{"text": "If probation departments fail to meet their goals for commitment reduction , they must return a prorated portion of the extra money they received at the end of the fiscal year .In the past , the state gave grants to probation departments with the goal of encouraging reduction in revocations for technical probation violations .But that carrot was never accompanied by a stick , and departments that ignored revocation - reduction goals - notably Bexar and Collin , among larger counties - essentially faced no consequences .SB 1055 includes stronger mechanisms for holding departments accountable , as well as more lucrative incentives for meeting stated goals .", "label": "true"}

{"text": "And , for now , they are considered legal .One of the tax - avoidance tricks that Romney 's funds employ , however , is not legal , according to Fleischer .This trick involves treating not just \" performance - based fees \" but management fees as capital gains rather than ordinary income .Private - equity firms , like other fund management firms , generally charge two kinds of fees on each fund : .Both of these fees are standard professional fees , so they both should be taxed at ordinary income rates .In one of the most outrageous loopholes in the tax code , however , the fund - management industry has bamboozled ( or simply bribed ) Congress into treating \" performance - based \" fees as capital gains rather than income .", "label": "false"}
{"text": "And , if they structure the funds well enough , they can avoid ever having to pay ordinary income taxes on their fees .But Bain went further than claiming the common \" carried interest \" treatment on its performance fees , says Fleischer .In a much more controversial move , Bain also claimed capital gains treatment for its management fees .This allowed the funds ( and Romney ) to avoid paying ordinary income taxes on all of its fees , not just its performance fees .How did Bain claim that its management fees were capital gains ?", "label": "false"}
{"text": "For two reasons , though , this justification is weak .First , for normal Americans , investment capital is eligible for capital - gains treatment only after it has been assessed with ordinary income taxes .If the doctor put this capital at risk , he would then be entitled to capital - gains treatment .Thanks to the \" carried interest \" loophole , however , fund managers can put the whole $ 1 million of fees at risk simply by keeping it in their funds .Thus , they can let all of their fee - income compound tax free and never pay ordinary income taxes on it .", "label": "false"}
{"text": "Second , as Fleischer explains , Bain had extraordinary flexibility in choosing which investments to take its guaranteed share of \" future profits \" out of , in addition to when .Basically , all Bain had to do to ensure that it would get its management fees was to choose one investment in each fund that would appreciate in value at some point in the future .And given that Bain also had lots of control over the \" carrying values \" of these investments , it had superior knowledge of which investments would be the most likely to gain value .", "label": "false"}
