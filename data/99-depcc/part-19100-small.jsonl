Films made under the state socialist regimes of Eastern Europe in the mid - twentieth century tend to fall roughly into two categories : the rigidly institutional and the scathingly anti - establishment . These films either serve to trumpet the cause of Communism or else find ways to avoid or subvert its conventions . The early films of Krzysztof Kieslowski present a slightly different alternative . On the one hand , these films duck the scrutiny of government censors with minute , incisive portraits of the system 's failings ; but on the other , they tend to humanize and complicate the causes of these failings . Rather than make the system seem a corrupt , faceless entity , Kieslowski 's early films present a collection of individuals whose personal problems and shortcomings compose this system and thereby bring about its failure . With its sympathetic portrayal of the trials and tribulations of a bureaucrat , Kieslowski 's debut feature , The Scar , exemplifies this complex tone of the director 's early work . The film follows the construction of a new fertilizer factory in the small , rural town of Olecko . A forest and many homes are leveled to make way for this new factory , which is ostensibly to be built to provide jobs for the region . Nonetheless , the public and the press are skeptical about the motives and the management behind the building of the factory , and so the affable Stefan Bednarz is hired to act as the factory 's director . Kieslowski presents Bednarz as the complete opposite of the archetypal anonymous bureaucrat . He is sympathetic and dedicated , befriending the factory workers and candidly chatting with the journalists who oppose his cause . His relationship with his wife and daughter in shambles , Bednarz immerses himself in the minute problems of the factory : public relations , technical inadequacies , and the greed and disorder of the Party . As one citizen of Olecko describes him : & 8220;He 's no ordinary engineer [ or ] technocrat . He 's another breed : a genuine humanist . He wants his town to flourish . But the responsibilities of the factory , and its dishonesty and mismanagement , prove to be more than even one conscientious man like Bednarz can control . This provides the film with its central theme : the effect of a single individual on a corrupt system . Bednarz is true to his party 's principles of collectivity and cooperation , and so Kieslowski 's film is not an indictment of state socialism as a whole , but rather of its implementation . In the world of the film , one good Communist is ineffectual in a system full of bad ones . And as another citizen laments : & 8220;after he 's gone , he might be replaced by a pigheaded technocrat with a philistine mentality who will destroy everything he fought for . Like all of Kieslowski 's films , The Scar is concerned with the problems of the social order , but it is less combative and more mournful . Shot in a dreary and unforgiving documentary style , with only the sporadic use of an eerie and unsettling modernist score , the film calls not for the radical change of society but for a contemplation of the individual 's place within it .

Objective : It has been shown that patients with unilateral pure tone tinnitus may benefit from electrode implantation and permanent electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex . Until now , the implantation site has been determined according to the results of neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) and of functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . This is the first report of a patient in whom the implantation was guided by a region of hyperactivity in a positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . Methods : 45-year - old patient with a high pitched tinnitus , predominant on the right side . Extensive conservative therapy did not improve the tinnitus . TMS over the left motor / auditory cortex could reduce the loudness of the tinnitus tone temporarily . A FDG - PET scan revealed a region of hyperactivity in the primary and secondary auditory cortex in the left hemisphere . The PET scan was fused to a T1-weighted MRI sequence ( MPRage , 1.5 mm slice thickness ) and prepared for intraoperative neuronavigation . We implanted an epidural electrode with 16 contacts over the left auditory cortex overlying the hyperactive region in the PET scan . The electrode was connected to an extension and a neurostimulator which was implanted abdominally . Surgery was followed by extensive clinical testing of different stimulation parameters . Written informed consent from the patient and a positive vote from the local ethical committee were obtained prior to surgery . Results : No complications due to craniotomy , electrode , and neurostimulator implantation or epidural stimulation occurred . The loudness of the right sided tinnitus tone was reduced only mildly and temporarily under certain stimulation parameters . These effects were not reproducible after exhaustion of the initial benefit . Conclusions : Epidural cortical stimulation does not reduce the loudness of the tinnitus tone in all patients , who respond to TMS . The value of PET guidance for the location of the implantation site has to be determined in further studies . "}

I was delighted to see my favorite OS X writing app , Scrivener , turn up in today 's \" The Medium \" column of the New York Times Magazine . I reviewed Scrivener about a year ago , and still use it whenever I have to research , plan , and draft anything more complicated than a blog post . In fact , as luck would have it , I was actually working on my upcoming Macworld talk in Scrivener when I took a break to read the paper and saw this article . Kismet or something . Columnist , Virginia Heffernan , notes the app 's beloved full - screen capability : . To create art , you need peace and quiet . Not only does Scrivener save like a maniac so you need n't bother , you also get to drop the curtain on life 's prosaic demands with a feature that makes its users swoon : full screen . When you 're working on a Scrivener opus , you 're not surrounded by teetering stacks of Firefox windows showing old Google searches or Citibank reports of suspicious activity . Life 's daily cares slip into the shadows . What emerges instead is one pristine and welcoming scroll : Your clean and focused mind . High fives to other great apps mentioned in the article , including Ulysses , WriteRoom , and Nisus Writer . Slightly lower fives go to Microsoft Word , which , once again , takes its usual drubbing as The Application Everyone Wants To Get Away From \u2122 . Poor Microsoft Word , the mascara - smeared Gloria Swanson of word processors . In the year since I wrote my own review of Scrivener , I still find myself relying heavily on it for housing the research , braindumps , and very early draft shapes of most longer pieces I do . Falling somewhere between OmniOutliner , DevonTHINK , and the aforementioned WriteRoom , Scrivener is still , in my opinion , the go - to app for all - in - one research and writing . As ever , YMMV . My only beef with Scrivener is that when I send an article to someone , they still always want it in Word . I know it can export to RTF and DOC files , but futzing with the formatting every time you need to make a simple change , especially if your Scrivener file has separate chapters / pages , is kind of a hassle . Maybe I should be treating it as my first draft shop , then handle edits in Word / Pages / whatever . 43 Folders is powered by Drupal , which rules .

Let 's explore places where delicious food can be offer in a casual bistro or a fine dining restaurant . Join me on finding some of the best and worst places to go in USA . Settling For Less Than The Best Ramen @ Mr. Ramen ( Little Tokyo ) . I wish I can tell you why I decided to come here instead of Daikokuya , considering it was only a few steps away from this place . Maybe it was my sense of adventure of trying something New that pressured me into coming inside of this place . It 's really a tough call for me about this place because it does need repeat visits to make it an impact , but for me this might be it . I did really like the service at this place as it was very fast . It 's one of those no fuss kind of place where you get everything to your liking for your ramen . You can ordered different type of soup base to go along with your ramen . For something extra , you can add in a gyoza or any other side dish to your order . Gyoza ( pan fried pork dumplings ) . I ordered a miso soup ramen which was pretty good in terms of its noodle and soup . The portion because I ordered with a gyoza only comes in half of a bowl . I guess I can ordered the regular size , but it would charged me the full price instead of the special on their menu . Miso Ramen . The other pluses was that it has a shelf with comic books or magazines for you while you wait for your ramen . Nice little touch to keep the customer occupy while they wait for their order . The other big plus is that they are opened all day and do n't have a shutdown time like Daikokuya and some other restaurants . The bad part about coming to Mr. Ramen is that it 's a very small place that is very tight in space . The restaurant is a vertical length of a place with tables going along the side of the wall . Not an ideal for big groups bigger than 6 people . With Daikokuya so close , it probably would n't matter anyways . To me , their miso ramen was trying hard to be like Shin Shen Gumi 's miso ramen . It 's soft and a bit saltier on the soup broth . That was a bummer part because SSG was better in all three areas compare to Mr. Ramen : noodle , soup , and toppings . If it was just a tad better , I would have recommended this place . Now I 'm just too scared to try their pork based ramen soup because you know how I valued Daikokuya 's broth . So this was going to be a downer . Urban legend has it in that these place served veggie broth ( without any meat additives on their soup ) . One of my friend , the Vegetarian Diva visited the place and found no such thing exist here . So whoever had put these place up as a vegetarian friendly place , should take that claim off the vegetarian friendly list . The quality of the food and service was good , but not to a point where I can really give them a higher grade as several locations obviously served better ramen than the place that calls itself \" Mr. Ramen \" . If they owned the ramen competition like they owned the name , I would gladly ranked them higher , but alas it is in middle of the pack in my eyes and taste buds . "}

Search . Senator Farley Announces Senate Acts On Crime Victims Legislation During National Crime Victims ' Rights Week . Hugh T. Farley . \" This week ( April 10th through 16th ) is National Crime Victims ' Rights Week , a time to reflect on the people who are injured or killed as a result of violent crime , \" Senator Farley said . \" These survivors , and the families of the victims , are often left with physical or emotional scars that can last a lifetime . \" Senator Farley said the New York State Senate has been a leader in developing legislation that addresses the concerns and needs of this State 's crime victims . The Senate helped develop crime victim fair treatment standards for State and local agencies involved with the criminal justice system . The Senate continues to build on its efforts . In 1985 , the New York State Legislature adopted a law allowing children to testify via closed - circuit TV in court proceedings involving sexual abuse . The same concern for the emotional welfare of a child who must testify in other traumatic situations , including murder and criminal assault , warrants the extension of the insulation of televised testimony to these cases , Senator Farley said . The Senate also passed legislation ( S.930 ) that would prohibit a convicted felon from suing his or her victims for civil damages for injuries that were sustained while the crime was being committed . \" We already have a ' Son of Sam ' law that gives crime victims the right to seek compensation from criminals who have committed certain specified crimes . The law allows these victims to file civil lawsuits against criminals for crime related damages within three years of the actual discovery of any profits of the crime or funds of a convicted person . The victim can sue against all assets of the criminal , \" Senator Farley said . \" This new legislation would continue to protect victims by changing the law to prohibit a criminal from recovering any damages from a crime victim for injuries received during the act of committing a crime . \" These bills have been sent on to the Assembly for consideration . For more information on the \" Son of Sam \" law and victims seeking compensation , contact the State Crime Victims Board at ( 800 ) 247 - 8035 . Senator Farley also has a free brochure on laws that help crime victims that is available by calling his office at 455 - 2181 ( Albany ) , 843 - 2188 ( Amsterdam ) , 762 - 3733 ( Johnstown ) , or toll - free at ( 800 ) 224 - 5201 .
