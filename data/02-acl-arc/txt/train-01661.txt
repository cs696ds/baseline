For example , the interaction of lexical rules is explored at run-time , even though the possible interaction can be determined at compile-time given the information available in the lexical rules and the base lexical entries .2 Based on the research results reported in Meurers and Minnen ( 1995 , 1996 ) , we propose a new computational treatment of lexical rules that overcomes these shortcomings and results in a more efficient processing of lexical rules as used in HPSG .
