{"text": "A : Universities need to begin by appreciating the particular challenges economically disadvantaged students face .One reality is that often low - income students can not afford to stop working to go to college .The cost of a college education , especially for a young person with dependent family members , is not only tuition and books , but also foregone wages .Although colleges have adapted somewhat to students who work , they are still often extremely resistant to meeting the demands of this group .In addition to changing the format of education to accommodate working students , universities need to pay attention to the practical and emotional barriers to college attendance low - income students face .First - generation college students often also confront a greater adjustment problem in college .I found in my study adjustment issues when attending college fell into three main categories or domains of experience : personal , family and structural .The individual or personal level was filled with stories of students going through identity formation transitions .In many ways this first domain is less controllable and is a place where social realities become apparent .The family sphere gets us into the cultural issues which are in many ways the most powerful influence on the experience of low - income college students .Finally , the larger unequal socio - political environment provides a context for the family and personal student experiences .I was surprised by the tension and conflict I heard expressed from students in interviews about their parents .Those especially talented students who make it to college often suffer from extraordinary pressure to succeed because in a concrete way the fate of their families rests with them .Q : What legislative strategies -- at the local , state and/or federal levels -- should be considered in order to increase the enrollment and retention of low - income students ?A : Changes to the funding of higher education and the way we regard institutions serving low - income students are central to a public policy agenda .I would n't be the first to point out that the funding system for public higher education in America is n't sufficient .On the international level , the United States ' lower comparative tax rate means that public education is less supported than most comparable nations .In this way , there is a lessened effect of redistribution of wealth and the encouragement of social mobility through public college opportunities for the poor in America .If public funding does n't increase , then we must have more flexibility in how public institutions can operate , perhaps borrowing methods from the independents while trying to maintain core mission priorities .In addition , it is increasingly expected that universities redouble efforts to find ways to operate more efficiently .We undervalue those institutions that often facilitate the greatest change in students .Let 's identify and reward institutions that serve students from low - income families .The competition by universities to climb over each other in the U.S. News & Report rankings has had a negative impact on low - income students because the quality measures work against them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "43.62664"}

{"text": "The search for new educational resources now focuses largely on technology .An emerging rule of thumb is that to stay current , an institution should spend five to ten percent of its budget on information technology .Few universities are doing that now .To do this effectively , universities must prioritize what they do and take the unfamiliar step of ceasing to do things of lower priority by reallocating resources from within .There is risk in reallocation .Without a vision of what the technology - enriched future could be , as well as consensus from the faculty and support from boards and legislators , it is unlikely that a significant number of campuses will reallocate significant funds from existing programs into technology .Questions to Answer .Higher education has not developed the discipline of constantly looking for ways to maximize its value to those who support it .And this is where the two forces accelerating structural change join .Higher education managers -- a category that includes faculty -- must be no less compulsive in their efforts to maximize value to taxpayers than corporate managers are in trying to maximize their value to shareholders .Institutions should be flexible in their willingness to rethink how they provide education .Learning Productivity .Rethinking education requires that we ask the right questions .I believe that one question we must ask is how to improve learner productivity .In articles that are critical of higher education , you often see discussions of the need to increase faculty productivity .The main argument is that faculty should do less research and spend more time teaching .There is a fallacy in this argument ( Johnstone , 1992 ) .Certainly , faculty at our comprehensive research institutions could teach more .However , remember that these comprehensive research institutions employ about one - fourth of the nation 's full time faculty .These are the same faculty who are charged with leading the world in the production of research and the training of graduate students .If these faculty spent more time teaching or advising , it would not make them more productive , per se .It would simply assign them to different tasks .Those who deal with faculty issues on a daily basis are convinced , as I am , that the number of truly unproductive faculty is small .Increasing their teaching loads would not significantly improve higher education 's productivity . D. Bruce Johnstone has written a thoughtful treatise on learning productivity .His thesis is that significant and sustainable productivity increases must be achieved through greater attention to the learner .\" Learning productivity relates the input of faculty and staff not to enrollments or to courses taught or to credit or classroom hours assigned , but to learning , i.e. , to the demonstrated mastery of a defined body of knowledge or skills . \"( Johnstone , 1992 ) .One way to make learning more productive is for students to master a body of knowledge in less time .Learning that takes less time can cut the traditional costs carried by the institution , but also the opportunity costs ( lost earnings ) of the student .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "43.81077"}
