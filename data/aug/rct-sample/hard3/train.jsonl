Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg .Back row , from left : Sonia Sotomayor , Stephen Breyer , Samuel Alito Jr. and Elena Kagan .Scalia was found dead on February 13 at a Texas ranch he was visiting .Antonin Scalia - Justice Antonin Scalia was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 to fill the seat vacated by Justice William Rehnquist when he was elevated to chief justice .A constitutional originalist -- and a colorful orator -- Scalia was a member of the court 's conservative wing .At the time of his death , Scalia was the court 's longest - serving justice .John G.

Bush to succeed Justice Sandra Day O'Connor as an associate justice .After Chief Justice William Rehnquist died , however , Bush named Roberts to the chief justice post .The court has moved to the right during his tenure , although Roberts supplied the key vote to uphold President Barack Obama 's Affordable Care Act .Anthony M. Kennedy - Justice Anthony M. Kennedy was appointed to the court by President Ronald Reagan in 1988 .He is a conservative justice but has provided crucial swing votes in many cases , writing the majority opinion , for example , in Lawrence v. Texas , which struck down that state 's sodomy law .Clarence Thomas - Justice Clarence Thomas is the second African - American to serve on the court , succeeding Justice Thurgood Marshall when he was appointed by President George H. W. Bush in 1991 .He is a conservative , a strict constructionist who supports states ' rights .Ruth Bader Ginsburg - Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court .Appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993 , she is a strong voice in the court 's liberal minority .Sonia Sotomayor - Justice Sonia Sotomayor is the court 's first Hispanic and third female justice .She was appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009 and is regarded as a resolutely liberal member of the court .Elena Kagan - Justice Elena Kagan is the fourth female justice and a member of the court 's liberal wing .She was appointed in 2010 , at the age of 50 , by President Barack Obama and is the court 's youngest member .What 's the most important issue that neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney ever mention on the campaign trail ?The future of the Supreme Court .Need proof ?Try imagining how this election season would have unfolded if the justices had decided Citizens United a different way in 2010 .Or suppose that the court had overturned , rather than upheld , the Affordable Care Act earlier this year .The Obama presidency , to say nothing of his campaign , might look very different today .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "40.77326"}

{"text": "Perhaps the current disciplinary organization of the biomedical sciences should be abandoned .I have some sympathy for the idea that developments across the scientific frontier require the reorientation of a good deal of science and science education .Nowadays more and more scientists need to feel at home with biology , mathematics , and computation as well as the physical sciences .Moreover , substantial aspects of our research efforts in biology now require cooperation and participation as well with the social sciences and even philosophy .Contemporary developments in genetics , after all , may not only change our understanding of the notions of human identity , human equality , and human freedom , but cause us to rethink the standards and norms through which we organize our society .All these matters certainly need to be informed by science , but must also be informed by resources from other areas of human understanding .It is claimed by some that the rapidly increased sponsorship of research by for - profit companies at the nation 's academic health centers threatens to undermine the faculty 's academic freedom in biomedical science .Some suggest that the research agenda of the university faculty has become dominated by purely commercial considerations as opposed to intellectual values and the public good .Whether the public welfare is best served by a research agenda shaped by contemporary market forces or by the scholarly priorities of a relatively independent professoriate is an open issue .I am convinced that there are social benefits to a mixed strategy that retains a role for both .Although the impact of these factors can be exaggerated , it is clear that academic medicine , for example , is no longer as autonomous as it once was .Academia 's relationship with for - profit enterprises now extends well beyond the individual scientific investigator to include a large cohort of important university decision makers , including presidents and trustees .Nevertheless , there are few rules , regulations , or well - established precedents to provide appropriate oversight to the inevitable financial conflicts of interest for both institutions and institutional decision makers .The question remains : Are these changes , on balance , a good or a bad thing ?From one perspective , this increase in collaboration is a good thing in that it more fully integrates the nation 's biomedical and other resources in a joint effort to combat disease and otherwise improve the human condition .From another perspective , it creates a virtual flood of conflicts of interest within academic institutions , where it becomes less and less clear whose interests are being served by the collaboration .Certainly , the new alliance undermines traditional notions of faculty and university independence , the full participation of faculty in the intellectual commons , and the role of university faculty as disinterested creators and arbiters of knowledge .It may ultimately undermine the reputation of universities for independence and openness and eventually reduce public trust in the entire university enterprise .Indeed , as more and more scientists occupy roles in both academia and industry , the public , increasingly concerned about possible sources of bias in \" expert \" opinion , has become less certain where to turn for truly disinterested opinions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "41.638935"}
