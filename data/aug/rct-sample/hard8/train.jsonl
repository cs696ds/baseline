{"text": "As a result , maintaining strength and quality in each of higher education 's sectors contributes to the strength of every component of the system .In my judgment it would be a mistake for each of these different sectors to lose their distinctiveness by , for example , becoming too much like one another or trying to emulate the so - called elite institutions .Although this tendency is understandable , I believe it should be resisted as a matter of public policy at both the state and the federal level .The American university continues to be enriched by the flow of talent and ideas from abroad , and it increasingly depends on it , just as talent and ideas from abroad increasingly depend on us .The health and vitality of American higher education will remain unfulfilled if our counterparts abroad are not prospering .In these lectures , however , I will focus primarily on the American research university , because this is an area of higher education in which I have spent my entire academic career and to which I have given my most careful consideration .Within this sector , however , I will not distinguish between the private and public research universities because their differences , which are significant , are not central to the particular issues I have chosen to address .My view is that despite some significant contrasts , private and public research universities have an enormous amount in common .Most important , they are members of a common educational and scholarly community .Moreover , they are quite dependent on one another , and faculty , students , ideas , and even academic resources move quickly and relatively freely among them .For the most part , faculty and students who move from one to the other can adapt easily because the basic nature of their work will be largely unaffected .Though senior administrative officials need to relate to somewhat different constituencies , many constituencies , such as students , faculty , alumni , and the federal government , are the same .Of course , one key difference is the special relationship of university officials and trustees of public universities with state government officials .As I reflect on my own experience first as president of the University of Michigan and then at Princeton , many obvious distinctions come to mind -- their differences in size , their relative commitments to professional education , their different but overlapping constituencies .Less noticed , but equally important and interesting , were two important distinctions relating to presidential leadership and overall governance .As a result , the university 's objectives and exactly what the university was and who it should serve were always in the process of negotiation .At Princeton the analogous challenge of mobilizing the university 's constituencies was somewhat different .By and large , the broader Princeton community shared a common set of objectives .Thus the board 's discussions -- or any intrauniversity negotiations -- were more likely to focus on strategy as opposed to objectives .On the governance front , there were at least two interesting differences .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.073795"}

{"text": "Over the past 15 years , the result is that American industry has undergone phenomenal change .The revolution has now spread to health care , where its impact is of unprecedented magnitude .Largely because of public anxiety about education 's skyrocketing cost and legislators ' misgivings regarding its efficiency , the management revolution has finally reached higher education , and it will never be the same again .Cost Crisis and Productivity .The cost crisis in education must be viewed within the context of the shift from energy to knowledge as the basis for our economy .During the past 25 years , the shift has enabled productivity gains in virtually every economic sector except higher education .Higher education has n't enjoyed the productivity gains of other industries because our costs -- primarily labor costs -- are growing disproportionately to the cost of living and we have not experienced offsetting growths in productivity .To raise salaries commensurate with the cost of living , colleges and universities have had to raise prices for the consumer .College costs , therefore , are growing out of proportion to the cost of living and out of proportion with other sectors of the economy .Although higher education has been slow to embrace Deming - style management initiatives on its own , outside forces , especially legislatures , are now prescribing change .There are currently 27 state legislatures that have commissions studying the question : \" How can the public university do things better , faster , and cheaper ? \"Public Scrutiny .Governors and legislators across the country are looking at their public university systems with increasingly critical eyes .They are acutely aware of the need to train labor to keep their economies competitive , and they are coming to recognize the value of universities as engines of economic development through their technology transfer activities .It is sometimes said that war is too important to be left to the generals .I fear that many are coming to believe that education is too important to be left to the educators .It is increasingly difficult to convince the public of the importance of a liberal arts education .We believe it cultivates intellectual traits and has intrinsic value .My fear is that if higher education does not respond by precipitating change and influencing its direction , legislators and lawmakers will take over the job .Unless we take the information and management revolutions seriously , quickly addressing the imperatives of those responsible for reallocating taxpayer dollars , many public universities will not survive , or at least their current levels of autonomy will not .As it is now , lawmakers believe that higher education is unwilling to reallocate existing resources to priority areas such as technology .Their image of us is that we are often wasteful of taxpayer money .It is small consolation that this waste is not attributed to malice but to lax management , minimal accountability , and the inertia of doing things as we have always done them .We do not frivously spend money on things that do not benefit our states .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.411346"}
