{"text": "Gay Activists : Be Tolerant .Or We Will Destroy You !We have made great strides in the policing of thought in this country .Just ask Brendan Eich , one of the founders of Mozilla , developers of the web browser Firefox .Eich had just landed a promotion to the big chair as Mozilla 's CEO .He lasted all of nine days .The reason ?Back in 2008 Eich donated a thousand dollars to support Proposition 8 , the California ballot initiative to ban same - sex marriage .Eich , as many people in circumstances such as his , was stricken with the sudden desire to \" spend more time with his family \" and quietly resigned .Regardless of your position on same sex marriage , those activists who led to Eich 's resignation should be ashamed .Their basic message ?\" You 'd better be tolerant .Or else we will show you a display of true tolerance .By crushing you . \" In fact , it is no longer enough to be tolerant .In the same interview , he said that he wished for those who were calling for his ouster to know that \" without getting into my personal beliefs , which I separate from my Mozilla work -- when people learned of the donation , they felt pain .I saw that in friends ' eyes , [ friends ] who are LGBT [ lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgendered].I saw that in 2012 .I am sorry for causing that pain .\"Wow .Eich sounds like an intolerant jerk !No , strike that .He sounds like a dedicated and thoughtful professional who was able to separate his work and personal lives -- as well he should have been .But to the activist crowd , it 's not enough that people are tolerant .They must offer affirmation of the LGBT agenda or pay the price .Their much vaunted toleration does n't extend to those who might have opposing viewpoints , like Eich .Of course , gay rights activists claim that Eich 's views are not deserving of toleration because he sought to strip them of their rights .This may or may not be the case , but I 'd wager that many of them are n't such dogged defenders of rights when asked about , say , the Second Amendment .And I 'm hearing curiously little from these champions of freedom about the fact that 70 percent of California 's African Americans and over 50 percent of Hispanics voted for Prop 8 .The uncomfortable fact for the left is that 2008 was the same election in which minority voters pulled the levers in droves for President Obama .Even more uncomfortable ?President Obama himself was opposed to same sex marriage in 2008 .But , then , it 's not about principle .It 's about ramming through the \" right \" outcomes .Geez , ya think ?Andrew Sullivan , the unreliably conservative columnist had this to say : .Will [ Eich ] now be forced to walk through the streets in shame ?", "score": "8.636963", "label": "true"}

{"text": "My attention right now is focused more on the long term chart , and asking why since October Gold has been trapped between $ 1,315 and $ 1,430.60 .( By the way , first of those peaks occurred at $ 1,387.10 ) .Is this a top , where gold burns up buying power battering at $ 1,425 and fails ?Or is it gold stretching and coiling for another spring upward ?Today gold did manage to close above its 50 DMA ( $ 1,383 ) but below its 20 DMA ( $ 1,387.02 ) .All this feels better than falling through a trap door , but does n't tell us much yet .Tomorrow or Friday will come the crisis , where gold must either go forward or fall back .But here gold is merely marching back and forth over territory already traveled .The SILVER PRICE rose yesterday and today , but only by another 4.2c today to close Comex at 2953.2c .Again , this shows slowing momentum .In truth , silver merely traded sideways today , between 2970 and 2937c in US trading .Silver has crossed that first trip wire of a rally , the 20 day moving average ( 2936c ) but done little else .Until silver climbs above 3121c , it is in a downtrend .DMA , 20 day moving average , 200 day moving average , what 's all that about ?A 200 day moving average takes prices of the last 200 days and averages them .Next day , it drops the oldest and adds the latest , hence it is a \" moving \" average .Same method but shorter periods work for 50 and 20 DMAs .Markets trending generally upwards will remain ABOVE their moving averages .When they dip below the first tripwire , the 20 DMA , they signal a possible trend change .At longish intervals upward trending markets correct and return to kiss off their 200 DMA , which marks the long term uptrend .All of this works upside down for markets in primary down trends , that is , they spend most of their time BELOW their moving averages .I went back and looked once more at that GOLD / SILVER RATIO data from the last 10 years .Occasionally the ratio will peek above its 20 dma and then resume its downward move , but only rarely .More , the number of days the ratio has spent below its 20 DMA this trip is nearing the maximum number of days for such moves .That argues that we probably wo n't see a lower ratio for this move .US DOLLAR INDEX took a whipping today , apparently because sufficient suckers -- Whoa !Scotch that !Make that \" investors \" -- were found to buy a $ 1.5 billion Portuguese bond offering .Since this -- for the nonce , at least -- means that Portugal wo n't default on its sovereign debt , that took pressure off the euro .Hence speculators sold the dollar and bought euros .Right , it IS a silly game of musical currencies .", "score": "25.218441", "label": "true"}

{"text": "This letter is an attempt to do so .The powers and limitations of the government concerning religious matters are controlled mainly by the two religion clauses in the First Amendment to the US Constitution , which states : \" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .\" The first part of that phrase is known as the establishment clause , and the second part as the free exercise clause .Sixteen simple words that guarantee religious liberty in the United States , and which have spawned thousands of pages of writings and numerous Supreme Court cases .Based on Supreme Court precedent , the establishment clause prevents the government from endorsing one religion over another , or endorsing religion in general over non - religion ( and vice versa ) .In a nutshell , the government must be neutral in matters of religion .The free exercise clause guarantees an individual 's right to practice their religion as they see fit ( or not practice any at all ) without interference or persecution from the government .Concerning religion in the public schools , the idea that \" we do not allow ( God ) to be mentioned or even hinted to in our schools \" is untrue .Students can practice their religion and express their faith individually or among their peers as long as is does not disrupt the school or classroom .Teachers and other staff can also practice their religion and express their faith individually or among their peers .This is protected by the free exercise clause of the Constitution .The only things that are prohibited are religious activities sponsored or endorsed by the school , or performed publicly in the school by representatives of the school .Concerning President Obama taking his oath of office using two Bibles , the US Constitution explicitly spells out the oath for the President in article II , section 1 .It is : \" I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my Ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .\" As you can see , there is no requirement to swear this oath using a Bible or any other text .That President Obama chose to swear the oath using two Bibles ( one belonged to Abraham Lincoln and the other to Martin Luther King , Jr. ) was his personal choice and is protected by the free exercise clause of the Constitution .Also , since the inauguration is a privately funded and organized event the establishment clause does not apply .Concerning displaying the Ten Commandments in our courts , doing so would clearly be an endorsement of religion by the government and is therefore prohibited by the establishment clause .Displaying one version only ( there are differences between the Jewish , Catholic , and Protestant versions ) would be a government endorsement of one religion over another and is also prohibited .There are some grey areas in what the government is , and is not , allowed to do concerning religious matters but the overall ideas are very clear thanks to the US Constitution and many precedents set by the courts on its interpretation .", "score": "27.72139", "label": "false"}

{"text": "Let 's move on to today 's chart section to see how the situation looks like .The reason for this is the price action seen on Thursday when the index declined sharply , pulling back a bit before the session closed to end the day very close to the level of the May low .In fact , it is possible that we have seen the final bottom for this correction .The breakdown which we see here below the rising support line was so dramatic that it just might be the decline that the breakdown was supposed to generate .The most important and interesting implications are seen when we look at the reaction of the precious metals to Thursday 's decline in USD Index .Specifically , it is the lack of reaction in these markets that is most striking , even though the dollar index declined by about 1.5 index point and closed the day about 1 point lower .A huge rally in gold , silver , and the precious metals mining stocks would normally accompany such a significant move in the USD Index ( say , a $ 30 - $ 50 rally in gold ) , but barely any move to the upside was seen .This is a very bearish indication for the precious metals sector .In the short - term Euro Index chart , recall that we have had a head - and - shoulders pattern underway and not yet completed .The question now is , was this pattern invalided on Thursday with the decline in the USD Index and the move to the upside which was seen here ?Quite simply the answer is no .The move higher did not take the index above the final Fibonacci retracement level .Drawing parallel lines based on the local bottoms , we see that the upper line has not been reached and it emphasizes that the shape of the head - and - shoulders is still intact .The index level is not too high above the last shoulder as the formation is skewed .This is due to both higher lows and higher highs .The last shoulder ( September - October ) has a double top pattern so it 's really not so striking that the right shoulder just formed a second top .All in all , this pattern could still be completed and if it is , it will have bearish implications for the euro and the precious metals and bullish implications for the dollar .Now , let us take a look at the yellow metal to see whether any reaction to the dollar 's weakness was seen .Click to enlarge .We see that gold has rallied a bit more than $ 20 this week , really not much of a rally at all .The outlook continues to be bearish and the trend remains down .Gold could still decline heavily based on the long - term cyclical turning point , which is due approximately next week .Summing up , the most important development in the currency markets was the heavy decline of the USD Index on Thursday and the striking lack of reaction in the precious metals sector .", "score": "30.625893", "label": "true"}

Pesquera , Building with Our Hands ( 1993 ) .Ana Castillo introduces the term \" Xicanisma \" in opposition to the U.S. feminist movement , which has often ignored the woman of color 's struggle .Her collection of essays , Massacre of the Dreamers ( 1994 ) , adds to the development of literature which brings the Chicana 's experience to the forefront .Just as Mexicana feminism is often viewed in the context of a larger Latin American feminist discourse , Chicana feminism is viewed in the context of a larger U.S. third world women 's feminist discourse .One of the first key texts to offer a discussion of U.S. third world feminism is This Bridge Called My Back , edited by Gloria Anzald\u00faa and Cherr\u00ede Moraga ( 1981 ) .The text which acts as a second volume to This Bridge Called My Back is Making Face , Making Soul , edited by Gloria Anzald\u00faa ( 1990 ) .I also call on the work of Chandra Mohanty et al .for their discussion of third world feminism in Third World Women and the Politics of Feminism ( 1991 ) .These dynamic works offer a critical foundation for examining international feminisms .Bringing together Chicana and Mexicana feminism presents a tremendous challenge .For the reasons explained above , the two histories have been disconnected in a variety of ways for over a hundred years .", "score": "30.95924", "label": "true"}

{"text": "However , since this rally broke above its previous high of $ 96.11 , we may need to wait for the SPY to go to the black , thin resistance line ( about the 100 level ) before it moves lower .The 100 level is a resistance level due to the fact that it is a round number and likely to draw media atttention .( The 96.11 level corresponds to 956.23 in the S&P ) .The general stock market ( along with other markets , which were covered in the Premium Update on which this essay is based ) is likely to correct , but not necessarily immediately .Since in the previous weeks gold , silver , and corresponding equities were trading in the opposite direction to the U.S. Dollar , and in tune with the general stock market ( strong correlation ) , we may expect precious metals to take a small breather soon as well .Before making any specific calls , we need to analyze the precious metals themselves .This week , I will focus on silver .Silver has broken out of the delining trendling , but the low volume on Friday , suggests that we may see prices dip or consolidate before they resume their upward path .During a similar breakout in May , silver has consolidated around the price level corresponding to the previous local top - the $ 13 - $ 14 area .The analogical price level today is several cents higher - around $ 14 .The more similarities there are between two situations , the more probable it is that the history will repeat itself .The additional factor that suggests that the rally in silver is likely to take a pause is the action in volume .In May , slow volume after the breakout preceded the consolidation , so there is one more piece of the puzzle that fits the whole picture .With gold and silver suggesting a small consolidation , let 's take a look at the precious metals stocks .Mining stocks have also consolidated in the middle of May , and now they formed a triangle pattern , which is usually a sign of trend continuation .The volume has been declining this week , as PM stocks were trading sideways , thus confirming the triangle pattern .Taking into account points raised earlier , even if mining stocks break down from the triangle pattern , the following move should be rather insignificant - I do n't think that it would take the GDX ETF below 37 level .On the other hand , if we get a breakout to the upside , but gold and silver move lower soon , I would expect mining stocks to correct along with them , most likely once again to the upper border of the triangle - below 41 level .Moreover , one of our indicators signals that a pause is rather likely .Please note that usually when SP Gold Stock Bottom Indicator broke above the upper dashed line it meant at least a brief pullback in the coming days .This has been the case during this week , so we may indeed see lower prices of PM stocks in the coming days .", "score": "31.219988", "label": "true"}

{"text": "Now , gold is around 1725 and silver 's over 33 and they both appear to be headed much much higher .And if this is the beginning of a new breakout , silver may well restart its 11 year bull market rise and we could see its gain far eclipse that of gold .So keep listening and if I steel up my courage , I may make another call , which you can accept or reject - at your liking . \"Ranting \" Andy Hoffman and I sat down again ; fortunately , we did it a few days later than usual .We got to discuss the opening parabolic warm - up shot that gold and silver took today .If you 've been listening to Andy and the Financial Survival Network , this should have been just another day at the office .We knew it was coming , it was always a matter of when not if .And today , we got our answer .Because the metals have been artificially depressed , there is still time for some real profits , meaning profits over and above the actual inflation rate .The key is to buy before the big move takes place .The energy and strength of today 's upside move means the wait could well be over .At the risk of being premature , FSN has been seeing unmistakable signs of an early spring awakening for gold and silver .And the stocks could be well - positioned , but my as well as Andy 's primary focus is on the actual physical metals .Because no one knows what is going to happen to the economy , both locally and internationally , it is urgent that you have a core holding of physical metals .How much ?That is a decision for each individual to make based upon their own circumstances .Some people say 10 percent of total assets is adequate .Others say the number is much higher .But in any event , there is no right or wrong answer .It 's dependent upon your needs and wants .Bob , \" The International Forecaster \" and I sat down for a brief chat about the economy , gold , silver and the mining shares .Bob explains that frugal management , especially in the early years , is extremely important .Management should be involved to make profits from the eventual success of the project , rather than cashing in on high salaries and other compensations ; share structure is also quite important .When companies have hundreds of millions of shares outstanding , before producing one ounce , this will greatly lessen the potential future share appreciation .Focus is also extremely important ; concentration on a few or even just one project is very important for a junior minor .This will assure management makes the most of every opportunity .But in the final analysis , the price of gold and silver is going to be the main factor .And here Bob is emphatic it 's going no where but up .2012 could very well be the most important year in the history of modern finance .", "score": "31.872135", "label": "true"}

{"text": "As an example , metals were showing major weakness overall with both gold and silver selling off violently .However , what caught my eye even further was the dramatic selloff in copper futures which is shown below .As can be seen above , copper futures had rallied along with equities since the lows back in November .However , prices peaked in copper at the beginning of February and a move lower from 3.7845 on 02/04 down to recent lows around 3.5195 on 02/25 resulted in roughly a 7 % decline in copper prices over a 3 week period .As stated above , commodity volatility often precedes equity volatility .As can be seen above , copper futures appear to be reversing during the action today and many times commodities will bottom ahead of equities .I want to be clear in stating that equities will not necessarily mirror the action in commodities or copper specifically , but some major volatility was seen in several commodity contracts besides just metals .Oil futures were also coming under selling pressure as well .As can be seen above , oil futures topped right at the end of January and then sold off briefly only to selloff sharply lower a few weeks later .Oil futures gave back roughly 6 % - 7 % as well which is quite similar to copper 's recent correction .I have simply highlighted some key support / resistance levels on the oil futures chart for future reference and for possible price targets .In equity terms , since February 20 th the S&P 500 futures have sold off from a high of around 1,529 to Monday 's low of 1481.75 .Thus far we are seeing a move lower of about 3.10 % since 02/20 in the S&P 500 E - Mini futures contract .While I am not calling for perfect correlation with commodities , I do believe that a 5 % correction here not only makes sense , but actually would be healthy for equities .If we assume the S&P 500 E - Mini contracts were to lose 5 % from their recent highs , the price that would correspond with that type of move would be around 1,453 .As shown above , while 1,453 does represent a consolidation zone in the S&P 500 which occurred in the beginning of January of 2013 , there is a major support level that corresponds with the 1,460 - 1,470 price range .I am expecting to see the S&P 500 test the 1,460 - 1,470 price range in the futures contract , however the outcome at that support level will be important for future price action .If that level holds , I think we likely reverse and move higher and we could even take out recent highs potentially .In contrast , if we see a major breakdown below 1,460 I believe things could get interesting quickly for the bears .I am watching the price action today closely as I am interested in what kind of retracement we will get based on yesterday 's large bullish engulfing candlestick on the daily chart of the S&P 500 futures .", "score": "31.887651", "label": "true"}

Federal Election Commission decision .They are allowed to accept unlimited contributions from corporations , unions , trade associations and nonprofits , on the condition that they do n't donate the money they raise directly to candidates or coordinate with candidates about the group 's operations .They can spend their funds on ads or otherwise expressly advocating for or against candidates .A myriad of super PACs have sprung up to support and augment the campaigns of every presidential candidate .Most are led by former political advisers of the candidates .And their weapon of choice is negative advertising .Restore Our Future , perhaps the most well - known candidate - specific super PAC , was created to support Romney 's candidacy .Restore Our Future has spent more than $ 17.5 million on independent expenditures designed to boost his candidacy .More than $ 16 million of that sum has been spent on negative advertisements at key points during the race , such as when Gingrich 's prospects seemed to be rising in Iowa .Gingrich , for his part , is being supported by the super PAC Winning Our Future .This group has spent $ 8.8 million , with much of it going to negative advertising against Romney .Supporters of Paul and Santorum have likewise created super PACs of their own , and they fulfill a similar role : To act as an independent arm of the presidential candidates ' campaigns - their phantom limb .", "score": "31.9946", "label": "false"}
