{"text": "Gay Activists : Be Tolerant .Or We Will Destroy You !We have made great strides in the policing of thought in this country .Just ask Brendan Eich , one of the founders of Mozilla , developers of the web browser Firefox .Eich had just landed a promotion to the big chair as Mozilla 's CEO .He lasted all of nine days .The reason ?Back in 2008 Eich donated a thousand dollars to support Proposition 8 , the California ballot initiative to ban same - sex marriage .Eich , as many people in circumstances such as his , was stricken with the sudden desire to \" spend more time with his family \" and quietly resigned .Regardless of your position on same sex marriage , those activists who led to Eich 's resignation should be ashamed .Their basic message ?\" You 'd better be tolerant .Or else we will show you a display of true tolerance .By crushing you . \" In fact , it is no longer enough to be tolerant .In the same interview , he said that he wished for those who were calling for his ouster to know that \" without getting into my personal beliefs , which I separate from my Mozilla work -- when people learned of the donation , they felt pain .I saw that in friends ' eyes , [ friends ] who are LGBT [ lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgendered].I saw that in 2012 .I am sorry for causing that pain .\"Wow .Eich sounds like an intolerant jerk !No , strike that .He sounds like a dedicated and thoughtful professional who was able to separate his work and personal lives -- as well he should have been .But to the activist crowd , it 's not enough that people are tolerant .They must offer affirmation of the LGBT agenda or pay the price .Their much vaunted toleration does n't extend to those who might have opposing viewpoints , like Eich .Of course , gay rights activists claim that Eich 's views are not deserving of toleration because he sought to strip them of their rights .This may or may not be the case , but I 'd wager that many of them are n't such dogged defenders of rights when asked about , say , the Second Amendment .And I 'm hearing curiously little from these champions of freedom about the fact that 70 percent of California 's African Americans and over 50 percent of Hispanics voted for Prop 8 .The uncomfortable fact for the left is that 2008 was the same election in which minority voters pulled the levers in droves for President Obama .Even more uncomfortable ?President Obama himself was opposed to same sex marriage in 2008 .But , then , it 's not about principle .It 's about ramming through the \" right \" outcomes .Geez , ya think ?Andrew Sullivan , the unreliably conservative columnist had this to say : .Will [ Eich ] now be forced to walk through the streets in shame ?", "score": "8.636963", "label": "true"}
