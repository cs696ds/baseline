{"text": "Gay Activists : Be Tolerant .Or We Will Destroy You !We have made great strides in the policing of thought in this country .Just ask Brendan Eich , one of the founders of Mozilla , developers of the web browser Firefox .Eich had just landed a promotion to the big chair as Mozilla 's CEO .He lasted all of nine days .The reason ?Back in 2008 Eich donated a thousand dollars to support Proposition 8 , the California ballot initiative to ban same - sex marriage .Eich , as many people in circumstances such as his , was stricken with the sudden desire to \" spend more time with his family \" and quietly resigned .Regardless of your position on same sex marriage , those activists who led to Eich 's resignation should be ashamed .Their basic message ?\" You 'd better be tolerant .Or else we will show you a display of true tolerance .By crushing you . \" In fact , it is no longer enough to be tolerant .In the same interview , he said that he wished for those who were calling for his ouster to know that \" without getting into my personal beliefs , which I separate from my Mozilla work -- when people learned of the donation , they felt pain .I saw that in friends ' eyes , [ friends ] who are LGBT [ lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgendered].I saw that in 2012 .I am sorry for causing that pain .\"Wow .Eich sounds like an intolerant jerk !No , strike that .He sounds like a dedicated and thoughtful professional who was able to separate his work and personal lives -- as well he should have been .But to the activist crowd , it 's not enough that people are tolerant .They must offer affirmation of the LGBT agenda or pay the price .Their much vaunted toleration does n't extend to those who might have opposing viewpoints , like Eich .Of course , gay rights activists claim that Eich 's views are not deserving of toleration because he sought to strip them of their rights .This may or may not be the case , but I 'd wager that many of them are n't such dogged defenders of rights when asked about , say , the Second Amendment .And I 'm hearing curiously little from these champions of freedom about the fact that 70 percent of California 's African Americans and over 50 percent of Hispanics voted for Prop 8 .The uncomfortable fact for the left is that 2008 was the same election in which minority voters pulled the levers in droves for President Obama .Even more uncomfortable ?President Obama himself was opposed to same sex marriage in 2008 .But , then , it 's not about principle .It 's about ramming through the \" right \" outcomes .Geez , ya think ?Andrew Sullivan , the unreliably conservative columnist had this to say : .Will [ Eich ] now be forced to walk through the streets in shame ?", "score": "8.636963", "label": "true"}

{"text": "My attention right now is focused more on the long term chart , and asking why since October Gold has been trapped between $ 1,315 and $ 1,430.60 .( By the way , first of those peaks occurred at $ 1,387.10 ) .Is this a top , where gold burns up buying power battering at $ 1,425 and fails ?Or is it gold stretching and coiling for another spring upward ?Today gold did manage to close above its 50 DMA ( $ 1,383 ) but below its 20 DMA ( $ 1,387.02 ) .All this feels better than falling through a trap door , but does n't tell us much yet .Tomorrow or Friday will come the crisis , where gold must either go forward or fall back .But here gold is merely marching back and forth over territory already traveled .The SILVER PRICE rose yesterday and today , but only by another 4.2c today to close Comex at 2953.2c .Again , this shows slowing momentum .In truth , silver merely traded sideways today , between 2970 and 2937c in US trading .Silver has crossed that first trip wire of a rally , the 20 day moving average ( 2936c ) but done little else .Until silver climbs above 3121c , it is in a downtrend .DMA , 20 day moving average , 200 day moving average , what 's all that about ?A 200 day moving average takes prices of the last 200 days and averages them .Next day , it drops the oldest and adds the latest , hence it is a \" moving \" average .Same method but shorter periods work for 50 and 20 DMAs .Markets trending generally upwards will remain ABOVE their moving averages .When they dip below the first tripwire , the 20 DMA , they signal a possible trend change .At longish intervals upward trending markets correct and return to kiss off their 200 DMA , which marks the long term uptrend .All of this works upside down for markets in primary down trends , that is , they spend most of their time BELOW their moving averages .I went back and looked once more at that GOLD / SILVER RATIO data from the last 10 years .Occasionally the ratio will peek above its 20 dma and then resume its downward move , but only rarely .More , the number of days the ratio has spent below its 20 DMA this trip is nearing the maximum number of days for such moves .That argues that we probably wo n't see a lower ratio for this move .US DOLLAR INDEX took a whipping today , apparently because sufficient suckers -- Whoa !Scotch that !Make that \" investors \" -- were found to buy a $ 1.5 billion Portuguese bond offering .Since this -- for the nonce , at least -- means that Portugal wo n't default on its sovereign debt , that took pressure off the euro .Hence speculators sold the dollar and bought euros .Right , it IS a silly game of musical currencies .", "score": "25.218441", "label": "true"}

{"text": "Opposition Remarks .Leaders of the Venezuelan opposition did not waste time in launching new criticisms of the Chavez government and raising doubts about the constitutional process of succession .Only hours after the country first learned of Chavez 's death Tuesday evening , opposition legislator Maria Corina Machado demanded to know who would be the new president .\" It is necessary to know who is in this moment the President of Venezuela and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces , \" Machado said via Twitter early Wednesday morning .She went on to release a statement calling for the \" transformation of the country \" and demanding the \" liberation of political prisoners \" and an \" end to the criminalization of political dissidence \" .When Vice - president Nicolas Maduro signed an official decree yesterday , Machado accused the government of a \" flagrant violation of the constitution \" .Opposition media and analysts argue that it should be the president of the national assembly , Diosdado Cabello , who takes over the presidency while new elections are called , but government officials assure that it is the vice - president who takes over temporarily .Article 233 of Venezuela 's constitution allows for both scenarios , depending on whether the absence occurs for a president - elect , or for a president that has already begun their term .Other opposition analysts have focused on Article 229 of the constitution , which says that the vice - president can not be elected to the presidency , and have thus argued that Maduro can not stand as a candidate in the coming elections .However , government officials have explained that Maduro will take over the presidency during 30 days , and thus will no longer be the vice - president .In a statement of condolences on Tuesday , opposition leader Henrique Capriles refrained from taking a position on the constitutional debate , but did call for the constitution to be followed .\" We hope , like all Venezuelans , that [ the government ] acts strictly within the constitution , \" he said .Other opposition leaders have not sought to make an issue of the succession process , saying that what is most important is that an \" absolute absence \" be declared by the national assembly .\" Once the national assembly declares an absolute absence and swears in Maduro as president , I will be the first to raise my hand [ to swear him in ] , because it wo n't be a violation of the constitution , \" said opposition legislator Hiram Gaviria .Venezuela 's national assembly is expected to officially declare an \" absolute absence \" in the coming days , and to swear in Vice - president Nicolas Maduro to take over the presidency while new elections are organized .Though it has not been announced officially , sources say that the opposition will declare their support for Miranda Governor Henrique Capriles as their candidate for the coming presidential elections .", "score": "27.718605", "label": "false"}
{"text": "This letter is an attempt to do so .The powers and limitations of the government concerning religious matters are controlled mainly by the two religion clauses in the First Amendment to the US Constitution , which states : \" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .\" The first part of that phrase is known as the establishment clause , and the second part as the free exercise clause .Sixteen simple words that guarantee religious liberty in the United States , and which have spawned thousands of pages of writings and numerous Supreme Court cases .Based on Supreme Court precedent , the establishment clause prevents the government from endorsing one religion over another , or endorsing religion in general over non - religion ( and vice versa ) .In a nutshell , the government must be neutral in matters of religion .The free exercise clause guarantees an individual 's right to practice their religion as they see fit ( or not practice any at all ) without interference or persecution from the government .Concerning religion in the public schools , the idea that \" we do not allow ( God ) to be mentioned or even hinted to in our schools \" is untrue .Students can practice their religion and express their faith individually or among their peers as long as is does not disrupt the school or classroom .Teachers and other staff can also practice their religion and express their faith individually or among their peers .This is protected by the free exercise clause of the Constitution .The only things that are prohibited are religious activities sponsored or endorsed by the school , or performed publicly in the school by representatives of the school .Concerning President Obama taking his oath of office using two Bibles , the US Constitution explicitly spells out the oath for the President in article II , section 1 .It is : \" I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my Ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .\" As you can see , there is no requirement to swear this oath using a Bible or any other text .That President Obama chose to swear the oath using two Bibles ( one belonged to Abraham Lincoln and the other to Martin Luther King , Jr. ) was his personal choice and is protected by the free exercise clause of the Constitution .Also , since the inauguration is a privately funded and organized event the establishment clause does not apply .Concerning displaying the Ten Commandments in our courts , doing so would clearly be an endorsement of religion by the government and is therefore prohibited by the establishment clause .Displaying one version only ( there are differences between the Jewish , Catholic , and Protestant versions ) would be a government endorsement of one religion over another and is also prohibited .There are some grey areas in what the government is , and is not , allowed to do concerning religious matters but the overall ideas are very clear thanks to the US Constitution and many precedents set by the courts on its interpretation .", "score": "27.72139", "label": "false"}
