{"text": "Gay Activists : Be Tolerant .Or We Will Destroy You !We have made great strides in the policing of thought in this country .Just ask Brendan Eich , one of the founders of Mozilla , developers of the web browser Firefox .Eich had just landed a promotion to the big chair as Mozilla 's CEO .He lasted all of nine days .The reason ?Back in 2008 Eich donated a thousand dollars to support Proposition 8 , the California ballot initiative to ban same - sex marriage .Eich , as many people in circumstances such as his , was stricken with the sudden desire to \" spend more time with his family \" and quietly resigned .Regardless of your position on same sex marriage , those activists who led to Eich 's resignation should be ashamed .Their basic message ?\" You 'd better be tolerant .Or else we will show you a display of true tolerance .By crushing you . \" In fact , it is no longer enough to be tolerant .In the same interview , he said that he wished for those who were calling for his ouster to know that \" without getting into my personal beliefs , which I separate from my Mozilla work -- when people learned of the donation , they felt pain .I saw that in friends ' eyes , [ friends ] who are LGBT [ lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgendered].I saw that in 2012 .I am sorry for causing that pain .\"Wow .Eich sounds like an intolerant jerk !No , strike that .He sounds like a dedicated and thoughtful professional who was able to separate his work and personal lives -- as well he should have been .But to the activist crowd , it 's not enough that people are tolerant .They must offer affirmation of the LGBT agenda or pay the price .Their much vaunted toleration does n't extend to those who might have opposing viewpoints , like Eich .Of course , gay rights activists claim that Eich 's views are not deserving of toleration because he sought to strip them of their rights .This may or may not be the case , but I 'd wager that many of them are n't such dogged defenders of rights when asked about , say , the Second Amendment .And I 'm hearing curiously little from these champions of freedom about the fact that 70 percent of California 's African Americans and over 50 percent of Hispanics voted for Prop 8 .The uncomfortable fact for the left is that 2008 was the same election in which minority voters pulled the levers in droves for President Obama .Even more uncomfortable ?President Obama himself was opposed to same sex marriage in 2008 .But , then , it 's not about principle .It 's about ramming through the \" right \" outcomes .Geez , ya think ?Andrew Sullivan , the unreliably conservative columnist had this to say : .Will [ Eich ] now be forced to walk through the streets in shame ?", "score": "8.636963", "label": "true"}

{"text": "My attention right now is focused more on the long term chart , and asking why since October Gold has been trapped between $ 1,315 and $ 1,430.60 .( By the way , first of those peaks occurred at $ 1,387.10 ) .Is this a top , where gold burns up buying power battering at $ 1,425 and fails ?Or is it gold stretching and coiling for another spring upward ?Today gold did manage to close above its 50 DMA ( $ 1,383 ) but below its 20 DMA ( $ 1,387.02 ) .All this feels better than falling through a trap door , but does n't tell us much yet .Tomorrow or Friday will come the crisis , where gold must either go forward or fall back .But here gold is merely marching back and forth over territory already traveled .The SILVER PRICE rose yesterday and today , but only by another 4.2c today to close Comex at 2953.2c .Again , this shows slowing momentum .In truth , silver merely traded sideways today , between 2970 and 2937c in US trading .Silver has crossed that first trip wire of a rally , the 20 day moving average ( 2936c ) but done little else .Until silver climbs above 3121c , it is in a downtrend .DMA , 20 day moving average , 200 day moving average , what 's all that about ?A 200 day moving average takes prices of the last 200 days and averages them .Next day , it drops the oldest and adds the latest , hence it is a \" moving \" average .Same method but shorter periods work for 50 and 20 DMAs .Markets trending generally upwards will remain ABOVE their moving averages .When they dip below the first tripwire , the 20 DMA , they signal a possible trend change .At longish intervals upward trending markets correct and return to kiss off their 200 DMA , which marks the long term uptrend .All of this works upside down for markets in primary down trends , that is , they spend most of their time BELOW their moving averages .I went back and looked once more at that GOLD / SILVER RATIO data from the last 10 years .Occasionally the ratio will peek above its 20 dma and then resume its downward move , but only rarely .More , the number of days the ratio has spent below its 20 DMA this trip is nearing the maximum number of days for such moves .That argues that we probably wo n't see a lower ratio for this move .US DOLLAR INDEX took a whipping today , apparently because sufficient suckers -- Whoa !Scotch that !Make that \" investors \" -- were found to buy a $ 1.5 billion Portuguese bond offering .Since this -- for the nonce , at least -- means that Portugal wo n't default on its sovereign debt , that took pressure off the euro .Hence speculators sold the dollar and bought euros .Right , it IS a silly game of musical currencies .", "score": "25.218441", "label": "true"}

{"text": "This letter is an attempt to do so .The powers and limitations of the government concerning religious matters are controlled mainly by the two religion clauses in the First Amendment to the US Constitution , which states : \" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .\" The first part of that phrase is known as the establishment clause , and the second part as the free exercise clause .Sixteen simple words that guarantee religious liberty in the United States , and which have spawned thousands of pages of writings and numerous Supreme Court cases .Based on Supreme Court precedent , the establishment clause prevents the government from endorsing one religion over another , or endorsing religion in general over non - religion ( and vice versa ) .In a nutshell , the government must be neutral in matters of religion .The free exercise clause guarantees an individual 's right to practice their religion as they see fit ( or not practice any at all ) without interference or persecution from the government .Concerning religion in the public schools , the idea that \" we do not allow ( God ) to be mentioned or even hinted to in our schools \" is untrue .Students can practice their religion and express their faith individually or among their peers as long as is does not disrupt the school or classroom .Teachers and other staff can also practice their religion and express their faith individually or among their peers .This is protected by the free exercise clause of the Constitution .The only things that are prohibited are religious activities sponsored or endorsed by the school , or performed publicly in the school by representatives of the school .Concerning President Obama taking his oath of office using two Bibles , the US Constitution explicitly spells out the oath for the President in article II , section 1 .It is : \" I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my Ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .\" As you can see , there is no requirement to swear this oath using a Bible or any other text .That President Obama chose to swear the oath using two Bibles ( one belonged to Abraham Lincoln and the other to Martin Luther King , Jr. ) was his personal choice and is protected by the free exercise clause of the Constitution .Also , since the inauguration is a privately funded and organized event the establishment clause does not apply .Concerning displaying the Ten Commandments in our courts , doing so would clearly be an endorsement of religion by the government and is therefore prohibited by the establishment clause .Displaying one version only ( there are differences between the Jewish , Catholic , and Protestant versions ) would be a government endorsement of one religion over another and is also prohibited .There are some grey areas in what the government is , and is not , allowed to do concerning religious matters but the overall ideas are very clear thanks to the US Constitution and many precedents set by the courts on its interpretation .", "score": "27.72139", "label": "false"}

{"text": "Let 's move on to today 's chart section to see how the situation looks like .The reason for this is the price action seen on Thursday when the index declined sharply , pulling back a bit before the session closed to end the day very close to the level of the May low .In fact , it is possible that we have seen the final bottom for this correction .The breakdown which we see here below the rising support line was so dramatic that it just might be the decline that the breakdown was supposed to generate .The most important and interesting implications are seen when we look at the reaction of the precious metals to Thursday 's decline in USD Index .Specifically , it is the lack of reaction in these markets that is most striking , even though the dollar index declined by about 1.5 index point and closed the day about 1 point lower .A huge rally in gold , silver , and the precious metals mining stocks would normally accompany such a significant move in the USD Index ( say , a $ 30 - $ 50 rally in gold ) , but barely any move to the upside was seen .This is a very bearish indication for the precious metals sector .In the short - term Euro Index chart , recall that we have had a head - and - shoulders pattern underway and not yet completed .The question now is , was this pattern invalided on Thursday with the decline in the USD Index and the move to the upside which was seen here ?Quite simply the answer is no .The move higher did not take the index above the final Fibonacci retracement level .Drawing parallel lines based on the local bottoms , we see that the upper line has not been reached and it emphasizes that the shape of the head - and - shoulders is still intact .The index level is not too high above the last shoulder as the formation is skewed .This is due to both higher lows and higher highs .The last shoulder ( September - October ) has a double top pattern so it 's really not so striking that the right shoulder just formed a second top .All in all , this pattern could still be completed and if it is , it will have bearish implications for the euro and the precious metals and bullish implications for the dollar .Now , let us take a look at the yellow metal to see whether any reaction to the dollar 's weakness was seen .Click to enlarge .We see that gold has rallied a bit more than $ 20 this week , really not much of a rally at all .The outlook continues to be bearish and the trend remains down .Gold could still decline heavily based on the long - term cyclical turning point , which is due approximately next week .Summing up , the most important development in the currency markets was the heavy decline of the USD Index on Thursday and the striking lack of reaction in the precious metals sector .", "score": "30.625893", "label": "true"}

Pesquera , Building with Our Hands ( 1993 ) .Ana Castillo introduces the term \" Xicanisma \" in opposition to the U.S. feminist movement , which has often ignored the woman of color 's struggle .Her collection of essays , Massacre of the Dreamers ( 1994 ) , adds to the development of literature which brings the Chicana 's experience to the forefront .Just as Mexicana feminism is often viewed in the context of a larger Latin American feminist discourse , Chicana feminism is viewed in the context of a larger U.S. third world women 's feminist discourse .One of the first key texts to offer a discussion of U.S. third world feminism is This Bridge Called My Back , edited by Gloria Anzald\u00faa and Cherr\u00ede Moraga ( 1981 ) .The text which acts as a second volume to This Bridge Called My Back is Making Face , Making Soul , edited by Gloria Anzald\u00faa ( 1990 ) .I also call on the work of Chandra Mohanty et al .for their discussion of third world feminism in Third World Women and the Politics of Feminism ( 1991 ) .These dynamic works offer a critical foundation for examining international feminisms .Bringing together Chicana and Mexicana feminism presents a tremendous challenge .For the reasons explained above , the two histories have been disconnected in a variety of ways for over a hundred years .", "score": "30.95924", "label": "true"}

{"text": "However , since this rally broke above its previous high of $ 96.11 , we may need to wait for the SPY to go to the black , thin resistance line ( about the 100 level ) before it moves lower .The 100 level is a resistance level due to the fact that it is a round number and likely to draw media atttention .( The 96.11 level corresponds to 956.23 in the S&P ) .The general stock market ( along with other markets , which were covered in the Premium Update on which this essay is based ) is likely to correct , but not necessarily immediately .Since in the previous weeks gold , silver , and corresponding equities were trading in the opposite direction to the U.S. Dollar , and in tune with the general stock market ( strong correlation ) , we may expect precious metals to take a small breather soon as well .Before making any specific calls , we need to analyze the precious metals themselves .This week , I will focus on silver .Silver has broken out of the delining trendling , but the low volume on Friday , suggests that we may see prices dip or consolidate before they resume their upward path .During a similar breakout in May , silver has consolidated around the price level corresponding to the previous local top - the $ 13 - $ 14 area .The analogical price level today is several cents higher - around $ 14 .The more similarities there are between two situations , the more probable it is that the history will repeat itself .The additional factor that suggests that the rally in silver is likely to take a pause is the action in volume .In May , slow volume after the breakout preceded the consolidation , so there is one more piece of the puzzle that fits the whole picture .With gold and silver suggesting a small consolidation , let 's take a look at the precious metals stocks .Mining stocks have also consolidated in the middle of May , and now they formed a triangle pattern , which is usually a sign of trend continuation .The volume has been declining this week , as PM stocks were trading sideways , thus confirming the triangle pattern .Taking into account points raised earlier , even if mining stocks break down from the triangle pattern , the following move should be rather insignificant - I do n't think that it would take the GDX ETF below 37 level .On the other hand , if we get a breakout to the upside , but gold and silver move lower soon , I would expect mining stocks to correct along with them , most likely once again to the upper border of the triangle - below 41 level .Moreover , one of our indicators signals that a pause is rather likely .Please note that usually when SP Gold Stock Bottom Indicator broke above the upper dashed line it meant at least a brief pullback in the coming days .This has been the case during this week , so we may indeed see lower prices of PM stocks in the coming days .", "score": "31.219988", "label": "true"}

Kinsey et al ., people were asked to rate themselves on a scale from completely heterosexual to completely homosexual .Kinsey reported that when the individuals ' behavior as well as their identity are analyzed , most people appeared to be at least somewhat bisexual - i.e. , most people have some attraction to either sex , although usually one sex is preferred .According to Kinsey , only a minority ( 5 - 10 % ) can be considered fully heterosexual or homosexual .Conversely , only an even smaller minority can be considered fully bisexual ( with an equal attraction to both sexes ) .Kinsey 's methods have been criticized as flawed , particularly with regard to the randomness of his sample population , which included prison inmates , male prostitutes and those who willingly participated in discussion of previously taboo sexual topics .Nevertheless , Paul Gebhard , subsequent director of the Kinsey Institute for Sex Research , reexamined the data in the Kinsey Reports and concluded that removing the prison inmates and prostitutes barely affected the results .[79 ] .Because sexual orientation is complex and multi - dimensional , some academics and researchers , especially in Queer studies , have argued that it is a historical and social construction .In 1976 , philosopher and historian Michel Foucault argued that homosexuality as an identity did not exist in the eighteenth century ; that people instead spoke of \" sodomy \" , which referred to sexual acts .", "score": "32.249615", "label": "false"}

{"text": "Source : The Constitution .The First Amendment encompasses several basic freedoms that often first come to mind when one hears \" the Bill of Rights . \"These rights make up the backbone of the concept of American liberty .The First Amendment guarantees the freedoms of religion , speech , press , assembly , and petition .Religion .The religion aspect of the First Amendment is split into the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause .The Establishment Clause has been interpreted to prevent the federal government from establishing a national religion or preferring one religion over another .The Free Exercise Clause has been interpreted to allow all people to freely practice the religion of their choosing .Each of these clauses has been incorporated and applied to the states , and there have been several cases regarding each that have molded and shaped the freedom of religion in the United States .In the 1962 case Engel v. Vitale , the Supreme Court ruled that official prayer in public schools violates the Establishment Clause , indicating that students may not be forced to pray in school .In the 1971 case Lemon v. Kurtzman , the Supreme Court ruled that direct government assistance to religious schools is unconstitutional .It also set up guidelines for government involvement with religion called the Lemon Test , which stated three clauses that must be met in order to avoid violating the Establishment Clause .These are ; ( 1 )The government action must have a secular legislative purpose ( 2 )The government can not primarily enforce religion ( 3 )The government can not \" excessively entangle \" with religion ( Oyez 1 ) .In the 1990 case Westside Community Schools v. Mergens , the Supreme Court ruled that schools can use public funds to support clubs that are religious or political in nature .Free Exercise Clause Cases : .In the 1878 case Reynolds v. United States , the Supreme Court ruled that a religious duty is not a viable defense to a criminal indictment .This established that illegal actions such as bigamy ( the issue debated in the case ) can not be committed , even for religious purposes .In the 1990 case Employment Division of Oregon v. Smith , the Supreme Court ruled that states have the right to deny unemployment benefits to someone fired for using prohibited drugs for religious purposes while working .Speech .The speech aspect of the First Amendment has also been broken up and defined more specifically as time has gone on .Several Supreme Court cases have been decided that have defined certain types of speech and enunciated what is allowed to be regulated by the government .In the 1919 case Schenck v. United States , the Supreme Court ruled to allow Congress to restrict speech that creates a clear and present danger .This means that , although Americans are free to speak as they please , they may not do so in a manner than endangers others , for example , shouting \" fire \" in a crowded movie theater .In the 1925 case Gitlow v.

{"text": "[ 2 ] In criminal law , a duress defense is similar to a plea of guilty , admitting partial culpability , so that if the defense is not accepted then the criminal act is admitted .Duress or coercion can also be raised in an allegation of rape or sexual assault to negate a defense of consent on the part of the person making the allegation .There is no equivalent term for ' rape ' in the Qur'an .Likewise , there is not a single verse in the Qur'an which even remotely discourages forced sex .In contrast , there are several verses in this book which give the green light to rape and other sexual crimes against women .Surah an - Nisa discusses lawful and forbidden women for pious Muslims .Before we delve into the particular verse , it should be noted that it is not easy to understand what is being suggested using the verse alone .Therefore , relying on authoritative Tafsirs ( Qur'an interpretations ) and Sahih ( authentic ) Hadiths associated with it , are necessary to get the exact picture .Verse 4:24 .Also ( forbidden are ) women already married , except those whom your right hands possess .Thus has Allah ordained for you .All others are lawful , provided you seek them from your property , desiring chastity , not fornication .So with those among them whom you have enjoyed , give them their required due , but if you agree mutually after the requirement ( has been determined ) , there is no sin on you .Surely , Allah is Ever All - Knowing , All - Wise .What we see in the beginning of this verse as \" forbidden \" refers to sexual intercourse .The Qur'an dictates , women already married are forbidden for Muslims except those whom their right hands possess ( sex slaves ) .Context .It is important to know the context of this verse , as it sheds light onto the nature of allowance .If we go through a Sahih Hadith in Sunan Abu Dawud : .Abu Said al - Khudri said : \" The apostle of Allah sent a military expedition to Awtas on the occasion of the battle of Hunain .They met their enemy and fought with them .They defeated them and took them captives .Some of the Companions of the apostle of Allah were reluctant to have intercourse with the female captives in the presence of their husbands who were unbelievers .So Allah , the Exalted , sent down the Quranic verse , \" And all married women ( are forbidden ) unto you save those ( captives ) whom your right hands possess \" .That is to say , they are lawful for them when they complete their waiting period .\"[ The Quran verse is 4:24 ] [ 3 ] .Abu Dawud 11:2150 .Here in the above hadith , we are told why verse 4:24 was revealed to Muhammad .It was to encourage his fighters , who were reluctant , to have sexual contacts with female captives even while their husbands were alive as prisoners of war .", "score": "33.674232", "label": "false"}

{"text": "In doing research for my book The Whole - Brain Path to Peace- which examines how our dual mental perspectives affect our behavior - something rather unexpected happened .I discovered a connection between sexuality and brain perspective that casts new light on why some people are sexually attracted to members of their own sex .This connection is implicit in recent brain research , but has not been fully explored .Although most sexual - orientation research is still focused on genes , social conditioning , and hormones , the role of the brain is increasingly being taken into account .Scientific research has now established that the brains of gay men show strong similarities with the brains of heterosexual women in many respects ; and the brains of lesbian women show areas of similarity to those of heterosexual men .The hypothesis I am presenting here takes these findings a step further .I am proposing that the similarities in the brains of homosexual men and heterosexual women ( or homosexual women and heterosexual men ) include perspective -dualistic and/or holistic - and that perspective is the trigger that determines sexuality .This hypothesis , which I will explain in detail , complements existing non - brain - based theories and findings rather than refuting or discrediting them .And it is consistent with recent research - both brain - based and non - brain - based - in lending strong support to the position that one 's sexual orientation is not a choice .The focus of my research , mental perspective , might be best understood in comparison to its cousin , physical perspective .Perspective reflects our \" point of view\"-what we sense and feel of the world around us in terms of things , ideas , and feelings .Perspective supplies us with raw information which we then interpret and give meaning to in light of our experiences and the influence of cultural forces .The end result is perception , a state of understanding that reflects how we view the world .Depending on our perception ( which is often based on other people 's perceptions ) , we then formulate a response ( or respond automatically ) .Thus our behavior - including our sexual responses - is profoundly shaped by what we perceive of our environment .The human brain is split laterally into two complementary hemispheres that separate the information flowing to consciousness so effectively that Roger Sperry described the two hemispheres as having a consciousness of their own , a discovery that earned him a Nobel Prize in 1981 .Based on more recent studies , Michael Gazzaniga , Sperry 's student assistant at the time , and others now view consciousness in terms of \" multiple dynamic mental systems \" rather than a dichotomous one . 1 Nevertheless , the conscious experience of the two hemispheres appears to be specialized and very different , a conclusion so well supported by research that Gazzaniga describes it as \" obvious \" .What does having our information inputs separated into two specialized channels do for us ?It sets up a dynamic similar to 3-D vision or stereo sound , but instead of a physical event , our experience is a mental one .", "score": "33.714638", "label": "false"}
{"text": "Homosexual CSA can have long - lasting , perhaps permanent , negative impacts on boys and young men .A number of studies report that the risk of mental health conditions - including depression , anxiety , self - mutilation , drug abuse , attempted suicide , etc . - is twice as great for victims of CSA as for those who never experience such abuse .In addition , CSA victims frequently exhibit over - sexualized behavior , putting them at greater risk for contracting sexually transmitted infections ( STI ) and/or adopting the very behavioral pattern to which they were subjected .A recent large - scale study found that almost 20 % of self - identified homosexuals and bisexuals had experienced homosexual CSA in their own lives , compared to less than 5 % of heterosexuals .The relative risks of having experienced homosexual molestation compared to male heterosexuals were 9.5 times higher for gays and 12.8 times higher for male bisexuals .18 Thus , in a perhaps counter - intuitive way , homosexual CSA is indeed a form of modeling upon which boys and young men can become fixated due to the physical pleasure associated with the abuse .What are the likely ramifications to BSA if the current policy is changed ?Despite the current ban on self - identified homosexuals , individuals with homosexual interests continue to infiltrate Scouting in order to be close to unsuspecting boys and young men .A new study involving a systematic Google news search over the past year of media - reported child sexual abuse ( CSA ) cases identified four Boy Scout leaders caught or accused of CSA , including three accused of homosexual molestation .19 The study also identified homosexual CSA in 9 of 24 ( 38 % ) teachers , 2 of 2 boys or girls club leaders , and 5 of 9 ( 55 % ) coaches and instructors .Overall , of a total of 210 perpetrators , nearly 41 % allegedly engaged in homosexual CSA , entirely consistent with past studies and other databases on this topic .Given these facts , the realities of changing current BSA policy to allow open homosexuals would include the following : .The impact of any sexual molestation can be traumatic and long - lasting .BSA would be forced to change its long - standing moral code , thus alienating a large majority of families that have trusted Scouts to promote its stated values of \" clean , \" \" reverent , \" and \" morally straight .\" By allowing open homosexuals , all scouts , regardless of their personal or family beliefs , will be given the clear message that the Boy Scouts endorses homosexuality .BSA will be placed under significant legal scrutiny and risk of damaging lawsuits .It is one thing for individuals to secretly subvert Scout policy against child sexual abuse .It is another for the Boy Scouts to accept open homosexuals when there is clear scientific documentation of the vastly greater risk of male - on - male CSA by homosexuals and those with homosexual interests .Boy Scouts has already paid large sums of money to victims of CSA due to its past negligence in protecting scouts .", "score": "33.750633", "label": "false"}

Tarver explains the classic texts , The Art of War by Sun Tzu and The Art of Warfare by Sun Pin , in plain English .War is the perfect training ground for teaching Sun Tzu 's ancient philosophies to attaining victory over an opponent .The Art of War outlines the steps for outwitting the enemy , be it an army of 10,000 or an unresponsive client .The Art of War teaches leaders strategies to attain victory by : . \" The one who is first to the field of battle has time to rest , while his opponent rushes into the conflict weary and confused .The first will be fresh and alert .The second will waste most of his energy trying to catch up . \"Be the first to the battlefield with The Art of War .Most Helpful Customer Reviews .This is not merely a military or tactical manual - this is a book of pure wisdom .Sun Tzu was way ahead of his time in creating such an extraordinary guide to strategy and leadership , both in and out of combat .Read this book once , then read it again the advice and aphorisms that flow from it are infinite each time .This is a book full of wisdom and knowledge in the dealings of war .The concept of war can then be taken from the text and applied to all area of one 's life .I have become a stronger individual after reading the book .While originally thought to be a manual for making and winning wars and battles , astute readers and practioners will find Sun Tzu 's writing to be a way of living life .The priciaples of war ae there for certain but think , dig deeper and improve your life .This is an amazing book , but I do n't want people to be deceived , it 's dry .The driest martini in the world type of dry , the Sahara looks like a rain forest dry .It is meant to be educational and it is useful for creating your own philosophies and maybe a little bit useful in warfare ( still great if you want to wage an ancient war ) .But not every reader that loves reading will understand why this is great .it is not an escape .My hockey team went on a retreat about 9 months ago .We were told that we would be uncofortable .Over the course of a few days , our coach opened up Sun Tzu 's work to us .", "score": "34.11036", "label": "true"}

{"text": "Notice the actual language of the First Amendment : \" Congress shall make no law ... \" .As one of many efforts to limit the power of the federal government , the Constitution left authority over religious matters to the States .The Supreme Court consistently adhered to this constitutional principle until well into the twentieth century .But in the 1925 ruling , Gitlow v. New York , the Supreme Court began ignoring its predecessors and precedents .The Court reasoned that one of the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment was to extend the Bill of Rights to the States .( This would obviously expand the powers of the federal courts to a great degree . )The history of the Fourteenth Amendment does not support their contention , nor do the earlier Courts .Nonetheless , the 1925 Court ignored the historical record and the opinions of their predecessors , establishing a new precedent .Gitlow dealt with freedom of speech and the press ; religious matters would soon follow .In the context of religion , the Court 's first and most abusive reinterpretation began in a 1940 Supreme Court ruling , Cantwell v. Connecticut .Here , the Court applied the \" free exercise \" clause of the First Amendment to the states .Again , religion was a State matter .State courts were , and are , completely capable of handling the issue .Nevertheless , the Supreme Court , in direct opposition to the original intentions of the Constitution , applied yet another portion of the Bill of Rights to the States .They did not stop there .The next landmark ruling came down in 1947 .In the case , Everson v. Board of Education , the Supreme Court applied the \" establishment clause \" of the First Amendment to the states .In the context of the \" separation of church and state , \" the Court 's foundational reinterpretation of the Constitution was complete .From 1947 forward , the Court has ruled with regularity on religious issues , in direct violation of the original meaning of the First Amendment .Their rulings , and those of lower courts ( federal and State ) have become the \" law \" of \" separation of church and state .\" That was a very brief description of how the federal courts have taken authority over religious issues , reinterpreting the First Amendment and applying it to the States by way of the Fourteenth Amendment .All of this was done in clear violation of the actual wording of the Constitution , as well as the intentions of its framers .The modern concept of \" separation of church and state \" can not be justified using the historical record .We are forced , however , to work with the existing court doctrines .Therefore , what does the phrase mean today as it is applied in American public policy ?The First Amendment , which prohibited any \" law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , \" has evolved into something entirely new .During the last generation , the courts , at all levels , have ruled in ways that essentially guarantee the freedom from religion , instead of the freedom of religion . \" Separation of church and state , \" as applied to education , means that a prayer at a graduation ceremony is unconstitutional .", "score": "34.823708", "label": "false"}

{"text": "Congress wins relief on Obamacare health plan subsidies .WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Congress has won some partial relief for lawmakers and their staffs from the \" Obamacare \" health reforms that it passed and subjected itself to three years ago .In a ruling issued on Wednesday , U.S. lawmakers and their staffs will continue to receive a federal contribution toward the health insurance that they must purchase through soon - to - open exchanges created by President Barack Obama 's signature healthcare law .The decision by the Office of Personnel Management , with Obama 's blessing , will prevent the largely unintended loss of healthcare benefits for 535 members of the Senate and House of Representatives and thousands of Capitol Hill staff .When Congress passed the health reform law known as Obamacare in 2010 , an amendment required that lawmakers and their staff members purchase health insurance through the online exchanges that the law created .They would lose generous coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program .The amendment 's author , Republican Senator Charles Grassley , argued that if Obamacare plans were good enough for the American public , they were good enough for Congress .Democrats , eager to pass the reforms , went along with it .But it soon became apparent the provision contained no language that allowed federal contributions toward their health plans that cover about 75 percent of the premium costs .This caused fears that staff would suddenly face sharply higher healthcare costs and leave federal service , causing a \" brain drain \" on Capitol Hill .But Wednesday 's proposed rule from the OPM , the federal government 's human resources agency , means that Congress will escape the most onerous impact of law as it was written .The OPM said the federal contributions will be allowed to continue for exchange - purchased plans for lawmakers and their staffs , ensuring that those working on Capitol Hill will effectively get the same health contributions as millions of other federal workers who keep their current plan .The problem surrounding the Obamacare language for Capitol Hill staff was the subject of intense negotiations in recent weeks between House and Senate leaders and the Obama administration .Some Republicans immediately slammed the OPM decision , using it as fuel for their campaign to turn public opinion against Obamacare just as its core provisions are due to go into effect .\" While the administration has handed out waiver after waiver and exemption after exemption for the well - connected in Washington , they have done nothing to lower health care costs for families in Michigan , \" said Dave Camp , chairman of the tax - writing House Ways and Means Committee .Camp said the OPM ruling is the \" latest proof \" of impending failure for the reforms and pledged that Republicans would keep trying to repeal them .Last week , House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said the language problem would have caused unintended \" collateral damage \" on congressional staff , causing many to leave for the private sector .\" They are a tremendous intellectual resource , people who could , shall we say , be better compensated financially outside \" of government , said Pelosi , who spearheaded passage of the health care law in 2010 as House Speaker .", "score": "35.8462", "label": "true"}

{"text": "We see five big risks that may affect the mapping of our macro views into the market forecast : .Long - dated real yields rise more sharply .We forecast that real bond yields in the US ( and G4 ) will rise modestly in 2014 , at a pace close to the forwards .Given the importance of the valuation gap between bonds and equities for our story , we have highlighted the risk that this gap closes more through higher real yields than through higher equity markets .There are good reasons to expect the rise in yields to be relatively moderate .Back - dated yields have moved much closer to normal levels than they were a year ago and our measures of G3 bond valuations are no longer ' rich ' .Inflation remains benign and major central banks still look committed to a long period of unusually low policy rates .And with Fed tapering already begun , the market has incorporated the expectation that asset purchases will end this year .But the term premium in bonds is still lower than during much of the pre-2007 period .And models of the term premium and fund rate paths that we used last March to argue that there was upside risk to yields suggest that some upside risk remains ( Exhibit 6 ) .Exhibit 6 shows a range of yield estimates generated from simple term premium models .While these do not point to large upside risks in 2014 , they do imply increased risk beyond that point .These models are based on our own benign view of the Fed funds path and inflation , so if those assumptions come under challenge , so could our yield view .We have argued that rising yields are consistent with positive equity returns as long as improving growth is driving both higher , so the driver of higher yields matters .That is a key reason why we have been mostly relaxed about the impact of higher bond yields so far .But there are two key caveats .The first is that periods where yields rise rapidly - even with strong growth - tend to hurt equities , as during the taper tantrum .Temporary periods of that kind are likely even in our central forecast .The second is that if yields rise because of expectations of tighter monetary policy , this is more unambiguously negative for equity markets .On the rates strategy front , it is the pricing of rates over the next 3 - 5 years where we think the risk premium looks unusually low .That takes us to our next risk .Markets doubt G4 commitment to easy policy in the face of better growth .Our forecast is that although tapering will likely be completed this year , the Fed will not raise the Funds rate until early 2016 .The Fed itself has worked relatively hard to try to decouple the decision to taper from the decision to hike .And while the market gave little credit to that view during the ' taper tantrum ' last summer , expectations of the path for US policy rates fell back significantly after the non - taper in September and the nomination of incoming Fed Chair Yellen , despite rising bond yields .", "score": "35.961044", "label": "true"}
