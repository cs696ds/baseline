{"text": "Gay Activists : Be Tolerant .Or We Will Destroy You !We have made great strides in the policing of thought in this country .Just ask Brendan Eich , one of the founders of Mozilla , developers of the web browser Firefox .Eich had just landed a promotion to the big chair as Mozilla 's CEO .He lasted all of nine days .The reason ?Back in 2008 Eich donated a thousand dollars to support Proposition 8 , the California ballot initiative to ban same - sex marriage .Eich , as many people in circumstances such as his , was stricken with the sudden desire to \" spend more time with his family \" and quietly resigned .Regardless of your position on same sex marriage , those activists who led to Eich 's resignation should be ashamed .Their basic message ?\" You 'd better be tolerant .Or else we will show you a display of true tolerance .By crushing you . \" In fact , it is no longer enough to be tolerant .In the same interview , he said that he wished for those who were calling for his ouster to know that \" without getting into my personal beliefs , which I separate from my Mozilla work -- when people learned of the donation , they felt pain .I saw that in friends ' eyes , [ friends ] who are LGBT [ lesbian , gay , bisexual , or transgendered].I saw that in 2012 .I am sorry for causing that pain .\"Wow .Eich sounds like an intolerant jerk !No , strike that .He sounds like a dedicated and thoughtful professional who was able to separate his work and personal lives -- as well he should have been .But to the activist crowd , it 's not enough that people are tolerant .They must offer affirmation of the LGBT agenda or pay the price .Their much vaunted toleration does n't extend to those who might have opposing viewpoints , like Eich .Of course , gay rights activists claim that Eich 's views are not deserving of toleration because he sought to strip them of their rights .This may or may not be the case , but I 'd wager that many of them are n't such dogged defenders of rights when asked about , say , the Second Amendment .And I 'm hearing curiously little from these champions of freedom about the fact that 70 percent of California 's African Americans and over 50 percent of Hispanics voted for Prop 8 .The uncomfortable fact for the left is that 2008 was the same election in which minority voters pulled the levers in droves for President Obama .Even more uncomfortable ?President Obama himself was opposed to same sex marriage in 2008 .But , then , it 's not about principle .It 's about ramming through the \" right \" outcomes .Geez , ya think ?Andrew Sullivan , the unreliably conservative columnist had this to say : .Will [ Eich ] now be forced to walk through the streets in shame ?", "score": "8.636963", "label": "true"}

{"text": "My attention right now is focused more on the long term chart , and asking why since October Gold has been trapped between $ 1,315 and $ 1,430.60 .( By the way , first of those peaks occurred at $ 1,387.10 ) .Is this a top , where gold burns up buying power battering at $ 1,425 and fails ?Or is it gold stretching and coiling for another spring upward ?Today gold did manage to close above its 50 DMA ( $ 1,383 ) but below its 20 DMA ( $ 1,387.02 ) .All this feels better than falling through a trap door , but does n't tell us much yet .Tomorrow or Friday will come the crisis , where gold must either go forward or fall back .But here gold is merely marching back and forth over territory already traveled .The SILVER PRICE rose yesterday and today , but only by another 4.2c today to close Comex at 2953.2c .Again , this shows slowing momentum .In truth , silver merely traded sideways today , between 2970 and 2937c in US trading .Silver has crossed that first trip wire of a rally , the 20 day moving average ( 2936c ) but done little else .Until silver climbs above 3121c , it is in a downtrend .DMA , 20 day moving average , 200 day moving average , what 's all that about ?A 200 day moving average takes prices of the last 200 days and averages them .Next day , it drops the oldest and adds the latest , hence it is a \" moving \" average .Same method but shorter periods work for 50 and 20 DMAs .Markets trending generally upwards will remain ABOVE their moving averages .When they dip below the first tripwire , the 20 DMA , they signal a possible trend change .At longish intervals upward trending markets correct and return to kiss off their 200 DMA , which marks the long term uptrend .All of this works upside down for markets in primary down trends , that is , they spend most of their time BELOW their moving averages .I went back and looked once more at that GOLD / SILVER RATIO data from the last 10 years .Occasionally the ratio will peek above its 20 dma and then resume its downward move , but only rarely .More , the number of days the ratio has spent below its 20 DMA this trip is nearing the maximum number of days for such moves .That argues that we probably wo n't see a lower ratio for this move .US DOLLAR INDEX took a whipping today , apparently because sufficient suckers -- Whoa !Scotch that !Make that \" investors \" -- were found to buy a $ 1.5 billion Portuguese bond offering .Since this -- for the nonce , at least -- means that Portugal wo n't default on its sovereign debt , that took pressure off the euro .Hence speculators sold the dollar and bought euros .Right , it IS a silly game of musical currencies .", "score": "25.218441", "label": "true"}
{"text": "Not much happened in gold and mining stocks this week , but silver moved higher .We sometimes saw this type of divergence right at the local tops , but it was not an extremely reliable sign .Click to enlarge .As the situation did n't really change yesterday , the comments that my firm had made previously did n't change either : .Gold moved higher and the rally above the declining resistance line is now quite significant .However , it 's overbought on a short - term basis .Taking the RSI indicator into account , it 's even more overbought than it was in August 2013 , when it was trading $ 100 higher .The Stochastic indicator is about to flash a sell signal as well .This suggests that we will likely see either a beginning of a new big decline or a correction in the rally ( if one has really already begun ) .Either way , it looks like there soon will be a much better opportunity to go long than the one we have right now .Silver has finally moved visibly higher .Friday 's rally took the white metal above both the rising and declining resistance lines , and it moved higher this week as well .Did the outlook change substantially based on that ?Not necessarily .The move was sharp , and silver has been trading above the declining resistance line for just a few days now .More importantly , silver moved to its 50-week moving average , which served as strong support and resistance numerous times .The last time that it served as resistance was right after silver rallied sharply after the previous long - term cyclical turning point .Consequently , even though silver 's recent rally is impressive , let 's keep in mind that the same was the case in August 2013 ( actually , the rally was much more significant back then ) and was still followed by declines .In the coming years , silver will probably rally very far - well over its 2011 high .However , as far as the short term is concerned , it seems that traders and investors might expect at least a short - term decline .The third and final metal that I would like to feature today is palladium .The situation has n't really changed this week , but the implications for the precious metals sector remain in place .Palladium moved to its declining resistance line without breaking it , and if you 've been following my firm 's analyses for some time , you know that this has been signaling local tops in the entire precious metals sector .Consequently , whatever happens months from now , it still seems that we will see a short - term downswing shortly .All in all , it looks like we are likely to see a correction or another big decline soon .Let 's see if this outlook is consistent with the situation in the currency markets .It 's been over a year now since the USD Index broke above the long - term resistance line , which is now support .", "score": "25.32619", "label": "true"}

{"text": "To be clear , this is a pertinent question for the former first lady , who 's facing three separate federal investigations related to her private email system .Two stem from the State Department and the other emanating from the FBI .It was revealed yesterday that State slapped the Clinton Foundation with a subpoena last fall , where they asked for documents relating to projects that might have needed approval from the government while Hillary was serving as Secretary of State .Chris Cillizza explains why the latest development comes at a bad time ( via WaPo ): .It furthers the \" where there 's smoke , there 's fire \" argument .This hurts Clinton both coming and going .For Republicans , it hands them yet another way to suggest that something untoward is going on with Clinton .For Democrats , it increases their anxiety about the possibility of nominating someone who could fall under an ethical cloud just as the party is trying to elect them to the White House .\" There is a concerted effort to try to make partisan advantage by really trying to throw so much at me that even if little splotches of it stick , it will cloud peoples 's judgment of me , \" Clinton told MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow this week .\" That is a burden I carry .\" There is , without question , a desire on the part of many Republicans to cast Clinton in the worst possible light using almost any means necessary .But it strains credulity to believe that Republicans somehow concocted a way to get the State Department and the FBI to look into Clinton 's tenure at State .As I wrote in this space this week , at some point Clinton will need to directly face down the fact that it 's not just Republicans who are talking about her emails or her paid speeches or the Clinton Foundation .The numbers coming out of the New Hampshire exit poll make plain that Democratic voters care about honesty in their politicians , and those that prize it the most are voting heavily against Clinton .Yet , apparently this did n't warrant a question from Ifill , or the co - moderator Judy Woodruff last night .So , there 's your taxpayer - funded news for you , folks .Poll : Voters Open To Revolution To Steal Other People 's Money .Friday , February 12 .By Matt Vespa .Katie delivered a punch to the gut when she wrote yesterday that a majority of Millennials prefers socialism to capitalism .To make matters worse , we have a Vox / Morning Consult poll showing that most are open to a political revolution to steal other people 's money ( via Vox ): .Just 30 percent said they disagreed .Liberals and liberal - leaning demographics were most likely to agree with the statement .But majorities of independents , white voters , evangelicals , and even Tea Party supporters in our sample agreed too - showing that redistribution may no longer be a dirty word in American politics .", "score": "25.62011", "label": "false"}
{"text": "The point of planning is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of both sides in this level of detail .This being done , the strategist can depart from the plan on the basis of knowledge , not ignorance .\" Knowing yourself \" and \" knowing your enemy \" was not some sort of abstract Taoist mysticism to Sun Tzu ; he was a general , not a philosopher .He wanted to know himself , and his enemy , in concrete terms of direct relevance to planning for victory in the most effective and efficient manners possible .Only by rationally assessing reality as it is , not as one wishes for it to be , can a person develop a strategy that has a firm basis .In this way , even if the means are not part of philosophy themselves , the end result feels like an extension of natural law .After all , Sun Tzu counseled to be like water , following the path of least resistance , yet striking with the force of a raging torrent .This is the result of not so much the plan , as the depth of the knowledge that was obtained in the formation of one .Some would call the title of this post the \" most quoted \" quote of Sun Tzu 's entire book .However , I dislike the emphasis many place on learning \" The Art of War \" through disjointed quotations .Chapter I has a significant section on deception , but readers of this isolated quote might never learn the context associated with it .Allow me to explain .When Sun Tzu elaborates on deception , he begins : . \"Hence , when able to attack , we must seem unable ; .When using our forces , we must seem inactive ; .When we are near , we must make the enemy believe we are far away ; .When far away , we must make him believe we are near . \"A reader might glance over this and be tempted to remark , \" Well , that sounds easy .\" It most assuredly is not .When in a conflict against fellow human beings , the opponent is a fellow man ; being a fellow man , he is familiar with the patterns that accompany readiness to attack , signs of inactivity , and indications of proximity or lack thereof .These are signs that armies and other large organizations give off without conscious thought or effort .While not every leader or strategist is well versed with the subtleties that accompany them , they are all familiar with the bold strokes that accompany an armored cavalry thrust from a General Patton , as one example .These are things that are hard to conceal , yet easy to detect .Thus , something more is required .This is the role of deception .Unable to simply show the enemy nothing , the strategist instead shows his opponent something that the opponent wishes to see and wishes to believe .Having shown something , but having shown this something in a way that creates a false impression , the enemy is seduced into deceiving himself .", "score": "25.71795", "label": "true"}
{"text": "\" Know your enemy and know yourself \" .Others are just practical sense and statistical outcomes that you learn in any military training .I could go through the list , but again that is why you buy the book .Lesen Sie weiter ... 'The Art of War .Storyline .Although accounts differ over the Sun Tzu 's origins , according to a biography written by a 2nd century BC historian he was a general who lived in the state of Wu in 6th century BC .Sun Tzu is most famous for the Art of War , praised as the definitive work on military strategy and tactics prior to the collapse of imperial China .Consisting of 13 chapters , the Art of War is one of the most famous studies on strategies for military success .The most fundamental of Sun Tzu 's principles is that \" warfare is based on deception \" , and he believed that \" the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting \" .One of his stratagems emphasizes the importance of knowing your enemy , \" If you know the enemy and know yourself , you need not fear the result of a hundred battles .If you know yourself but not the enemy , for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat \" .Today his work has found new applications in areas totally unrelated to its original military purpose and used as a guide in business , sport , diplomacy , and even in dating !Sun Tzu is 100 % right , and it does not only applies to warfare , but also to work : I 've convinced a seniot CEO to promised a hole lot of money if I could achieve a bold gold .( doen't matter what those golds were , only the time to achieve them : 5 months ) .Sun Tzu says : there are 5 elements you should consider BEFORE going to war .I verified the 5 elements BEFORE the \" war \" and reckon they were all in my favour ...so I WON !Straight & simple !As a mathematician I ca nt help but draw parallels to the Utility maximization problem .Which is basically Sun 's idea expressed in mathematical form .maximise gain , minimise loss .Sun Tzu was a truly rational thinker who also accounted for human emotion .@Ashish - I agree but I would like to say that it is maybe a little less \" emotion \" and a little bit more \" human problem solving \" .What I mean is that if you present a problem to someone its not pure logic vs emotion , alot of it is just how people tackle problems .There is another documentary on this site about Maths .One part of the doc showed how people consistently made bad decisions playing a game called \" lets make a deal \" .That shows that to predict human behavior you have to understand what a persons problem solving system is .I think this is where art of war shines .", "score": "25.922085", "label": "true"}
