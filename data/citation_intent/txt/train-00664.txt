However , learning-based resolvers have not been able to benefit from having an SC agreement feature , presumably because the method used to compute the SC of an NP is too simplistic : while the SC of a proper name is computed fairly accurately using a named entity ( NE ) recognizer , many resolvers simply assign to a common noun the first ( i.e. , most frequent ) WordNet sense as its SC ( e.g. , Soon et al. ( 2001 ) , Markert and Nissim ( 2005 ) ) .
