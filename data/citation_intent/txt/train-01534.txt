only the available five relative scopings of the quantifiers are produced ( Hobbs and Shieber 1987 , 47 ) , but without the need for a free variable constraint -- the HOU algorithm will not produce any solutions in which a previously bound variable becomes free ; â¢ the equivalences are reversible , and thus the above sentences cart be generated from scoped logical forms ; â¢ partial scopings are permitted ( see Reyle [ 19961 ) â¢ scoping can be freely interleaved with other types of reference resolution ; â¢ unscoped or partially scoped forms are available for inference or for generation at every stage .
