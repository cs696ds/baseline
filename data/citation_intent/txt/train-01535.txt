In the transducers produced by the training method described in this paper , the source and target positions are in the set -LCB- -1 , 0,1 -RCB- , though we have also used handcoded transducers ( Alshawi and Xia 1997 ) and automatically trained transducers ( Alshawi and Douglas 2000 ) with a larger range of positions .
