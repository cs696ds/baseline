{"text": "And , for now , they are considered legal .One of the tax - avoidance tricks that Romney 's funds employ , however , is not legal , according to Fleischer .This trick involves treating not just \" performance - based fees \" but management fees as capital gains rather than ordinary income .Private - equity firms , like other fund management firms , generally charge two kinds of fees on each fund : .Both of these fees are standard professional fees , so they both should be taxed at ordinary income rates .In one of the most outrageous loopholes in the tax code , however , the fund - management industry has bamboozled ( or simply bribed ) Congress into treating \" performance - based \" fees as capital gains rather than income .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And , if they structure the funds well enough , they can avoid ever having to pay ordinary income taxes on their fees .But Bain went further than claiming the common \" carried interest \" treatment on its performance fees , says Fleischer .In a much more controversial move , Bain also claimed capital gains treatment for its management fees .This allowed the funds ( and Romney ) to avoid paying ordinary income taxes on all of its fees , not just its performance fees .How did Bain claim that its management fees were capital gains ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For two reasons , though , this justification is weak .First , for normal Americans , investment capital is eligible for capital - gains treatment only after it has been assessed with ordinary income taxes .If the doctor put this capital at risk , he would then be entitled to capital - gains treatment .Thanks to the \" carried interest \" loophole , however , fund managers can put the whole $ 1 million of fees at risk simply by keeping it in their funds .Thus , they can let all of their fee - income compound tax free and never pay ordinary income taxes on it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Second , as Fleischer explains , Bain had extraordinary flexibility in choosing which investments to take its guaranteed share of \" future profits \" out of , in addition to when .Basically , all Bain had to do to ensure that it would get its management fees was to choose one investment in each fund that would appreciate in value at some point in the future .And given that Bain also had lots of control over the \" carrying values \" of these investments , it had superior knowledge of which investments would be the most likely to gain value .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fleischer says this trick , treating management fees as capital gains , is \" not legal . \"He also believes it would not stand up in court .To be fair , it appears that , legally , this particular tax - avoidance scheme is still in the \" not yet settled \" phase as opposed to the \" established law \" phase .At some point , if the IRS concludes that the capital gains treatment is bogus , it will likely challenge it in court .And Bain and other private - equity firms will defend it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Or , alternatively , the IRS and/or Congress could issue a clarification that either explicitly allows this treatment or explicitly disavows it .But what appears clear is that this aggressive interpretation and use of tax law has likely saved Bain and Mitt Romney millions of dollars in taxes over the years .Update .Although I refuse to watch the GOP circus tonight , I do pay attention to the twitter media and truth tellers and I love this from Alex Wagner about Ann Romney 's speech tonight : . -Mem .Mem McD .I am a true dumpster diver which allows me to up - cycle and create !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "And I realized I needed to get down as close to the podium as I could .So I made my way down through the several delegations on the right side of the convention floor and settled in about thirty feet down from Obama 's left .What struck me first about Obama is something I 've only really seen clearly before in Bill Clinton .In most politicians -- in most public speakers really -- you can always sense a sort of double motion .You can sense their constant awareness of what they should be doing before they do it , and their inability to get the two to match up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
