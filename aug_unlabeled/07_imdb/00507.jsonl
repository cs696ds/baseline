'could be even left out completely , just noting he was invited .Vruthath said : \" Yayath \" , \" yes \" .- the line does n't quite fit to me and ca n't come up with another word(s ) to say , how about making him say nothing and hesitate or shake his head ; but the witch keeps repeating her demand , he decides etc . .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
