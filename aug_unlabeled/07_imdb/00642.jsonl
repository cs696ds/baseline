{"text": "December 16 , 2005 .Brokeback Mountain ( 2005 ) : C+ .Despite the ever - swelling chorus of effusive praise being sung for Brokeback Mountain , Ang Lee 's mainstream \" gay cowboy \" romance turns out to be as regressively conservative as it is trailblazing same - sex cinema .Occasionally poignant despite its telegraphed pathos , it 's a melancholy portrait of inhibited passion bolstered by a quartet of honest , emotionally raw performances .Yet as aesthetically stilted and subdued as Ennis and Jack are sexually repressed , Lee 's film is also regularly sabotaged by its glossy , superficial construction and its disheartening failure to conceive of homosexual relations as anything other than tragic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Oh well .First , I would like to comment on a couple of the threads of the discussion above .The original reviewer argues that the film imagines gay romance as tragic , and subsequently an other reviewer argues that the film only suggests that the particular love between the two represented men is tragic .I would like to agree with the original reviewers ' rebuttal to this argument .A film can argue that two ' particular ' people are in fact representative of a ' general ' phenomenon by celebrating , aggrandizing , making aesthetic , the stories of two ' general ' , unparticular people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
