{"text": "Cos , even if you look like a Rasputin and talk like a Vajpayee , she 's going to pick watching you over the flick .Yes , if you needed a movie with ample conversation time throughout , and just a whiff of a hint of a pint of humor , it would be Sandwich .If you thought the movie was a comedy , perish the thought - the movie is a joke .Not that there are n't some laughable moments .When Govinda goes \" bhanda bachalo \" , in his inimitable style , he rings some nostalgic bells of the days when ribs used to tickle and sides used to split .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And when it is , it 's so loud , that sides split all right ... the sides of your eardrums .The comic one - liners sometimes ( read mostly ) try too hard to be funny , while of the ones that fell flat , you can tell that there just was n't any imagination .In this 3-hour movie , it would be your responsibility to keep your date entertained for two - and - a - half .And here 's all that it puts you through .Sher Singh aka Shekhar ( Govinda ) wakes up one morning and finds himself married to two women .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , you just take a Bollywood movie , add a Govinda , and hey presto ... anything is possible .One wife , Sweety ( Mahima ) , he keeps in his village , while he lives with the other one , Nisha ( Raveena ) , in Mumbai .Fast forward through a song and a dance in which both the girls ' mothers get to exhibit their motherly love to the newborns and watch them grow up a bit .You 've become an uncle , and have aged 7 years .Fed up with the separate existence , Sweety , with mom - in - law ( Reema Lagoo ) and kid Tony in tow , lands up in Mumbai to pep things up for the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Think life is too simple so far ?Wait , for it gets more so .The children find there is something amiss , and begin to suspect that their fathers are the same .The suspicion rubs off on the mothers as well , and they begin to ask questions .Shekhar / Sher Singh do as good a job of dissolving these suspicions as any ... after all , they have Govinda to back them up .But it all goes awry when Govinda in the role of Sher Singh meets another Govinda , the fake real husband of Nisha .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I mean , no one goes to a Govinda movie to dwelve on the story .It 's more like gimme my slapsticks , and I 'm outta here .More of his one - liners fall flat on their faces rather than not .That said , there is surely a lot of action left in the man .Raveena plays an overtly suspicious wife / lover , a role she is not natural in .However , she can carry off some bits of comedy well , and manages to do so .Mahima plays a gharelu Sweety , who has to quickly adapt to modernity in the city , yet keep the rural outlook .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The acting of the other sidekicks and villains is up to the low standards set by the script .Had the one - liners been more imaginative , the medley could have been thoroughly enjoyable .As it stands , the movie seems to have fallen as flat as most of its one - liners have .Your comments will be accepted once you give your email , and will be deleted if the email is not authenticated within 24 hours .\u00a9 Copyright 1999 - 2009 LRR Technologies ( Hyderabad ) , Pvt Ltd.All rights reserved .fullhyd , fullhyderabad , Welcome To The Neighbourhood are trademarks of LRR Technologies ( Hyderabad ) Pvt Ltd.", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
