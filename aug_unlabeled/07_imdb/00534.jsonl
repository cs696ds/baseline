{"text": "One of the key questions when we come into any scene is this : when is it happening ?Movies and prose handle this in different ways .Suppose your story features a man who 's refurbishing a derelict bar .In a movie , it 's shown with a sequence of scenes .In one , he is getting to work , pulling old cupboards off the walls and uprooting obsolete appliances .In the next scene , it 's clean , the floorboards are sanded and he 's opening for business .Because film is an external storytelling medium ( we watch it from the outside ) we accept that this cut is telling us several days or weeks have passed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But in prose , a cut like this might feel too abrupt .Because prose is internal , and we walk in the characters ' shoes , a sudden jump in time can feel like too much of a lurch .We need a linking sentence or two to ease the way , drawing attention to what 's changed .Many writers who are weaned on movies leave these details out .A sense of time .As well as evidence that time has passed , we also need a sense of it passing .If you have other characters or storylines , you can cut away to them , then return to your bar , which is now finished .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But if your story follows just one character , you need to create the passage of time in your narration .If we watch a movie we 'll do this ourselves .We 'll assume the character spent a week or a month working on the bar non stop .In prose , we need you to add this element , even if it 's only two lines , saying ' I had no time to worry about anything .I was sanding , sawing , painting , ordering crockery .I flopped into bed at night and rose with the dawn .

{"text": "If so , you 'll certainly know some great storytelling tricks , but the two disciplines are different .Some movie techniques simply do n't translate to the page .Indeed , if you 're writing your novel as though it 's a movie in your head , your ideas might not work as powerfully as they should .Film is a visual medium .And so the actors ' moves , the camera angles and the emphasis of the lighting are telling the story just as much as any words the characters are uttering .Indeed , you could probably watch a well - made dialogue scene with the sound off and still understand the thrust of it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On the page , however , the prose does everything .But what I often find with writers who are tuned to the screen is that they do n't realise how much more work a dialogue scene in prose has to do .They have n't got actors , or a lighting crew , or a set designer , or a composer who will add the other pieces to take the story forward .They 're good at getting their characters talking , and sounding natural , but their dialogue scenes lack half the information they need to move the story on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "When using inconsequential chat , social niceties and companionable remarks , keep it concise , or find a way to make it purposeful .Internal reactions The screenplay - tuned writer often does n't use internal dialogue , because an actor would add the expressions .Also , most films show a story from a third - person point of view .But in prose you can show what a character thinks and feels .Either you can do this with a close third - person point of view , or a first - person point of view , or by showing reactions through a physical act like clenching a fist .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Silence , pauses and non - verbals Remember we see dialogue as well as hear it - do n't forget to include the characters ' reactions and non - verbal responses in your scene .Use your narration to create pauses .Make them sigh , look out of the window .Let them change their expression .Prose is your background music Take charge of the scene 's environment .Create atmosphere through your description of the setting .A dripping tap in a moment of silence might increase a sense of tension .Rain might echo a character 's sadness or make a happy moment seem deliriously unreal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Perhaps your themes have changed and this is why the novel is looking too sprawling .Has it suddenly become a novel about ' everything ' ?Sometimes you get more coherence by diving into the first draft regardless .If you have a scene order that makes rough sense but is n't perfect , start writing anyway .See what happens once you live as the characters and let them inhabit the book .You might find their experience fills those gaps and confirms your hunch on a level you could n't get by analysis .Or you might see modifications you can make - rewrite cards , shuffle them if necessary , adjust your map as you go .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But novel - writing has its own laws of physics , as every medium does .Here are three techniques that work well in movie storytelling but not in prose .1 Scenes with a lot of characters at once .In a movie you can put as many people as you like in a scene - because we can see them .But in a novel , that 's hard to manage .You have to keep them alive in the action and so you are constantly reminding the reader that they are there - fidgeting , scratching their nose or fiddling with their cup of tea .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some writers make it policy never to have more than three people in a scene .Others say it should only be two .One of my ghosting projects was an adventure series with five main characters .I split them into pairs as much as possible .It led to more intimate scenes , with better conflicts and development .Sometimes , an ensemble scene is unavoidable - in which case it 's better to put it late on when the reader is well acquainted with the characters and what matters to them .Probably the most disastrous place to put an ensemble scene is at the opening .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I know it only too well .I 've seen so many novels begin with a large bunch of characters chit - chatting and revealing snippets about themselves and their world through oblique dialogue - and instead creating a confusing mess .Yes , I confess I came out of Reservoir Dogs wanting to whack more panache into my writing .But its opening does n't work in a novel .2 Short scenes that chop around a lot .Another filmic technique that I see mistakenly applied to novels is short scenes that jump around .In fact , I 'm guilty of this myself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I saw it all in my head and wrote very short scenes that intercut - the hostages , then the friends watching with bated breath , then back to the hostage .It was pacy and tense .But when I revised it I realized it was a nightmare to read - because I 'd written a screenplay , not a novel .In a novel the reader has to load each scene in their head - where it is , who 's there , what they 're doing .All the things that come over at a glance on a movie screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In a novel , if you do it too much it becomes irritating .Think of it as like trying to access a web page on old - fashioned dial - up .If you chop around scenes , the reload time is longer .3 Point of view .In a film , the audience is a passive observer seeing from the outside .The camera acts as a narrator , drawing our attention to things .It can show us things outside the characters ' usual point of view - perhaps warning that the heroine has left her phone on the kitchen table .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If what you 're doing with your novel is writing a description of the movie on the page - .a - the scenes might not work as you expect , and .b - you 're missing most of what prose can deliver .Yes , in the novel you have only words , one after the other .This makes movies - with music and visuals - like broadband and the novel like dial - up - you ca n't have too many streams of input at one time .But these limitations do n't make the novel inferior .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Quite the opposite .Novels go deeper than films ; they are less literal too .A novel about scientists trying to control the weather , for example , can also make you feel it 's about humanity wrestling with randomness in their lives .Novels set the story going inside you rather than show it to you finished .This makes prose an incredibly powerful medium .Novels can take you right inside what people are feeling in a way that movies ca n't .I prefer that , which is why prose is my favourite storytelling medium .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
