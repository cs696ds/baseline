{"text": "Here , in You , The Living , Andersson takes his notions of the ridiculous beyond the traditional bounds of reality - presenting us with hallucinations from vacant souls , who struggle to find ' meaning ' in the despairing silence of the everyday .To map out a pr\u00e9cis here however would be futile .For the filmmaker does not construct a traditional three - act narrative form , but rather weaves us into his story through emotional impulses .As such , all of the characters are ' connected ' , but unlike hegemonic movies , the players here are drawn together by their pessimistic outlook on life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For those of you who feel that I may have just given away a vital plot point , rest assured .Unlike Sirk however , this filmmaker does n't mask his morbid outlook in subtext .These aesthetic choices imbue the piece with a dreamlike quality - one that is as much a nightmare , as it is a lurid fantasy .Besides its gloomy exterior , You , The Living is laced with some very funny instances .Old - fashioned physical gags are interspersed with inventive comic interludes .The most inspired of these examples involves a van driver , who while attempting a traditional cloth pulling technique finds himself unraveling a posh dinner party , ruining a series of antique china pieces .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In an ingenious turn of events , Andersson executes these moments in a series of slow motion deadpan scenes , which left me hurling with uncontrollable laughter .Another hilarious slice of comedy finds a disgruntled hairdresser reshaping an influential businessman 's head into a pseudo - Mohawk before an important meeting .When confronted by the fuming victim , the barber responds quietly : \" take it easy \" , explaining that a domestic tiff with his wife left him agitated , and unable to cut his hair in the manner requested .But despite his penchant for comedy , Andersson 's film boils with a potent political undertone , which raises existential queries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
