{"text": "The Movie that Haunted Coen Brothers . 'Big ' writers generally avoid writing about movies , or , at any rate , writing seriously about them .Part of the reason is that for a big writer ( or a would be big writer ) , there is always the immortality thing to consider , which is as natural and understandable as any other quest by human beings .Immortality in some form has , of course , been one of the holy grails of human history and civilization .Writing about such things as movies might affect their chances .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Movies , ' the art form of the ( twentieth ) century ' , even the best movies , are still not fully accepted as belonging to the the haloed territory of High Art .An unfortunate consequence of this is that it is hard to find what great writers have written about movies in general and about specific movies .Some might say that there have n't been all that many really great writers in recent times , but that is a risky territory for me to go into .Obviously the above consideration does n't apply to every great writer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But then the evidence seems to suggest that he was n't exactly planning on becoming a great writer , at least not in the way Beckett was .He had other things on his mind .This unexpectedly makes me add here that avoiding politics by ambitious writers is more often than not because of the immortality factor .Mark Twain is another example ( in the category of Orwell , not Beckett ) .Is it just a coincidence that both had politics in their writing ?I mean explicitly : Everyone has politics at least implicitly , whether they like it or not .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie made such an impression on her mind that she does n't now remember who she saw it with .Some of the images have haunted her ever since , she says , especially the famous ' underwater Shelly Winters ' scene ' in her aspect of wrecked mermaid ' , which has made ' several disguised appearances ' in her own writing .Since then I have come across many others , writing that this particular scene haunted them and it 's easy to see why .In my opinion , though , this scene is just one of the minor things that make this movie great .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To digress a little , I think it is quite wrong to see them as anything other than Hollywood .They represent the best of the mainstream Hollywood .None of their movies strays too far from the Hollywood style .But that is not necessarily a failing .As I said , they represent the best in this tradition .And they do push the boundaries .I have been meaning to write about them and the Charles Laughton movie ever since I saw one of their movies after The Night of the Hunter ( let 's make an acronym to save my labour : TNOTH ) , though I had seen two or three earlier .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I ca n't really say that I am a fan of their movies , but I do like most of them , to varying degrees , like everyone else I guess .But here I am not going to review their movies or even TNOTH .It just gives me pleasure to point out some interesting facts which might be relevant for reviewers of their movies .I had once somewhere read about a few people having influenced them , as is usual in biographies , even very brief ones .And I have also read about specific influences on their movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So let me mention a few of the readily observable of such influences .I said the movie has haunted them and it is based on the way images and motifs from TNOTH repeatedly occur in their moves .Their first movie that I remember seeing was Miller 's Crossing .I have since seen it again and it is one of my least favourite of their movies .And it is the only one of their movies for which I ca n't recall any example of image or motif from TNOTH .This might be partly because I have n't thought much about Miller 's Crossing , as I have in the case of other movies by them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No County for Old Men .Apart from the fact that the movie is set in the West , it is about a serial killer who is almost supernaturally good at hunting people ( down ) .He is a ruthless and cold blooded killer , but he has his own code of conduct , his ' principles ' .Somewhat like Harry Powell , the preacher in TNOTH , although there are differences .And both are hunting for money , which is easy to forget in all their killing .Still , in both the cases it is not very clear what is their primary consideration : money , the violence ( which is often shown to be the primary and sole motive for psychopaths : by shallower story tellers ) or their ' principles ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One meets his nemesis , while there is just a slight hint of redemption for the other , even though the young woman has to die for that .Both movies have a long segment involving the ' hunt ' .Raising Arizona .What I wrote above for No Country for Old Men is also true of Raising Arizona , except that , since this was a comedy , all similarities are passed through a comic filter .Just like in the other two movies , here also the killer - hunter seems to be ' more a force of nature ' ( a comment the directors made about the actor who played the role in this movie ) than a real human being .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now I might have something more to say about these things , but here I intend to perform duties nearer to accounting than to criticism .You could say that I am doing this on behalf of Charles Laughton , the great actor , who only made one movie because this one movie , which he rightly believed to be very deserving , was n't received well at all at that time .May be I am doing it just to show off , but I like the first idea better .By the way , a week or two ago I saw the list of top ten all time favourite movies of Fassbinder ( excluding his own ) and what do I find ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I had a vague feeling that Fassbinder too ( in some indirect way ) was influenced by this movie , but I actually thought that I was going too far and probably finding imaginary influences .On second thoughts , it 's not so surprising , because the Brechtian thread connects them , if nothing else .Getting back to the movie under consideration , here also the killer - bounty - hunter has his own icons .In TNOTH he had the LOVE and HATE tattoos on the fingers ( another favourite and frequently copied image from the movie ) and his trademark knife ( recall Brecht 's Mack the Knife , Brecht being associated closely at one time with Charles Laughton ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And he has his coin that has been travelling for a long time .In Raising Arizona , he has several such icons strapped on to him and his bike , including one that says ( if I remember correctly ) ' Mama did n't love me ' .Even this comic character has supernatural tracking skills .There can be another take on the supernatural tracking - hunting skills .No real individual can plausibly have such skills .But a large organisation or institution or syndicate ( I just saw Love is Colder than Death ) or ' agency ' can .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Or , to put it better , The System can .As in , for example , Burn After Reading .It would be a piece of cake , even with more than one to be tracked .And even with clueless individuals involved in the tracking .There is always an army of bishops , knights , rooks - and pawns - acting like remote controlled drones with wills of their own , which have nevertheless been trained to do the bidding of their handlers .Not to mention the latest technology of the day and the latest Mythology of Fear and the old old Ideology of Domination .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": ", this young girl who has become infatuated with the preacher , drops what she was doing and cries out excitedly to Rachel Cooper , ' The Man ! , The Man ! 'The Man is the other take .O Brother Where Art Thou .The underwater scene makes an appearance here too , though there is no corpse as far as we can see .But there must be a few in the background , given the previous scene .Talking of the previous scene , there is , yet again , the motif of the tracker - hunter with almost supernatural capabilities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He is supposed to be from Cool Hand Luke , but that one was n't shown to be an uncannily good tracker .He only looked similar and supervised a chain gang .Fargo .I had to think a little for this one .It might not be so obvious , but it 's there .The pregnant policewoman who tracks down the killers ( yes , the tracking thing is present here too ) , one already fed to a grinder by the other , can be seen as reference to Rachel Cooper .The latter was old , the former is pregnant .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Both , in fact , seem vulnerable , but they manage to do what they should .They are no Lara Croft .The Man Who Was n't There .The underwater corpse is present here .With the car .Inside the car .Drowned with the car after being murdered .But the murderer in this case is not a psycho serial killer , but a very plausible real person , who cons everyone and is well liked and admired .The protagonist 's wife is having an affair with him .And he is not even a habitual murderer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Three extra points from me to Coen Brothers .The Hudsucker Proxy .Margaret Atwood mentioned Harry Powell as a man ' embraced by society , then torn apart by it ' .This applies to the protagonist of The Hudsucker Proxy too .There is even the more specific motif of this sacrificial character being chased by a lynch mob , just as the mob goes after Harry Powell at the end of the TNOTH .And the mob consists of the same people who had earlier built him up , directly or indirectly .The Big Lebowski .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "People reviewing this movie always mention the mysterious cowboy ( ' The Stranger ' ) at the end who has a brief chat with Lebowski .Who is he ?This is what I think : He is the grown up John Harper from TNOTH .Of course , there is some artistic license here regarding the age etc . , but he ca n't be anyone else .And Rachel Cooper at the end of TNOTH said about children , ' They abide .They abide and they endure . ' , also to the camera .The tone used is the same in both the cases .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He seems to have learnt well from her and was really saved after all .He even seems to like adopting orphans , in a manner of speaking .It 's almost as if the Coen Brothers are finally trying to exorcise the TNOTH ghost , which has been haunting them for such a long time .Margaret Atwood , in her article , also wondered what would John become when he grew up : .Perhaps he will grow up to become a robber .Or perhaps , as his name suggests , a singer of bloodspattered sagas and the author of apocalyptic revelations ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So this story seems to have a happy ending .But it could have ended differently .What if John Harper had been taken away by Harry Powell and been made his apprentice or if Rachel Cooper had not found him at all ?Well , then , he could have become what we get in Raising Arizona .The choice of Coen Brothers has a significance also because , as I mentioned earlier , they are quintessential Hollywood directors , no avant garde or nouvelle vague etc . .2 Responses .Advertised as the \" original revenge film , \" Walking Tall is a ' 70s classic that I 'm not sure would appeal to today 's audience even though there seems to be a resurgence in the popularity of heroes in revenge films with films like Taken .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This review covers the ' 70s theatrical films that have been released as a trilogy in a single package .When Walking Tall was originally released in 1973 , I was only eleven years old , but for some reason , I have a strong memory of this film 's impact .The movie was R - rated , so neither I nor any of my friends nor even my older brother saw the movie in the theatre on its initial release .Perhaps it played at the drive - in , but I do n't recall seeing it then .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The ending title scroll of the film says that the film is a fictionalized account of Buford Pusser 's life , but I understand that he actually did carry a big stick around with him for a while .I have always associated this with an adage attributed to American President Theodore Roosevelt : \" Speak softly and carry a big stick , you will go far . \" Supposedly a West African proverb , the word \" speak \" has occasionally been replaced with \" walk , \" and the adage shortened by omitting the understood \" you will go far \" part .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Since the story does take place in a modern age , you can imagine a big stick will only get you so far , and Pusser eventually has to resort to using firearms especially when he gets himself elected Sheriff .While watching how Pusser learns the rules of being an official lawman , you have to wonder how many elected officials do mess up during their learning period .In the beginning , Pusser seems pretty ignorant in that he does n't even know that you need a search warrant !I would hope the filmmakers are taking poetic license in this case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It did precede Death Wish by a year , so it may have inspired a spate of other revenge films .But many Asian films have revenge as the main theme with a training montage involved to show how the hero becomes powerful enough to exact revenge .( Buford Pusser was a former wrestler , so Walking Tall dispenses with showing Pusser training , but we do get to see Pusser creating his big stick . )And I believe many previous films including Westerns have used the stock plot of a villain killing a family , but overlooking a child who later grows up to seek revenge .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As for the brawls , I do n't think I recognized too many wrestling moves used by Pusser .I think his size is his main advantage .He does seem to be lucky beyond the stretch of imagination , but at least he does get injured .The car chases are your standard Dukes of Hazzard fare .I saw an edited version of Walking Tall on television in the 80s , I think .Seeing it again after all these years , I ca n't say I was bored at any time even though there are really no outstanding scenes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is surprising since the film clocks in at just over two hours .Actually , one scene did seem unusual .Pusser 's son ( Leif Garrett , later to become a teen heart - throb ) , who must be like 12 years old , carries a rifle into the hospital to see his dad .Everyone just feels pity as they witness the son visiting his dad .Apparently , it was okay for kids to bear firearms back then .Maybe it still is in Tennessee .The success of Walking Tall resulted in a sequel , strangely titled , Part 2 : Walking Tall .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For some reason that is not readily available , Joe Don Baker passed on the opportunity to reprise his role .Then the real - life Buford Pusser was offered the role .( Apparently , the producers did n't think acting ability was required . )He accepted , but then died in an auto accident that some people suspected was a result of foul play .Eventually , Bo Svenson , an ex - Marine , took over the role of Buford Pusser for the second and third films .He had been a judo champion in the U.S. Armed Forces .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Before being cast , he was a Ph.D. candidate in meta - physics at UCLA !After release of the second film , some people thought he was a \" most promising actor .\"Recently , Quentin Tarantino seems interested in reviving his career .In Part 2 Walking Tall , Buford Pusser has to deal with hitmen since the local villains failed to \" get him out of the picture \" in the first film .Unusually , one of the hitmen is a race - car driver who kills people by running them off the road .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The scriptwriter is obviously trying to find ways to corrupt our hero .Along with The Walking Tall Trilogy , I was sent a recent Hong Kong film called Accident .That film involves hitmen killing people by staging elaborate accidents .In my review of that film , I mentioned that the paranoid protagonist used a leaf in order to tell if someone had opened his door .In order to determine if someone has tampered with his car under the hood , Pusser uses a piece of transparent tape applied to where the hood meets the body of the car .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have a preference for Joe Don Baker as Buford Pusser , because he seemed to me to be more unbalanced and therefore more charismatic .Pusser was injured drastically in the first film , and seemed more vulnerable .Even though Part 2 : Walking Tall was n't as popular as the original and its ending seemed to indicate that a trilogy was n't planned , someone must have thought there was still money to be made .Since making the second film with a parental guidance rating had n't increased the box - office , the third film returned to the original 's restricted rating .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With Final Chapter : Walking Tall , Buford Pusser deals with a child - beater , juvenile delinquents , police brutality , civil rights , election politics , obsolescence , financial problems , and helping an abused kid and a prostitute .This film also brings back the big stick , which was missing from the second film .There is one attempt at humour that is missing from the previous two films .What I found most interesting about this film is the post - modern twist it takes when it depicts the events of Buford Pusser 's life being made into a movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately , if you 've been paying attention , I 've already ruined the end of this film for you .Given that this film seems to be all over the place in terms of the topics tackled , one might think that it 's a mess , but I enjoyed it .Although the sequels were not as popular as the original , the Hollywood trade paper Variety ranks Part 2 : Walking Tall and Final Chapter : Walking Tall among the top fifty highest - earning , independently - produced films of all time .While the Walking Tall films are seen as inspirational films of an American hero who stood up for what he believed , the deaths of people close to Pusser illustrate the price one pays , and serve as sobering reminders for anyone who might want to emulate him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These films erase any doubts as to why superheroes need secret identities to protect their loved ones although surprisingly , all the villains Pusser encounters have the decency to not target his family .Most of the deaths simply occur due to botched attempts at Pusser 's life .Although the real - life Buford Pusser 's exploits started in the ' 60s , the Walking Tall films are reflective of the ' 70s when Watergate broke and corruption could be found at the highest level of government .The theme of \" one man standing up for what is right \" was already popular due to films like Dirty Harry and Billy Jack , both released two years earlier .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think because the filmmakers wanted to keep a semblance to Pusser 's real life , the plots of the sequels were constrained .Concerning the DVDs , I found it strange that there was no Chapter Selections option in the menu even though chapter stops exist .I really wish there was a subtitles option , because the Southern accents made it difficult for me to understand some dialog .There is a new documentary narrated by Joe Don Baker .Some cast members as well as members of Buford Pusser 's family appear onscreen as they are today .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I assume the filmmakers wanted to take more liberties with the plot .Coincidentally , two sequels were also made with another actor , Kevin Sorbo , in the lead role although playing a different character .I 've not seen any of these films , but I am curious as to how they compare with the originals .If someday you find yourself in Tennessee , be sure to check out the Buford Pusser Home and Museum .I wonder if you can buy a replica of his big stick . -Reed .Individual Scores : Walking Tall : Part 2 Walking Tall : Final Chapter Walking Tall : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
