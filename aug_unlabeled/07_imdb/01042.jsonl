{"text": "Well , ca n't say I 'm surprised .When I did n't see it return after the baseball playoffs and World Series were all done I kind of figured it was gone for good .Figures though , it was just starting to find it 's footing so of course Fox had to yank it before it can find an audience .This sucks .I can deal with Kitchen Confidential 's demise , i have n't really had that long to get attached as they only got to air 3 episodes , but Arrested Development ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maybe some other network can take Arrested Development , its 4mil viewers are n't much on FOX , but try FX or UPN or anywhere .This sucks .Damn , according to Variety AD 's ep order was cut from 22 to 13 ! !My gut was telling me , but my gut was also very .... no , i ca n't even finish my reference now , i am to upset / mad .First they kill one of my favorite characters on Lost last night , and now they just about kill AD , i am waiting for the announcement that the world is ending any second now .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Think it 's in one of the outtakes in season 2 where Tobias has a rant about how when a show is critically acclaimed and wins loads of awards , maybe the fault lies with the network , and not the showrunners .Sad news about Kitchen Confidential , but if Arrested Development is facing the chop the KC really does nt stand a chance .Maybe now we might see Will in Alias one day again .So the only shows i have left now are HIMYM , Lost , Alias , and CSI , and only 1 of those is a comedy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And if this does turn out to be Alias ' last season , and then whenever Scrubs does return this is supposed to be its last season also , so next season i will have a whopping 3 shows : HIMYM , Lost , and CSI .At least i know that CSI and Lost are same from any of this cancellation nonsense .This is off topic for Whedon site but I think a campaign to the WB or UPN to pick up Arrested Development is in order .Its by far a much better comedy than any of their other shows .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm hoping he gets a part on the SciFI movie of the Dresden Files .I wrote to them suggesting he be considered .I ca n't entirely blame FOX , though I would like to .HIMYM is getting nominated for a People 's choice award which kind of gives a clue as to what kind of TV people are watching .This is in no way a knock on that show , yea for them , but it does have a rather formulaic premise and delivery ... .I think it 's just that the masses are n't really looking for something at all different from the ' norm . '", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Both AD and KC tried NOT to be a typical sitcom and look where it got them .:( I 'm sad for both shows .Agree with Grace about HIMYM being rather formulaic .I ca n't seem to stomach it .AH is certainly cute , but all the characters have been done to death and I just do n't find anything with a laugh track funny .Also sad about Arrested Development since it 's one of my favorite shows .But I kind of expected it .Hopefully , somebody else can pick it up , it sure seems like a good candidate to me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Regarding the Lost situation .I 'm totally with you on my anger for the demise of my favourite character in the show , which is why I created a thread entirely dedicated to it on Whedonesque.org .Its unsuprisingly not under the heading \" Thankyou Lost producers for all you have done \" but actually under \" NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO !\" You ca nt miss it .Join us in fully venting your anger .R.E. AD and KC .I love AD .Its my favourite comedy programme after Nighty Night , and surely is the most original thing on TV at the moment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thankyou Fox yet again .They currently have beaten the WB to the post as my \" Least Favourite Network Ever ! \" Congratu - bloody - lations .But who cares about that lol , and really , I 'll miss you Kitchen Confidential , we had a little over an hour of good times .The slow death of Arrested Development however hurts bad , especially after showing two brilliant episodes in a row after a fairly long haitus .Arrested Development is imo the most brilliant comedy / sitcomish show ever , better than Seinfeld , much better than Friends .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I highly doubt we 'll see the rest of those 13 episodes before the DVDs .Hey , maybe , um , some invisitext for them there Lost spoilers ?I just started the first season , and while I now know that a character died , I did n't read any farther , so I do n't know whom it pertains to , but still .Remember , people ... spoilers are for squares ... .Anyway , sad to hear that about Kitchen Confidential , but I knew from the beginning this was bound to happen , especially considering it was airing on Fox .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Arrested Development is the funniest sitcom since ... since ... since ...I do n't know any sitcom that is actually funnier than AD .Well , no American sitcom anyway .Those cunning Brits have been genuinely funny on occasion .Fox sucks .But who I am telling that ?This is the site with five million posts on the subject of Firefly after all .I think that KC 's first ep .was good but the next two were just not funny .The B plot lines were much funnier then the main plot lines .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was predictable how he was gon na die and it wasted Laroquette 's talents .The story with the Nick buying the young chef for a hot dog from the dishwaser got me to laugh but that was it .With that said i was very much looking forward to seeing it improve and especially with Vartan making a guest appearance as I 'm sure there would have been some Alias references thrown in .The show had potential and it did nt help with a lead in like AD that was already hurting for ratings .I 'm not suprised that AD is getting cut short .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Granted AD IMO is the funniest show since Cheers ( oh how i loved Cheers ) .I hope they still bring it back next year and keep it with 13 episodes and run them uninterrupted til American Idol comes on .AD will never get many fans cause its a show not like other sitcoms , if you miss an episode you miss alot .I also noticed that more online fans hate laugh tracks then those that i come across at like work or the gym .I do nt like laugh tracks myself but some of the greatest sitcoms ever all had laugh tracks Seinfeld , Friends , Cheers , Raymond , Cosby etc .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now the lead is not funny and comes across as very annoying and desperate .I 'm so cynical about FOX that I 'm just not surprised .Poor Wonderfalls , poor Kitchen Confidential , so many shows never given time to find their feet .Grrr , Argh .Arrested Development won an Emmy , you stupid network gits .Do n't cancel it !I do tend to think that Arrested Development has had plenty of time to prove itself now .For once , Fox has played fair and given a show some breathing space to improve it 's ratings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fair enough , from a business point of view .However , it 's treatment of Kitchen Confidential is the standard \" if it is n't a winner in the first week then it never will be \" kind of thinking that cost us a proper run of Firefly .Typical Fox , in other words .I agree that AD has been given many chances to prove itself , which is why I 'm not angry or surprised .Frankly , I 'm shocked it had anything a third season , and the only thing I feel right now is resigned .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Or that the major networks are the worst places for good TV .If Buffy : tVS or Angel : tS had been on any of the major 4 networks , the former would 've been gone after the abortive first season , and the latter would not exist .The treatment of Firefly is not asymptomatic of FOX 's pathology : great quality shows , trigger - happy cancellation finger , and great DVD sales .Both shows , Firefly and AD deserve a format somewhere .AD is a great dvd seller .Its first season has been out for a year and it 's still in Amazon 's overall top hundred and in the top twenties of dvd sales .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "AD is n't half as unprofitable as its Nielsen ratings make it look , because it has found its audience , which is n't too well - represented in the Nielsens , but obviously are affluent enough to afford buying the dvds by bucketloads .If FOX sticks with it , it could become profitable enough in the future to make up for its not - so - great current ad rates .From what I understand the main problem is the way Fox has it 's various companies seperated .While Arrested Development may be making Fox a lot of money on DVD , the money goes to the production side of Fox not the network sides of things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unless the sales are huge like the case was apparently with Family Guy , the two sides do n't seem to work together .Fox needs to re - organize their branches to work out a business model so that they do n't cancel shows that they are making money off of .Also with iTunes video really taking off , selling a million videos in just 20 days ( this is with very limited selection of videos and only available in the US ) hopefully it wo n't be long until the business model of tv changes even more .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "More formula and generic type shows do n't generate these types of loyal followings as while they might get good ratings , they are very disposable to most of their audience .Unfortunately tv networks are n't exactly known to adapt quickly and it might still be a few more years before things really change .Bringing this back to a whedonesque topic , if the Spike movie does become a direct - to - DVD movie and is a big success it could be one of the things that shakes things up a bit , as that could be another way to go .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unless the show moves network , it wo n't survive .Mind you , more importantly it needs to find an audience .Add chickens !And monkeys !I love AD and KC was really starting to hit it 's stride .Gunn 2 N 's , I had the opposite reaction to KC -- I thought the pilot was just eh , while the last two eps have been actually lively and funny .John Larroquette 's character showed up announcing he was dying -- the typical lame sitcom plot would 've kept him alive and turned his life around with the help of his friends and healthy eating !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
