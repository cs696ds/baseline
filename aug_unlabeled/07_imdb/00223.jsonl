{"text": "Yes , there is a difference between neglect and \" I do n't care \" , and a historical building that might be decaying , yet has character .Here in Philly , the city really does do an amazing job in keeping our history intact .Unfortunately that takes money , so sometimes a building will sit for awhile until they can get to it .But even so , I can still see the beauty within .I think that 's why Dad 's Honor Flight touched me so .... it was commemorating a generation that is most definitely aging ( sometimes not very gracefully ) and reinforcing just how amazing and beautiful they are .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes !Yes !And that 's why your beautiful post brought tears to my eyes when I read it .The honor commemorating a generation and reinforcing just how amazingly beautiful and VALUED they are !Truly , that was such a wonderful post !There 's a fine line between urban decay and urban blight , and I think you 've captured the essence of the former beautifully .I love these shots and agree with you that there is beauty within .Maybe nobody buys a wedding dress from Pauline 's anymore , but there are stories contained within those weathered walls , and your camera allows us to ponder them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Great photos Ron .And you 're right about people too .Take , oh , I do n't know , picking someone at random , Audrey Hepburn ; even if you 'd never seen a youthful picture of her , you 'd still be able to see her luminous beauty in later photos .Nice post .Have a groovy weekend .Dale , you are sooooooo right !And thank you so much for sharing that because it 's a PERFECT example of what I mean with this post .Even in later photos , and even when she was ill , you could STILL see the beauty emanating from her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I for one have always held our elderly in high regard and in much respect .I have also always preferred older architecture to new .Like you said , there is a reverence within them - a history and a story .And if we look and listen , we can see and hear it .That is how the UK was , when I was growing up .You would get young boys helping the elderly across the street .You never sat down and let anyone over a certain age stand !Those values have completely disappeared now .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , Babs , as well as when I was growing up .My mother was HUGE about teaching us to respect our elders .In fact , she smoked , but knew that her mother did n't approve of it .So she would NEVER smoke around her mother - even when she got older .what a wonderful post Ron and so true , there is beauty in that decay if we only look beneath the surface .I 've seen some beautiful buildings going down over the years , imploded , trashed ... all in the name of \" progress \" making room for a modern \" box \" to take it 's place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "LOVE every photo , especially the lady at the food court .I 've seen some beautiful buildings going down over the years , imploded , trashed ... all in the name of \" progress \" making room for a modern \" box \" to take it 's place .Efficient but sad and boring at the same time .Exactly .... a modern \" box \" to take it 's place !Philadelphia does an excellent job in keeping and restoring most of our older , historical buildings .But it takes money , so sometimes the buildings sit for years until they get the funding .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ron , I love when you share these deep , thought - provoking posts .I enjoy reading how you look at things in a certain perspective , which causes me to see them differently .These photos are so beautiful .I took my time looking at them and could really see the beauty in them .The seventh photo down , although decaying , you can see the beautiful architecture still present , peeking through .And I love that last photo of the elderly lady sitting in the food court because regardless of her age , she really is beautiful and colorful !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "OMG , we are SO the same person !I asked my sister if she would drive with me through East Cleveland , which is total ghetto , but which used to be so grand .I wanted to photograph it !My father taught me to find the beauty .I remember one time we were driving out in the country and I passed by an old barn that was falling apart .I slowed down and he looked at me and nodded his head .We turned around and he took a photo ( cuz he always had a camera with him ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My mother , in the meantime , was in the backseat yelling because we were taking a picture of a crappy old barn .Love these photos !And the sweet old lady , too .The seventh photo down , although decaying , you can see the beautiful architecture still present , peeking through .Z \" .Funny you mentioned that one because it was actually the last photo I took for this series .I spotted that building down in Old City one day and I had to snap a photo of it .It sits between two newer buildings , so it really sticks out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Is n't the lady in food court adorable ?I wanted to HUG her .Love the hat and the striped socks !I would rather be with our elderly than people my own age because they have the wisdom and knowledge we do n't yet have .I felt the same way when I was much younger , but still feel the same way now - wisdom and knowledge .Thanks so much for stopping by , buddy .Wishing you a safe and happy holiday weekend as well !Yes , we have quite a few areas like that in Philly ( such as Germantown ) which at one time was exquisite , but eventually turned into what looks like war zone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My father taught me to find the beauty ...... we turned around and he took a photo ( cuz he always had a camera with him ) .He ended up painting it from the photo .This is lovely , Ron .I 'd never really thought to compare urban decay to old age , but you 're right .Every stage in life is beautiful -- it 's just how we view things that might not be so !Part of me really wanted to fix up those old buildings ( if nothing else , for safety 's sake ! ) , but just because they 're showing signs of age does n't mean they 're not still useful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thank you for pointing out another perspective .Every stage in life is beautiful -- it 's just how we view things that might not be so !You 're spot on about that .Every stage of like is beautiful - it 's just how we look at it .All my life though , I 've always seen age as something incredibly beautiful .I remember telling my mother that I could n't wait to get older and she laughed because I was only 14 years old at the time - HA !Part of me really wanted to fix up those old buildings ( if nothing else , for safety 's sake ! )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But no one is permitted to go inside them until they are restored .The thing I really love about Philly is that when they eventually restore an old building , they keep everything on the outside the same ( to preserve the look ) , but redo inside .Thanks so much for stopping by , dear lady .Wishing you a beautiful holiday weekend !Not sure how much I like urban decay , but shabby chic is pretty cool .;) I get what you 're saying though and do like your comparison and how you see the beauty there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I like the second one , the one with the black windows and the one of the older woman .Cool socks she 's rockin ' there .Ron , my favorite thing to do is to come back and read everyone 's comment .It 's so interesting to read what people say and how they feel .You have such great readers here who take the time to share in depth comments .Thank you .You put into words something I 've struggled to put my finger on .It 's disturbed me since I returned home and I thought it was just me being edgy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "ignorance/ lack of information .We , --I conclude things and act on that conclusion .Sometimes in a very unloving way ...I did n't have that reaction with the gorgeous buildings and architecture .Note the windows ...Absolutely adored the photos , loved the bits worn and forever changed .Amazing .I could stand and wander the alley ways , never tiring of the affects of the aging .But the last photo carried the simple message that has haunted me all weekend .Aloneness takes center stage .And it 's not solitude , it 's aloneness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wonder if buildings get that same sense .I get that tug at my heart when I see emptiness , but I do n't feel the aloneness .We need to do so much more WITH each other .Saddens me .We renovate buildings and destroy people ..... .Mel , I so loved your comment because your truly understood the deep , deep message that I was conveying in this post , and THEN some .It 's hard to see someone / something devalued because of a narrow perception or ....ignorance/ lack of information .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You can look at these photos in so many different ways - as decay , emptiness , aloneness , or all of the above .And yes , it / they mirror the bittersweetness of humanness .I did n't see that last photo as being aloneness , but I can see how anyone could .I saw it / her as a BRIGHT spot in the food court .Even how the LIGHT from the skylight above ILLUMINATES her , I felt as though it was saying to me .... \"Look at how beautiful and colorful she is !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
