{"text": "Have I mentioned they 're stupid ?They follow the formulated clich\u00e9s , which could turn you off , but luckily the film saves it with over the top , gory deaths .Madman takes course over one dark night , which helps keep the story flowing at a good pace and I have to mention how well lit this movie is .The blue hues , mixed with the ambiance of howling wind and creaking wood floors , give the film a calm , but alarming feel to it .Overall , Madman is an underrated slasher , most likely due to its seemingly simple setup ... and hammy acting , but underneath that is a gory , interesting slasher flick with a lot to offer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Remember , it takes all kinds of critters ... to make Farmer Vincents fritters .Most horror films make ya scared of the dark , be it with mask wearing psychos , slime covered aliens , or zombie insurance salesmen .It takes a special kind of horror film to make you scared of the DAY , as Jaws does .Nothing screams \" summertime \" more than swimming on a crowded beach on a nice afternoon .In Jaws though , the screams of \" summertime \" quickly turn to \" SHARK ! \" as a man - eating beast from the deep makes a snack out o ' humans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
