{"text": "Considering that prohibition was repealed in 1933 , cults may have moved into speakeasys .Either way , a valuable reference .\"Oh brother where art thou \" is also a great reference and anything listed on The Great Depression ( TvTropes again ) page is well worthwhile .Depending on when in the 1930 's you 're talking , it will be littered with more or less rotting debris from the roaring twenties .For the right feel , Grim Fandango nails it spot on in the underwater chapter .Thanks . \"Oh Brother Where Art Thou \" is a good reference and I like the Steinbeck suggestions on that TV Tropes page .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
