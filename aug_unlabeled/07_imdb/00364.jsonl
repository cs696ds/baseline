{"text": "Pages .( Apologies to fans of \" Lost .\" If you have n't seen the new episode , beware : this post spoils some major plot points .Get on iTunes and spend the $ 1.99 it costs to catch up .If you do n't watch \" Lost , \" then you should .But read on anyway as I attempt to make this unknown show nonetheless entertaining for you . )I 'd like to think I 'm not often surprised .I guess that 's probably true , but when something does actually catch me unawares , I 'm happily put in my place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Part of a larger site promoting the work of author Gary Troup , this page explains a little about a book called The Valenzetti Equation .I honestly ca n't remember what I clicked to get here , but I gave it a once - over and left without looking at the rest of the site .Later , Spencer told me that the bookstore is now carrying a new book by Troup : Bad Twin .It took me a few seconds to realize that the author of this new book was the same as the one for the Valezetti Equation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "You might remember earlier post , \" I Love Television , But Television Does n't Love Me Back , \" in which I bemoaned the death of Shannon on \" Lost .\" I still maintain that Shannon was a worthwhile character , even though the show has managed to keep my interest in spite of her absence .Last night , in the final moments of the episode , the newly returned Michael - who has spend the bulk of this season lost in the jungle , looking for his missing son - betrayed his nice guy exterior and shot two regulars , presumably to death .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "If I 'm to believe my eyes and ears , Ana - Lucia is for sure a goner .The preview of the following episode shows a character saying \" She 's dead .\" If that were n't enough , TV Guide 's Mike Ausiello put a column online immediately after \" Two for the Road \" aired on the west coast .It explains that Michelle Rodriguez , who played Ana - Lucia , signed on for the role with the condition that she 'd only be on the set for a year or so .No one as yet is sure what has happened with poor Libby , played by Cynthia Watros .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" She 's an understated actress who I think is better suited to dramatic work than comic stuff , and I think I like her more and more every time I see her .Unfortunately , we viewers know next to nothing about her .While last night 's episode marked the second one to feature the pre - island life of Ana - Lucia , Libby has n't had a single flashback episode yet , so we know next to nothing about her .And to lose both Ana - Lucia and Libby - both of whom were introduced earlier this season to the show as survivors of the long - missing tail section of flight 815 - would seriously knock the show 's gender ratio out of whack .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Both Rodriguez and Watros were arrested near the show 's Hawaii set earlier in the year for drunk driving .Sometime later .By being shot .By the guy who played Mercutio in the Baz Luhrman \" Romeo + Juliet .\" Really , whatever keeps people sober behind the wheel , I suppose .In short , even me , a guy who follows the show very closely and occasionally peeks as spoilers was shocked by this twist .For a show to eliminate a major character like that - not during sweeps and not during a season finale , even - is daring .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
