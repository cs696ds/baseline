{"text": "The Muppets ' Wizard of Oz ( TV ) .100 min .ABC .Director : Kirk R Thatcher .Cast : Dave Goelz , Queen Latifah , Quentin Tarantino , David Alan Grier , Edward Hibbert .The Muppets have always had an interest in adapting classic stories .The \" Tales from Muppetland \" TV specials of the late ' 60s and early ' 70s included Hey Cinderella ! , The Frog Prince , and The Muppet Musicians of Bremen .1981 's The Muppets Go to the Movies featured movie parodies , and in the ' 80s Jim Henson dug deep for The Storyteller , with more realistic Muppets blending with human actors in fairy tales and Greek myths .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was fairly innocuous with celebrity interviews and ghostwritten columns in the style of Muppet characters , but photo features entrenched the idea of Muppet parodies .In 1984 , the first Muppet parody calendar was released , Treasures from the Kermitage Collection .Fine : here was a cute idea putting Muppets into classic paintings .But in 1995 ( five years after Henson 's death ) , a \" Muppet Parody Calendar \" was released .Though 1992 's The Muppet Christmas Carol and 1996 's Muppet Treasure Island were carrying the torch admirably under the circumstances , the trademark Muppet wit was becoming strained down to \" Muppet hip .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If an actual script surrounded these hip references , perhaps I 'd value them more - Pepe 's joke about playing Dark Side of the Moon along with the film is pretty funny .( In a glaring misstep , Uncle Henry refers to the Muppets as puppets , breaking the cardinal rule of Muppet realism . )After the lukewarm reaction to 1999 's Muppets in Space , the Jim Henson Company pitched its Muppet features to television , with an eye on home video .2002 saw varying results from the wan Kermit 's Swamp Years ( on Starz ) and the zesty but overeager It 's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie ( on NBC ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Certainly it was a mistake to try to remake The Wizard of Oz in a Muppet context , tempting as that may be .One day we 'll see a faithful remake of The Wizard of Oz ( and the rest of Baum 's books ) , but this is n't it .Setting the elephant aside , the telefilm has other problems : a weak script ( credited to Debra Frank , Steve L. Hayes , Adam F. Goldberg , and Tom Martin ) , horrible songs , and a story that makes a human the leading character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ashanti plays Dorothy Gale , whose daydream music video \" Kansas \" opens the film ( \" Sometimes you got ta get out of Kansas / And sometimes you got ta take your chances ... \" ) .Dorothy works in a diner run by her Aunt Em ( Oscar - winning Queen Latifah , self consciously doing children 's movie acting ) and Uncle Henry ( David Alan Grier , endearingly amusing ) .A tornado lifts Dorothy and her pet King Prawn Toto ( Bill Barretta 's Pepe character ) to the land of Oz .There she meets rat - like Munchkins ; collects Scarecrow ( Steve Whitmire as Kermit ) , the Tin Thing ( Dave Goelz as Gonzo ) , and the Cowardly Lion ( Eric Jacobson as Fozzie ) ; and tangles with four witches , all played by Jacobson 's Miss Piggy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Original Muppet performer Whitmire still plays Rizzo , and it 's comforting to think that Goelz will gladly be Gonzo until he drops .Whitmire has settled into Kermit pretty well , and Eric Jacobson - who has adopted most of Frank Oz 's roles since 2000-makes a good vocal match for Fozzie and Miss Piggy .Statler and Waldorf ( in brief cameos ) will probably never sound right again , but the Muppet staff is on the right track .Other relatively recent additions to the stable continue to contribute good work .Barretta 's Spanish - accented Pepe , who ends nearly every line with \" okay ? \" is endlessly funny , and Barretta 's Johnny Fiama makes a welcome return appearance as a henchman to Piggy 's wicked witch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One suspects that these guys could make the magic happen , with better support behind the camera .But the weaknesses of the script are glaring , in plot and dialogue , and the pacing and production design add to the realization that this is a relatively chintzy affair .We 're a long way from the creative energy , heart , and charm of Henson 's Muppet movies , even though I 'm not ready for the Henson Company to stop trying .For those who were paying attention , The Muppets ' Wizard of Oz was broadcast in HDTV , meaning this release does not feature the original aspect ratio .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( The film was shot \" protected \" for Full Screen broadcast , so it does n't appear to be cropped . )In other respects , the transfer is adequate .A few bonus features are included , aside from the requisite \" Sneak Peeks \" ( of Valiant , Narnia , The Muppet Show , and \" Kermit 's 50th Anniversary \" ) .First , we get \" Oz Oops ! \"( 4:47 ) , a reel of bloopers and kidding outtakes from the production of the movie .This is always a good idea with the Muppets , as the performers tend to stay humorously in character when things go wrong .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Though marred by hyperactive editing , this featurette is hugely preferable to the common alternative : clips , narration , and talking heads on autopilot .Try staying on autopilot while talking to a Spanish - accented King Prawn .Quentin Tarantino certainly ca n't in \" Pepe 's Extended Interview with Quentin Tarantino , \" an amusing chat with the director and genuine Muppet fan .Pepe calling the star director \" Mr. James Farentino \" is inspired .I can only recommend this disc to Muppet completists , as the feature is n't very good .The movie lacks replay value , and the extras are n't enough to compensate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
