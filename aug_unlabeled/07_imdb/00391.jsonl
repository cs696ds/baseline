{"text": "There 's no good reason I remember February ' 82 as well as I do .It was n't the month of a special vacation or a birthday or anything like that .I was in the ninth grade when I happened to see Kate Jackson on \" The Tonight Show . \" She was adorable and chatted with Johnny for a bit before he asked her to explain the plot of her new movie , \" Making Love , \" Hollywood 's first attempt at a big - budget mainstream gay film .Knowing that she was entering uncharted territory , Kate gracefully tried to ease the audience into things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" It did n't take more than a second for the audience to turn on her -- and turn hard .They began to loudly boo her -- one of Charlie 's Angels ! -- on national television .I was stunned and immediately felt sick just watching everything unfold .Johnny had to step in and reprimand the audience and make them be nice .Imagine , if you will , the profound effect this had on a confused 14-year - old gay boy in Mesa , Arizona .As long as I live I will never forget the hostile reaction Kate got just because she dared to mention the subject of gay men .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although it 's absurd , it 's like the fear of rejection has been embedded in my DNA .It 's been nearly 25 years since \" Making Love \" and I would argue that \" Brokeback Mountain \" is its long - awaited follow - up .And whether the film crosses over at the box office is n't what 's at stake here at all . \" Brokeback \" is America 's chance to treat the subject of homosexuality with respect and to show how much this country has progressed in the past two decades ( it has , right ? )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And while it 's true that we 've had a number of silly big - budget \" Birdcage \" and \" To Wong Foo \" caliber films , none of these were comparable .Those campy characters do n't threaten the mainstream .They 're what 's expected of the gay community .And even our so - called breakthrough , the Oscar - winning \" Philadelphia , \" was , to me , much more a civil rights saga than a romantic love story .( And it was surely more readily accepted by the masses because of its mostly nonsexual storyline . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Two typical guys who kiss , who have real sex , and who yearn for each other when they 're apart .There are no drag queens here for laughs .And the fact that the lovers are played by two A - list Hollywood leading men , along with a big - time director , sends a clear message of tolerance and acceptance to the masses .And while some gay people will identify with the repression aspect of the plot , for me it was about something more universal , almost like watching \" The Bridges of Madison County , \" only with my people as the central characters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At the end of the day , \" Brokeback , \" too , is nothing more than a romantic tale of forbidden love that anyone with a heart could understand .But because Hollywood has chosen to ignore this version of the age - old story , \" Brokeback \" is a very important film .I do n't think the general public can begin to imagine -- nor should they be expected to -- what it feels like to live a life that is virtually unrecognized in mainstream pop culture .The whole world is predicated on the idea that you are straight -- and in America , that you 're straight and white .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That feeling of pure exhilaration at seeing someone who is actually like you up there on the screen !Sure , many gay people -- like other minority groups -- learn to have thicker skins and to embrace the fact that they 're different .And while we have our campy supporting TV characters , the occasional tacky cable television series , and even a string of oft - embarrassing , low - budget \" gay \" films , none of this is a substitute for the purest form of recognition : a good old - fashioned Hollywood romance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( And perhaps where Middle America 's understanding begins . ) \" Brokeback Mountain \" is our moment to go to the regular cineplex ( not the crappy art house with the 30-inch movie screens ) and watch one of those wonderful epic Hollywood romances .Only this time it 's about a couple of guys like us .9 comments : .Jesus CHRIST !Why are you copy - editing ?Why I am not reading THIS in the Sunday magazine ?This is brilliant .This -- you hit something universal with this , the desire to see people just like you on screen once in awhile .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is so funny how you mentioned Kate Jackson initially , because my \" like me \" moment with television was when I was first watching Charlie 's Angels .Yeah , you had the blonde glamourpuss and the brunette glamourpuss . . .and then you had Sabrina .Who was pretty , but not conventionally so .Who was almost defiantly brunette .Who was SMART .It meant the world to me , that they included her , even though it was a dumb show .It meant the world to me to see her there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If I try to imagine it from your perspective , the best I can do is to figure it 's what I felt , times infinity .Love this post .Love it .Get it published , you asshole !And I mean that in the nicest possible way .I think you 're spot - on about this .This movie has the potential to change so much .For one thing , consider that a few years ago a mainstream heartthrob leading - man actor would NEVER think about playing a sympathetic gay character .Now we 've got TWO of them , in love with each other !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Philadelphia was indeed a breakthrough , and I do n't agree with your statement that it was utterly nonsexual .It 's been a long time since I 've seen it , but I seem to remember a scene when Antonio Banderas climbed into a hospital bed with an ill Tom Hanks and they had some kind of sex .It was n't much , but it was something .Still , this is bigger .This is more .And I am SO glad it 's in the capable hands of Ang Lee and not some hack ( Chris Columbus , not to name names ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "growing up with damaging cultural experiences on television : I do n't remember Kate Jackson on Johnny .But I DO remember the flamboyant queen on Barnie Miller , who was always being busted for having sex in parks .I was , like , 11 years old -- and I remember thinking , \" Is this ME ?\" I , too , loved the scenes where , despite their pretty quiet natures , they really laid their feelings fo reach other on the line .Two scenes expecially .Which is a lot for Ennis .In fact , the two scenes by the riverside stick in my mind .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And ending with Ennis breaking down , Jack realizing his pain and , despite their words a minute ago , hugging him for all he 's worth : \" Damn you , Ennis del Mar. \" .Thank you Kenneth for those words .You hit the nail on the head .I saw the movie at a screening over a week ago and have been reeling ever since .I can not recall a film which has touched me so deeply - ever .Not only do we ache for Jakc and Ennis but we ache for ourselves and the pain and hurt we 've borne all our lives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
