{"text": "The Lobbyist : Fine Hotel Dining at Triomphe .Triomphe , in the newly refurbished Iroquois Hotel on West 44th Street , is not like any hotel dining room I 've been in before .This tiny gem of a restaurant is hidden behind a pocket - size bar off the lobby , a small , windowless space with a white - domed , neoclassical ceiling , a polished walnut floor and only 11 tables .Eating here is like being on a ship .You feel you ought to be , at the very least , on nodding acquaintance with the other customers - all the more since some of them look as though they came downstairs for dinner having just unpacked their luggage in their newly refurbished rooms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For the food at Triomphe is not only better than what you 'd get on a ship , it 's , as the Michelin Guide would say , worth a detour .When I arrived for dinner with some friends , they were clearly wondering what I was getting them into - if not , as Robert Benchley once remarked , out of a wet coat and into a dry martini .The Iroquois Hotel has never been on anyone 's list for fine dining any more than the Algonquin down the block .( How , I wonder , did two hotels named after Indian tribes come to be on 44th Street ? )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But the $ 13 million renovation has obliterated all traces of Judy .I ca n't imagine how she fit her act into the premises , which are probably not much bigger than the bedrooms upstairs .To the left as you enter Triomphe is a dark - brown and lemon - yellow banquette and shelves of bottles , backlit so they glow like semiprecious stones against the white wall .On the opposite wall is a giant mirror hung with velvet curtains to cleverly give the illusion of another room beyond , filled with tables set with white cloths , candles , an orange amaryllis - and you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Instead of the ubiquitous foie gras ( which one trendy hotel restaurant I recently visited had sliced into macaroni and cheese for their take on luxury comfort food ) , Mr. Zobel kicked off with what some might also consider comfort food : chicken livers .He pan - fried them , lightly braised them in sherry and butter and heaped them on the plate with Spanish and pearl onions and frizzled leeks .Try these pink , creamy livers and you wo n't miss foie gras .Instead of gravlax , Mr. Zobel served a sushi - grade salmon cured \u00e0 la minute with salt and sugar , garnished with pickled red onions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Wontons , stuffed with a thick , pleasantly sweet pur\u00e9e of roasted acorn squash , were poached in a rich chicken broth with fines herbs , chives and parsley and topped with tangy shaved Parmesan .Compared with the wontons ' bold flavors , Mr. Zobel 's oyster stew was restrained , even wimpy .It was made in the traditional way with leeks , butter and potatoes , seasoned with Vermouth and cream and studded with nice brioche croutons , but it did n't have much taste .Sea scallops , on the other hand , had an aroma that wafted clear across the table .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When sweetbreads show up on a menu , they are generally good for an argument since no one can agree on what they really are .Even waiters do n't seem to know half the time .( A few years ago , at a pretentious French restaurant , I asked if there was anything on the menu suitable for an 8-year - old , and after a quick look , the waiter replied , \" Sweetbreads .\" I realized later that he must have thought they were sweet . )My companion at Triomphe insisted that sweetbreads were the pancreas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Undeterred , he ordered the glands , which Mr. Zobel prepared not in the usual cream sauce but with a Mexican touch , served crisp on a toasted baguette with an artichoke \" guacamole \" and topped with tomatoes , onions , jalape\u00f1o and cilantro .It was spicy , light and surprisingly good .Mr. Zobel 's choice of companions for lobster eluded me , however .The lobster itself , poached in butter with turnips , carrots and shaved black truffles , was wonderfully tender .But I 'm not sure that chewy brown rice laced with raw scallions is what I really want to eat with it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This was a great dish .Rare , meaty New Zealand lamb chops were good too , plated with white beans , Swiss chard and crisp slices of pancetta .In a lighter vein , the day 's market fish coated with a light \" marinade \" made with white - wine vinegar , sugar , soy sauce , chili and ginger reclined on a bed of jasmine rice and grilled leeks .It 's worth getting side orders of the delicious greens with garlic and oil or the fried mixed vegetables in an airy batter .There are just a handful of desserts on the menu .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In a strange but delicious pairing , cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e came with Concord grapes and sugar cookies dabbed with apricot jam .And a tarte Tatin , filled with Golden Delicious apples , was made with feathery puff pastry and served with buttermilk ice cream .Mr. Zobel also has a serious cheese board : One night , the kitchen sent strong , creamy Morbier cheese and glasses of port to our table .Too bad we could n't head straight upstairs afterward .There is a world of difference between a hotel restaurant and a restaurant that happens to be in a hotel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But none that I 've smelled compare to the famed black truffles unearthed from woods and forests of southwest France .Rien du tout .When I worked in the restaurant business , we 'd often get knobbly black truffles sent to us , which were shaved over simple dishes like pasta , potatoes , and risottos ; anything more complicated competes with their funky , pungent , but highly - prized aroma .People go ga - ga over truffles , but I never caught the truffle bug , which was excellent news for my wallet .On my recent trip to Cahors , we went for a walk in the forest with a truffle hunter - and his boisterous pig , in search of black truffles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was a very chilly winter day , so cold that even the leaves on the spindly oak trees were shivering .But that 's truffle season ; January and February .And if you want to find truffles , they 're not going to land in your lap while sitting at home by the fireplace .One needs to roam through the forests , where the trees have been stripped nearly bare by the icy winds .And even though seasoned truffle hunters do n't require much protection , un certain Parisien was bundled up quite well for the search .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But that also makes them hard to detect .So truffle hunters use either dogs or pigs to find the elusive spores .In the past , pigs were used almost exclusively to rout out the truffles .But in spite of how cute and picturesque the furry fellows are , for the most part , dogs have taken the place of the porkers .When a single truffle can set you back well over a few hundred bucks , even the most die - hard animal lover will agree that as much as we love our pets , very few people love them that much .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While adorable , pigs have a habit of eating the truffle once they unearth it .Hence the stick , which I did n't see being used .And this particular hunter carried a running monologue with the pig as it scampered around , obviously thrilled to have a captive audience to his ramblings .The only mistreatment of the animal I saw was that he likely would n't get a cut of the take once the truffles were sold .Still , in spite of the cold , I can think of a lot worse things than roaming around the forest , sniffing truffles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
