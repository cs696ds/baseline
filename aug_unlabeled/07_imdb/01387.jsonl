{"text": "Job One , obviously , is racing .Since joining Porsche in 2003 , Long has scored class wins in the Triple Crown of endurance racing -- Le Mans , Daytona , and Sebring -- as well as overall victories in cars ranging from Daytona Prototypes to the 911 GT3 R Hybrid .So he 's proven himself worthy of entree to a select American fraternity of Porsche factory drivers that includes legends such as Dan Gurney , Peter Gregg , Al Holbert , and Hurley Haywood .At the same time , Long has also insinuated himself into the corporate culture by representing Porsche at events designed to burnish the brand .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I do n't care about the acting and I doubt anyone else watching a film like this would either .Not nearly as gory as most low budget stuff from the likes of Ittenbach , Rose , Schnaas .This drags less and is bloodier than Bethmann 's next film Die Insel der Damonen ( The Island of the Demons ) .Overall this is a decent watch for fans of ultra - low budget SOV horror stuff with good atmosphere and an OK amount of blood and gore .Great fun .24 July 2012 .This cheesy horror film is about 4 people trapped in a building while being besieged by a horde of hellish demons .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The old man gets dispatched fairly early on getting his head pulled down a drain and ripped off .There is also an archangel with huge muscles who resembles a young Lou Ferrigno .He 's not in the film long though as he ca n't interfere in a war between hell and mortals so unfortunately we do n't get to see him tear any demons to pieces .The film is filled with funny dialog from the Robert Z'Dar looking guy and lots of vulgar sexual / racist dialog from the taunting demons .The demon designs are pretty neat including some that resemble Syngenor / Alien / Humanoids from the Deep type creatures .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is also a nasty eel like demon which is tortured by the black soldier who rips out his teeth one by one .They then have a duel and the demon is ripped in half spewing green demon blood all over in an amazing scene .The film is pretty bloody and gory over all , though most of the blood is demon blood .It also features decapitations and severed limbs and demons shot up , hacked up and chainsawed .The CGI is pretty awful but that only adds to the fun in a film like this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's even a shower scene and a little bit of nudity .This film has just about everything someone could want- blood , gore , nudity , action , cool creatures , attempted demon rape and funny one liners .It feels a little bit like Evil Dead 2 and would almost be on par with that film if it was n't for the putrid ICP music .For those that do n't know ICP are white rapping clowns from Detroit who like Faygo and wrestling .The ICP music detracts from the scenes it 's used in and almost anything else would be better .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He lops off her head and then blows up the devil ( who is a small cute dog ) .He and the black dude now rule hell , so the film has a happy ending .Watch this if you like bad CGI gore and man - butt ... .7 January 2012 - 6 out of 10 users found this review helpful .Blood Pigs , Zombie 90 : Extreme Pestilence , The Burning Moon , Das Komabrutal Duell , Bone Sickness , VS trilogy ... these are great ultra - gorefests but The Summer of Massacre is just retarded .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And CGI alone is bad enough but this is really , really bad CGI .And the filmmakers blatantly lie about the bodycount of 155 .There 's maybe 55 on screen kills .Already dead bodies laying around should n't count towards the body count and I hope Guinness revokes their world record for body count in a slasher film ( if this is n't a blatant lie ) .I thought Joe Castro was a practical FX man ?I 've enjoyed his films such as Evil Unleashed , Legend of the Chupacabra and Jackhammer Massacre which if I remember correctly had almost 100 % practical gore fx .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Is he that lazy ?This film with all practical gore and blood would have been awesome .No one has ever liked CGI and it 's even more hated when it comes to blood and gore .Not only were the fx horrid but the death scenes were stupid .A guy getting a remote control pushed through his mouth and splitting his head ?A guy 's head getting crushed with a seatbelt ?Some of the stuff in the burn story was kinda neat despite still being very dodgy fx wise .Another knock on the film is the complete lack of female nudity and that would n't be a big deal if there was n't any male nudity which unfortunately there was .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The male nudity was n't confined to the behind either ... trying to tell us something Joe ?This is an anthology by the way and none of the stories are worth mentioning .I dare you next time to top this film Joe , but with 100 % practical blood and gore fx .Brian Paulin made 3 films just as gory as this and much , much better without any CGI at all and probably even less money than you wasted on this disappointment .Good but not enough gore .20 September 2011 - 4 out of 6 users found this review helpful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's really all you need to know about the plot .The characters are mostly uninteresting but the redneck was amusing .The whole rave thing is an instant turn off .There was n't much nudity and more would have been appreciated though the women in the cast were mostly nothing special looking .The main reason you 're watching this is for the gore and while there are a few notable scenes , it 's really not that great .A pulled off jaw and a head smashed through a grate are a couple of the better scenes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The main villain was pretty cool .There were also these female zombie chicks roaming around not doing much .There 's no explanation as to why they are there and they were n't utilized very well .The gore is still enjoyable and it 's a fun film but I ca n't imagine how much more plentiful and graphic the gore would have been if was made by Olaf Ittenbach , Brian Paulin or even Andreas Schnaas .Imagine the ending scene of this film if was done like the endings of The Burning Moon or Premutos .It would have taken this film to a whole other gory level .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Primal starts with 3 young people wandering through the forest who get bumped off by a bigfoot - like creature .The movie wastes no time in showing the creature and it 's shown often throughout the movie .The creature is a decent looking man in a suit though a little on the goofy side with long arms .Later we meet a group of uninteresting environmentalists who mostly get bumped off by the creature .Later we meet park ranger Wade , estranged brother of Julie .Julie has come there with her fianc\u00e9e to invite Wade to her wedding .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The people he works for do n't want to hear his stories about bigfoot for fear of ruining tourism in the area .Wade may lead an exciting life but he has limited social skills .Wade and Julie 's fianc\u00e9e spend most of their screen time having awkward conversations that even make the viewer feel uncomfortable .To make matters worse the only food he has for them is unappealing generic cereal served with water instead of milk , this really irritates the fianc\u00e9e .The remaining members of the environmentalist group hide out in a meth lab and end up battling it out with the angry meth - heads as Wade and his sister are on the way to burn the place to the ground .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Who will survive and what will be left of them ?Will Wade go to Julie 's wedding ?Are all park rangers issued automatic weapons ?Well , you wo n't find out as the movie just kind of ends .Primal is a passable bigfoot horror with OK acting for the budget level .The shaky camera during the bigfoot attacks is annoying but luckily \" flashy \" techniques like that are a kept to a minimum .CGI is also mostly absent as well , only appear during one scene and looking quite phony .The gore is minimal and mostly after attack stuff , but the fx are decent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A decent time waster for fans of cheap horror flicks like me who rarely dislike any of them .Greatest gore ever . 8 September 2011 - 5 out of 6 users found this review helpful .Blood Pigs is an apocalyptic zombie film and contains the best gore yet from director Brian Paulin easily on par with Bone Sickness .Extremely bloody , graphic and inventive .It takes a little while for the blood to really start flowing but the last half is almost non - stop gore .The acting and plot were fine for a film like this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film does a good job of building up to seeing the blood pigs for the first time .This is an extremely low budget film but the fx are mostly quite good and it does a fine job of building up an atmosphere of dread and hopelessness for the remaining humans .The bleak ending gives you a feeling that the blood pigs are everywhere and that humanity is doomed .I would n't mind seeing a sequel to this with even more creature fx .The only complaint would be the camera moving around too much during a lot of the gore / action scenes making them a little blurry and hard to focus on the gory goods .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
