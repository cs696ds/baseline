{"text": "share : .Darling Lili .In 1964 the top box office films were Mary Poppins , My Fair Lady , Goldfinger , and The Carpetbaggers ; two of the four were musicals that took a rose - colored view of turn - of - the - century England .Only six years later , it was a very different story .Films , like America , had changed drastically during the late 1960s and that change was felt at the box office .For actress Julie Andrews , who had played Mary Poppins and was now identified with that character by audiences , this created quite a problem .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Both had a goal in mind : to change Andrews ' sugary sweet screen image by making her sexy .As the ads for the film proclaimed , \" she sizzles , she dances , she spies .\" The \" sizzle \" came from Edwards shooting love scenes between Andrews and co - star Rock Hudson , even going so far as to show them in the shower together .As with many Julie Andrews films , there is plenty of dancing , although in Darling Lili , Edwards adds a twist by having Andrews turn a music hall performance into a striptease .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Edwards / Andrews romance seems to have been the only bright spot in what would become a very troubled production .Filming began in late March 1968 , a few weeks before the now famous Paris student uprising in May.France was brought to a halt by striking workers who were in solidarity with the students , making it impossible to shoot there .Production had to be moved to Brussels , and eventually Ireland , which caused Edwards even more problems .\" When we were ready to film Darling Lili , I was certainly production - wise enough to know it was impractical to consider a lengthy exterior shoot in Ireland .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are days when either it 's pissing rain or you get intermittent sun , for the most part , Ireland 's just a bad place to shoot a movie .I investigated that immediately and wanted to shoot the aircraft sequences in South Carolina , which can be made to look like German or French countryside , but Paramount stuck to its decision to shoot in Ireland , so off we went .Well , the second unit ran millions of dollars over budget just waiting to get ' clear air ' shots there .After that , I was under constant money pressure from the studio but that was n't nearly as hard to take as the rest of the stuff they did to me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They blamed Edwards and Andrews , accusing them in the press of being extravagant .Edwards defended himself in the Playboy interview , \" People who were at Paramount at that time would say things to me and then deny they 'd said them , and after a while , I began to doubt my own sanity .Well , I 'd taped that conversation , and we 'd never said a word about it .Another time , when we could n't find an inn for some exterior shots and were running into bad weather again , I told Paramount to bring me home because I could save some money by building the goddamned thing in the studio .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , I started thinking that maybe Charles Bluhdorn - the head of Gulf Western , which had just bought Paramount - was getting bad information .I told him that when I had a dinner with him in Paris , and he said , ?There 's only one thing that 's important : if this film is a success , you 're a hero .If it is n't , you 're finished .That was his answer .I 've got it on tape . \" In the same interview , Julie Andrews remembered their life as \" rather crazy at that time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I obviously realized what was happening to Blake and empathized , because I saw many instances of things that were stupid and unfair .For example , Blake had wanted a couple of musical numbers in the film to show that Lili was an entertainer ; that gave Paramount the notion to make the film into a big , big musical .\" Edwards continued where Andrews left off , \" And because we 'd spent SO much money on those second units , the studio decided to leave in as much of the aerial footage as possible just to show the money that was spent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By that , I mean Charlie Bluhdorn 's giving directives and Bob [ Robert ] Evans , who 'd hardly made a movie before , being head of the studio .\" Paramount was n't the only ones bashing Blake Edwards and Julie Andrews in the press ; rumors about their sexuality began to get around Hollywood at that time .She also implied that Rock and I had spent a lot of time together in San Francisco leather bars .We were shooting Darling Lili then , and I walked up to Rock and repeated the story to him , and I loved his response : \" How in the hell did she find out so quick ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's the last of the mammoth movie musicals ....I doubt that Hollywood , now practically broke and trying desperately to make a connection with the youth market , will ever again indulge itself in this sort of splendidly extravagant , quite frivolous enterprise .Had it been released a few years earlier , it might have been more successful .Though Darling Lili was not a financial success , for Blake Edwards and Julie Andrews their marriage which has lasted since November 12 , 1969 , has been their biggest success of all .C-114 m .Letterboxed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
