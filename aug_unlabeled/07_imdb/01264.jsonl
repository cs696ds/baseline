{"text": "Special Offers and Product Promotions .Editorial Reviews .Product Description .When Mystery , Alaska 's amateur hockey team accepts a challenge to play against the New York Rangers , the entire population must put their petty differences aside and pull together as their small town becomes the center of a nationally televised event .When it comes to the subject of community , David E. Kelley -- the prolific writer - producer behind television 's The Practice and Ally McBeal --falls somewhere on a continuum between directors Howard Hawks and Robert Benton .While Hawks 's professional characters are bound by a knowledge of how to do what they do even if they do n't know why , Benton 's people , professional or not , have long ago substituted their own eccentric reasons for that elusive why .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kelley 's script for Mystery , Alaska ( co - authored by Sean O'Byrne ) takes that level of eccentricity to a geographical and spiritual extreme .The film revives the hackneyed Rocky formula , setting a lopsided hockey match within a remote , self - contained hamlet where the members of a tiny population all have to wear multiple hats and still keep neighborly ties intact .The story concerns the town 's chief source of identity and pride : so - called \" Saturday games , \" in which local men divide into teams and play pond hockey for the locals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Coaching falls to the town sheriff , John Biebe ( Russell Crowe ) , an admirable man and a longtime player recently bumped from the team .John , however , does n't want the job : everyone knows the real coach in those parts is Judge Burns ( Burt Reynolds ) , but he wants no part of it either .All of that changes after a sad tragedy forces everyone to reevaluate their positions and pull together in order to beat the Rangers .Following the success of Austin Powers : International Man of Mystery , Jay Roach proves to be an able director of drama , swift action , and low - key , character - driven comedy not unlike that in Benton 's Nobody 's Fool .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "--Tom Keogh .Top Customer Reviews .This charming film did n't get the positive praise it deserved .It was absolutely wonderful .The small Alaskan town of \" Mystery \" has a quirky \" Northern Exposure \" feel to it , and a wonderful ensemble cast add a lot of fun and games .The \" Saturday \" hockey game leads off this fairy - tale story of David vs. Goliath , as their hometown boys go against the NHL 'S New York Rangers .Former \" townie \" Hank Azaria starts this whole thing by writing a spotlight on the \" Saturday Game \" for Sports Illustrated and well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Russell Crowe turns in a great performance as \" slightly older \" town Sherif John Biebe , who is the heart and soul of the much younger hockey team .There are many wonderful smaller performances by faces you 'll certainly know and love .It 's a wonderfully sweet , charming and funny ( with classic one liners from MANY of the young players ) movie that only HAPPENS to be about hockey .There is so much more to it .You do n't have to know a thing about hockey to appreciate this fun and lighthearted movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The ending is exciting , and surprisingly unpredictable .For me , the actor that stole the show was Ryan Northcott , a barely credited character , who plays the pivotal role of the high school skating whiz who takes Russell Crowe 's place on the team .He has a couple of the most amusing , and embarassing , scenes in the movie , and handles them with humor and grace .Overall , Mystery , Alaska was a funny , enjoyable movie that I recommend to everyone .You do n't have to be a hockey fan to love Mystery , Alaska .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Mystery Alaska \" is the story of a quirky little town that revolves around the Saturday hockey game played on the local pond .Being a member of the team is a prestigious and revered position in Mystery .There is no pay or world wide fame gained from being in the Saturday game , but the men play because their fathers played , and their fathers played .It 's funny to watch the men obsess over the their spot on the team , because only a select few hold those spots .When one of the men is replaced by the young up and comer in town , it 's almost as though someone has died . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
