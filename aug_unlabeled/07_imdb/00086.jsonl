{"text": "The arrival of 1977 saw the release of two important films - Eraserhead and Star Wars .Both films could n't be more different visually or thematically , and yet they share a common bond in the sense that each feature a filmmaker with a unique vision .Hoberman 's quote points out the respective ends of the spectrum that Star Wars ' director , George Lucas and Eraserhead 's director , David Lynch occupy .Lucas made a wildly popular film that appealed to a mass audience , while Lynch created an intensely personal film that attracted a small , but devoted group of admirers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many writers have tried to sum up the story of Eraserhead , but few have been able to accurately convey what exactly is happening .It is no secret that Eraserhead is a film that defies an easy synopsis .You do n't watch the film per se , but rather experience it .However , one of the best attempts to describe it comes from the director himself who once summarized the film as \" a dream of dark and troubling things . \"As the film opens , we gradually learn that Henry is on vacation from La Pelle 's factory and after a particularly gruesome and rather humorous dinner with his girlfriend Mary X and her strange family , he learns that she has given birth to a premature baby .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now this all sounds pretty straight forward right ?Well , Eraserhead does n't quite play out in this linear fashion .The film follows its own leisurely pace in order to let the rather nightmarish mood and creepy atmosphere slowly work its magic on the viewer .And this is where the film loses or keeps its audience .You are either captivated by its often disturbing , yet somewhat beautiful images , or repulsed by its rather negative and pessimistic worldview .Either way , Eraserhead is an unforgettable film guaranteed to provoke a strong reaction , which is what a good film should do .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Lynch and his first wife , Peggy had lived in the city from 1966 to 1970 , buying a 12-room house for $ 3,500 in an industrial district across from an old city morgue .Lynch experienced first hand the feeling of urban decay and the evil nature that man was capable of as violence , danger , and fear surrounded him on a daily basis .Their house was broken into three times , twice when he and Peggy were at home .Lynch remembers one such eye opening event that stayed with him for some time , an event that led to him writing and filming Eraserhead . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "He had achieved this scholarship thanks to a string of strange , unclassifiable film shorts that had won him all sorts of accolades and awards .Initially , Lynch was n't even planning to make Eraserhead but had originally submitted an idea for a film short called Gardenback , which he described as \" a story about adultery , really , but it had a lot to do with gardens and insects . \"However , the Center was n't exactly keen on the idea and did n't really understand what he wanted to do , so Lynch ultimately abandoned it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Instead , Lynch began studying the structure of film by attending conferences and a film analysis class taught by Frank Daniel , former dean of a Czech film school .This in turn provided the technical groundwork for his most ambitious project yet : Eraserhead .By the next year , the Institute gave him $ 10,000 and so Lynch began the pre - production stage of Eraserhead , working with a 21-page script that he had written in a compressed style that relied heavily on images . \"He showed me this little script he had written for Eraserhead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When truly inspired , Lynch worked fast on the screenplay .For example , the infamous family dinner scene was written mainly in a single night , while some ideas , like the Lady in the Radiator , developed gradually over time .This rather spontaneous method evolved from Lynch 's practice as a painter .He was used to collecting and accumulating images and ideas that were similar or could be linked together via his imagination .The script for Eraserhead did not take shape in terms of a plot , but rather in terms of textures .Lynch loved to study textures of all various kinds , from the organic sort to ones of an industrial or urban nature .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He discussed one such experiment in an 1980 interview with Wet magazine : \" I 'm obsessed with textures .We 're surrounded by so much vinyl that I find myself constantly in pursuit of other textures .One time I removed all the hair from a mouse with Nair - Hair just to see what it looked like .And it looked beautiful .\" Lynch was also fascinated by the textures of factories and cities , in particular , the buildings of downtown Los Angeles and the \" industrial / agricultural feel \" of the L.A. River .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In this respect , Eraserhead takes the film noir to its stylistic limits .Actual filming began on May 29 , 1972 in the abandoned AFI stables , located at Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills .Henry 's apartment was a deserted garage where filming took place between one am and dawn for a whole year .All of the soundstages that were used in Eraserhead Lynch and his small , but dedicated crew of five or six people had built themselves .The AFI money soon ran out and the young filmmaker was so poor that he ended up living on the set , building sheds , replacing hot water heaters , and delivering the Wall Street Journal for extra money .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Clearly , there is some truth to this anecdote .Lynch did deliver the Wall Street Journal , using a 1959 Volkswagen , and no doubt worked very hard at it , but he is also having a bit of fun at the interviewer 's expense by also mentioning the flu that was miraculously healed in one hour .Despite living poverty , Lynch 's time spent working on Eraserhead was one of the best times of his life .He was obviously a man in his element that had made a personal connection with his material .\" I really liked living the way I did during Eraserhead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The experience proved to be so enjoyable that Splet joined Lynch on creating Eraserhead 's soundtrack .Lynch and Splet worked on the soundtrack in another empty garage room in the deserted AFI stables .They designed , built , and then hung sound - deadening blankets over the walls to get the cleanest , purist sound possible .Lynch and Splet started with natural sounds and then altered them .It was the perfect environment for Lynch and Splet to create the ideal soundtrack for Eraserhead as Lynch said in an interview , \" we could make sounds the way we wanted them to be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Nance had recently arrived in L.A. to look for film work and apart from some small parts in low - budget AIP programmers , Eraserhead was his first film .Lynch transformed Nance into Henry , who was actually based on Lynch himself .Nance had to live with his rather bizarre haircut for five years , and began to even act like the director , adopting many of his mannerisms .Lynch consoled him by saying that \" one of these days , guys are going to be wearing their hair like that , \" but Nance was unconvinced , remarking , \" making a film with you , Lynch , is one frame at a time . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps it was Lynch 's personal approach to directing his actors that Nance enjoyed so much .\" David will use that moment and start talking to you and give you verbal cues to the scene like \" wrapped in plastic \" and you 'll be reacting to what he 's saying and do it on the spot .He has caught you , caught you unawares .It 's really neat and it 's really personal , a kind of intimate thing .\" It is this style of more actor - oriented directing that has attracted a lot of actors to Lynch and may account for the steady use of certain people like Nance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This not only included Splet but cinematographer Frederick Elmes who began working with Lynch on Eraserhead , operating one of the two cameras used in the film ( the other operated by Herbert Caldwell ) .Elmes ' contribution to the film is very crucial .His use of lighting ( or the lack thereof ) and shadows is important in creating a real feeling of dread and menace .He also mixes many of the stylistic elements of film noir with surrealism to create the sensation of watching a waking nightmare .Elmes would go on to work with Lynch on some of the filmmaker 's most important work - Blue Velvet ( 1986 ) and Wild at Heart ( 1991 ) , helping to define the distinctive cinematic look of these films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
