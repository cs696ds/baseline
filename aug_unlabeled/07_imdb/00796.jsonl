{"text": "Throw in an exceptional soundtrack , and this is a memorable entry in the franchise .What do you think ?Of course , the SNES library was vast and impressive , and by limiting ourselves to 10 titles we have omitted other games that can certainly be considered as classics .With that in mind , we want know what you think .What were your favourite games on the SNES ?What are your memories of the SNES launch , and what is the console 's legacy today ?Let us know in the comments below .From the web .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I 'd go over to his house and spend the whole night playing Super Mario world and Zelda : Link to the past .I drove my mom nuts begging for a Snes of my own .Finally that Christmas I got one and my whole perspective on Videogames changed forever .Still the coolest system ever !I was n't even born whent this came out .It 's a pretty good system overall and has some amazing songs and some of the best 2D graphics I 've ever seen .My favorite game on the ol' SNES would have to be Kirby Super Star hands down ( yeah", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have tons of memories with the system , such as watching my dad play Final Fantasy II and III on there , and playing a ton of games that are absolute classics .The SNES is my favorite system , better than the Genesis !We could have done with a bit more RPG love in Europe , but at least we got Secret of Mana - Definately my favourite SNES game , and one of my favourite of all time .I 'll never forget the day I got my first SNES .I was probably only about 8 or 9 at the time when it launched .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "aka the Super NES .All I can say is that it was worth the wait , i 've owned every Nintendo Console since but for me the SNES is still the best .Back then it was abit like it is today between the PS3 and the Xbox , you either had a SNES or a Megadrive , one or the other , constant playground arguments as to which was the best lol .My Favorite game is a predictable one but it has to be Super Mario World .I think its the perfect template on how to make a 2d sidescrolling adventure game , even today ( 20 years later ) it still stands up pretty well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It has the best library of the Nintendo home consoles , and the third - party support coming from Capcom and Square was strong .When I was just a baby , the first video game that I saw was Mario Paint , and when I could pick up a controller I played Donkey Kong Country and Super Mario All - Stars .Now as a young adult I still have those games and have even picked up some new ones for the system over the years , such as Donkey Kong Country 2 and 3 and the Disney video games such as Aladdin and The Lion King .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Believe it or not , it 's also the only video game system that my own mom plays , and still does today .She can play Super Mario World and Donkey Kong Country so well !I was eight years old when my tech - crazy daddy decided that we 'd rent you during school holidays .My twelve year old aunt was always around and we played Super Mario World like crazy .I 'll never forget how much deeper , more rewarding and dynamic it felt compared to the NES games I played before .We were very surprised and laughing hard when suddenly everything turned pumpkin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Which maybe was n't the best decision since my aunt always pwnt me in F - Zero then .Later a friend of mine got you too and we played Super Mario All - Stars like crazy when his TV show obsessed mother allowed us to .Another friend got Probetector III ( aka Contra 3 ) and the intensity and presentation made it the most amazing gaming experience I had until then .Not only that but you 've always been my personal star at supermarket displays .Seeing Yoshi 's Island and Donkey Kong Country 3 in action i could n't believe my eyes how great games could look on you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "PPPPS : Where 's the cake ?Happy Birthday SNES !Even though it came before my time two of my favorite games of all time originally came from the SNES .They are Chrono Trigger and Super Mario World .My uncle has a cabin and there I found a NES , a SNES and N64 .One day I might just get those systems and when I do will finally get to play those games on a TV .I 'm one moth older than the SNES xD But thank god I still could play it in its great era .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It seems that fun was everything at those days , nobody cared about graphics or the lack of violence , it was just Nintendo doing what he best can do , really good ( and fun ) games .It 's a great console , but I still prefer the Genesis The RPGs of the SNES just do n't do it for me ( takes a bow ) except Super Mario RPG .I do love the graphics of the SNES though .The DKC series remains amazing to this day .Castlevania , Starfox , SMW , Earthbound , and Kirby Super Star are all fantastic games .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "@Yoyogamer - I 've heard from a couple of people that it launched at different times depending on where in the US you were , with dates of 13th , 19th , 23rd and even 9th September mentioned .It certainly was n't on one date all over the country .I was 17 when i got my SNES / Super Famicom as i ordered it from Japan as i already owned a Jap Megadrive and hated the UK consoles SLOWWW running speed and smaller screen size .This and the N64 are my best machines to date .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , I was able to pick one up about a year ago , and it has become one of my all - time favorite consoles .The game quality , the controller , the looks ... everything is perfect about it .Excellent article .The SNES is without a doubt , my favorite Nintendo console .But Honestly I think the PAL version looks cooler .I do n't know why .And I love the top ten ; I 've played 8 and a 1/2 of them .I got a Sega Genesis the year it was released .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Seeing Mario in glorious 16-bit colors was THE reason for getting a Super Nintendo .Games like Super Metroid , F - Zero , and ALttP only solidified more the fact that Nintendo was miles ahead of it 's competition .Sorry , Sega ... but Nintendo did do what u said it do n't .Pleasant surpise to find this on Nintendolife this morning because I was just playing my orginal SNES last night !I just wrapped up Demon 's Crest last night and recently got Turtles IV : Turtles in Time .My eject button is a \" little sloppy \" and loose when a game is not locked in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I probably just need to open it up and look inside .Also mine has n't yellowed to bad , I still keep that bad boy in the original box and plastic when not using it .The North America version is definitely better looking - more clean and simplistic which makes it more pleasing to my eyes .The PAL version looks like something conjured up after watching SpaceBalls .I admit I am probably biased though .Oh , the SNES .My favorite console ever !I remember playing turtles in time and sunset riders all the time with family .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's such a great console .I beat Megaman X and still play through it for fun .I also beat DKC2 and SMW recently .Man .... 20 years , huh ?They are n't kidding when they say time flies .I could cry with joy trying to remember some of my best gaming memories on this console .I love the SNES and Nintendo .Happy 20th birthday good friend ! where are final fantasy 3 ( FF6 japan ) and mario kart ? ? ? also , street fighter 2 turbo should have been there , because it gave one hell of a long franchise legacy , still up and running strong today .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But there is so much games on the snes that are memorable .Truly the console that gave me the most memorable times .i rarely play a game twice these days , but the snes made me play some titles over and over again , years after years ... even today !Arguably the greatest console of all time .I never got to own one , I was born in 1995 .I do play SNES games on the Wii VC though , and they are amazing .Chrono Trigger , Super Mario World ( I played the GBA port as a kid ) , Link to the Past , Super Castlevania IV , the list goes on and on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Never has there been one system with so many legendary experiences .It may not stay at the top forever , but it has n't been beaten yet after 20 years .I got my SNES in 1992 and it 's cracked and discolored , but fires up every time .I still play it frequently because I feel it has the best selection of games .My favorite genres are platformers and beatemups so the SNES fits the bill perfectly .Definitely the best console of all time .Had a ton of fantastic games along with great graphics and an excellent sound chip ( although some games like Ys III sound much better on the Genesis ) too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "IMO the best console of all time the only one that comes close is the PS2 .And I personally think the NA version was the best looking out of the 3 .@StuffyStuff : Did you get your SNES working again ?I remember a few months ago you said it stopped working .PAL version wins by a mile in the looks dept IMO.Also we had the nice coloured buttons .Less games though Awesome console and still one of the best !Its best games are as good today as they were 20 years ago .Probaly the golden age of games for me ( probably cause I was a kid , but still ... ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I played Super Mario World and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 like a crazy !Also Zombies , Super Mario : All - Stars , Final Fight , Super Castlevania , Super Ghouls N Ghost and Megaman X were great and I played them for a loong time !But why have n't we seen Rock N Roll Racing for so long ?Could be so cool if it was rereleased for the wii shop or maybe the 3DS , I miss it a lot Also miss Gooftroop !the SNES was me first gaming experience and my favorite game will always be Super Mario World , The Legend of Zelda : A Link to the Past , .... and wait for it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "especially sicne it releashed on my birth year .and i beat it in 2 hours and 55 minutes last Friday and also i found some beatifully made music called Metroid Metal which Rocks ! ! !( close in a sense of Gernera )I will always Love you SNES the best console EVER !( the PS1 takes a close second , ... but it 's your day and also we are on a Nintendo sight ) .I traded in my mega drive for a Snes for the in - game pack Mario all Stars , I loved that console and think the only Nintendo console ever to top it is ( sorry ) the Wii .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I look on this celebration as a bit of an outsider .However my kids loved the SNES while they had it , andI think Donkey Kong Country 2 stands out in my mind as one of their all - time faves .After picking up a Wii again recently ( 2nd hand and cheaper than a new release PS3 game ) I 'm discovering pretty much for the first time why there 's so much love for Nintendo .I appreciate how well - crafted their 1st party titles are and once I 've finished PAper Mario , my next VC game will be the SNES 's DKC .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "SONIC THE HEDGEHOG 3 IS THE BEST SUPER NES GAME EVER .I did n't get SNES until mid way through it 's cycle ( 94 - 95 ? )but I got it with Super Mario World and Donkey King Country .I had a Sega genesis too but I ultimately chose the SNES every time .That system was the best to date .I love it .oh , the memories .I ca n't say that I liked this or the N64 better , they were both very different times in my life , but it seems the Snes lasted a long time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also there was a great , nerdy import shop near my house and it was in the days when \" region lock \" just meant a plastic tab that I had to cut away in my system so I could rent imports like Parodius and such .Void 's the warranty !they said trying to get me to buy the cheap plastic convertor ; like that tank would ever die .You could spill a case of beer in there and it 'd still work after an hour in the sun or a minute in the oven \" warm mode \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( except Wii , ironically ) .The SNES was a great system , yes .I read up on that japan - mod , and I may have to import some Super Famicom games and try it some time .And the blocky US consoles / carts do look cooler than the PAL / Japan versions , though I like the Pal / Japanese controllers better , LOL !NES will always be my favorite system though - maybe I 'm just too old school .Wheels2050 you 've forgotten some thing else , We never got Super Mario RPG ..... until it was released on the VC and it was a crime by Nintendo to leave Europe out at the time , nowadays Nintendo love Europe- ( Well kind of ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The PAL version looks cooler .On a different note , I 'll finally be getting a Super NES !I wanted to get one some time ago , but I spent my money elsewhere ( Pok\u00e9mon mini , Virtual Boy , etc . ) .I 'm doing some looking around and hope to have one by the end of October !Nintendo 's greatiest creation will always be the SNES for me ! !If video games never evolved from the 16-bit age and every new game was 16-bit that would be just fine with me I would actually be in heaven .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
