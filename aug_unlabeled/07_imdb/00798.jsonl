{"text": "Content : .Summary : .The movie DETROIT ROCK CITY follows four rebellious youths from Cleveland to Detroit as they road trip to see a Kiss concert .Filled with obscenities , rebellion , pot - smoking , fornication , and other forms of decadence the movie tries to re - visit the rock - and - roll comedy in a very pagan and anti - Christian , mostly ineffective comedy .Review : .The rock group Kiss has been aggravating parents since the early 1970 's , when this hard rock quartet donned face paint and outlandish costumes while jamming onstage surrounded by pyrotechnics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "True or not true , many people claimed their name was an acronym for Knights In Satan 's Service .Their songs , including \" Rock and Roll All Night , \" \" Hotter than Hell , \" and \" God of Thunder , \" certainly suggested that these guys were out to rock the boat of conventional stage theatrics and , of course , morality .Very rebellious , containing negative Christian characters , only marginally amusing , and also very simply written and directed , this movie will probably only attract hardcore Kiss fans .Hawk ( Edward Furlong ) , Jam ( Sam Huntington ) , Lex ( Guiseppe Andrews ) , and Trip ( James De Bello ) are four Cleveland youths in a Kiss cover band called Mystery .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hawk is the smart , seemingly confident leader of the group , who rallies them together when Jam 's mother finds the tickets and burns them .In fact , Jam 's mom takes him away to a private Catholic detention school where he can be better monitored .Undeterred , Trip breaks out of shop class , calls a radio station in Detroit and wins front row seats .Hawk encourages Lex to steal his mom 's car , so that they can go bust Jam out of school and go see Kiss .Hawk laces a pizza with drug filled mushrooms , gives it to the headmaster / priest of the school and steals Jam away .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hawk ends up getting drunk , stripping and losing his virginity to an older woman .Jam gets caught again by his mother who hides him in a Catholic church .There , Jam loses his virginity in a confessional booth with his high school admirer .Lex gets chased by attack dogs and rescues Christine from some would - be rapists .Finally , Trip thwarts a convenience store robbery , gets attacked by thugs and has his wallet stolen .All these complications aside , the boys make one last ditch effort to see Kiss .This movie tries to have the charm of AMERICAN GRAFFITI and the cleverness of DAZED AND CONFUSED .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While there exists a small pleasure in seeing dimwitted fellows pursue their goal , they go about it with complete abandonment to any rules involving fornication , alcohol use , drug use , theft , assault , and disobedience to parents .Jam 's mother , while obviously concerned for her son , is a chain - smoking , unfeeling woman more concerned about superficial piety than being a good parent .Her zealousness is portrayed very negatively .Likewise , the Catholic priests in the movie are portrayed either as ignorant or lechers .This anti - Christian bias completely overshadows the whole picture and ends up being the primary opposing force to the protagonists ' objectives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "DETROIT ROCK CITY bests FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH and even AMERICAN PIE at showing all aspects of youthful rebellion .It is not a movie for teenagers , and it will hold little nostalgic appeal for adults .Only the most ardent and hardened Kiss fans who themselves made a pilgrimage to see Kiss can appreciate this tough comedy .The members of Kiss gave this movie their blessing and even appear in it at the end .Hence , one can only conclude that they do indeed give honor to rebellion and lawlessness and give service to Satan after all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "When his dreams of becoming a pop music sensation he tries out for a band and that band is DETROIT METAL CITY .And with his talent for writing good Metal music DETROIT METAL CITIES popularity soars and they get bigger and bigger .Funny thing is that Negishi does not like Heavy Metal , he does n't like the brutality of the music , or the violent lyrics or the fact that he has to wear corpse paint and wear a theatrical costume and pretend he is a demonic rapist from hell !And he is terrified of his manager who is really the driving force behind DETROIT METAL CITY and will not let Negishi leave the band .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "He is a true rock star but so out of touch with the Metal scene and he is just a old man now .Another thing I did not realize about DETROIT METAL CITY is that it will remind you of METALOCALYPSE and I found out that DETROIT METAL CITY was a manga and a anime before the movie came out .And like METALOCALYPSE it is funny and it is stupid , and silly , but as it progressed I could see that DETROIT METAL CITY actually had a heart .Negishi lives by a motto that no music equals no heart and believes in his music and it 's ability to inspire others to do what they love .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
