{"text": "Zero Dark Thirty .Strong Female Character , But Dangerous Messages .So I started writing this piece yesterday .I came home all amped up from having enjoyed Zero Dark Thirty and I wanted to blog about how awesome I felt the female character was in it .In the process of researching what other people were saying to bolster my views , I came across some very legitimate concerns of the film 's depictions of torture ( details later . )It changed how I felt about the film in general , and I decided to go back and think about things with this new found information .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( What an important reminder that your own personal interpretation of things , while valid and important , can often be incomplete without interacting with others and listening to what 's out there . )I 'll try to keep this relatively spoiler free , but no guarantees .But , let 's be honest ... this one of those pre - spoiled movies .It 's called history .Anyway , I had the chance to see Zero Dark Thirty last night at an advanced screening .I went in interested , but skeptical .I like Kathryn Bigelow .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And I was excited when she became the first woman to win an Oscar for best director .But I was n't surprised that the honor went to woman who had just directed a film that was so deeply male centric .So when I heard that Bigelow 's next feature was another war film , I kind of rolled my eyes .But then I saw the trailer and I became really intrigued .It had something which The Hurt Locker lacked ... a prominent female character .Ok , Bigelow , you have my attention .Before I go on , I want to be perfectly blunt about this : there 's nothing I like about the war film genre .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I see it as just a bunch of hyper - masculine posturing and senseless violence which is glorified because of \" patriotism \" and \" honor . \"And this feeling goes beyond my movie preferences .For example , while I believe he was a deeply evil person , I did n't cheer when Osama Bin Laden 's death was announced .( I do n't celebrate death in a general way . )And I similarly did n't feel an urge to cheer when this occurred in the film .But within this same film exists a story about a very strong woman , created by women .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That is what she got right with The Hurt Locker and her eye for creating it carries on into Zero Dark Thirty .Beyond that , Bigelow and Jessica Chastain ( who plays the lead , Maya ) tell a story about a woman who is extremely compelling and quite strong .Maya is serious about her job .She pushes through even when it becomes too much for many of her male colleagues .Chastain recently shared some excellent insights about Maya : .When I read the script , from the very beginning I was shocked that there was a woman at the centre of it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Why would I be so shocked ?Of course , a woman could have done this .You start looking at lead female characters in film , they 're usually defined by the men in their lives .They 're either the victim of the man or the love interest of the man .Maya is not .She 's not protected or mentored really ...She 's intelligent , capable , and she can stand on her own .I agree .I was really impressed with this character .She 's a leader .She 's disciplined .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maya is really the central focus of the film , and that 's a tale that could have gone untold .We could have continued to hear the story involving a bunch of Navy Seal dudes , without any mention of a woman behind it all .But here Bigelow and Chastain bring to life a very real woman ( who is still currently undercover . )Throughout the film Maya is mostly interacting with male colleagues and detainees , but there are a few other female characters and it does pass the Brechdel test .Bigelow herself made some very feminist comments recently , saying how Zero Dark Thirty is \" a real tribute to three or four very , very strong women .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , like I mentioned , in researching for this post , I came across so many concerns about the torture content in the film .Critics feel that the film depicts torture as a necessary evil instead of just evil .And the more I think about it , the more I feel that the criticism is well founded .While screenwriter Mark Boal 's narrative does n't explicitly say , \" tortue gave us Bin Laden ! \" the story certainly does cloud the sequence of events and sends an inaccurate implication that torture led to raid on Bin Laden 's compound .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film conveys the unmistakable conclusion that torture led to the death of bin Laden .That 's wrong and dangerously so , precisely because the film is so well made .The more I read on the subject the less excited I began to feel about the film .I mean , what I liked about it ( rich suspense , captivating story line , and strong women ) could have been maintained without creating the illusion that torture was effective ( and therefore , perhaps , justified . )And the more I contemplated it , the more frustrated I became that this amazing female character ( Maya ) occurred within the context of all this violence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It just rang true with my previous concerns of Bigelow winning the Oscar because she was appealing to stereotypically masculine audiences .So in taking a second look at the film , I 've come to the ultimate conclusion that I ca n't really call Zero Dark Thirty a \" feminist film . \" Yes , it contains a strong female character , but to me , a feminist film would n't send such a potentially dangerous and flat out inaccurate message about torture and the justified use of violence .I 'm not saying that it would sugar coat the realities of the world , but it certainly would n't take liberties to re - tell the story in this manner .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is , from a cinematic / storytelling / entertainment perspective .But it is also one which ca n't be taken as truth and and I hope that its viewers take this into consideration .I suppose that could be said about everything .As I often say , it 's so important to be a critical consumer of media , for these very reasons .2 comments : .Let me preface this by saying I have not read any of your previous posts , and so I may not have your same definition of feminism .I just saw ZDT the previous night and concur with a lot of what you said about how impressive it was that Maya 's gender was barely a factor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That said , I do not believe it is necessarily a feminist movie , but I ALSO do not believe it is a legitimizing torture .My reasons for both are as follows .I feel that based on my definition of feminism that film does not meet this criteria due to not directly addressing the issues of patriarchal influence on an individual 's life , rather it is a film which is an EXAMPLE of gender equality .I too , do not believe that making a film with a female protagonist , even a strong one , is automatically feminist ; rather such a film is evidence of a widening acceptance for the diversity of female roles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would argue that the violence in the film is essential to emphasize how the task force is victimized in some way , be it physical danger , or the mental cost .Now , onto the less savory aspects of the film .Torture is of course , abhorrent .There 's no indication that torturing him led to him finally breaking , and if anything it seems to imply that treating him like a hero ( An altogether different tactic ) led him to abandon his cause .If anything , the events in the film seem to indicate that without people like Maya , devoted , resourceful , and smart , no one would have followed the trail to it 's very end ; regardless of what they got through their interrogations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I want propose that the most important message of the film is the cost of this manhunt on Maya herself .This is a classic case of showing the dangerous of obsession with retribution , and rather than showing her triumphant , that final scene show her realizing how achieving her goal has done nothing visible .Though bringing him to justice may have made a symbol of U.S. power and perhaps gave the government and people hope , all we see in that scene is how the obsession with killing him had blinded her from any thoughts of the future .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thanks for your very thoughtful comments .I 'll tackle the part about does the film take a stance on torture first .Like I mentioned , when I first watched the film , I did n't walk away thinking , \" Damn that movie was pro torture !\" I think it is ambiguous but that means there 's legitimacy to the interpretation that it does endorse torture .There 's no indication that torturing him led to him finally breaking , and if anything it seems to imply that treating him like a hero ( An altogether different tactic ) led him to abandon his cause .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But to me , the problem here is that the prisoner character is n't based on a real person or a true series of events .He represents a composite of MANY actual detainees and by collapsing all those people down to just him , it can make it appear like his fear of further torture inspires him to tell them the truth .You say that the dinner setting is them tricking him , while that plays a critical role .So the chosen story arch of using that ONE character who was tortured and then treated w/ kindness , a meal , etc . makes it look like the torture at least played a role .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think there was unnecessary ambiguity pumped into the story .It was probably done to keep the cast down to a smaller number of character for simplicity , but the fact remains that it 's a pretty big issue to simplify and leave open to this interpretation when we know the reality of the true life situation .It feels like they 're playing loose and fast with it for no good reason .If they had created a totally fictional psychological thriller , I 'd get it , but this is supposed to be grounded in reality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was going to add in some extra thoughts about how the movie does n't really directly confront gender issues in high level defense related government work ( and there are many ! )but I thought I had already rambled on enough ... so yes , I agree with you about that .While Maya is strong , her character and the film do n't necessarily take that next step to ask the viewed to think critically about her gender or societal structures .This blog has strict comment moderation intended to preserve a safe space .Moderation is managed solely by the blog author .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
