{"text": "Increasing the Value of Your Property with Home Improvements .Posted February 4 , 2011 4:54am .When you start thinking about selling your home , you also start thinking about getting the best price possible for it .Making it look good will attract buyers and increase its value .That does not necessarily mean it will increase your home 's selling price .Nor does it mean you 'll get back all the money you invested .The type of project that will give you the best return depends on how close you are to selling , as well as the starting value of your house .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also , upgrades in an older home are more valuable than upgrades in an already modern one .Finally , some improvements do n't increase value much , but they do prevent decreases in value and/or they encourage buyers to take a look .Fix - It and Short - Term Projects for Increasing Property Value .If you are almost ready to put your home on the market , cosmetic improvements are your best bet .A house that looks clean and well maintained will attract more buyers and usually go for a higher price than one that looks lived - in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Repair anything that 's broken or does n't work right , including : .Broken windows .Doors that stick or do n't close right .Broken air - conditioning .Light fixtures .Plumbing .Fencing .Cracked concrete .Reseal the driveway .Replace missing or damaged roof shingles .If your roof is nearing the end of its life , you may need to replace it .This is one of those projects that may not add value but will make the home easier to sell .If you 're selling soon , but not necessarily right away , evaluate your home as if you were a potential buyer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The longer a house stays on the market , the less you 'll end up getting for it .Redo the landscaping : A poorly maintained yard , or half - dead trees and bushes may cause buyers to give your home a pass without looking closer .Make the building exterior inviting : Clean and/or repaint siding , paint the trim or front porch .Rethink your flooring : Remove old , stained carpeting .If you have hardwood flooring underneath , refinish instead of recovering it .Paint the walls : Even though new owners will probably repaint , you can make tired rooms look fresh with a coat of white paint .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Make minor upgrades : If they bring your home into line with similar ones in the neighborhood , they will help you get a good price .Avoid major upgrades unless rooms are dated , like for example , a 1970s avocado - green kitchen .Also , if you have an older home with popcorn ceilings or walls , having it professionally removed can improve salability .Long - Term Projects for Increasing Property Value .If you 're looking ahead to selling someday but want to make improvements now that you can enjoy for a few years , some big projects can give you a good return on investment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Americans love space , so additions can increase property values significantly .Keep in mind that you do want to keep your home 's overall size in line with the rest of the neighborhood .If you do n't want to add rooms , try adding a wood deck .In some areas , you can recoup as much as 90 % of your investment .The popularity of green home improvements keeps rising .Many people are willing to pay more for a home with these features , because they know they 'll make up the cost with lower utility bills .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Finally , keep up with maintenance projects on your home .This is the best way to prevent deterioration that can decrease property values .Monday , June 18 , 2007 .Enlistment Day .It was a very familiar feeling .The dread and misery was there .However , the difference was that it occurred 3 years ago and it 's not me , but my brother .Today 's my brother 's enlistment day .Strange enough , I felt the dread I experienced 3 years ago even though it was not my enlistment day .It was as if I am being enlisted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The taxi ride was long since we stayed in Jurong .Mum cried along the way .I remember those tears .She cried a lot when I was enlisted .It was 3 years ago , but somehow it felt so real .We reached the interchange and went to the bus that will lead us to the jetty .The queue was already there in the early morning .I looked around and saw young men with their family / friends / relatives / girlfriends .They were all in different shapes and sizes .Some looked fit while others looked unfit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Before I entered , I turned my head and saw two ladies crying .I think that they are the mum and sister / girlfriend of the enlistee .It was a sad scene .I remembered when it was my enlistment day , my mum cried so often that it made my day even worse .It 's one thing to be enlisted , it 's another thing to see your mum cry .Yet they are both similar in that they can really ruin your day .In the bus , I looked around and the road seemed familiar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wo n't say that they are good memories .The long and winding road seemed to reflect the confusion and dread I had then of being enlisted .Why the dread and all ?Well , the transition from civilian to military is definitely a very tough change .It 's worse than puberty .Bad analogy I know .I remembered how on our first day we were treated in a distasteful manner .One sergeant entered the room and kicked the red pail on the floor .It flew across the room .Luckily it did n't injure anyone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We are humans .We are all Singaporeans .If you want respect , you can begin by showing respect and not by kicking a pail .The pail was not all .He shouted and gave a very black face .He asked us to sign some forms .My friend signed his signature and his signature touched some line .Guess what happened ?The sergeant flared up !Oh please , it 's only a signature .It 's not as if he lost the first prize for Toto or his house was on fire .What followed was a fine and exquisite show of skilled expletives that so smoothly flowed out of his mouth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I guess that 's the only talent he has , or at least that 's the impression I had then .All these pail kicking and expletives just on the first day .So you can imagine the despair one would feel away from family and with people like the sergeant who is suppose to take care of you .Ironic .I grew angry at all of these and then the bus reached the jetty .We alighted and waited for the fastcraft , which is something like a boat that ferries people from mainland Singapore to Pulau Tekong .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I guess it 's natural as they wo n't be experiencing what I experienced .Why ?Because the intake was a PES E intake .A PES E intake consist of only a 1 week stay instead of 3 months or 6 months .Also , the recruits are treated very nicely because of their PES E status .So what 's this PES E anyway ?In short it means that an enlistee is unfit for strenuous and demanding physical activities .The sergeant on duty informed us the fastcraft reached and told us to board it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My family and I sat down in the fastcraft .We gave some advice to my brother like drinking lots of water and making sure that he gets enough sleep .The overall mood then was light .The my mum shed tears again .It reminded me of the same thing that happened 3 years ago .3 years ago , I sat down in the fastcraft with thoughts of what life would be like in the army .Would I adapt well ?Would the people be fierce ?That 's a stupid question I know .I looked at my mum and saw tears .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I turned to look at my dad and saw a distressed faced .It was also sad .I looked in front and just prayed for the best .Back to reality , the horn sounded .I recognized that sound .We have reached .I looked at my family and this time they looked much better than 3 years ago .We alighted from the fastcraft and went to Pulau Tekong .After walking through the main entrance , the enlistees went to a certain place while the visitors were given a tour of the place .Everything looked the same .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then we arrived at Mohawk and Leopard company .It all looked so familiar .My brother is posted to Leopard while I was posted to Mohawk 3 years ago .They are just beside each other but things operate differently .It was like two different worlds placed side by side .Anyway , I was happy that my brother was in Leopard .Leopard is good .We went into a lecture room and were briefed about the things the current soldier has .I learn that a lot of things has changed since my time .For example , the field bag is different .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After it , we were directed to the auditorium .We were guided to the auditorium .It looked the same .There , we watched a video on NS stuff .Then suddenly , I heard something .I looked behind and it confirmed my suspicions .A senior looking man was sleeping and snoring so loudly !Oh man , that was so unprofessional .The lady beside himr looked at the senior man and produced a smile .Anyway , after the video ended , a major gave a talk .He sounds sincere and nice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After the talk , we went for a meal at the cook house .The food was the same I had tasted 3 years ago .Same taste .They said that the food now is now much better .I ca n't imagine how it was then .Maybe I am just so used to food in the mainland .I did n't eat a lot as somehow , the longer I stayed there , the more I am reminded of how my first impression was and it totally destroyed my appetite .They say first impression counts and I believe so .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was a total turn off .Yes , I made good friends and would say that the OVERALL experience I had was okay , but that first day was totally off , it really ruined my day .Of course as time passed by , I soon got adjusted to the scoldings and expletives mouthed .Anyway , after the lunch , we went home .At the checkpoint , my brother went with the others to this training shack and the visitors ( us included ) went to the fastcraft back to the mainland .Finally ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Surprise ?Yes .If I were in her shoes , I may have kids already since I am older than her .Yet in conservative Medan , it 's no surprise that girls marry young and stay at home to be a housewife .Anyway , I heard news that she 's having a hard time .She is required to mop the whole house two times a day ; wait on the husband when he comes back home ; not allowed to visit her mother ... etc .In short , her life is tough .It seems as if her mother - in - law is giving her a hard time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've seen the mother - in - law and she does look kinda ... scary .I can only wish the best for her future .This made me think .My friend from there lives on with such a life , but would a modern Singaporean wife live on with such treatment ?Are they different ?No , both are girls and love their husband to the point of marriage .The only difference is society and their upbringing .Here in Singapore , women are encourage to think , are independent and work until late in their lives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
