{"text": "Pages .How much did I hate \" Rise of the Silver Surfer \" ?I hated it so much I ca n't even quantify it .Why is it so bad ?It desperately wants to be a comedy .It goofs in our faces , smirks , elbows , then expects us to smile and laugh with it .Nothing is as embarrassing as a bad comedy .Or a bad action comedy .Worst moment : Exposure to the Silver Surfer causes Johnny 's molecules to become unstable .This leads to swapping powers when any of the other of the Fantastic Four touch him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She screams hysterically and rises into the air .An amazed Reed Richards sees her hovering outside the window .Shouting to her through the thick protective plate glass window : \" You 're on fire , \" ( at least I think this was what he said ) , she responds with a Valley Girl : \" Ya think ? \"Johnny , who quickly swaps powers with Reed , stretches , grabs her , and brings her down to the sidewalk .There , she loses the power of flame , and is on the street----Naked ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "oh wait .lemme ... catch a breath ... HAHAHAHAHAHA .I was going to walk out after this scene , I almost never walk out on anything .I think the last film that I walked out on was The Exorcist : Part Two .However , I went with a friend , and so we suffered to the end of an insufferable film .What else was wrong with this bit of Rupert Murdock garbage ?As predicted , Dr. Doom continues to be a cruel injustice to a magnificent villain .Standing tall , whining , waxed eyebrows hunching , he is the least malevolent bad guy imaginable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I guess the producers felt that such a pretty face should n't be covered .Another indignity was the silver surfer who ( if you love the surfer as a comic book hero , then brace yourself ) draws his power from his surf board .So separate the man from the board and you beat him .Finally , Galactus , the cloud .What a great idea .Let 's reduce the giant menace from a God to a cloud .Boy that will scare the kiddies .Puffs of cloud reaching for the planet . ooooooooh .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer wins awards for worst film of the year .I promised myself I would n't see this crap and I broke my promise .I make a new promise though , and it 's one I promise not to break : I will see no more of this franchise .Although given how atrocious this is , I ca n't imagine another one seeing light of day .15 comments : .If you read my review then you of course know I had the opposite opinion of it , again because I was n't invested in the comic and thought the movie was just fine , another summer popcorn film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That is what I want explained .Carl , no offense , but if this was your idea of a fine popcorn movie , then your bar is awfully low .How could Galactus have been presented ?How about as a large face ... seen in the mind of the surfer .That personalizes it and makes the idea of the entity less absurd as it travels through space .Then , the cloud would have been how Galactus reached out and touched the world .I have been laying in bed thinking about carl 's statement , trying to come to terms with how he or anyone else could have liked this film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I also tried getting my head around the idea that this is a family friendly film .It is .It is .The conservative group , the Parents Television Council will be delighted .Anyone under eight will be delighted .They wo n't have to ask an adult to explain a thing to them .I did n't love the first f4 movie and thought this was an improvement .Not the best but did n't expect it to be .Gallactus is based on the one from the ultimate universe thus the swarm rather then giant dude .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Personaly Doom is what lets these films down big time ... .I did n't mean to give you a sleepless night , Stewart , I 'm sorry ! ! !For the most part I stand really strongly behind my movie preferences but I 'm not sure I am always good at differentiating what I like vs. what I thought was amazing in my reviews .Was FF amazing ?No .But you must remember that I am being 100 % honest when I say that I have no ties at all to this film , nor any emotional investment in the franchise at all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not something I wanted to own , but something I was glad I saw in the theatre .What I was most pleased about , having several friends with very young children , is that both FF movies appear to be made more for family viewing , rather than for older kids and adults .I 'm sure this is not what fans of the franchise want , but I was fine with it .It is rare that I get to go to movies with my friends AND their kids , so I take those opportunities when I can .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We all have our guilty pleasure films and I imagine everyone , even the most snobbish movie critic ( I am pointing specifically to the one in my home town ) , has movies that are n't critically well done that they can not help but enjoy .I ca n't lie and say that I did n't enjoy FF II when I did , that is just the way it is .Is my bar set low , maybe .If I have to compare it with the mess that was Spiderman 3 , then yes , my bar is set low .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would rather go to a movie , be entertained , and if I liked it great , if I did n't , then I try to vocalize why I did not .Like I 've said , I certainly can not critize anyone for hating this film , because everyone who saw it had their own expectations , etc . going into it and thus had their own experience .Mine , and that of those I went with , was to enjoy it for what it was .I do n't need every movie to be a masterpiece or for every movie to be complicated .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For the most part they are the forgettable films that you go to with the gang , enjoy , and then move on .Looking back on the experience , the selling point for me was the scenes out in space .Being a huge sci fi geek , I love seeing space scenes in films and the planet exploding at the beginning of the movie and the way they portrayed Galactus really appealed to me as a sci fi fan .Had those elements not been in the film , I personally might have had a much different experience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do think portraying Galactus the way that he looks in the comics would have been stupid in the extreme , but that does n't mean this was the best way to do it .Again , it worked for me because I thought the effect was well done and because I am not invested in the actual character .Get some sleep Stewart !I wo n't be shouting about FF : Rise from the rooftops like I do with films like Pan 's Labyrinth , the LOTR trilogy , etc .I 've seen it once , will most likely never see it again , and soon will no doubt give a glowing review to some other film that no one but me likes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "in my world , that means Final Fantasy :) .But I 'm a gamer nerd , and I accept that about myself .On the whole , I agree with Stewart , and so does the hubby .When it was all over , the first thing he said to me was , \" I 'm sorry \" .It was his choice to see it .I personally wanted a dose of man candy from Pirates , but now he owes me , so I 'm sure I 'll get it .Some other thoughts and notes are on my blog , I wo n't spoil the surprise , lol ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I last saw The Wizard of Oz many , many years ago and do n't remember specifics .I 've seen it maybe twice in my life and it 's not on my list of all - time favorites or anything .This is my way of saying I approached this prequel with an open mind and did n't compare it to the classic .James Franco plays Oscar ( get it ? ) , a low - rent magician at a Kansas carnival in 1905 , seducing his assistant and anything in a skirt .He 's bound to run into an angry boyfriend or two , but when one of the jealous guys happens to be the carnival 's strong man , Oz escapes by jumping into a hot air balloon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She tells him that because of a prophecy , Oz has been waiting for him to come rescue the land from an evil witch .Oscar is n't interested in being the savior of anything , until Theodora 's sister ( Rachel Weisz ) shows him all the gold that could be his if he accepts the challenge .There are nods to the classic movie , such as Glinda flying inside a bubble ( which is clear , not pink ) , Munchkins , and flying monkeys .And of course , Glinda and the Wicked Witch .It 's hard making a purely good person interesting , but Williams , while not required to flex all the skills in her arsenal , glows with decency and grace .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And though Oscar starts out as a cheat and liar , he turns into the hero , something that 's not a good fit for Franco , who seems more comfortable in oddball roles .It 's clear lots of money was spent on the production , and some of the visuals might make you feel like a kid watching fireworks at Disneyland ( I saw the 2D version ; it might look even better in 3D ) .But fireworks last only for a short time .At over two hours , this road to Oz is long and winding .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's kind of what I expected with this one .I actually really dislike the original movie , which I know is sacrilege to some , but to me , it 's only ok .So this is n't one I 'll rush to see , but I am curious to see how everything plays out .Thanks for the review !I 've seen the original WAAAYYYY too many times ; hubby is of the school that requires a showing each Sunday before Thanksgiving ( when it aired when we were kids - I usually opt out ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thanks for backing up my instinct .I am on the sam page as both Jenn and Jann .Seen it ( and It 's A Wonderful Life ) way too many times .Still tradition is fun , especially if you have one of your nieces or nephews with you and a big bowl of popcorn .From the trailer and clips I have seen on talkshows , I was pretty sure this was going to be a miss for me .You are so right about Franco .He needs to let his freak flag fly to be watchable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't watch it ritualistically , but I 'm excited about sharing it as well as this new addition with my kiddos .I feel like maybe the marketing for it was a bit over - the - top , but I guess they wanted to get it out there .Who knows ?Still I 'm excited it was even \" just ok \" because hopefully that means it will at least be a fun getaway .Great review !There are some scenes that may be too intense for your kids .The flying baboons are mean .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
