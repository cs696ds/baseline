{"text": "Launching us from a grave past to a space - age future , these two thrilling double features , from producers Richard and Alex Gordon , spin classic tales of hair - raising homicidal mania and intrepid , death - defying exploration .Featuring Boris Karloff in two of his most horrifying roles ( The Haunted Strangler and Corridors of Blood ) , and two classic sci - fi treats from the atomic age .Corridors of Blood ( 1958 ) .Unfortunately , the road to general anesthesia is blocked by a ruthless killer ( Christopher Lee ) , as well as Bolton 's devastating addiction to his own chemical experiments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "DVD Release Date : January 23rd , 2007 3 transparent Keep Cases with overlapping spindle - holders ( see image above )Chapters : various .NOTE :The 4 main features of this boxset are on dual - layered discs although only one exceeds a 4.7 Gig size so the dual layering seems mostly superfluous .They are housed in two individual transparent keep cases ( see image above ) - discs overlapping on dual spindles .The covers are on opposing sides of the case .They are not sold separately at this time and can only be obtained in Criterion 's Monsters and Madmen Boxset .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Those who know me and have read some of my comparable genre reviews on this site may recognize that I am a big sucker for 1950 's modest production sci - fi and horror features .I find them the perfect diversion from the often heavy art films that are my first love and that the DVDBeaver site is better known for .So , I am thankful that , perhaps , someone at Criterion feels that same way - hence this unique package .Image : All four are progressively transferred and in their original screen ratio ( 1.33:1 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For the most part they look very good , perhaps even better than the screen captures will indicate .At times they can look exceptional and other times acceptably average .The Haunted Strangler , Corridors of Blood and The Atomic Submarine are fairly even but First Man into Space is a bit weaker with some dirt and digital noise showing through .For films of this ilk these look as good as they ever will on digital disc .NOTE :All four , to my knowledge , have been released previously on DVD ( by Image Entertainment in region 1 ) - and if history is any judge they are most probably in very frugal transfers with bare - bones extras and no subtitles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is expected that there is some dynamic weakness considering the age of the films but it is easily good enough for standard viewing .The mono tracks sound very consistent and discernable .All 4 features have optional white ( black border ) subtitles in English at Criterion 's usual level of completeness .Extras - the package is stacked with a commentary for each film by the principles ( producers Alex and Richard Gordon and writer Tom Weaver ) .They are kind of fun for the most part but if you are expecting a Tony Rayns level of film analysis or critique you will no doubt be disappointed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I found the ' Censors cuts ' interesting - what was and was not allowed , so as to adhere to code - and why .Plus there are some fairly extensive little liner notes booklets included ( 2 ) that show some care went into their production ( perhaps more so than in any of the creation of the films themselves ) .Like much of what Criterion does - this is not going after the biggest slice of the pie .These particular films are downright bad , by any standard , and most people will not really get into the enjoyable ' popcorn ' feel that this package aims towards .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you ever get in the mood they make nostalgic and fun double features .As long as you know what you are in for - we warmly ecommend ! 19th - century English author James Rankin ( Boris Karloff ) believes that the wrong man was hanged twenty years earlier for a series of murders , but his investigations lead him to a horrible , and , for him , gruesomely inescapable secret .In 1840s London , Dr. Thomas Bolton ( Boris Karloff ) dares to dream the unthinkable : to operate on patients without causing pain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
