{"text": "The editing and camerawork was sub - par , to the point of seriously detracting from the viewing experience .The script was amateur and forced .At just under an hour in length , it was still difficult to get through .Even the opening and closing theme music seemed entirely inappropriate to the material .However , in researching the film , both before and after viewing , virtually all the reviews and feedback I found regarding it were resoundingly positive .And this has been a situation echoed many times since I began the Vault .This time , I was tired of saying nothing about it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "B - Sol at The Vault of Horror , in writing his review for the movie Serial : Amoral Uprising , has touched upon the dirty little black book too many horror movie reviewers carry around with them .Now I have not seen Serial : Amoral Uprising .I can not say if it 's good or bad or middling or whether it 's worth watching or not .This is not the point , I think , B - Sol is trying to make ( although he clearly did not like the movie ) .What surprised him -- maybe not surprise , let 's say irked him -- is how a movie , which measured badly on many critical points , could receive only glowing reviews ; not one , but many .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The answers are in that dirty little black book .When I first started blogging I eagerly sought after screeners .I wanted to be a movie critic and I believed screeners would be a great way to hone my critical skills .Basic camerawork , basic scene setups , basic storytelling , basic acting , and all those basic craft things taught in school -- or by hard knocks -- to produce a watchable movie were ignored outright , or worse , trifled with .I began to feel insulted .I also felt embarrassed , even intimidated , because I had asked for many of them and I felt compelled to not write a bad review .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This was not , and is not , a good place to be put in .I 'm not saying all the screeners I received were bad .I 've had good and rewarding indie movies come my way , and through them I 've developed relationships with directors , actors , and writers who 've helped me grow as a blogger and critic .Some were skilled people who knew their way around a camera , and others who , with a little more budget , a little more practice , and a little more experience would improve their craft ; their movie showed that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No balanced reviews , just kudos for clearly what should have been recognized as poor filmmaking .Of course I stopped reading those reviewers , some of whom were connected to commercial horror websites .Either their critical acumen was questionable , or they simple did n't want to hurt someone 's feelings , or they did n't want to be shut out from receiving more screeners .That last one can be found in that dirty little black book 's table of contents under How to Keep Getting Screeners By Not Biting the Hand That Gives .It 's a situation every movie blogger , and especially horror blogger , eventually faces , and one which test 's your professionalism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Worse still , you are letting down those who most need the feedback from your honest appraisal : the directors , writers , actors , and production people who need these reality checks to help them improve their craft .Roger Ebert provides some very good guidelines for dealing with situations like these and how to review movies while keeping your integrity intact .I recommend reading his little rule book for any movie blogger who takes his or her writing and reputation seriously .Comments .Sean , yes , interviews are very important .They provide the background to help understand where creative people are coming from and why decisions are made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've interviewed people whose movies I may not have liked , but I still enjoyed speaking with them and learned a lot .I could n't agree more , but I wonder if there 's room for doing a positive interview or profile on the filmmaker , even if they 've made a bad film ?My blog is almost entirely interviews of queer filmmakers , or filmmakers that have made films with queer content .I 'd hate to have this seen as giving a good review when one is n't warranted .I hope that profiles of filmmakers , good or bad , can be taken as just that - profiles meant to entertain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've only been offered three screeners , turned them all down .It 's not that I would not mind watching said films and reviewing them , but I really do n't have the time .Also , even if I did not like the film , I 'd feel obliged to write something about it .I 've found that it does seem a lot of times that writers are simply afraid to hurt people 's feelings .Which has to make me ask , why do you want to review movies , then ?You have to have a thick skin , or do n't bother writing reviews .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To LYZ , I agree that 's very unfortunate , but clearly this filmmaker is an egomaniacal dolt .This is also the chance you take when reviewing movies -- many critics are unpopular , and if you decide to be one , even as a blogger or amateur online writer , you have to be willing to deal with that if need be .Otherwise , do n't do it .Reviewing movies should NOT be a method for making friends with filmmakers .Writing movie reviews , and being a journalist , should n't be about how many friends you make it should be about how well written your reviews are .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I always take budget constraints and the like into consideration , but I would n't ever lie about how the movie itself is .Some film makers are very happy about getting an honest review while others did n't talk to me afterwards .Fim makers have got to realise that not everybody will totally like their film , and if they do n't have a thick skin then they should n't be in the business of making films in the first place .I learned the hard way to be careful about what you say in a review .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
