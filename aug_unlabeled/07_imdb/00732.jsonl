{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .I just got my copy of Family Guy Volume 10 and its great !I now have ALL 10 of the Family Guy season DVDs .I was a bit reluctant buying the new DVD on Amazon as I do n't do that regularly but everything is fantastic !I am pretty happy I got the DVD for only $ 26 before taxes since the price is $ 33 before taxes .I would definitely recommend this DVD especially if you need a good laugh from a tough time .I look forward to enjoying it even more !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The product image does not even match what I 've received !It seems like this is a picture of a cardboard slipcover ...The one I received from Amazon does not have any and the artwork is different .It looks like its missing the slipcover .Furthermore , the DVDs come in one of those cheap plastic cases that has holes in it .It seems that with every volume since volume 6 Fox packages the Family Guy DVDs in cheaper packaging each time !As a huge fan of the series , I really feel like I 've been taken advantage of on this one !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Just to be clear to everyone , this is NOT SEASON 10 .This is the remaining episodes from season 9 .The product description does not even state it as such either .Every place I have looked up shows season 10 with this cover but this is not the case .I rate this 3 stars due to this set not even mentioning air dates or any mention of it being season 9 episodes , not to mention how much space is filled with \" junk \" bonus material .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have been a huge fan of family guy since it came on .I make sure to buy next volume whenever its released on DVD so I can have all the episodes available to me .It 's always great to have episodes nobody has seen before so you can watch them together .Every year it seems like they put less episodes on the DVD release , and now are behind putting volumes out .( We all know that they are )They do it on purpose .They stopped caring about making people laugh , and decided to get greedy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Do nt waste your money , wait for the price to drop , or buy it used .I 'm not a very big Family guy fan anymore .It 's not even anywhere near as funny as it used to be .You can tell they are running out of ideas .I 'm surprised the show has n't been cancelled again .I have turned my attention to American Dad and the Cleveland Show .Do n't buy these unless you 're OCD like me and ca n't stand an unfinished collection .I love family guy and have just about all of it on DVD .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The cover image shown ( blue ) on the item purchase page is supposedly the hard paper sleeve that the plastic DVD case comes in .An object of some sort punctured the back , It was bad enough to tear the inside paper but the disc itself was not damaged .So I 'll let it slide and keep it .It 's just that what I receive should be what is pictured .Quality - wise , this three - disc collection , already out in the UK , is a very mixed bag .The only true candidate for classic status among these 14 epsiodes ( the remainder of Season Nine ) is Brian Writes a Best - Seller , a brilliant comeuppance for the more than usually full - of - himself pooch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But too many of the later ones come off like filler .For instance , the fight sequence in German Guy far exceeds its comedic life , while the full Jagger / Bowie Dancing in the Street video in Foreign Affairs is time - marking pure and simple .And at least subsequent DVD releases should finally get back to a convenient seasonal basis for the first time since Vol .But , overall , this represents a distinct drop - off in quality -- one that would continue into Season 10 .I use to be a big Family Guy fan , but I 'm coming to realize Family Guy has not topped the first 3 seasons .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fans are n't complaining because Family Guy is changing or evolving , we are complaining because the writing is poor and repeated .Family Guy now seems targeted to a typical 15 year old male audience .Volume 10 in particular had some of the least appealing episodes to me .And the only character growth we see is Lois becoming a horrible person .I use to see Lois as a matriarch of a dysfunctional family , but now she is mean and cruel for no apparent reason .You would think by not releasing seasons the volumes would be considerably cheaper .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
