{"text": "There really is n't much to say about them that has n't already been said , so I 'm going to do my best to keep things short .The Exorcist .The original film is a pop culture mainstay .As one of the first massive blockbuster releases of the post movie - brat era , it 's often forgotten how genuinely good The Exorcist is .Straight out of his Oscar shattering debut , the ne - plus - ultra of gritty crime dramas The French Connection , director William Freidkin had an amazing sense of inflated ego and something to prove when he started production on the film adaptation of William Peter Blatty 's original hit novel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The fact that a relatively slow moving , psychological horror film about the possession of a pre - teen girl could capture the attention of so many people is a product of the time it was made .Had the film premiered today , in its present form , it would most likely be written off as cheesy , boring , and ultimately ( and perhaps most shockingly ) not scary .Almost as interesting as a litmus test for a past society 's moral barometer and entertainment measure as it is a film , The Exorcist begs revisiting , even if it has become unfortunately dated in 33 years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After the novelty of shock value has long since warn off , we can admire the layered plot building and amazing acting chops .Had The Exorcist been made in the post-Scream ' 90s , those involved would 've most likely found it impossible to take the subject matter as seriously as necessary .At no point during this film is anyone 's tongue planted in his or her cheek , and this serious tone is what ultimately leads to the many critical dissections of it that followed its release .Like most ' 70s era , hard horror releases , it is an allegory for many real life issues , in this case divorce , puberty , dogma , and faith , and many others .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For the 30th Anniversary , director William Freidkin - who by the way never repeated the critical or monetary success of either of his first two films - re - edited the original film , and added new sound and visual effects .Obviously this decision was based largely on the success of the re - release of George Lucas ' original Star Wars Trilogy in 1997 , though this revamping proved to be far less controversial than Lucas ' .The new effects ( most of which are subliminal images ) are iffy , and like those of Star Wars , they did not blend into the original footage very well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's effectively creepy , but makes little sense , and makes the mistake of having the possessed Regan leave the confines of her bedroom , which at that point in the film was a mistake .In addition to this there are some other reinstated scenes throughout the picture that owners of the original DVD release may remember from the The Fear of God documentary .It appears that author Blatty finally nagged Friedkin enough to make things a little less up to interpretation .The revamped sound on the other hand is spectacular and almost the preferred way to view the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Based on the general youth consensus however , the film does n't quite transcend the generation gap .Exorcist II : The Heretic .The second Exorcist film is a great example of how not to follow up a massively successful motion picture .This would n't be the last time Warner Bros. would drop the ball on the franchise , but it was a great place to start .First off , if history has taught us anything , it 's that the audience usually wants more of the same out of a sequel .This is especially true when the first film left no room for a sequel in the first place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Exorcist II awkwardly tries to expand on the original 's story , but the plot makes almost no sense , and the film bares very little resemblance to Friedkin 's original .As best as I can explain it , the story revolves around the demon Pasuzu trying to repossess Regan , who 's now in college , having forgotten completely about her harrowing experience in the first film .To stop the demon , Father Philip Lamont tries to bring about Regan 's repressed memories through an experimental hypnotism process , which involves some silly Sci - Fi headgear .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The second failed step made in the pre - production process was the hiring of John Boorman , one of the most experimental men ever to work in mainstream Hollywood .Boorman is best know for his work on indispensable films like Point Blank and Deliverance , but has also directed such overdone fantasy epics as Zardoz and Excalibur ( both cult films , but undeniably weird ones ) .Boorman really goes for broke when it comes to bizarre touches , such as pre - digital layered effects , and a very long flashback sequence from the point of view of a locust .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The finished film is the utter disaster that history claims it to be , but this is what makes it somehow watchable today and not unlike watching a car crash as portrayed by Salvador Dali after a bout with e coli .The film also contains , in flashback , a third variation on Merrin 's past which differs from both of the later prequels .Exorcist III : Legion .Years after the complete debacle that was Exorcist II Warner Bros. found the courage to revisit the series again , only this time putting the writer of the original , William Peter Blatty , in charge of both writing and directing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Gruff cop , played gruffly by the always gruff George C. Scott is hot on his trail , but must deal with his own preconceptions of the supernatural and faith first .Blatty 's picture was pretty much ignored on its initial release , but garnered more praise than Boorman 's massive flop , which intelligently enough Blatty pretended never existed .After its release on video , the film gained some steam and a healthy cult following , as is want to happen in out post - internet day and age .Some now consider The Exorcist III on level with the original , but the truth is that like so many ' discoverd on video ' classics , it has become a tad over - praised by a vocal minority .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately , the final act is very muddled , only skidding by through Blatty 's visual flair .Word has it that Blatty was plagued by a lot of studio interference , and that the final act , especially , was compromised .Apparently the original book and screenplay did n't end with an exorcism scene at all ; a fact that once realized makes the scene even more painfully moot .This is the one film besides the original that may be a must see , but it only barely earns the tag .Exorcist : The Beginning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When someone at Warner Bros. ( or technically subsidiary company Morgan Creek ) first came up with the idea of making a film concerning the adventures of a young Father Merrin , director John Frankenheimer was brought on board .Unfortunately Frankenheimer died during pre - production , and Paul Schrader was brought on board .Schrader is best known for his dark work writing films like Taxi Driver , and directing films like Affliction .He seemed like a good choice .When Schrader delivered his final cut , the producers were none too happy .Apparently Schrader 's film was too psychological , and too understated .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Once again , Warner Bros. stepped in to muck about with an Exorcist film .Schrader was taken off the project and cheese processor Renny Harlin ( Deep Blue Sea , Cutthroat Island , Cliffhanger ) was brought aboard for re - shoots .After struggling to produce the thrill - machine Warner Bros. wanted , Harlin ended up partially recasting , and basically started from scratch .All this meddling did not bode well for the final film .When the film was finally released , the general public did n't seem to have a grasp on just how screwed up the filmmaking process had been , and The Beginning actually pulled in a decent opening weekend haul , all things considered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's too easy to blame Harlin for the film 's eventual self - destruction .Factually , Harlin was brought on as the hands of executives , and in the end was simply doing his job .The plot of the film follows a young Father Lankester Merrin ( played by Max Von Sydow in the original and here by Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd ) , a man down on his luck and faith , who 's confronted for the first time by the evil demon Pasuzu .Merrin has found solace in archeology , and has discovered an ancient church buried in the sands of East Africa .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Meanwhile , evil is afoot , and a war is about to break out between the natives and the British settlers .Exorcist : The Beginning was most reviled for its generally nasty nature ( showing a small boy torn limb from limb by ravenous hyenas and a lingering shot of a maggot infested still - born , for example ) .I do not pretend to think the film was not nasty , but personally feel that it was this nastiness that gave the film its one edge .For the most part there is nothing to separate this film from any other generic Exorcist rip - off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The worst offense the film commits , however , is its twist ending , which goes against the original films loose mythology , by changing the possessed individual .Dominion : Prequel to the Exorcist .After the fish - like flopping of Harlin 's film , Warner Bros. decided to release Schrader 's film after all , thanks to good early reviews and the fact that it had gained a bit of a mythic reputation over the internet .Suddenly we were left with two very different versions of the same film , something that had n't occurred in cinematic history ( as far as I know , and remakes do n't count ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Shockingly enough , it turned out that Warner Bros. may've been right ; Schrader had delivered a thrilless , boring motion picture .Not only this , but the drama was flat , the characters were just as uninteresting , and Schrader 's usual gritty touch was almost entirely absent .If anything , I 'd say that at least visually Harlin 's film has the edge , especially in texture , which Schrader should be expected to deliver .Dominion does deliver some creepy moments , but I was personally expecting a psychological experience on par with Taxi Driver , Raging Bull , Affliction , and Auto Focus .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It seems unfair to berate Schrader while letting Harlin off the hook , but I have to remember that Harlin was just doing a job , and had almost no creative interest in the project .This , we are expected to believe , is the best Schrader could do , and I for one know it is not .Video .As I said before , these are exactly the same as the previous releases , right down to the disc art .There has been no re - mastering .The original Exorcist is the same single layered disc released back in the early days of the format .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The colours and detail levels are muted , and there is a lot of cross - colouration , but overall the print is n't too bad .The re - release , on the other hand , is a revelation in clarity .When compared back - to - back it 's obvious that a lot of effort went into the reconstruction of the original negatives for the revamp .Colours are much richer , details are extremely sharp , and grain has been greatly minimized .If you can take the additional scenes and the added effects , The Version You 've Never Seen is by far the superior version .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Again , it is anamorphically enhanced , and has been cleaned .Details are n't the sharpest , but will do , and colours are relatively vibrant .Black levels are deep , and nearly noise free .There is some digital blocking on moving edges , but overall this is rather impressive .Exorcist III is another older DVD , and has some problems with noise mostly .But the release is anamorphically enhanced , and detail levels are decent , making it an average DVD watching experience .I must admit I was a bit impressed considering the disc 's age .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Beginning is the only film in the set that utilizes a widescreen 2.40:1 aspect ratio , and probably looks the best all around .Night time sequences are slightly muddy , but finding real fault is pretty much impossible .Dominion is a hair less crisp , but represents the film 's muted colour pallet well , and can not be faulted on any great level .Audio .The original DVD release of the original film was sort of awkwardly remixed from mono into Dolby Digital 5.1 .The track is very two - dimensional , and though the surround channels get some action , they always seem to be playing on the same volume frequency .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The re - release is , again , a revelation .Fidelity is very high , and the added bass track throbs most unsettlingly .Surround tracks are very aggressive , and directional effects are frighteningly effective .Once again , if you do n't mind the extra junk , this is the ideal way to watch the film on a modern home theater system .Exorcist II is the only disc in the set that is n't presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital audio .The disc retains the original mono soundtrack only , which despite box claims , only comes out of the center channel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dialogue is clear , and there 's very little distortion , even during the film 's louder moments .The only loss is Ennio Morricone 's wacko score , which sounds great on stereo CD , and probably could 've sounded even better in full - on surround sound .Part three has been semi - successfully remixed into 5.1 Dolby Digital , is more just loud than good .There are some effective surround effects , but dynamic range is severely lacking in separate channels .There is n't much distortion , and dialogue is plenty clear , but the track tends to just blare noise rather than sound .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's also the only one with an optional DTS track , which is basically a louder version of the Dolby Digital one .The Beginning is n't a very good film , but a lot of effort was put into its sound design , and the effort was worth it .Dominion on the other hand , sounds surprisingly flat , and even during the spooky scenes does n't raise too many neck hairs .The mix is crisp and realistic , but not exactly mind - shattering .Extras .Once again , in case you 've skipped the rest of my review for this section alone , these are not new DVDs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Warner Bros. has pretty much dropped the ball here , especially in the shadow of Fox 's Alien Quadrilogy re - release a few years back ( not to mention their own Superman collection due out this year ) .That set included long , well produced documentaries about each film in the series , and offered up a producer 's cut of the misunderstood Alien 3 .The original DVD release of The Exorcist was a flipper ( movie on one side , features on the other ) , and was a real special edition set when it came out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I never got the DVD , so I never knew how much of the documentary I 'd missed .From a fan standpoint , the bit of information I 'd missed on the truncated VHS version was the fact that El Topo sound designer , Gonzalo Gavira was brought on by Friedkin to help create the eerie effects track .If you do n't own the original DVD release , and are n't too hip on picking up all 5 films , you might want to track down a used copy just for this doc alone .The disc also features two commentary tracks , one from Blatty , one from Friedkin , just in case you had n't already learned everything you ever needed to know about The Exorcist from the doc .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are a few outtakes from the doc featuring an even longer discussion between the writer and director about the deleted scenes .The trailer and TV Spots are all tops , including the infamous ' flashing - faces ' trailer that was banned by the MPAA during the film 's reissue .The Version You 've Never Seen is a bare - bones release , with only another Friedkin commentary and a few trailers to show for itself .The commentary is pretty moot if you have the old one , as Friedkin hardly even mentions the reinstated scenes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Exorcist II is also barebones , though its teaser and trailer have to be some of my favourites of all time .The rhythmically quick - cut full trailer will get Morricone 's theme song stuck in your head like non - other .Fortunately for me , I own the CD .Sometimes the making of a flop can be even more interesting than the making of a classic , and a retrospective documentary could 've been a nice addition for this release .They could 've at least gotten a hold of Boorman for a commentary , he did a decent one on Point Blank with Steven Soderberg .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In light of Richard Donner 's Superman II finally seeing release , you 'd think Warner Bros. could 've looked into re - cutting their other fan favourite studio infiltration piece .I suppose the footage may've been lost , but we all know Blatty would be interested , based solely on his treatment of the original film .As is , the disc is barebones , featuring a only a trailer .The Beginning has an advertiser 's featurette , some trailers , and a Harlin commentary track .I 've always been a fan of Harlin 's track because he makes no qualms about the low - level ambition of most of his films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The base Harlin oh - so - delicately tip - toes around is the fact that this was not originally his film .There is almost no mention of the film 's sorted past , though this may've been implemented by the studio before the track was even recorded .Those who 've sat through the film will be happy to know that Harlin basically apologizes for the sub - par nature of the digitally created hyenas , and blames the short production period .Dominion also features a trailer and a collection of deleted scenes ( all of which are totally dispensable ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Schrader is another creative type that is good at speaking about his work , and the track is the closest we get in the set to a history of the doomed project .Schrader leaves too many blank spots on the track , but when he does speak it comes from the heart .I find myself thinking again of Fox 's Alien Quadrilogy box set , where the studio had the guts to make a feature length expose on their own breaking of Alien 3 .Had Warner Bros. and Morgan Creek had any guts , or want to please series fans , they would 've done something similar here for the prequels .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Overall .So , once again , if you already own the previous region one releases of these films , you have this set .The second film is a slightly fun oddity , and the prequels , though basically garbage , are interesting for historical and comparable reasons .Warner Bros. has , in my opinion , dropped the ball in not putting any effort into this release , unlike other , superior re - releases like the Alien Quadrilogy .Message Enter the message here then press submit .The username , password and message are required .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
