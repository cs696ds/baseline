{"text": "Even after this breakthrough , many years elapsed while scientists struggled with applications of Newton 's laws to explain the apparent motions of planets , moons , comets , and asteroids .Meanwhile , the first semblance of a modern theory was proposed by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant in 1755 .Early scientific theories .The Kant - Laplace nebular hypothesis .Kant 's central idea was that the solar system began as a cloud of dispersed particles .He assumed that the mutual gravitational attractions of the particles caused them to start moving and colliding , at which point chemical forces kept them bonded together .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Because Kant was highly versed in neither physics nor mathematics , he did not recognize the intrinsic limitations of his approach .His model does not account for planets moving around the Sun in the same direction and in the same plane , as they are observed to do , nor does it explain the revolution of planetary satellites .A significant step forward was made by Pierre - Simon Laplace of France some 40 years later .A brilliant mathematician , Laplace was particularly successful in the field of celestial mechanics .Besides publishing a monumental treatise on the subject , Laplace wrote a popular book on astronomy , with an appendix in which he made some suggestions about the origin of the solar system .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Knowing nothing about the source of energy in stars , Laplace assumed that the Sun would start to cool as it radiated away its heat .In response to this cooling , as the pressure exerted by its gases declined , the Sun would contract .According to the law of conservation of angular momentum , the decrease in size would be accompanied by an increase in the Sun 's rotational velocity .Centrifugal acceleration would push the material in the atmosphere outward , while gravitational attraction would pull it toward the central mass ; when these forces just balanced , a ring of material would be left behind in the plane of the Sun 's equator .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Similarly , a planet 's moons would have originated from rings produced by the forming planets .Laplace 's model led naturally to the observed result of planets revolving around the Sun in the same plane and in the same direction as the Sun rotates .Because the theory of Laplace incorporated Kant 's idea of planets coalescing from dispersed material , their two approaches are often combined in a single model called the Kant - Laplace nebular hypothesis .This model for solar system formation was widely accepted for about 100 years .During this period , the apparent regularity of motions in the solar system was contradicted by the discovery of asteroids with highly eccentric orbits and moons with retrograde orbits .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "A discouraging aspect of the theory was the implication that the formation of solar systems in the Milky Way Galaxy must be extremely rare , because sufficiently close encounters between stars would occur very seldom .The next significant development took place in the mid-20th century as scientists acquired a more - mature understanding of the processes by which stars themselves must form and of the behaviour of gases within and around stars .They realized that hot gaseous material stripped from a stellar atmosphere would simply dissipate in space ; it would not condense to form planets .Hence , the basic idea that a solar system could form through stellar encounters was untenable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Hence , as the cloud collapses , it starts to rotate , and , to conserve angular momentum , its speed of rotation increases as it continues to contract .With ongoing contraction , the cloud flattens , because it is easier for matter to follow the attraction of gravity perpendicular to the plane of rotation than along it , where the opposing centrifugal force is greatest .The result at this stage , as in Laplace 's model , is a disk of material formed around a central condensation .This configuration , commonly referred to as the solar nebula , resembles the shape of a typical spiral galaxy on a much reduced scale .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Why ? ?We were shown the extremely close bond between all the Scully 's .I believe that we will meet him in 3 and he will play a pivotal role .I also believe that we will see Doggett and Reyes and that Skinner will have a much larger role than in IWTB .His apperance was to show that he was still with the FBI .Every scene in every episode and in both movies is done with the final culmination of the story in mind .Each unanswered question for us the fans , really has been answered but in different episodes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In Emily , Mulder tells the Judge that he suspected that Scully had been infertile since her abduction .Now seriously I have guy friends , and I do n't give them the intimate details .But thinking about it , ok WHY would he suspect she was sterile ? ? ?Hello .okay off topic that was just an example of we have questions , we have already been given the answers .The Alien Human Replicants , are not what we think they are .I think we 'll be seeing Billy Miles again .Well at least i 'd like to think so ................ .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm sure a way could be found for him to play a significant part in the story for the third film .His character just seemed to be ' getting there ' when he disappeared yet again .He is an enigmatic alien and perhaps he could be some kind of explanatory voice from the alien side of things .Mind you I 'm a big fan of The Invaders which R.T. was in back in the 60s .I 'd like to see somebody reactivate that concept ( messrs Spotnitz & Carter et al ? ) and do a modern day successor series .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In 1995 a weird reinterpretation of The Invaders was produced as a three hour mini - series .Thinnes agreed to appear in this , but very much just as a cameo type role , in which he sort of handed the baton over to Scott Bakula 's character .For me , The X - Files shares common ground with The Invaders .Not least the inclusion of Thinnes into the later seasons , but also the themes being dealt with ( alien conspiracy ) .I know the Big Light team , and particularly Mr. Carter and Mr. Spotnitz like to work upon their own creations - but perhaps reviving a classic old 1960s show might prove to be just another vehicle worth considering ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
