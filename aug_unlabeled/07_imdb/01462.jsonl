{"text": "Along the lines of \" The Monster Club \" and \" The Night Stalker \" .Starring The one and only Angel herself , Kate Jackson , this film is almost an exact replica of her earlier film debut , \" Night Of Dark Shadows \" .Only better .I 've always felt that Night of Dark Shadows is so lackluster because it never decides what it wants to be .Serious , Campy , artsy ... you get the picture .Obscenely slow paced and with a rather mundane , molasses slow script .Death At Love House moves at a much faster pace and is 10 times more entertaining .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
