{"text": "Mil wins his one - on - one with the Mummy and good triumphs over evil .The Mummy is sealed in his stone sarcophagus and the Aztec temple is dynamited to seal him up for eternity .The problem facing those who want to make new lucha - hero movies is what slant to put on the material .Do you try to make a 21st - century film that just happens to star a masked wrestler or do you attempt to faithfully recreate the \" classic \" lucha - hero style , at the risk of producing something that seems \" campy \" ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For the most part , the heroes were wrestlers and their opponents were played by wrestlers , so the street fights looked like wrestling matches , only slower and more awkward , because the participants were n't in their familiar environment ( the ring ) .So this is a case where tradition clashes with modern audience expectations .The hagiographic presentation of Mil M\u00e1scaras , mentioned earlier , is another example .He 's just too perfect and the constant verbal allusions to his expertise in every field of human endeavor get a little ludicrous after a while .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Consequently , although this may not have been the filmmakers ' intention , MM : R and other recent lucha films come off as rather campy , because the traditional lucha sensibility was rooted in the 60s-70s and not the 2000s .On the other hand , if you do just plug a masked wrestler into a standard action or horror movie , are n't you losing something of the soul and essence of lucha - films ?MM : R certainly ca n't be faulted for this : it is faithful to the legendary Mil M\u00e1scaras and faithful to the lucha film genre as a whole .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
