{"text": "Book Nook .Pages .Brand New at the Library !My husband says you should never read a \" New York Times \" bestseller , because you 're bound to be disappointed .I 've never followed that advice , and this book makes me thankful for it .I found John Grisham 's \" Skipping Christmas \" to be a flat out delight , even if I did n't get to read it till after the tree was already on the curb .Now I 'm a huge Grisham fan , but usually he puts out legal thrillers that have me trying to decide whether the jury is rigged or a judge corrupt .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It has all the advantages of a Grisham novel - his ridiculously original characters and brandy - smooth writing - with a whipped cream heavy plot , so it does n't require more thinking than say , whether to use bubble bath or not before you engage in a soak .The principals are Luther and Nora Krank , and since they are sending their daughter off to the third world for Christmas , they decide to forgo their usual holiday rituals ( which accountant Luther finds are costing them a fortune ) and take a holiday cruise instead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In contrast to another book I just read by Dominick Dunne which deals with the lives of the rich and famous in New York City long ago , Maria Semple here deals with the lives of the computer nouveau riche , including the title character Bernadette Fox .She is married to a genius from Microsoft , but is a bit of a genius herself , something we do n't realize until about halfway into the story .At the start , Bernadette is simply a Seattle mom who is tired of dealing with the other mommies at her daughter Bee 's very special grade school , and that makes her character very approachable from this reader 's point of view .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The BBC is well known for its productions of the works of famous British authors like Jane Austen and Charles Dickens .This 1985 production of Dickens ' \" Bleak House \" fits into that category , and is at its heart a condemnation of the legal profession and the people who make their living in it .The story is a simple one .Two young heirs to the case of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce come to light , and while the case goes through Chancery ( the court system in Britain ) the pair go to live with a distant relation , John Jarndyce .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "She is the natural daughter of Lady Dedlock and this army officer , but only finds out her heritage right before Lady Dedlock runs away to avoid bringing shame to her husband and his noble house .The only shades of comedy in this piece come from the ridiculous names , like the landlord Mr. Krook , the Neckett family , and of course Inspector Bucket .The BBC production is also bleak and lacks color in many scenes , but it is the picture of London at this time in history that is the bleakest of all .This first print offering by comedian Ron \" Tater Salad \" White is the perfect thing to take to the beach , or to the bathroom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This book is filled with amusing and sometimes disturbing episodes from White 's life .But for me it got to the point where the party - all - night lifestyle of White 's was a little sad .White draws hysterical portraits of other people , including his various wives , girlfriends and pets .But my favorite stories come from before White was famous , when Jeff Foxworthy helped him out in his career and in his life .White makes Jeff sound like a true Christian with comic talent and a generous heart , and White himself suffers in contrast .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Ron White is truly one of the funniest people on the planet , but I worry that his errant life - style choices will put him in the same category as comedians John Belushi and Sam Kinnison , brilliant artists who died before their time .With a title like that , you would think the movie would be filled with light moments , a breezy comedy perhaps , and nothing at all like a movie titled \" Bleak House \" .Think again ! \"The House of Mirth \" is a humorless tale with a very sad ending for the film 's protagonist Lily Bart , played by Gillian Anderson of X - files fame .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The story ostensibly starts in 1906 New York , where Bart visits a man she loves , and hopes to marry , played by Eric Stoltz .She is one of those penniless young women of any time who are on the prowl for a wealthy spouse , and yet the man she loves has to work for his money ( as a lawyer , though ! ) and so he would be a bad match for her .As if he 'd ask her !He 's a gorgeous creature , and has already seduced Bart 's married friend , Bertha .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "As such , the reader might expect this book to be a comedy riot , along the lines of written offerings from other comedians like Ron White or Chelsea Handler .But it is not , yet that does n't make it a bad book .\" It 's Always Something \" is more the story of how Gilda Radner went through ups and downs during her eventually losing battle against ovarian cancer .It is one of those books where even though you know how it ends ( she is dead , after all ) , the glory is in the struggle itself , and here Radner lays out her fight against the disease in sometimes agonizing personal detail .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "# 1 The Shining ( 1980 )Surprisingly , this movie does have its detractors ( King purists ! ) , so let me explain my choice .Simply put , AFI judges its films as films .And here you have what might be the highest quality horror picture ever made .One of the all - time greatest directors , riveting acting , amazing cinematography and score , and most importantly , scary as all get - out .# 2 Bride of Frankenstein ( 1935 )The most enduring piece of cinema to come out of the entire Universal monster movie cycle , rich in symbolism , rife with dark humor and thematically bold .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "# 4 Psycho ( 1960 ) Hitchcock 's grim yet stylish chiller invented both the slasher sub - genre and the modern thriller in one swift stroke .Could do without the clunky exposition in the final scene , though .# 5 The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 ) An unrelenting nightmare of terror , and the crowned jewel of ' 70s exploitation horror .A classic that demonstrates how effective you can be on a low budget and a small scale .# 6 The Exorcist ( 1973 )Along with The Shining , one of the only horror movies that could 've conceivably won the Academy Award .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "# 8 Frankenstein ( 1931 )Though overshadowed by its sequel , there 's something deeply effective about James Whale 's original , and Boris Karloff 's brilliant wordless performance .It may not be as shocking today , but that will never take away from just what a damn good movie it is .15 comments : .Good list , though I consider \" The Thing \" ( both original and awesome re - make ) sci - fi and not horror .I 'd have also had \" Carnival Of Souls \" ( the orig . ) on that list somewhere :) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jack was too Jack , and Duvall was just plain bad .However it 's still masterfully crafted .Great list-Usually I read other horror fans top ten lists and find myself thinking \" naw , there are better movies than that one \" but with your list I agreed with your choices across the board .And the AFI is seriously messed up for not including a horror list .They probably knew that they would get more of a reaction from the horror freaks about their lousy choices , so they decided to avoid the problem and remain silent ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You probably nailed it with The Shining taking the top .I always find it tough , personally , to make such list in my life - my Top 10 of anything always has about 50 inductees , like a hall of fame , if you will .A few flicks that I suggest could have made your list but did n't : Alien and Aliens , Jacob 's Ladder , Invasion of the Body Snatchers [ either one ] , Rosemary 's Baby , War of the Worlds [ old ] , Jaws .I also do not see any distinction between a horror film based in magic / fantasy , in reality , or one in science fiction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thanks Ray -- if you 'd like to put together your own top 50 list or something like that , feel free to write it up as another guest post anytime .Most of the ones you mentioned were contenders , but I 've always considered War of the Worlds to be straight sci - fi .And for some reason , I 've always had a hard time considering Jaws a horror movie .I know I 'm in the minority on that one .A brilliant list !I 'd just move some titles around .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Bride is terrific , but the original has rough , raw power and I think it 's superior to the more elaborate sequel .Thanks , Pierre .I see your point about the Frankensteins .But while the original may have more raw power as a pure horror film , I feel the sequel is a better all - around film from top to bottom .It 's more sophisticated in its technique , richer in its symbolism , with a bueatiful score and effective performances across the board . Y'know , it 's great that AFI has a Sci - Fi list , but most of the movies belong in the \" Fantasy \" or \" Action \" categories .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And T2 , I guess , but it does n't explore anything that Blade Runner did n't .Alien and Body Snatchers are both horror movies through and through , so I guess that 's something .Like The Vault on Facebook .Welcome to the Vault .... .I 've been fascinated with horror ever since my parents let me watch The Exorcist at 8 years old ( what were they thinking ? ? ) and I ran up to my bed screaming when Linda Blair 's eyes rolled into the back of her head .Although it often gets a bad rap from \" mainstream \" critics and audiences alike , horror has often been the most creative and vibrant movie genre of all , from Nosferatu to Saw .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
