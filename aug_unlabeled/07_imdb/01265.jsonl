{"text": "Lohan , Lewis , and Jolson .In a recent television interview Jerry Lewis was asked to comment on the latest Lindsay Lohan , Paris Hilton misadventures .He shook his head and said , \" One , they do n't know who Al Jolson was . \"Although I understand what Lewis was getting at , it 's a silly thing to say in relation to these young girls .Of course they do n't know who Al Jolson was .Al Jolson died in 1950 , probably before Lohan 's and Hilton 's parents were even born .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Paris Hilton at 29 is a bit older , but I 'm pretty certain she would n't know any old time show business names much before Michael Jackson .These girls are n't into show biz history , they 're into themselves .Narcissism mixed with money is always a dangerous combination , add to that plain ordinary stupidity and a total lack of moral fiber and you 've got the society / celebrity of the 21st century .It 's sad .It 's also disgusting and shameful .I 'm sure you could add a few of your own favorite adjectives to that list .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Gather around kids , you might actually learn something .Al Jolson was known in the industry as \" The World 's Greatest Entertainer , \" for well over 40 years .Jolson 's career began in vaudeville but quickly his talents were recognized by the Shubert Brothers and he was signed by them to appear in the opening show of their new Winter Garden Theater on Broadway .That was in April of 1912 .Jolson soon became \" King of the Winter Garden , \" with shows specifically written for him .Winter Garden and Jolson became synonymous .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "During that time Jolson received reviews that have yet to be matched .The Jolson presence on stage is said to have been magical .Audiences loved his bigger than life singing style and his warm , happy manner .Audiences shouted , begged , and often would not allow the show to proceed unless Jolson would come back out on stage .At one performance in Boston , the usual staid and conservative audience stopped the show for 45 minutes !He was said to have had an \" electric \" personality , along with the ability to make each member of the audience believe that he was singing only to them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Al Jolson became bigger than ever and moved to Hollywood to make pictures .Unfortunately his screen persona did n't rise to the same level of his stage presence .He just could n't make the successful transition from live stage entertainer to movie actor .He continued to make pictures throughout the 1930 's however and also starred in his own radio show , but by the late ' 30s his star was not shinning as brightly as it once had .When World War II broke out Jolson was among the first entertainers to travel overseas to entertain the troops .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He continued to entertain the troops stateside after he recovered .In 1946 Colombia Pictures struck a deal with Jolson to film his life story starring Larry Parks .\" The Jolson Story \" became a surprise smash hit and rejuvenated Jolson 's career .The picture was the highest grossing film of the year and earned Parks an Academy Award Nomination for Best Actor .A sequel , \" Jolson Sings Again , \" was made in 1949 ( to this day the only biography sequel in film history ) and that too became a box office hit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In 1950 and against doctor 's orders , Jolson went to Korea to entertain his favorite audience , American troops .While there his health declined and shortly after his return to the U.S. he suffered a massive heart attack and died .Al Jolson was undoubtedly the first American entertainer to become a true phenomenon .He was the biggest Broadway star of his time .He was the first show business superstar , setting the stage for others such as Bing Crosby , Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley .Elvis , by the way , always said that Jolson was his idol and he recorded \" Are You Lonesome Tonight ? \" one of Jolson 's last recordings , in tribute .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The gig was at Madame JoJo 's in Central London on June 18 , 2008 .Comedians .Reviews .Original Review : .This charity gig was billed as Jessica Hynes 's first stand - up performance .In the event , it was n't quite that monumental , as she mostly stuck to introducing the other acts with a few attempts at comic banter on the way .That was probably for the best , given that stand - up requires dozens of stage - hours to perfect , even if you are as lovely and talented as the former Miss Stevenson undoubtedly is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Her longest routine was a windy tale of finding her mum 's vibrator - yes , that comedy staple - that would make an entertaining anecdote for a late - night talk - show , but was too undercooked to ever stand out in a club .As a compere , she was flighty - forgetting several acts ' names and interrupting a couple of other 's sets - yet so natural and likeable she 's easily forgiven .But a stand - up she ai n't ... at least not yet .Hynes was n't the only famous name on the strange bill , which was jokingly described as ' vagina - heavy ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Opening was Stephen Merchant , who made no mention of his Office and Extras fame , and simply got to work on the routine that he 's quietly been honing over the last few months on the circuit .He is an instinctively funny man , and genetics has given him the frame to match .His segments about being a freakish 6 ft 7 in are witty and charming , and brought to life with a skilful comic physicality .He mines the problems of making love to a smaller woman for all they are worth , awkwardly re - enacting the dilemmas with the aid of the microphone stand in a deliberately overextended routine that wavers between testing the audiences ' patience and rewarding them for sticking with it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Newbie Miriam Elia certainly found him tough act to follow , especially as she claimed to be trying out lots of new material , which she would almost certainly have been best advised to save for a smaller gig .Even though many of her gags misfired , this young Jewish comic has an engagingly quirky streak , which occasionally bursts to the surface with a perfectly pitched line .There are some off - the - wall jokes here that any comic would love to have written , such as her ideas for London Transport 's Oyster cards or her brilliant take on authentic Fifties diners .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , there 's no doubt she 's brimming with quirky ideas , which more experience will surely focus more consistently .She offered enough intriguing material to suggest she 's one to watch , even if tonight was n't the best showcase for her .Roisin Conaty also tried something new in her slot - with similarly mixed results .Her hair tousled up in some sort of Eighties homage , she adopted the character of a deluded fringe actress / playwright unwavering in her belief she 's about to hit the big time .Although she sidestepped most the luvvie stereotypes in favour of a more oddball approach , the meandering talk of her theatrical masterpiece was more bewildering that funny , and tried to make running jokes out of weak premises .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The lyrics - likening a failed relationship to a game of Monopoly - were stupidly witty , and Conaty performed it with the perfect level of ill - judged gusto .Another relative rookie next , with the gushily talkative Grainne Maguire nattering away nineteen - to - the - dozen about such inconsequential flim - flam as her hard - to - pronounce name or just being Irish .She 's amiable enough and has deep reserves of excitable energy , but , a couple of nice throwaways aside , she finds the gags elusive .At least I 'm not Woody Allen , ' she said towards the end of her time , pointing out how he never makes anything decent any more - which is very thin ice for a comic who 's only engaged a minority of the audience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His persona is gloriously grumpy , at odds with the supposed spectacle of the illusions .Imagine Jack Dee in a dragon costume , and you 've got the idea .The tricks themselves are standard fare , and he could certainly exploit his cynical misery more - but the concept is inspired .Rich Fulcher is an acquired taste , though his Boosh and Snuffbox exposure has helped spread the word .Initially , his non - jokes and shouty , manic delivery drew a blank with a by - now indifferent audience .However , when he turned to more traditional segments with actual beginnings , middles and ends - all be they surreal ones - he won them over .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Michael Smiley was the most experienced comedian on the bill , but even he seemed to be struggling , with his sense of timing notably off - target .He started off very slowly , and much of his restless delivery was too quiet to carry to the back of the room .His chatty tales of childhood in working - class Belfast were evocatively described , but too often the gags were thrown away .And route - one material about adolescent masturbation , plus the mincing queen act he puts on to dissuade his daughter 's boyfriend , should really be beneath him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hello , ' he says to open , ' I 'm very famous . 'His honesty , his utter control of the stage , and the ability to harness his congenital self - absorbed misery into painfully sharp gags , make him a compelling comic .Thanks to another bit of strange scheduling , Amstell was n't headlining the show .Instead that honour went to Josie Long who , delightful as she is , could n't match Amstell , gag for gag .Her slow - burn whimsy takes a while to take hold , and it 's not until she gets to the solid jokes that are hidden behind that optimistically idealistic , lacksidasical exterior , that she wins laughs rather than just goodwill .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was a certainly a case of Long by name and long by nature of her set - ups .Her performance was symptomatic of much of the night , with too many of the less famous acts seeming to treat the occasion more as an new - material testing ground that a ' real ' gig .But when tickets are \u00a3 16 - the same as the Comedy Store - audiences might rightly expect more consistency , even if the charitable comics are performing for nothing .Seeing an on - form Merchant , Amstell and Fulcher justifies the price , but the supporting cast certainly struggled .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There are also places where the audio seems very hollow .The video is presented in anamorphic widescreen and looks great .There 's very good use of color and black and white footage that helps to give the movie a very classy feel .There 's a touch of grain at times , but the biggest problem with the video is the editing , which is very choppy .Music : The music is well balanced with the rest of the audio in the movie , and helps to give it a very classy feel .It 's also extremely varied when it comes to its style .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
