{"text": "Wong Jing is well aware of the irony of his own success .As a prudent businessman and one of Hong Kong 's highest - grossing filmmakers of the past three decades , the 58-year - old has been profiting from an oeuvre that 's coloured by the very vice that he mocks and yet was inadvertently born into - gambling .The reason I took gambling as my theme is very simple , \" says Wong during an interview to promote his latest film , From Vegas to Macau .\" I grew up in just such an environment : my mother gambled a lot when I was a kid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "People get ... completely hypnotised by the atmosphere [ of the casino ] .Director Wong Jing .He became \" a punter \" when he made friends with a horseracing gambler in his first year of college at the age of 19 .Ever since , going right back to his very first film , Challenge of the Gamesters ( 1981 ) starring Patrick Tse Yin , the theme of gambling has never been far from Wong 's critically divisive yet profitable career .I 'm not a gambler , \" says the writer - director firmly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I can stop gambling any time .\" But when I watch others gamble it 's just fascinating . \"Wong explains : \" It 's like : ' Oh wait , you 're so nice to everyone in your daily life and yet you 're so mean at the gambling table ! 'Or ' You 're trying so very hard to take my money - are you for real ? 'There are people who remain clueless even after they 've lost money .\" I had a classmate who gambled like there 's no tomorrow when he was only 16 or 17 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I find these gamblers ' minds very interesting . \" As the filmmaker who almost single - handedly established and popularised the Chinese gambling movie sub - genre , Wong can rightly take pride in turning out one undisputed classic - 1989 's God of Gamblers .He made stars out of his gambler protagonists , played by Chow Yun - fat , Andy Lau Tak - wah , Stephen Chow Sing - chi and Nick Cheung Ka - fai .From Vegas to Macau marks Chow Yun - fat 's return to the gambling table after the immense success of God of Gamblers and its 1994 sequel , God of Gamblers Return .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The crime - thriller distantly evoked Chow 's days in the popular 1980s TV series The Bund .\" I already thought very highly of Chow when we were both newcomers , \" Wong says . \"Since my father is [ the late renowned director ] Wong Tin - lam , sometimes Chow would ask me for advice .We went on to make our own careers since but our paths would occasionally cross .We made [ at least five ] TV dramas together .Then we also worked on The Romancing Star ( 1987 ) and the two God of Gamblers movies . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I make use of my past insight - of his tricks and his best qualities - when we work on new projects .That 's why every film we have made together has been very successful . \"With From Vegas to Macau , Wong has come full circle in more ways than one .Andrew Lau - the producer for both The Last Tycoon and this film - is a friend and long - time collaborator , while Chow 's co - star , Nicholas Tse , is the son of Patrick Tse - the gambling hero of Wong 's feature debut .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "\" People wished for the presence of superheroes who were autonomous , rich and famous .That 's why it worked at the time .[ The hero ] was a wealthy master gambler who would go as far as to bet his life against yours - just to win a billion dollars back and see his opponent lose .\" That was the mentality then .There were also lots of hoodlums and triad people at the Macau casinos - it was a pretty scary scene .But now , more than 20 years after God of Gamblers 2 , Macau is actually no different from Las Vegas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
