{"text": "BRIAN DE PALMA 's COLUMBO !I kid you not . \"Shooting Script \" , an unproduced Columbo spec script has turned up , dated 26th July 1973 , written by Joseph P. Gillis and Brian De Palma .De Palma we all know for the genius film director he is , responsible for a string of the most inventive and entertaining thrillers since Hitchcock .Gillis is untraceable and may well be a pseudonym for the series ' staffers , since they are bound to have had input into a spec script ( an unsolicited screenplay ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jackson Gillis was the former executive story consultant for Columbo , though he continued to contribute - suggesting a staffer ; Joe Gillis is the screenwriter character played by William Holden in Billy Wilder 's Sunset Boulevard - suggesting a ' movie brat ' having some fun .Hey , maybe it 's Paul Schrader !He and De Palma met that year , after he reviewed Sisters .They and all the other so - called movie brats - Scorsese , Spielberg ( who had of course directed a Columbo ) , John Milius etc . hung out together in LA the summer of ' 73 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The following year the pair collaborated on Vertigo -inspired script \" D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu \" , filmed by De Palma as Obsession .\" The perfect crime is the motiveless crime , but then again there is no such thing as a motiveless crime .Even a maniacal urge to kill indiscriminately is a motive ...But subtlety of motive -- that always confounds the police , who have no subtlety at all .The police also have no taste , whereas my taste is exquisite ...Thus I decide that taste will be my motive -- and the most distasteful thing in this distasteful world to me is this cult of pseudo - celebrities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Without style , or grace .Creatures of the media .This chic apartment building , where I live , is full of these public zircons .I shall kill one of them . \"Quentin Lee in \" Shooting Script \" .For Columbo , the date indicates Season Three .A four month writers ' strike had held up production , with just two episodes in the can , and in July 1973 they were gearing up to make the remaining six shows .Stephen J Cannell , soon to find enormous fame with The Rockford Files , also handed in a spec script at this time - it was something to do during the strike , he said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For Brian De Palma , then 32 years old , he had seen the successful release of his psychological horror Sisters earlier in the year , and was prepping cult favourite Phantom of the Paradise .Where did Columbo fit in ?De Palma famously hates television , considering it the ultimate manifestation of art selling out to commerce , and to my knowledge has never worked in the medium other than here .I 'm presuming he was attracted to the show 's idea - led structure .Sisters had been a new direction after his improvisatory comedies Greetings and Hi Mom ! - a challenge to try working within the confines of the thriller .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also , it was a good gig , with a number of Emmys already under its belt .And I ca n't believe De Palma did n't like Columbo .Hopefully Steven Spielberg put in a good word too .Peter Falk as Lieutenant Columbo in Season 3 of the NBC Sunday Mystery Movie , which was Number 14 for that year .And it 's a good fit .I loved the script : it 's classic Columbo and very De Palma .The episode opens over shots of San Quentin prison cells - we 're not sure what we 're watching - which turns out to be a documentary playing through a video machine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He is based on Truman Capote I would guess , and a most delicious Columbo villain he would have made .De Palma takes the programme right back to its Dostoyevskian origins .Like Raskolnikov in ' Crime and Punishment ' - quoted here - Lee commits murder as an experiment .He wants to document a perfect crime , and sets about doing so with a video camera .Already it is displaying De Palma themes .Both Hi Mom ! and the later , partly autobiographical Home Movies feature characters documenting their lives through film cameras .We do n't actually see Lee until he has perpetrated the crime , when he sets the camera down to move the body - just as we do n't see Robert De Niro for the first few minutes of Hi Mom ! as he is operating the camera .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'll not go into too much detail about the plot .Lt .Columbo is being shadowed throughout by a trio of college students - one of whom is named Spielberg - who are documenting his activities for their graduate class ( shades of the much later \" Columbo Goes to College \" ) .More recording going on .Whether Spielberg 's name appears because of his connection with Columbo , or his friendship with De Palma , we 'll never know .At the time he was working on The Sugarland Express , his first theatrical feature .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If I were to hazard a guess as to why it was n't produced , I 'd say there are a couple of details which might have proved difficult to show effectively on screen .De Palma himself could 've solved them if he was directing , but they seem rather ambitious for television .Also , the murderer being panicked into revealing the location of the incriminating evidence , as happens here , is similar to Stephen J Cannell 's \" Double Exposure \" - and better done there to be honest .The page count suggests a 90-minute Columbo rather than a 2-hour , but I would 've given this one the longer time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As for who could have played Lee , my first thought was John Lithgow , who has been enlisted by De Palma for villainous duties a number of times - but at 6 ' 4 \" is too imposing a physical presence for this part .I see this more like Clifton Webb in Laura , so how about Paul Williams , diminutive singer - songwriter and actor who played the Faustian record producer in Phantom of the Paradise , De Palma 's very next project !He 'd be perfect .I can only hear him reading the extract above , now .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a fascinating insight into the early development of De Palma as an artist , and just as importantly , it 's a new episode of 70s Columbo !Any more hidden gems out there ?ADDENDUM 2 ( 6th August 2012 ) : I found this extract in a profile of Brian De Palma from The Milwaukee Journal , written by Helen Dudar , and dated 20th April 1980 a few months before Dressed to Kill was released .This is the Columbo script !De Palma and Jay Cocks must have rewritten it as a film when it was n't used .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
