{"text": "14/31 - The Walking Dead , Episode 4 : Around Every Corner .There is no shortage of praise for Telltale Games ' The Walking Dead .The first three episodes were well received , and Episode 3 in particular has brought many gamers to tears - myself included .Telltale continues its storytelling masterpiece with Episode 4 : Around Every Corner .Episode 4 finds Lee and friends finally making their way to Savannah .It 's the last known location of Clementine 's parents , as well as possibly the group 's best chance of getting away from the chaos around them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just because you 're trying to get there , does n't mean you 'll like what you find .One thing I ca n't state enough is the sheer cinematic quality present in every second of this series .The \" previously ... \" episode intros give it the feel of an ongoing television series , while credits displayed over slower - paced playable portions early in any chapter enhance that immersion .That quality extends to the visuals as well ; everything from the color palettes to the camera angles are chosen to maximize the impact of what gamers see in front of them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The angle of the light and its soft , warm tone , combined with the angled wooden structure around it , are somewhat reminiscent of a church , many of which have angled ceilings and high windows to allow light to shine down on the interior .I ca n't help but wonder if this was intentional on Telltale 's part , selecting the imagery of a place that for many people is associated with hope and comfort , to frame against a character dealing with so much pain and despair .The imagery in the game is so perfect , that often it can have an impact on players even if no words are being spoken .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Clementine is vastly different than in previous chapters , now that the possibility of reuniting with her parents is so close to becoming real .Lee , in the meantime , grapples with the dual responsibility of making sure Clementine is capable of taking care of herself and contributing to the group , while also ensuring she is n't put in harm 's way as a result .There 's a degree of tough love here , with Lee needing to keep her spirits raised at times , and scold her to discourage reckless behavior at others .For better or worse , Lee is her father now , and that protective instinct rises to the surface - sometimes with a kind word for the girl , sometimes in a violent outburst when he feels her well being is in danger .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The events of Episode 4 have the group once again looking for a way to survive .Some new characters are encountered , some are put in danger , and depending on your choices , some do n't make it through to the end .While Episode 3 focused heavily on the group continuing to make progress towards Savannah , Episode 4 deals mainly with the threats encountered one there - both human and non - human alike .By the end , some characters are near their breaking point , and the choices you 've made along the way will determine if they are still standing by your side when all is said and done .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It may not be quite as emotionally devastating as Episode 3 was , but this may be for the best .A good story needs both highs and lows , rather than a continuous linear escalation towards either extreme .Given the powerful scenes of Episode 3 , having Episode 4 return to the mold of \" just trying to survive and keep everyone alive \" is a good change of pace .It allows the events of the last episode to sink in , while also allowing this chapter to develop a \" slow burn \" as the consequences slowly eat away at what 's left of Lee 's group .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "During this scene , which probably features more deep throat action than all of this year 's other porn movies put together , sex show promoter Dan Quinn ( played by Evan Stone ) approaches Julie .He really seems to have her best interests in mind , and Julie leaves her boyfriend behind to go work in his night club .Unfortunately , although Quinn 's methods are a bit more sophisticated , he too exploits her talents , which leads to her final demise .Meanwhile , there 's a subplot going on alongside the main story , between Penny Flame and Tom Byron .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Even when there are no lines to be spoken , Sasha 's facial expressions and body language leave no doubt as to what her character is feeling .Sasha indeed has some remarkable deep throat skills , and does a convincing job of making you believe that she had the ability to cum from sucking a cock .She takes an energetic ass pounding from Evan Stone as well , along with several assorted vaginal fuckings , with great enthusiasm .For someone who supposedly only received true satisfaction from having her clitoris stimulated ( which was in her throat ) you could n't help but wonder how she was getting so much from regular sex .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The back cover art shows a bare torso shot of Sasha , and the artist cleverly used the chest area for some faded text and added darkened explicit scenes from the movie along the side .The movie is filmed in high definition and is presented in wide screen format in 16:9 ratio , and the lighting throughout almost the entire film is well done and appropriate to the scenes .Director Paul Thomas obviously used the visual effects to enhance whatever mood he was trying to express to the viewer , which at times is dark and a tad eerie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's one of the many outdoor scenes , but there was some off - color glaring that appeared on her skin along with a general \" washed out \" tone to this one .The audio comes through in Digital Dolby Surround Sound , with music selections that are subtle enough that they are often times not even noticeable , and are not a part of every scene .As with the lighting , the director chose to use the music to enhance a mood or situation , and he did it well , particularly during the Zone Club orgy scenes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The movie 's running time is about 1 hour and 20 minutes , and there are chapter stops throughout that as well , so it 's easy to bounce through and replay specific scenes if you want to .One thing that was impressive about this whole movie was the realism of it .Although Penny Flame 's verbal performance seemed a bit stiff here and there , the acting in general did n't seem forced nor did the sex seem excessively scripted .Very rarely did you hear the fake robotic moans of a performer who was making noise just because they had been told to , as you see in the usual mainstream porn .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "no silicone tits , no airbrushing to hide skin flaws , and not every one had a picture perfect physique .All of this added to the feeling that you were actually getting a peek at the real life of an adult performer , instead of seeing some sort of made - up sexual circus show .Experience . -Alan & Michele 's opinion .Alan says : I enjoyed this movie , and I think most other guys will too .Sasha Grey is sexy as hell in her role and there 's plenty of hard sex and deep throating going on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The story itself was good , and there was n't a lot of wasted dialogue to make me want to reach for the remote .As a man , the incident that occurred right before Julie Garrett 's death really made me cringe though .It made sense why things played out the way they did , but damn !There is n't much bad to say about the movie , but there were two or three spots where the director used very brief skip - action photography and I 've never been a fan of that .The ending of the movie struck me as being a bit abrupt too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Last but not least , I could n't help but wonder how this girl who was hurting for money so bad at the beginning of the movie was living in such a nice house ?Michele says : A very disturbing yet enjoyable show .I kept watching because I just had to know what happened to the main character .I went from feeling sorry for her , to feeling pissed off at how she was treated , to applauding her outrageous act at the end .It 's not often that a porn movie makes you care one way or another what happens to the characters , so that alone was impressive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There were a few things about the movie that did n't work for me .The first is that Trent Tesoro was cast as Julie 's boyfriend , and there was absolutely no chemistry between them that I could see .It was n't just that the character that he played was a real jerk , Trent just did n't seem to be a good match for Sasha in any way .The second thing is that the little subplot between Penny Flame and Tom Byron was totally unnecessary .Sure , it made for some additional sex scenes in the movie , but the director did n't really flesh it out enough to make it feel like much more than a distraction from the main plot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The final issue is nothing more than a personal pet peeve of mine .Girls in porn never seem to be able to deep throat a guy without gagging , even the less endowed ones , and there were few exceptions in this movie .Sasha does do an admirable job , but there are still times when you wonder whether or not she 's going to puke on the guy .I really enjoyed this movie , much more than I expected .This was great to watch with a partner or alone , and some of the actors had great chemistry together .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
