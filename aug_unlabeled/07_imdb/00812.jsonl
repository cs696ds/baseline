{"text": "( 1 ) Sun Aug 07 201111:57 The MST3K - IMDB Effect , Quantified : Sometimes when I rewatch an MST3 K episode I go to the movie 's IMDB page to learn more about it .Inevitably I 'm annoyed by the comments of people who give these movies one - star reviews solely on the basis of having watched an edited version on MST3K.But even greater than my annoyance is my desire to quantify the phenomenon .Today , I have quantified it .What does being on MST3 K do to a movie 's IMDB rating ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
