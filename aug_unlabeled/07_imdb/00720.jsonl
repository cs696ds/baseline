{"text": "Cliffhanger was one of Stallone 's last successes so it was no great surprise to see him teaming up with Harlin once again for Driven .Stallone wrote the screenplay and hired Harlin to direct the movie .However would the magic of Harlin be enough to kick start Stallone 's failing career ?Movie Driven revisits the world of motor car racing twelve years after Tom Cruise 's Days of Thunder graced our screens .A lot has happened in twelve years and the technology has advanced enough to make Driven a promising project .As would be expected Sylvester Stallone plays the main character Joe Tanto a car racing driver who is persuaded to come out of retirement by long term friend Carl Henry ( Burt Reynolds ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Bly is a promising young driver who has a real chance of winning the championship .However recent results have raised concerns about Bly 's mental state to win the championship .Stallone 's character is thought to be the ideal person to guide the youngster to the championship .Only World Champion Beau Brandenburg ( Til Schweiger ) stands in Bly 's way of becoming this season 's champion .Things are complicated further by Bly 's infatuation with Brandenburg 's former girlfriend played by Estella Warren .Driven received a huge amount of criticism when released and some of it is justified .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As I was writing this review I noticed that Estella Warren had won the worst supporting actress at the 22nd Annual Razzie Awards , which are given to the industry 's worst on the eve of the Oscars .Her performance is certainly representative of the acting in general in Driven .One of the most disappointing performances has to go to Bert Reynolds for his role as the team manager .I have never seen a man wear so much makeup and his whole performance was just embarrassing .I thought that he had reached an all time low by starring in StripTease but his performance in Driven at least matches that !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some of the race scenes were pretty impressive but others looked fake .Two scenes particularly stick in my mind .There is one scene where Tanto and Bly race through the streets after stealing two race cars .This scene is unbelievable enough but the special effects just make it a farcical five minutes .The other scene , which made me cringe was the final race .I do n't want to give too much away , but there is a crash and you see a wheel spin up in the air and travel towards the spectators .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So far you are probably thinking that Driven is going to get a bad score from me .Even though the above points spoil the film I still found it reasonably enjoyable .Renny Halin has created a fast packed documentary style movie , which certainly passes the time .I say documentary because that is how the movie felt to me .Each race is introduced in a documentary way with commentators and real life footage being shown .Some of the race scenes are pretty exciting and cleverly filmed .I have done a bit of research and apparently some of the race scenes are actually taken from real life footage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am a fan of Harlin 's other movies like Die Hard and Deep Blue Sea so I was expecting a reasonably high paced movie .Whilst not recommending Driven as a nights entertainment I , could think of far worse films to watch .As to the earlier mention of whether Driven would kick start Stallone 's career , well he is going to have to do a lot better then this to get the audiences paying to watch his movies .There is nothing in Driven to persuade me that Stallone is back to his best .If I was to write a school report about his performance in this movie it would probably contain the words ' must do better ! '", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You may not like the film but Roadshow have certainly pulled out all the stops with this transfer .I would probably go as far as to say that this is reference quality .Contrast and sharpness are spot on and the black levels , which can be seen during the night street chase scene , are excellent .There is no sign of edge enhancement and the dreaded artifacts are nowhere to be seen !This transfer is probably one of the clearest I have seen so far .Examples of this can be seen in any of the race scenes where the crowd is brought to the screen with wonderful clarity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Audio We are treated to two soundtracks with this disc .There is a Dolby Digital 5.1 track and a DTS track . one .There is very little difference between the tracks .Both tracks use the full range of speakers with the rears getting a particularly good workout during some of the races .During the races you actually feel like you are in the middle of them .The dialog at times seemed a little muffled and hard to hear .However this probably has something to do with the fact that the surrounding noise is so loud .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If I was going to recommend one of them I would go for the DTS track as it sounds a little livelier , but there is very little difference to be truthful .Extras First up on the disc are Deleted scenes with optional audio commentary by Sylvester Stallone .There are ten deleted scenes altogether on this disc .They run in a seamless branch and have a combined running time of just over thirty - eight minutes .The picture quality varies considerably between the scenes .Some of the earlier scene are very poor quality .Each scene has ' property of Warner brothers ' displayed at the top of the picture .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All of the scenes develop the character personalities and there is no actual new action .The first and the last deleted scenes are pretty laughable really as they try to dwell on the sentimental aspect of the characters and they fail dismally .It just goes to show that action directors should n't really try to build character relationships in movies .The scenes become very boring after a while and only a few of them are worthwhile .It is easy to see why they were deleted !One thing I did notice was that some of the scenes that were deleted were actually in the Region 1 version I watched a few months ago .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With this disc you also get a feature - length audio commentary by director Renny Harlin .Renny talks about various aspects in this commentary .He mentions that he is a fan of the sport and that coming from Finland it is expected that you would like motor sports .What is clear from this commentary is that Harlin is very interested in all aspects of the film and is very enthusiastic .He explains why and how various shots were done .I am not a great fan of commentaries but I found this one to be interesting and it added a little more depth to the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The first one is a behind - the - scenes documentary entitled \" The Making - Of Driven \" .It has a running time of just over fifteen minutes .The documentary starts off by giving some facts about the movie .For example there were 270,000 spectators used as extras in the film .The first two minutes of this documentary is fast paced with rock music playing in the background with lots of clips being shown .During the fifteen minutes we are shown various interviews with the stars including Sly , Renny Harlin , Gina Gerson and Burt Reynolds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What interested me the most during the documentary was Harlin 's chat about film the movie during live races .Some of the footage was filmed in the pits a few minutes before live races were taking place .The other documentary that we are treated to is called \" Conquering Speed Through Live Action and Visual Effects \" .This has a shorter running time of just over nine and a half minutes .This documentary is not as interesting as the making of documentary .It basically shows some of the main scenes in the movie and how they were created .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also included as an extra is the theatrical trailer .This trailer is actually one of the best that I have seen for a long time .It makes the film out to be much more exciting then it actually is .It is only about a minute long but managed to set a frantic pace and does n't give too much of the story away .Certainly worth a quick look .The disc also includes cast and crew biographies , which have now become standard on most discs .Overall I have watched Driven a few times now and it is the sort of film I would struggle to recommend but still found myself enjoying .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The acting is poor , there is little character development and some of the race scenes just do n't look real enough .The same can not be said for the disc itself .It has an excellent transfer , a full of life soundtrack and some quality extras .If you are a fan of car racing films then give this a try .However if you are not interested in cars then you wo nt find much to keep you entertained .Message Enter the message here then press submit .The username , password and message are required .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "At that one moment , everything about big - budget moviemaking changed .While many late-1990s science fiction films such as ' Dark City ' and ' Strange Days ' embraced a similar grim , urban aesthetic , ' The Matrix ' absorbed it , internalized it , and expanded upon it .The original film would be seminal in stretching the boundaries of computer - generated imagery -- literally .Characters run along walls before delivering a kick .Bullets visibly ripple through the air , moving slowly enough for their intended targets to move out of the way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By the time it was over , audiences had a new benchmark for what constituted cool .It 's clear now that the writing and directing team of Larry and Andy Wachowski were not content to just drape everyone in black and call it style .Nor did they simply rely on their extraordinary visual sense . 'The Matrix ' depends on obvious religious parallels ( Neo has been interpreted to be a spiritual stand - in for everyone from Jesus Christ to Buddha ) to give it a familiar , universal feel and a philosophical bent .But , like the outlet embedded in the back of Neo 's head , the real power of ' The Matrix ' is its ability to plug into the psyche of its target audience : young males .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As such , it played right into the hearts and minds of a generation .Much as ' Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ' introduced mainstream American audiences to the Chinese martial arts films , ' The Matrix ' introduced us to the kinetic visuals of Japanimation , John Woo - inspired violence and the Cyberpunk ethos pioneered in the novels of William Gibson .Though the first ' Matrix ' is undoubtedly a classic of its genre and a highly - influential blockbuster , its cross to bear is its two sequels .After the first film grossed over $ 500 million worldwide to become the sleeper sensation of 1999 , it was inevitable that there would be follow - ups .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Matrix Reloaded ' and ' The Matrix Revolutions ' would form a trilogy with the original ' Matrix , ' and gargantuan box office seemed inevitable .Indeed , ' Reloaded ' opened huge , but the sequels seemed to quickly suffer from the law of diminishing returns .It is impossible now to look back on ' The Matrix ' phenomenon and not see the kinks in the armor -- namely , that ' Reloaded ' and particularly ' Revolutions ' disappointed not just the mainstream but also the franchise 's massive legion of devoted followers .Not since the ' Star Wars ' prequels has a sure - fire sci - fi franchise suffered such a steep drop - off in cultural relevance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

'The Matrix ' first hit Blu - ray as part of ' The Ultimate Matrix Collection ' last year , itself the second high - def incarnation of the series following an HD DVD release in 2007 .That set came with considerable expectations , which for me were met .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Warner 's work on the high - def master , which was minted for the original HD DVD release , was a clear step up from the standard - def DVD , which received mixed notices from critics at the time of its release .A direct compare of ' The Matrix ' transfer from the original DVD makes the results immediately obvious .Though the previous DVD certainly looked good , all the black - on - black of the ' Matrix 's trend - setting visual aesthetic often faded into inky mush in standard - def .The high - def version fixes this wrong .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is the kind of three - dimensional , picture - perfect image high - def is all about .The intended color palette of ' The Matrix ' has come under much debate from fans .The dominant hue is clearly green .Though there are many uses of deep purple and occasional splashes of incredibly vivid reds , the colors have been obviously skewed .Yet I remain impressed with the level of detail and \" naturalism \" ( albeit highly stylized ) that remained despite the tint shift .And all things considered , fleshtones are as accurate as possible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Audio : Rating the Sound . 'The Matrix ' is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 surround tracks ( 48kHz/16-bit ) .It remains a superlative soundtrack , and demo - worthy for any home theater .Dynamics are top - notch .Just as \" bullet time \" revolutionized modern special effects , the sound design here was pioneering .In hindsight , it should n't have been a surprise that the original ' Matrix ' swept most of the 1999 Oscars given for tech categories over ' Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace .

{"text": "The airtight extension goes all the way down to the lowest frequencies .Mid- and high - range is also wonderfully clear and free from irritating harshness .As loud as this soundtrack gets , I never felt bombarded with treble , which is can be a problem with high - impact soundtracks , where it often seems like the sound mixers simply crank everything up to eleven .Dialogue also is accurately balanced in the mix -- Keanu Reeves ' now - famous utterance of \" Whoa ! \" is ( for better or for worse ) perfectly intelligible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

'The Matrix Revisited ' is excellent , and for me is easily the highlight of all of the ' Matrix ' extras .Vignettes - Also included are the now - famous \" Take the Red Pill \" and \" Follow the White Rabbit \" vignettes that were presented as branching segments on the original DVD release .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
