{"text": "Category Archives : British troops .Post navigation .This film is the first in a planned series under the title of America : Her People , Her Stories , which is produced by Tony Malanowski , who seeks to creat positive , family friendly productions that present a more positive outlook on American history .The film features a docudrama and a section providing the historical context , presented through interviews with historians .Having had a couple of weeks to reflect on the production since viewing it , I have found both positives and negatives within it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite covering a violent subject , like war , he presents the battle in a way that younger children can learn without being frightened .In addition , despite limitations he was able to pull off an over two - hour production rather well .The film consisted of two main parts , a docudrama and a historical perspective .The docudrama part consisted of a movie reenactment of the battle , focusing on two fathers and sons , living in the area .The historical perspective placed the battle and the Revolutionary War within the larger context of early American history , incorporating interviews with three , as the film puts it , \" historical experts . \" Gregory J. W. Urwin is a scholar of both the Revolution and Civil War at Temple University who has written many works .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My only problem is that Urwin is the only scholar working in the field covered by the film .Patterson is a good choice given his public history work at Trenton , but Chemerka seems out - of - place , as I could find no information related to any work he did on the Revolution .Though this is merely a difference of historical outlook , I had to mention it .That said , the docudrama was an interesting work .The battle scenes were well done , given the budgetary issues .It was portrayed well for an audience geared towards younger children and makes the colonial militia out to be heroic , which is good .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The sons portrayed in the film present an interesting issue , as they seem to be fourteen or so .Their presence at the battle is a conundrum , as if old enough to come and help , they likely would have been allowed to stay and fight , as they would have known how to use a musket .Further , what about leaving the son home to tend the farm ?Again , this is my observation and reflects training and a slightly different outlook .The historical perspective was rather good and placed the battle in context , which is very important .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In addition to the two main parts , a few extra features were added , including Reagan 's farewell address , which I enjoyed immensely .Overall , the docudrama is a good program for families with young children to engage them in history .However , as I always state with any film , be sure to supplement the viewing with proper books and documents , as reading is always good .Get children reading the Constitution , Declaration of Independence , and other primary documents .I look forward to seeing more from this project .David Hackett Fischer has written a remarkable book on one of the more important events of the American Revolution : the Battle of Trenton , placing that battle within the larger Revolution with great detail .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fischer 's work , like others in the series examines a significant moment in American history and how that event shaped the course of the development of the nation .Washington 's Crossing explores the importance of Trenton , as it is one of the most important days for the creation of the United States , as without this event , the Revolution would have likely collapsed .( ix ) .Fischer provided an enormous amount of background , starting first with the competing forces .He discussed the American army , including a brief biography of George Washington , noting more democratic elements within it , like the Committee of Privates in one Pennsylvania unit , as well as an overall lack of discipline .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In contrast to the American army , Fischer presented the British army as a more disciplined force .( 42 - 45 ) Finally , he explored the mercenary forces from Germany , collectively known as Hessians .In addition to looking at the forces involved , Fischer devoted space to the background of the battle .Subjects included the Howe brothers , who commanded the British / Hessian forces during the campaign , as well as the failures at New York .Fischer then analyzed the desperate picture of the American Revolution , discussing Thomas Paine 's pamphlet The American Crisis and how it reflected the low point of the Revolution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The detail on the campaign itself is immense , with Fischer describing the conditions of New Jersey under enemy occupation .Further , his chapters explored key aspects and persons directly surrounding the battle , including Colonel Johann Rall , commander of the Hessian force in Trenton .Readers will come to have a strong grasp of the battle and the Revolution thanks to Fischer 's inclusion of multiple , detailed subjects on the battle .In addition to the rich focus , there are several other aspects of this book that make it a landmark work on the Battle of Trenton and the Revolution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fischer structured his chapters both chronologically and by subject .This organization allows readers to use this book as a great research tool .Second , is the use of maps and other images that compliment the text , which makes the book accessible to those unfamiliar with the Revolution .The area where Fischer shines is in his historiography essay .The essay covers the wide variety of interpretations on both the battle and larger war , focusing upon early views of both the battle and larger war from those who participated in the conflict .Fischer illustrated how , for each side , Trenton represented different ideas , including republican virtue , criticism of British policy , as exhibited by the Howe brothers , contempt for the Hessians , and religious fervor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He then explored the creation and rise of a romantic school , embodied by Washington Irving , which later combined with an earlier republican school to create the Whig , later called Liberal , school .George Bancroft characterized this school , which placed the campaign within the larger struggle of democracy and freedom against more oppressive forms of government .( 433 - 437 )This idea of a moral struggle that Fischer alludes to ( 435 ) is rather similar to the earlier view held by some participants that viewed Trenton as a righteous victory .Fischer 's exploration of the historiography included interpretations linked to later events in American history .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( 438 - 9 )One of the more interesting aspects he looked at was Marxist Howard Fast 's historical fiction on the war .Fischer appeared to mention this subject for mere curiosity and hinted at a lack of value of Fast 's work .( 445 - 6 ) While Howard Fast may be a way to attract Marxist scholars to Fischer 's book , it seems irrelevant to the overall historiography .Overall , Fischer 's look at historiography is quite helpful to those unfamiliar with it and wishing to learn more about the war .He covered the many versions of writing over the years , including the clash in the late twentieth century between academic and popular history , as well as the rise of multiculturalism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Another great feature that sets this book apart is Fischer 's inclusion of an annotated bibliography , which lists and discusses the vast amount of primary and secondary sources .He also provided his own interpretation of the value of various secondary sources .This section adds to the reference qualities of the work and compliments the historiography essay well , and illustrates that Fischer 's book is based on sound scholarship .There are so many great qualities to Washington 's Crossing that it is a must read for anyone interested on both the Trenton Campaign and the larger American Revolution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His use of appendices , a historiography essay , and bibliography enhance the value of the work to general readers , students , and scholars alike .While the book appears daunting , it is well worth the effort to examine .With all the positives to this study , it is very clear why Washington 's Crossing won the Pulitzer Prize and was an American Library Association Notable Book .David Hackett Fischer made a significant and wonderful contribution to the scholarship of the Revolutionary War .Most Americans believe that the Declaration of Independence by the Continental Congress on July 4 , 1776 began American independence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not all Americans favored independence and most historical estimates place the number of Loyalist , or Tory , Americans near one - third of the population .Winning independence required an eight - year war that began in April , 1775 and ended with a peace treaty finalized on September 3 , 1783 .Unfortunately the infant nation found itself born in a world dominated by a superpower struggle between England and France .The more powerful European nations viewed the vulnerable United States , correctly , as weak and ripe for exploitation .Tragically , few Americans know of this period of crisis in our nation 's history because of the irresponsible neglect of the American education system .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As with all historical events this declaration continued the endless cycle of action and reaction , because nothing occurs in a vacuum .Tragically , most Americans ' historical perspective begins with their birth , rendering everything that previously occurred irrelevant .Furthermore , most educators conveniently \" compartmentalize \" their subjects and do not place them in the proper historical context .Since most Americans only remember the United States as a superpower they do not know of our previous struggles .Unfortunately our agenda driven education system also ignores this period and often portrays America in the most negative light .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "None of the thirteen colonies trusted the other colonies and rarely acted in concert , even during times of crisis .Regional and cultural differences between New England , mid - Atlantic and the Southern colonies deeply divided the colonists .Even in these early days of America slavery proved a dividing issue , although few believed in racial equality .The \" umbilical cord \" with England provided the only unifying constant that bound them together culturally and politically .The colonies further possessed different forms of government as well , although they steadfastly expressed their liberties and \" rights as Englishmen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Proprietary colonies formed when merchant companies or individuals , called proprietors , received a royal grant and appointed the governor .Charter colonies received their charters much as proprietary colonies with individuals or merchants receiving royal charters and shareholders selected the governor .Each colony elected its own legislature and local communities made their laws mostly based on English common law .Any form of national , or \" continental , \" unity remained an illusion largely in the minds of the delegates of the First Continental Congress .The Second Continental Congress convened on May 10 , 1775 because England ignored the grievances submitted by the First Continental Congress .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Known today as Patriot 's Day few Americans outside of Massachusetts celebrate it , or even know of it .Setting forth their reasons for taking up arms against England , they established the Continental Army on June 14 , 1775 .For attempting a united front , they appointed George Washington , a Virginian , as commander - in - chief .On July 10 , 1775 , the Congress sent Parliament one last appeal for resolving their differences , which proved futile .While Congress determined the political future of the colonies fighting continued around Boston , beginning with the bloody battle on Breed 's Hill on June 17 , 1775 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This battle encouraged the Americans because it proved the \" colonials \" capable of standing against British regulars .British forces withdrew from Boston in March , 1776 and awaited reinforcements from England as fighting erupted in other colonies .While Washington and the Continental Army watched the British in Boston , Congress authorized an expedition against Canada .They hoped for significant resentment of British rule by the majority of French inhabitants , something they misjudged .In September , 1775 the fledgling Continental Army launched an ambitious , but futile , two - pronged invasion of Canada .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I found no evidence that the Founding Fathers did this intentionally , or whether it merely reflected the writing style of the time .Despite everything mentioned previously regarding \" continental \" actions , the thirteen colonies jealously guarded their sovereignty .Although Congress declared independence England did not acknowledge the legality of this resolution and considered the colonies \" in rebellion . \" England assembled land and naval forces of over 40,000 , including German mercenaries , for subduing the \" insurrection .\" This timeless lesson proves the uselessness of passing resolutions with no credible threat of force backing them up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We hear much in the news today about \" intelligence failures \" regarding the war against terrorism .England definitely experienced an \" intelligence failure \" as it launched an expedition for \" suppressing \" this \" insurrection \" by a \" few hotheads .\" First , they under estimated the extent of dissatisfaction among the Americans , spurred into action by such \" rabble rousers \" as John Adams .They further under estimated the effectiveness of Washington and the Continental Army , particularly after the American victories at Trenton and Princeton .British officials further under estimated the number of Loyalists with the enthusiasm for taking up arms for the British .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Once British forces withdrew , particularly in the South , the Loyalist forces either followed them or disappeared .A perennial lesson for military planners today , do not worry about your \" footprint , \" decisively defeat your enemy .This hardens the resolve of your supporters , influences the \" neutrals \" in your favor and reduces the favorability of your enemies .Regarding the \" national defense \" the Continental Congress and \" states \" did not fully cooperate against the superpower , England .The raising of the Continental Army fell on the individual colonies almost throughout the war with the Congress establishing quotas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Continental Army recruiters often met with competition from the individual colonies , who preferred fielding their militias .The Congress offered bounties in the almost worthless \" Continental Currency \" and service far from home in the Continental Army .Colonial governments offered higher bounties in local currencies , or British pounds , and part - time service near home .Congress only possessed the authority for requesting troops and supplies from the colonial governors , who often did not comply .For most of the war the Continental Army remained under strength , poorly supplied , poorly armed and mostly unpaid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Colonial governments often refused supplies for troops from other colonies , even though those troops fought inside their borders .As inflation continued devaluing \" Continental Currency \" farmers and merchants preferred trading with British agents , who often paid in gold .This created strong resentment from the soldiers who suffered the hardships of war and the civilians who profited from this trade .In fairness , the staggering cost of financing the war severely taxed the colonial governments and local economies , forcing hard choices .Congress further declared independence as a cry for help from England 's superpower rival , France , and other nations jealous of England .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "France 's ally , Spain , also suffered defeat and loss of territory during this war and sought advantage in the American war .However , France and Spain both needed American victories before they risked their troops and treasures .With vast colonial empires of their own they hesitated at supporting a colonial rebellion in America .As monarchies , France and Spain held no love of \" republican ideals \" or \" liberties , \" and mostly pursued independent strategies against England .Fortunately their focus at recouping their former possessions helped diminish the number of British forces facing the Americans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately the Congress fell short on this issue , enacting the weak Articles of Confederation on November 15 , 1777 .Delegates so feared the \" tyranny \" of a strong central government , as well as they feared their neighbors , that they rejected national authority .In effect , the congressional delegates created thirteen independent nations instead of one , and our nation suffered from it .Amending this confederation required the approval of all thirteen states , virtually paralyzing any national effort .This form of government lasted until the adoption of the US Constitution on September 17 , 1787 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Particularly early in the war , the British forces possessed several opportunities for destroying the Continental Army and ending the rebellion .Fortunately for us British commanders proved lethargic and complacent , believing the \" colonial rabble \" incapable of defeating them .Furthermore , as the Continental Army gained experience and training it grew more professional , standing toe - to - toe against the British .Since the US achieved superpower status it fell into the same trap , continuously underestimating less powerful enemies .The surrender of British forces at Yorktown , Virginia on October 19 , 1781 changed British policy regarding its American colonies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Loyalist forces , discouraged by British reverses , either retreated into these enclaves , departed America or surrendered .Waging a global war against France and Spain further reduced the number of troops available for the American theater .This serves another modern lesson for maintaining adequate forces for meeting not only your superpower responsibilities , but executing unforeseen contingencies .Ironically , the victory at Yorktown almost defeated the Americans as well , since the civil authorities almost stopped military recruitment .Washington struggled at maintaining significant forces for confronting the remaining British forces in their enclaves .An aggressive British commander may still score a strategic advantage by striking at demobilizing American forces .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Treaty of Paris , signed on September 3 , 1783 officially ended the American Revolution ; however it did not end America 's struggles .American negotiators proved somewhat na\u00efve in these negotiations against their more experienced European counterparts .Of importance , the British believed American independence a short - lived situation , given the disunity among Americans .Congress began discharging the Continental Army before the formal signing of the treaty , leaving less than one hundred on duty .Instead of a united \" allied \" front , America , France and Spain virtually negotiated separate treaties with England , delighting the British .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "As stated previously the Articles of Confederation actually created thirteen independent nations , with no national executive for enforcing the law .Therefore each state ignored the resolutions from Congress and served its own self - interest .Each state established its own rules for interstate commerce , printed its own money and even established treaties with foreign nations .No system existed for governing the interactions between the states , who often treated each other like hostile powers .The new nation did possess one thing in abundance , land ; the vast wilderness between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Overall , all four episodes in this series are worth watching , as they focus on important people in frontier America and the events surrounding them .Though the programming on The History Channel has declined some over the years , Frontier : Legends of the Old Northwest is one program that illustrates how historical programming on frontier America should be done .I take children 's television programs dealing with historical events very seriously because not only are kids our future , but if they are given a bad education on history , I will end up attempting to fix the mistakes when they arrive at college ( shudders ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The goal of the program is to educate kids age 7 - 12 about the American Revolution ( God forbid that kids are encouraged to read books on the subject ) .This is certainly a noble effort , but the show falls short , choosing to present a politically correct story of our war for independence that ignores many historical facts .The main characters of the show report the events of the Revolutionary period while working for Dr. Benjamin Franklin 's Pennsylvania Gazette .While it is true that Franklin printed such a paper , a Google search is inconclusive for the time of the Revolution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The show does a wonderful job of portraying George Washington to be a wonderful man of character , which is somewhat lacking in today 's historical discourse .The portrayal of Benedict Arnold is quite good , and the battle sequence , though a little quirky , is done very well , so not to scare young kids , but give them a decent concept of the nature of the battles during the war .In addition , the show illustrates the trials of the Continental army at Valley Forge , their training by Baron von Steuben , and the attempts to seize power from Washington by other officers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In closing , PBS 's attempt to present a politically correct American Revolution to kids fails this historian 's litmus test for the most part .While it is important to tell the stories of minority participants in history , the over emphasis of minority characters , as well as the neglect of several events in the Revolutionary War only serve to give kids a misguided idea about this critical time in our history .There are some good qualities to the show , but they are overshadowed by the problems noted .Kids , do not let your knowledge of American history be only what you watch on television , get out and read , as you will discover many wonderful things that TV will not provide .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
