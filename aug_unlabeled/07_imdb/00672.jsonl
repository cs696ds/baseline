{"text": "Every fan has their favourite Hitchcock films , so here are - in my opinion and in chronological order - the five films that are not to be missed for a newcomer .Rebecca ( 1939 ) .Based on Daphne Du Maurier 's classic novel of the same name , Rebecca tells the story of an unnamed young lady ( Joan Fontaine ) who marries a wealthy widower , Maxim De Winter ( Laurence Olivier ) , while on holiday .Upon their return to his mansion , Manderley , it soon becomes clear that she is playing second fiddle to Max 's deceased first wife , Rebecca .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The performances of all the characters are compelling , especially Judith Anderson as the scheming Mrs. Danvers .Hitchcock 's attitude towards his female leads is apparent in Fontaine 's character - he told her that everyone on set hated her to get a realistic timid and scared performance out of her .Rebecca was Hitchcock 's first film following his move to America and the first of the films he made with the notoriously difficult producer David O. Selznick .It was the only Hitchcock film to win an Oscar for Best Picture , but the gong went to Selznick and the only Oscar he received was an honorary award in 1968 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All in all , the features on these discs are a bit half - hearted .The out - of - print Criterion edition is the most comprehensive release of Rebecca on DVD , including a commentary by Leonard J. Leff , author of ' Hitchcock and Selznick ' and three hours of radio adaptations of the novel .Rope ( 1948 ) .Immediately after his contract with David O. Selznick ended , Hitchock made Rope , the first of two experimental films he made in the ' 40s , using very long takes edited together to give the appearance of a whole film in one take .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They hide the body in a chest and host a party in their apartment with the chest as a central piece of furniture , but among their guests is an old school teacher ( James Stewart ) who begins to suspect them .Rope is essentially an 80-minute stage play captured on film , with a camera following the action , directing the audience 's attention .Of all of Hitchcock 's films , Rope divides opinion more than any other - is it an experimental masterpiece or a load of arty nonsense ?The debate will continue forever and even though Hitchcock himself publicly regretted using the one - shot technique , there is a lot to enjoy in the way the camera moves around with the characters , threatening to reveal the body at any moment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The region two and region one releases are both part of the ' Hitchcock Collection ' that is re - released every few years .The main feature on most discs in this collection is a comprehensive documentary , taking in all the principal collaborators ( who are still alive ) , and Hitchcock 's daughter Pat who always adds a more personal edge to the proceedings .Vertigo ( 1958 ) .James Stewart is a troubled private detective hired to follow the wife of a man who has suspicions that she ( Kim Novak ) may try to kill herself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I did n't want to give too much away in my summary of Vertigo as you really have to see it to believe it .Some critics argue that this is the closest you will get to a glimpse inside the mind of the man behind the camera , addressing his personal fears and his penchant for blondes , while others claim that this is Hitchcock spoofing himself .Either way this is Hitchcock 's most emotionally complex film and the usual measures of suspense and intrigue do not suffer as a result .Vertigo also serves the San Francisco tourist board well , showcasing the landmarks in beautiful Technicolor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You know the shot in Jaws where Brody realises there 's a shark in the water and the background stretches away from the camera ?That 's Hitchcock 's ' Dolly Shot ' , which was created by zooming in while pulling the camera back and it 's as effective now as it was in 1958 .The DVD release of Vertigo is also part of the ' Hitchcock Collection ' and is obviously the jewel in the crown as it has been given the most loving restoration work , particularly the picture quality .The picture quality on all of the discs in the collection is very high , and considering the age of the titles and the fact that they do contain scratches and artefacts , it 's hard to wonder how the inevitable HD releases could provide a significant improvement .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "North by Northwest ( 1959 ) .A common theme of Hitchcock films is that of an everyman who must fight for his life in a deadly case of mistaken identity .North by Northwest is a perfect example of this , and given its light - hearted tone and linear storyline probably the best film to start with if you 're new to the director .Cary Grant is a womanizing advertising executive whose only worry in the world is his nagging mother - that is until he is mistaken for a spy and before he knows it , the bad guys are after him and he has to find out why .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Throw in Eva Marie Saint as the femme fatale and James Mason as the camp villain and you 've got one of the most accomplished adventure films of all time .In every scene we are compelled to consider what we would do in a similar situation , one of the major reasons why Hitchcock 's film have such an impact on so many people .The identical region one and region two Warner releases of North by Northwest employ the same structure as the ' Hitchcock Collection ' ( to which this does not belong ) by having a retrospective documentary as the centrepiece and the usual trailers and TV spots .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A major highlight is the audio - only track so you can appreciate Bernard Herrmann 's wonderful score in all its Dolby Digital 5.1 glory .Psycho ( 1960 ) .Janet Leigh plays a young real estate secretary who steals $ 40,000 from her employer and makes a run for it .She then takes refuge in the out - of - the - way Bates Motel and the rest is movie history .In an incredible piece of misdirection , Hitchcock kills off his heroine halfway through the film .So now we focus on the trail of the $ 40,000 she has stolen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A plot device regularly used by Hitchcock is an object or person that he christened the ' McGuffin ' .What does that mean ?The ' McGuffin ' is something that keeps the story moving along but in reality is irrelevant to the meaning of the story .In the case of Psycho , the $ 40,000 stolen by Janet Leigh is what makes her go on the run and end up at the Bates Motel but the film is actually a story about Norman Bates and his relationship with his mother .The briefcase in Pulp Fiction and the silver box in Ronin are modern - day examples of the ' McGuffin ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This theme is echoed in countless teen slasher movies but the true work of genius is the editing .Hitchcock uses shorter and shorter cuts as the scene progresses , building the crescendo until the victim 's body is lying dead in the bath with her blood trickling down the plug hole , followed by a graphical match that will be familiar to fans of The Usual Suspects .The ' Hitchcock Collection ' release was very light on extras and has been improved upon with a re - release in time for its 45th anniversary in 2005 .Further viewing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Lady Vanishes ( 1938 ) is a stronger film from the early British era , but Sabotage is an important film because it is the one time where Hitchcock breaks his own rules .Without trying giving away the outcome of the big set - piece , I 'll warn you that for once Hitchcock delivers what he threatens .Rear Window ( 1954 ) .The Birds ( 1963 ) .Probably the closest Hitchcock came to making a pure horror film .Flocks of birds attack a small coastal town without warning .Everyone has their own theory - mine is that the birds represent Jessica Tandy 's emotional state , but what do I know ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hitchcock returned to London towards the end of his career and intentionally pushed the violence in his films to new levels .As his only film to be rated ' 18 ' in the UK , there are many moments of black comedy .How many other directors could find opportunities for slapstick between the bad guy and the body of the woman he raped and murdered only minutes earlier ?Message Enter the message here then press submit .The username , password and message are required .Please make the message constructive , you are fully responsible for the legality of anything you contribute .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I keep checking Ebay , but I do n't feel like paying $ 200 .I see North by Northwest as not just an essential Hitchcock film , but also the quintessential Cary Grant film ; he carries the picture with his onscreen charisma and charm as only he could and like no other Hitchcock character ever did .Rear Window and Vertigo are my personal faves .The Birds and Psycho are up there too .Never cared for North By Northwest that much .Regaurdless , I 'm happy to see a differing opinion from my own , otherwise I could 've written this thing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Good list , Alfred Hitchcock ranks among my favorite directors .His tv show , \" Alfred Hitchcock Presents \" would also make a great addition to the list ( although he only directed four episodes ) .Mr. Brock , you have a good point , but I wonder if perhaps it was just the technology at the time and some of the effects were believable then , but hardly so now .I 'd but Rope in further viewing and Strangers on a Train up there , if not The Birds .Rope ?I 'll be saying that all day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm in agreement with this list , and in with Dave in that 39 Steps should be under Further Viewing .It 's semi - off - topic , but I 've found the Psycho sequels to be especially enjoyable , especially 2 and 4 .The second one especially is a sequel that holds it weight against the original in that it does n't try to be horror , but a dramatic continuation of what we saw in 1 .The main fault with Hitch films is actually technical .he seems to care not one tint bit for FX shots .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some examples that take you out of the unfolding events are : The cliff finale to \" Northwest \" where some truly dire matte FX remove almost all the excitement and tension of ( supposedly ) having the hero hanging on for dear life .The AWFUL moment in \" Frenzy \" when Hitch freeze frames the picture to show the woman has died and stopped moving !HITCH !BABY !Film stock has constantly moving grain that we see but do n't see at the same time ... stop it though and it shows .Big time !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some of the work is good when it 's on set and real , but some of the matte FX completely take you out of the picture and make it far too obvious that actually people are swiping away at thin air .OH ! Scary .And the one that is not important but is utterly laughable to mammoth proportions is the HUGE matte painting ship parked down the bottom of the street in \" Marnie \" !Some of this can be down to age ... but most is quite frankly just technically bad film making .And given the mastery Hitchcock shows in all other departments I fail to see why he seemed to care so litte for these often vital aspects .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Your wind sounds from the parachutes sound great .I would try and overlay some more beefy fire when the flames burst , especially when the guy gets toasted as you ca n't really hear much of a burning noise .Adding a few of the elements above would definitely help it in my opinion , very good attempt though enjoyed it .Hey Chris - from the beginning - I tried to get out of audio mode before watching to give you a strict \" from audience \" perspective ( Its really hard for me to do this - as it is for a lot of sound designers ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It starts off very strong , great transition from loud latch open to music and quiet .At first I wanted to hear a deeper sound from them wooshing by the camera , design , but it could be argued you did nt need much because they are still in space .It is quite sonically calm while they are speeding down towards the atmosphere , which I think is great to give dynamics to the mix for the action that is about to come .And the calmness works well with the music .Once they hit the atmosphere , I hear what I would guess is an air compressor going off encircled by some digital suit bleeps .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Again , another one of those examples of making the coming event bigger and more action packed if pre - ceded by silence .First reaction of the dialog in the suit - pretty neat !Many types of processing on voices sells the fact that the subject is not out in the open , and I think yours works .But just my opinion , the performance of the actors seemed a bit laid back , especially if you are hurdling at hundreds of miles per hour towards the surface of a planet exposed to forces that would make my stomach fly out my behind .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would have them do a more adrenaline fueled performance , and even if they go way dynamic on you , just slap a compressor on it and you should be fine .Throw in some heavy breathing and some stress / force emotional huffs and puffs and you should sell the ADR quite a bit more .\" Effort \" sounds keeps the audience connected with the characters on a more emotional level , playing off of the characters present state of stress .Sweet parachute noises !I wanted to hear a yank on the guy in the blue suit - I just heard the chute go off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The dialog is very very relaxed during this escalating emotional stressed moment - this does not build the correct tension for the audience in your current version .I loved the scream , but wanted more as he is tumbling on and off and into the flame .Or at least a knock - out \" oof \" to show he 's unconscious if no scream before getting sucked into the flame .I would have added a subliminal sucking noise to give more to the \" mini - story \" of him getting sucked into the flame .I loved blue suits ( kirk if I am correct ) landing onto the drill .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It does sound like his glove may be out of sync with the metal grab , and a bit white noisy for my ear , design .Again , great with the chutes , the sucking back into the pack was friggin ' awesome .The hatch open and humanoid alien voice is menacing , fitting audio for sure .His voice was a bit loud though in the mix , design .Bad ass laser gun and chute destruction , great design .Once again lacking in performance with the yellow suit actor as there is no sort of panicked dialog as he has now lost control of his chute - there s no way of knowing his in distress .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This felt a bit out of place , design .I will admit fight scenes are tricky to get them to flow right .I also heard a couple repeated hits of audio in a row , design .Spread the chaos across the sonic image , and let the collective audio build the volume - design .Awesome with the sword .It really sounded like it was flipping out and locking into place - The axe was a bit confusing as I did nt hear any metallic reinforcement to tag with the axe 's headpiece finish snapping together .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maybe a quick alien \" arg \" or \" oh no \" ( not literally oh no but you know what I mean ) effort as he gets vaporized by the fire , but definitely just a design opinion .I loved the body fall off and woosh sound it made falling past kirk , but then it kept repeating .If this is not the woosh of the body falling past kirk , and some other sound , then it syncs with his fall / disappearance off camera and could confuse the audience as to what exactly this sound is emitting from .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I hear them ready their guns and the audio is very present , then they unload their shots into the drill and the sound is quiet - just a mix design opinion .Very cool snippet , and your coverage was pretty thorough .Definite thought put into the sound and music .Very good practice and experience by doing this piece .I enjoyed it .Grab some more enthusiastic actors next time - and you have a few mix issues .Good job though .Hope this helps , and remember its just an opinion !Great choice of a clip , Chris .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think the sound of the dialogue at the start was a bit too reverberant .I would suggest creating the sound of them whooshing down to the platform and let the dialogue cut through that big sound while still sounding as if it were going through radio speakers .Your current filter for the dialogue works , I just think its as if they 're talking in a big room when it 's just a helmet .Great gun blasts !Perhaps the sound of parachute tearing should be heard a bit more as Kirk 's chute gets shot up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "At first they were added because I did not have any dialogue yet for those scenes and there was a missing element .The background does drop out unexpectedly sometimes at the end .That was an experiment and I figured correctly that a professional would pick up on it .There are some mixing fixes as well .Thanks for taking a look at my clip .low can either be a characteristic of subject OR low end can determined by proximity .usually if a loud sound is far off you only hear the low end - like a car coming down the road bumping rap - you only hear the snap and clap of snare and hats when its passing by you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
