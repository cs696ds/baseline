Wolf .It 's got 5 votes and an IMDB rating of 5.2 .Now here 's another short film in the same series , \" Speech : Platform Posture and Appearance \" .Same director , same writer , same lead actor , but this film had the misfortune to be double - billed with Red Zone Cuba on MST3K.

{"text": "The \" Normal \" set only includes films that had enough IMDB votes to be given a rating .I included shorts and episodes of TV shows .This is n't perfect , because IMDB 's plain - text data dump sometimes ( but not always ) gives a director 's credit where their website gives a writer 's credit .But it 's close enough .I took the average rating of the \" Normal \" list and the \" MST \" list .The difference between the two averages is how much it hurt that director to have one of their films featured on MST3K.", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For the sake of comparison , the mean rating for a movie on IMDB at large is 6.4 stars , the median is 6.6 stars , and the standard deviation is 1.6 stars .However , \" one star \" is not a consistent unit of measurement .I 'm considering redoing this table with normalized percentiles , but I 'm not convinced there 's a big demand for that , so for now you get stars .Data .Here 's a big table with the data for every director who had at at least five films in the \" Normal \" set and at least one in the \" MST \" set .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Now , for the explanation of Effect 2 .From Normal std we know how likely this director is to make a film that 's substantially better or worse than their average .If they made one bad film that was on MST3 K , and there was no MST3K - IMDB effect for that director , the rating for that film would most likely be within two standard deviations of the director 's average .But if there were a strong MST3K - IMDB effect for that director , the rating for the MSTed film would be much lower than the director 's other bad films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "A low Effect 2 just means that being on MST3 K does n't hurt a director 's ratings very much .It does n't say anything about the movie 's quality .OTOH , a director with a high Effect 2 is probably worth a second look in a non - MST3 K context .Look at the director at the bottom , David Elliot , with Effect 2 of 14.1 .He worked with Gerry Anderson , creator of \" Thunderbirds \" , and Invaders From The Deep is made up of recut episodes of \" Stingray \" , a \" Thunderbirds\"-type show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Let 's close out by taking a look at some of MST3 K 's favorite directors .But his record 8 MST3 K movies have an MST m of 3.2 , which is n't much worse .Put one of his movies on MST3 K and it loses only one star .Ed Wood is n't especially well - known for being on MST3 K but he does provide a pretty clear example of the MST3K - IMDB effect .His two MST movies have a MST m of 2.8 .Is The Sinister Urge ( IMDB rating : 2.11 ) really the worst movie Ed Wood ever directed ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Conclusion .I 'm still annoyed by those one - star reviews , but I understand them a little better now .When you watch , say , \" The Function of Gestures \" , you enjoy it for its camp value , you have fun with it , and you give it a relatively good rating .Finally , I 'd like to thank IMDB for , in a relic of its geeky past , making plain - text dumps of its data available .It 's a strange feeling to have a file open in an Emacs buffer that lists nearly every movie ever made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Each generated poem feels like a sonnet because it starts with a \" first line \" and ends with a \" last line \" and every line in between is placed where it was in some manually generated sonnet .I 've named the technique in honor of Queneau because I ca n't find anyone who used it earlier .It 's not universally better than a Markov chain , because it only works in certain cases : .It does n't work on free text , only on texts with a small - scale internal structure ( a poem , a paragraph , a short biography ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Outside of poetry , the paragraph is the Queneau assembly 's natural habitat .A pragraph has a flow to it , especially when you 've got something like a description of a board game or an asteroid that 's only one paragraph long .You need to handle things like quotes and parentheses that open in one sentence and do n't close by the end of the sentence , or that close without having opened .I wrote code for this in BGD but it does n't catch all the cases .Phrases made from words .In \" Board Game Dadaist \" , the names of games are also Queneau assemblies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In general , Queneau assemblies will not create coherent English sentences .Much as it pains me to admit , a Markov chain is better for that .It works for board game titles because we allow titles a lot of creative license , even up to the point of suspending the rules of grammar . \"Pirates !Denver \" makes no sense as a sentence , but it 's a perfectly good game title .Words made from letter - chunks .Many games have single - word titles , eg .\" Carcassonne \" .I wanted to have single - word titles in BGD , but I did n't want to duplicate real names .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
