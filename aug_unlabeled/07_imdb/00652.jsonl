{"text": "Wesley Snipes stars as a vampire who goes around killing other vampires with his big , long , sharp sword , hence the title .The film is a bit cheesy , but then again , I think this is the style the film makers were going for .In parts this film looks quite good , but in most of the other parts its crap .Lots of people enjoyed this film but I thought it was rubbish .It has a cheesy script , cheesy acting , lazy directing for the most part and it 's about vampires .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Comments .I found this film impossible to enjoy because it contains three of my least favourite actors - Sly Stallone , Sandra Bullock and Wesley Pipes , I mean Snipes ( where 's Billy Bong Thornton when you need him ? )The plot concerns a cop ( Stallone ) and a con ( Snipes ) from the 90 's who get cryogenically frozen .Snipes manages to escape ( ca n't remember how , maybe he snuck a hair dryer in with him or something .Stallone is the thawed out to recapture naughty Wesley .When Stallone is thawed out , he is confronted by what appears to be a Utopia , a perfectly sanitised world where crime appears to be practically non - existent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This plot could have been fairly entertaining , had it been played by actors I could have watched for more than 10 minutes without vomiting blood .If you can look past the terrible actors ( which I ca n't ) you may enjoy this film .Comments .Eddie Murphy plays Axel Foley again in this passable sequel .Foley has to travel back to Beverly Hills for more of the same culture shock jokes and wisecracks .And he solves a crime or something aswell .Whilst this film is funny in parts , you ca n't help but get the feeling Murphy 's heart is n't really in this film as it was with the original Beverly Hills Cop film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "nah , did n't think so , nah .Comments .This is one of my favourite films of all time .This is the kind of film John Woo should still be making instead of the Hollywood junk he churns out nowadays .The film follows the relationship of three friends and how they cope with the pressure put upon them when money and war come between them .In one film you have a fantastic war story , an indepth study of friendship and , this being a John Woo film , lots of kickass action .Brilliant .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "HIGHLY recommended .Comments .Comments .I have n't seen this film for a while , but doing this review has reminded me how much I enjoyed it when I saw it , and i will watch it again very soon .Brandon Lee ( Son of Bruce , he died making this film ) plays a guy who comes back to life with the help of a crow after some nasty dudes kill him and his girlfriend .He then seeks out the bad boys and wreaks revenge on them .The film looks beautiful with its dark , gothic scenery and is one of the most stylish films you will see , although there is n't that much substance to it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nic Cage is a very bad actor .This film is pretty good .Some convicts ( Led by John Malkovich ) hijack a prison transport plane and wreak havoc .Nic Cage is in the plane and has to stop them with the help of John Cusack or Ed Norton , ca n't remember which .They do .Like a lot of Hollywood action films , there is nothing particularily wrong with this film ( apart from Nic Cage , and while I 'm on the subject , what kind of idiot spells their name Nic ? ) , there 's just not anything particularily right .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Comments .This is the kind of film I really hate .It is plain to see that the script writer , Director and the actors have put absolutely no effort into this film .People who know me will tell you that I hate people who do nt make an effort as I am a workaholic .Stallone plays a mountain climber who was responsible for someones death and then gave up climbing .Whilst visiting friends he gets caught up with some terrorists who have accidently dropped all the money they had stolen on a mountain , and they need Sly tohelp them get it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you are thinking of watching this film , do n't .Read one of daviod 's dooyoo reviews instead , becuase even they are more enjoyable than this rubbish .Comments .See my face / off review for my criticism of John Woo 's Hollywood efforts .It 's harder to see Woo 's trademarks in this film than it is in Face / Off , but they are there , buried under the American shmultz .And some woman who I ca nt remember plays a forrest ranger who helps out slater .For an Hollywood film , it 's fine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And it 's not as good as Face / Off .Comments .This is a suprisingly good film for an Eddie Murphy vehicle .And Hilarity ensues .Well worth seeing .Try watching it on ITV as the editing adds another dimension to the humour : \" Forget you , you MotherForgetter \" .Poetry .Comments .Generic , very generic .Average , very average .Not much more you can say about this standard Hollywood fodder .Harrison Ford proves once again that he does n't deserve to be in better films as he plays the American president whose plane gets hijacked by those damn middle eastern terrorists again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Do nt bother buying or renting the video or DVD , but if it 's on TV and there is nothing better on , it might be worth watching .( I 'll add the punctuation later ) .Comments .This film is not nearly as intelligent as its predecessor , but action films do nt need to be intelligent .This film takes place about 15 years after the original .Sarah Connor is now in a mental hosiptal , and John Connor lives with some foster parents who he does n't get on with .Arnie comes back again , but this time he is a good terminator who has to protect John from another bad terminator .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The special effects are excellent , especially the Silicon Graphics made T-1000 .The final battle with the T-1000 is very cool .Several versions of this film exist , directors cut , special edition etc , I 'm not sure of the differences , but whatever version you get the chance to see , it 's well worth it .Comments .Come on , this film was never going to be oscar material , films based on computer games always suck the big red one ( except Tetris : The movie ) .This one is probably the worst of the bunch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ouch .M Bison is holding some hostages and some UN type agency has to rescue them .Guile and Cammy work for this agency .Along the way Chun Li , E Honda , Ken and Ryu also try to kick Bison 's ass .I supose they could have made a quite good film out of the Streetfighter franchise .Unfortuneatly they made this turkey .Avoid like the plague ( or TomDaBomb ) .Comments .This films plot seems pretty similar to Full Metal Jacket - although it 's not nearly as good .In the beggining they are at the boot camp and they have a strict drill instructor , one of them dies at boot camp , then they go off to the war , and , um , they say Sir , Yes Sir a lot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Actually , this is really nothing like Full Metal Jacket , that was a serious , intelligent film , this is just a bit of Hollywood fun .On it 's own merits , this film is very fun , although a little too cartoonish at times .If you are a fan of Sci - Fi , gore and explosions , which most of us are , you will probably enjoy this film on some level .Comments .Oh dear , oh dear , oh dear .After 3 good films we get this rubbish .This film is painful to watch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
