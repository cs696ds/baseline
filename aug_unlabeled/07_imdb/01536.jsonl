{"text": "Created by a Hungarian nobleman , the machine - man known as The Turk traveled Europe and America , made the acquaintance of Benjamin Franklin , Catherine the Great , Napoleon Bonaparte , and Edgar Allan Poe .Product Description .From Library Journal .The Turk was the name given to a chess - playing automaton created by Wolfgang von Kempelen in order to impress the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria - Hungary .In 1770 , von Kempelen demonstrated the Turk and so began a series of performances that would continue for 85 years , throughout Europe and eventually in the United States .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "By gradually ( a bit too gradually ) introducing the reader to the time period and the public 's preoccupation with all things mechanical , Standage shows the reader a world waiting to be amazed ; even if the amazement comes by way of an ingenious form of misdirection .With appearances by a number of figures who were intimately involved with The Turk 's \" performances to the interaction of such luminaries as Napoleon and Poe , Standage keeps the reader interested in each and every twist of The Turk 's rather bizarre history .It is only when Standage takes on the philosophy of the \" thinking machine \" does the book make a wrong turn ; it slows down the pace and interrupts the flow of what is otherwise an intriguing look this amazing example of man 's ingenuity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
