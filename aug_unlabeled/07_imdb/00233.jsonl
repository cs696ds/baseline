{"text": "I rememeber that was a line from a draft AICN reported of a sequel to the Naked Gun series .Although Leslie Nielsen was , above all , an actor , he gained worldwide fame with his comic roles , and I doubt he regreted any of it .I can not think of a single actor who could perform the deadpan , serious buffonesque Frank Drebin without looking ridiculous .He maintaned a dignity in all of his roles , no matter how pathetic the situation ( or plot ) was .He was a main part of a long forgotten genre of comedy , the screwball dadaistic comedy mastered by the Zuckers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Nielsen was definitely one of a kind .It 's funny how he could brilliantly exhude the type of menace he did in Creepshow yet wring huge comedy from deadpanning his dialogue in movies like Airplane and Naked Gun .I was actually in the middle of a Nielsen semi - marathon at home when I heard the news .Even in complete shitburgers like Stan Helsing and 2001 : A Space Travesty he comes away unscathed .A true character in every way .R.I.P. , you nutty Canadian .And I ca n't believe all the love out there for Forbidden Planet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Nielsen effortlessly crossed genres .From the square jawed hero of FP to all of the TV villains he played so well in early 70 's detective shows- which was my first encounter with his talent .I could not stand him in the early 70 's because he was always the smooth talking bad guy .Then , one very late night I saw the movie that changed Sci Fi - Forbidden Planet .Simply breathtaking .He became one of my favorites from then on .When he had a career rebirth as an unrivaled deadpan comic actor with impeccable timing , it truly showcased the talent he possessed -and through hard work and perseverance and luck was able to share with the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "These horror cliches have relaxed over time , but we 'll probably never get rid of them completely since they 're largely what make most horror films possible .There are tons of these tropes and rules depending on how specific you want to get , but here are the main offenders .And while exceptions will always present themselves , there 's a reason why they 're called \" exceptions .\" Everyone Is an Idiot .For a horror film to work , people have to make some pretty awful decisions .Splitting a group up seems especially stupid when dealing with a serial killer who picks people off individually , but horror film characters do it all the time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There a whole universe of horror stupidity .But if everyone did the smart thing , we 'd have no more horror to watch .The Car Never Starts .Do n't bother driving a car into a horror film .It 's not going to start .You could take the Presidential State Car , you could take Arnold Schwarzenegger 's Humvee , you could take Bullitt 's Mustang .At the moment of truth , it will find a way to not turn over .The fact is , most horror villains use their feet for transportation ( though some seem to have teleportation capabilities ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So it 's works best to just pretend every automobile 's a lemon .Bad Cell Reception .Along with cars that do n't work , it 's also very difficult to find reliable cellphone reception in a horror film .So if you need to talk to someone , you 'd better have some carrier pigeons .It 's probably for the best .As we see at the beginning of ' Jason Goes to Hell , ' a massive posse of gun toting authority figures can ruin a serial killer 's plans to silently murder people pretty quickly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's Always a Jerk Who Ruins Everything .If the heroes in a horror film come up with a doable survival scenario , one of them will inevitably screw it up .It 's usually a male , and it 's usually not a very nice male .Sometimes the guy 's alpha male idiocy can lead to a decent fight with the killer near the end , but rest assured this character will die and he 'll die big enough to make the crowd cheer .The Black Guy Always Dies .There 's this fake horror cliche you always hear about where the black guy ( or girl ) always dies first .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The black guy does always die in horror films .Just not often at the beginning .They 're usually third or fourth .The same goes for Asians .Or any race filmmakers throw in to make their cast of characters more ethnically diverse .The Killer Never Dies .Invincibility is never a good foundation for tension , and yet horror films rely on it to a great degree .For the most part , horror films either end with the killer killing everyone , or one or two survivors turning the tables and taking the killer out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It does n't matter - somehow his body will reform , hardly scratched and ready for more .Adult Authority Figures are Useless .Sometimes victims on the run will seek help from authority figures such as police officers or their fathers .This wo n't work .One cop and one daddy is no good .You need to inspire a whole police department and/or family reunion to take action on your behalf .But that probably wo n't happen because the other thing about horror film authority figures is they rarely believe the blood and guts stories scared young people lay on them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No Guns .Horror films would go by a lot faster if more killers or victims carried guns .Whether a pistol , shotgun , or automatic weapon , the ability to blow someone 's brains out from across the street would simplify matters drastically on both sides of the predator / prey dichotomy .Filmmakers claim guns are too impersonal to scare , but that 's just an excuse .Yes , Michael Myers has been shot many times and keeps getting back up , but he probably would n't if Loomis had split his head open with a sawed - off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ironically , they 're the ones where more people should use blades .Sex Will Get You Killed .This one goes without saying , but if you want to survive a horror film , it 's probably best you do n't get it on at any point during the movie .Or before the movie .Or after , just to make sure .In fact , even if you wait until marriage , you probably do n't want to do it then because you 'll just make a baby who will one day become yet another doomed teenager .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Get thee to a nunnery .Women Ca n't Run Without Falling Down .Horror movies often pick one lady who gets to survive beyond the end of the film .Men have a much lower survival rate .The gender trade - off , though , is that horror films see women as athletically faulty idiots who can not run across a field without falling over .Sometimes it 's thanks to their high - heels .Sometimes they trip over a branch .But a lot of times gravity just seems to grab them and slam them down to Earth without provocation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
