{"text": "Just seen The Chronicles of Narnia ; The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe .And I have to say I throughly enjoyed it .Laughed a fair bit also which was nice .Non spoilery stuff ... .The child actors were very well cast , all four of them held their own against the backdrop of Narnia and the mythical creatures .I found their parts , very well handled .The CGI was good , sometimes not brilliant , but it more than did the job .And Aslan was wonderful .Swinton as the White Witch was impressive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The use of locations , after Jackson was done with NZ for LOTR was no where near the scale it could of been .Whearas Jackson used the scenery almost as another cast member , in Narnia it played second fiddle .Which was fine with me .This was one film , and did not have the luxury of being able to dwell for too long .The plot moved along at a decent pace , a few changes to the book , but nothing that failed on film .All in all , a great family film that will keep the grown ups / adults happy also .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The whole film was cast with English / British accents .This of course makes sense to me .Yet why o why was Maugrim given a distinctly American English sounding accent .It completly ruined the part for me .And to make it even more noticeable , it was the only use of an American accent in the whole film .Afwul thing to do .But there , tis done .I saw \" Syriana \" this afternoon .It was way too real and \" right now \" to be thoroughly enjoyable ... it was actually painful at times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "George Clooney did one of those \" disappearing acts \" into his character .He gained a lot of weight , and grew a pretty full beard .I 'm thinking he 's going to be nominated for an Oscar for this role .He was that good .Who knew ?I thought he was just pretty .I finally saw Harry Potter this week and enjoyed it quite a bit .I have bad retention when it comes to books , so I did n't feel like it was missing too much , and I really liked the end with Voldemort .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I 'm such a girl .I loved Aslan and The White Witch .Very well done .It was a little odd seeing the actor who played the Oompa Loompas in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory play such an evil minion .I was n't sure about the child actors in the beginning of the movie , but I grew to enjoy their performances as the movie progressed a little bit .The only character I found a little off was Mr. Tumnus .I always pictured him older and well green ?Was n't he green ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There was absolutely no George Clooney in that character .I think George Clooney did a lot of physical acting in this movie .The way his eyes darted around constantly and the way his mouth was hanging open much of the time made him appear to be fearful in a way you do n't usually see CIA operatives on film .And the torture scene was well done .( I do n't want to give too much away . )But , I did feel that the way the CIA delt with him was sort of cliche ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
