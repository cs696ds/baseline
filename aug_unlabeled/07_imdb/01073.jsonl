{"text": "Below average superhero film with no major faults in casting but it could have been a lot better .The script and charachters are as cliche as it comes and SFX arn't great which is one thing action films need to impress the 12 year old film goers of today .This movie was alright .The storyline was n't very good .Although I think Nicolas Cage is a good actor , I think he was the wrong person for the part .He did n't make the character seem real .I would like to say the special effects for the Ghost Rider was awesome .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Reason ?Well it was mainly because of the loudness and a very dumb storyline .The action was terrible .The acting and dialogue was totally laughable .I barely got entertained for the first fifteen minutes .This is the worst Superhero movie I have yet seen .I ca n't believe some people actually like this film .Films based on Superhero comics can be excellent such as Spider - Man 2 , decent such as Fantastic Four and absolutely appalling such as Catwoman , and it 's sad to say that Ghost Rider is not very good .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's not as bad as Hulk or Howard the Duck , but it 's not very far off .As most Marvel comic book adaptions go there almost always great and have some amazing depth of character , heart and power to drive the complex story of an ordinary man put in an extraordinary situation .While Ghost Rider has heart and power it lacks the depth of character and skill to properly tell the story of one of Marvel 's not so likable anti - hero 's .Ghost Rider boast a powerful and driven story but it lacks much of what made previous Marvel comic book adaptions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But all we get in returns is hammy dialogue , misguided action sequences and a story that makes little to no sense at times .But it is a fun ride for your money , a ride that 's not easy to sit through but fun none the less .Nicholas Cage(Who has done better . )Is not really convincing or moving as The Ghost Rider , He does n't invoke a sense of sorrow from the audience and in turn we ca n't truly feel the pain and lose of his character Johnny Blaze .Peter Fonda(Who is good here but ca n't save this movie . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But he does good none the less .Eva Mendes(Who just solidified herself as one of Hollywood 's worst actress . ) is just down right terrible in this , she ca n't bring emotion and even if she does she sounds like she 's from a soap Opera and she really brings this film down .But all in all the cast does adequately with there assigned parts and try so very hard to make this a good movie but sadly ca n't elevate this movie pass alright .All in all Ghost Rider is fair entertainment it wo n't win any new fans or respect as a movie as time goes on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Woah .Woah .This is a garbage .Look at this , Nicholas Cage is playing Johnny Blaze .Why ?Just ... why ?I ca n't review this film , that 's how much I dislike it .I want to be civil and write a proper review for it but I ca n't without nerding out about how awful it is .I wanted Ghost Rider to jump out the screen and eat my soul so I would n't have to watch it .This is it .This is the worst comic - book film ever produced .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My goodness what a terrible film this movie 's leading star in just painful to watch .This movie sums up Nicolas Cage 's roles in movies lately rather well .Eva Mendes just proves my point further that she ca nt act whatsoever .Filled with cheesey Dialogue and lame effects the worst part about this film is I went to see this crap in the theaters .As a fan of comic books and comic book movies , i have to say that i really enjoyed this movie .it really does have its moments , good and bad .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This movie is fun when your in the right environment and the right mood .One of my favorite aspects of this movie ars the special effects .The first time Johny Blaze turns into the Ghost Rider is truly fasinating and really cool .Nicholas Cage 's preformance is lack - luster , and they probably should have gone with someone much younger to allow more sequels , but I think he was enthusiastic about his part and did n't want to let anyone down .Sam Elliot was good doing what he does best , the people who played the demons where bad , and Peter Fonda was a good , deceitful devil .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
