{"text": "Boys can be so stupid .The Evidence .Were it not for 2001 's Sidewalks of New York , She 's the One would be writer / director Ed Burns ' best movie .It may be a relic of the mid-90s ( when Burns was at his most relevant as a director ) , but it 's an agreeable relic .Make no mistake about it : She 's the One is not a Great Film .It is slight .It is formulaic .It leans towards situation comedy more than it does towards cinema at times , but that 's where Burns ' intentions lie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , it was the mid ' 90s , and EVERY studio / indie was about people sitting around and talking .Burns ' dialogue has never been as clever or good as he seems to think - every character sounds very similar - but the movie had something that 's impossible to fake : charm .It as charming , and charming can go a long way .She 's the One loses some of that charm , because Burns is no longer the indie filmmaker struggling to get the movie he made with his friends and family made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps not surprisingly , all of those things work in the movie 's favor ; sure , it may have to trade in some of that \" charm , \" but it 's a welcome sacrifice if it makes the movie better .And She 's the One is a better movie - a more polished , refined , insightful retelling of many of the themes in Brothers McMullen .Jennifer Aniston , who was still a rising star on Friends and just getting her foot in the door of movie acting , is spunky and likable ; Amanda Peet , in one of her earlier roles , is very funny in a small part as her sister .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Mike McGlone , who Burns basically discovered on Brothers McMullen , is really good at playing a specific kind of prick ; though the performance is slightly one note , it 's a note that works .That Cameron Diaz is pretty much gone .Ah , but there is a weak spot at the center of the movie , and that 's the casting of Burns and his then - girlfriend Maxine Bahns as the two leads .I 've always kind of liked Burns as an actor - he 's got a movie star quality about him , which explains why he 's arguably been more successful as an actor in other people 's films than as a director - but he 's saddled with a single expression in here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She 's very pretty and she 's at least sincere , but she 's not a professional actor .She could get away with it in Brothers McMullen , but when she 's acting opposite John Mahoney and Leslie Mann ( in one of her early roles , playing a character who is totally unpleasant for no good reason ) , Bahns ' inexperience really comes through .All of the bonus features are the same ones from the DVD that came out 12 years ago .While still low budget by Hollywood standards , She 's the One is probably the best - looking of all Burns ' movies , and the 1080p HD transfer does a good job of bringing out what 's best about the photography .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Detail is good , colors are warm and the image has a nice film - like appearance .There 's only a stereo audio track offered ( no 5.1 remixing has been done ) , but it 's at least lossless and sufficient for the talky film 's demands .What really stands out is the score by Tom Petty , which gives the movie personality and texture without ever overpowering the scenes .Burns always gives good commentary tracks ( especially for aspiring filmmakers looking to learn tricks for shooting movies for little money ) , and his talk over She 's the One ( while a little patchy ) is no exception .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The other bonus features are standard promotional items : a press kit featurette , a trailer and the video for the Tom Petty song \" Walls , \" still maybe the best thing to come out of She 's the One .Closing Statement .She 's the One is basically a time capsule from a very specific part of the 1990s , when the Sundance generation were all getting the chance to work on a bigger and better stage .Burns used his opportunity to basically remake his first movie with better production values , and was quickly ( and somewhat correctly ) labeled a one - trick pony for his efforts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
