{"text": "Boasting a better budget that 's normally afforded a middle tier King adaptation , Needful Things also benefits from being able to assemble a very strong cast .And on the money they are too .Sydow has a great time , relishing another chance to play charismatic villainy and Harris as the Sheriff is a bastion of hard working honest Americana .It 's here with the number of characters in the story that the negative flip side of the film shows its hand .With the trimming and cutting comes the inevitable absence of character development , something that is evident both in the book and the film 's extended form .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
