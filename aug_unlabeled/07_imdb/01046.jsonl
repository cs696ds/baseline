{"text": "In order to expand and reach more readers , I have moved Adventures of a Young Feminist to a new , self - hosted site !Please update your subscriptions , links , blogrolls , etc .Friday , August 7 , 2009 .I have been waiting for a while for 500 Days of Summer to come out in Grand Rapids .And today , I finally got to go see it .I have been in love with Zooey Deschanel since I saw Tin Man and Joseph Gordon - Levitt since 10 Things I Hate About You , so I thought they were going to be a great match up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , let 's start off with the bad news first ( aka , the stuff I did n't like or found problematic ) : .It was told entirely from a male perspective : The movie was through the eyes of Joseph Gordon - Levitt 's character , Tom .We only got into the mind of Zooey Deschanel 's character , Summer , when she talked to Tom .So we never really got to fully see what she was thinking or feeling .And also because of this , Summer was portrayed , in some parts , as crazy , unemotional , or inconsiderate because all we saw of her was what Tom 's interpretation of her was .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But we never really get to hear Summer 's side of the story .We hear her explain her feelings to Tom , but it 's not the same as getting into her head as the movie does with Tom .It portrays skinny women as the norm : Yes , most tv shows and movies do this .But the movie actually says it .At the beginning of the movie , the narrator is describing Summer .He says she 's normal height , normals weight , and slightly larger than normal shoe size , while pointing out on a still image , her height , weight , and shoe size .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I understand that you 're hurting , Tom - fictional movie character , but I do n't think that it 's ok to call her a skank or whore just because you got your feelings hurt .In addition to that , when Summer is explaing to Tom and his friend that she does n't want a serious relationship and does n't believe in love , she gets asked if she 's a lesbian and then it is declared that she 's a guy .Stereotypes much ?And now on the why I really did enjoy the movie ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She 's not afraid to tell Tom that she does n't want a serious relationship and refuses to put labels on their relationship .She does n't embody the stereotypical role of women ( of wanting relationships and commitment ) and she is n't afraid to express it .It 's got a pretty unique storyline and film editing : We know from the beginning that this is not a love story , which is kind of a lie , but kind of not .But this already puts it one step ahead of most rom - coms .The movie also jumps between times , which adds an interesting aspect to the storyline .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This adds a lot of interest to the movie .Dating advice from a little sister : Tom gets dating advice from his little sister , who I would estimate to be around 13 or 14 years old .She tells it like it is and actually has some good advice for him .It definitely has its funny moments : While it 's not always funny to watch a depressed person on the big screen , Joseph Gordon - Levitt pulls it off .I laughed throughout the movie and so did a lot of people in the theater ( unfortunately , the ones sitting close to me had really annoying , loud laughs ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While it 's definitely not on the bigger end of most movies made , it 's not exactly an indie film either , even though it tries to be .I do recommend this movie because it 's amusing , unique , and cute .And I love Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon - Levitt and they have great chemistry on screen .Have you seen 500 Days of Summer ?What did you think of it ?To get a taste of their chemistry together , watch this video that they made to one of Zooey 's band 's songs ( \" Why Do You Let Me Stay Here \" by She & Him ) : . 2 comments : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I completely agree with you on the points about skinny as the norm , dating advice from the little sister , the funny moments , and the unique editing .However , while I certainly can not argue with the fact that it was told entirely from a male perspective , I did n't really mind that .I thought that it was interesting to see a movie that normally would be considered \" just another chick flick \" told from the male perspective .That being said , there were certainly times when Summer was a bit irrational without the opportunity to explain herself , which sucks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The friend was drunk and really just looked like an idiot ( at least to me ) and it gave Summer a chance to explain her point of view - that she can be an independent woman without a man in her life .I actually really liked that scene .The name - calling after the break up is certainly not ok though .But in the bar scene , I saw it more as making fun of the friend ( and stereotypes in general ) rather than making Summer out to be some sort of freak who must be a lesbian or a dude because she does n't want a boyfriend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I really did like your article and will definitely bookmark your blog !The movie was a somewhat true story from one of the screenwriters , ( it says so at the beginning ) so it was written from the guys point of view on purpose .If I ( a girl , though ) wrote about my last relationship I would n't be able to give you the guy 's point of view either , I could only make it up .Therefore , I liked this movie because that one point made this movie more true to real relationships than most of the other rom - coms out there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
