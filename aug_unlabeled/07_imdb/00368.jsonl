{"text": "I thought the movie was perfect !The characters were all just right .It was a very well thought out production .I have heard alot of people complain that the movie left alot of stuff that was in the book out .If they put every thought that Bella , Edward or any other character had in the movie it would have been a 6 hour movie .If a person would have seen the movie before reading the book I think they would not be so critical about it .Everything in the movie was perfect !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You felt the way they did .I have not one complaint about the movie .Very satisfied !It is pure torture that Edward is a Fictional character !I think that is why the women and girls want him so bad .You always want what you ca nt have !I just saw the movie and WOW .I would give it 4 stars , because I loved it and it was great , but it was n't as great as it could have been .Good points : -Rob and Kristen 's acting , and , well , really the acting in general .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "-The baseball scene .SO COOL !-The \" everything about me invites you in \" bit .Rob 's acting was just ...I do n't know .I loved it .It was intense !-And also Rob 's acting after the Guys in Port Angeles .You know , where he 's all worked up ?That was pretty good too .-The music .AWESOME !Exept that Decode was n't in the movie and there was one part that was a little \" Harry Potter\"-ish .-ALMOST everything else .Bad points : -The stuff they cut out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like , you never find out what Jasper 's power is for one .And EdwardandBella never say \" I LOVE YOU \" !-The rushed - ness .Some stuff was random , and there was n't really and build up to Edward and Bella 's romance , which is essentially what Twilight is about .It was kinda like , \" I HATE you , but now I 'm very interested in you , but we ca n't be friends anyway , partly because I 'm SO in love with you ! \"Whoa .But overall , I loved it ! totally awesome and pretty true to the book .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
