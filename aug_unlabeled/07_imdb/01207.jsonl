{"text": "The business with the snakes is presumably inspired by the stories about Philip seeing her sleeping by a snake around the time she conceived Alexander - which were meant to imply that Alexander was the son of a god , usually Zeus .She 's portrayed as foreign and exotic , with a pseudo - mid - European accent ( as opposed to all the others who have ...Irish accents .Hmm .I 'll get to that ) .But although young Alexander refers to all of them as Greeks , Olympias is actually the only Greek - the others are all Macedonians .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The ancient world did not have separate terms for ' heterosexual ' , ' homosexual ' , ' bisexual ' and so on .There was sex - you have it with wives to produce children , with captives to demonstrate power , with boys / men ( depending on city - state ) for love / lust / affection .Or you 're Plato and you try to argue for the superiority of a meeting of minds .The bit where everything gets tinted red is pretty weird , but I think it 's supposed to symbolise Alexander 's disoriented state after being shot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
