{"text": "As for the black specks on corn chips , tortillas and tortilla chips mystery , Feldman explains that each kernel of corn has a hilum , sort of an umbilical cord where the kernel attaches to the cob .The kernel gets nutrients through the hilum while in grows .As the corn grows , the color of the hilum changes from no color to light green , light brown and finally to black .Chip makers use more mature corn to produce their chips .Hence , you see the black spots , which are the remains of the hilum .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "WHY ARE THE SPRINKLES PUT ON ICE CREAM CALLED JIMMIES ?Feldman did a lot of research on this and finally discovered the answer at the \" Just Born \" factory .Jimmies were invented by the Just Born company in 1930 .Samuel Born was a Russian immigrant who invented the machine that inserted sticks in lollipops , the machine that coats chocolate on ice cream and the extruder that makes Easter \" peeps . \" Jimmies were invented at the Just Born factory and named after an employee , Jimmy Bartholomew , who worked the chocolate pellet machine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Yet there are a few sightings of elephants jumping in the wild .Veterinarian Judy Provo found two books in her college library that illustrate the discrepancy .S. K. Ettingham 's Elephant lays out the conventional thinking : \" ... because of its great weight , an elephant can not jump or even run in the accepted sense since it must keep one foot on the ground at all times . \"But an account in J. J. William 's Elephant Bill describes a cow elephant jumping a deep ravine \" like a chaser over a brook . \" Animals that are fast runners or possess great leaping ability have usually evolved these skills as a way of evading attackers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only other thing that could kill an elephant is a fourteen - ton tiger .\" Most of the experts agree with zoologist Richard Landesman of the University of Vermont that there is little reason for an elephant to jump in its natural habitat .Indeed , Mike Zulak , an elephant curator at the San Diego Zoo , observes that pachyderms are rather awkward walkers , and can lose their balance easily , so they tend to be conservative in their movements .But that does n't mean that elephants are pushovers .Why bother jumping when you can walk through or around just about everything in your natural habitat ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Veterinarian Myron Hinrichs , of Petaluma , California , notes that the traditional trench has to be at least two meters deep , two meters across at the top , and one and one - half meters across at the bottom to serve as a barrier for elephants : .That tells us that they ca n't or wo n't try to jump a distance of 6.5 feet .But these trenches have a high failure rate , for elephants can fill them in , especially in the rainy season , and then walk across the trough they have made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Why leap when you can trudge ?Submitted by Jena Mori , of Los Angeles , California .WHY WAS HE CALLED THE ' LONE RANGER ' WHEN TONTO WAS ALWAYS HANGING AROUND ? the classic western features a lone hero entering a new town and facing a villain who threatens the peacefulness of a dusty burg .The Lone Ranger , on the other hand , came with a rather important backup , Tonto .Leaving aside questions of political correctness or racism , calling the masked man the Lone Ranger is a little like calling Simon and Garfunkel a Paul Simon solo act .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Lone Ranger started as a radio show , first broadcast out of Detroit in 1933 , created by George Trendle , and written by Fran Striker .The first episode established that circa 1850 , the Lone Ranger was one of six Texas Rangers who were trying to tame the vicious Cavendish Gang .Unfortunately , the bad guys ambushed the Rangers , and all of the Lone Ranger 's comrades were killed .The Lone Ranger himself was left for dead .Among the vanquished was the Lone Ranger 's older brother , Dan .So for a few moments , long enough to give him his name , the Lone Ranger really was by himself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "John Reid did .The Lone Ranger and Tonto met a man who the Cavendish Gang tried to frame for the Texas Ranger murders .Sure of his innocence , the Lone Ranger put him in the silver mine that he and his slain brother owned , and turned it into a \" silver bullet \" factory .Eventually , during the run of the radio show , which lasted from 1933 to 1954 , the duo vanquished the Cavendish Gang , but the Lone Ranger and Tonto knew when they found a good gig .They decided to keep the Lone Ranger 's true identity secret , to keep those silver bul - lets flowing , and best of all , to bounce into television in 1949 for a nine - year run on ABC and decades more in syndication .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
