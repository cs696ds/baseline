{"text": "Casino Jack .Directed by George Hickenlooper .Special Features : Casino Jack - A Director 's Photo Diary Gag Reel Deleted Scenes .Other Info : Widescreen ( 2.35:1 ) Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound Spanish Subtitles Running Time : 109 Minutes .Synopsis : The following is the official description of the film : . \" Two - time Academy Award \u00ae Winner Kevin Spacey delivers a ' bravura performance ' ( The New Yorker ) in this ' uproarious , riveting and wickedly hilarious ' ( Elle ) film inspired by a true story .Spacey stars as Jack Abramoff , the real - life Washington power player who resorted to jaw - dropping levels of fraud and corruption .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But when Jack and his womanizing protege Michael Scanlon ( Barry Pepper ) enlist a dimwitted business partner ( Jon Lovitz ) for an illegal scheme , they find themselves ensnared in a web of greed and murder that explodes into a worldwide scandal . \" \" Casino Jack \" is rated R for pervasive language , some violence and brief nudity .The Movie : The story of \" super - lobbyist \" Jack Abramoff is the stuff that Hollywood thrives on since to most , it 's unfathomable that someone in Washington , D.C. could have gotten away with what he did before finally being busted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately , he then diluted those facts with humor in order to try and make a more entertaining film .This creates a rather strange tone that veers closer towards dark absurdist comedy than drama , and it 's a strange direction to take with this story .Even when Jack gets fired from his law firm for ethical violations , his ego remains wildly out of control .Spacey looks and sounds nothing like the real Abramoff , so instead he enhances the character by doing impressions of other movie characters , spouting their famous lines and high - five - ing his similarly douchey partner and friend Mike Scanlon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For the most part , both of their performances are taken ridiculously over the top to try to make the movie funnier .In some ways , the results act somewhat like a companion piece to Alex Gibney 's documentary of the similar name although Hickenlooper 's film glosses over or leaves out large chunks of the story , like how Abramoff first got involved with Senator Tom Delay .Instead , it expects the audience to know a lot of the Abramoff story going in , so seeing Gibney 's doc beforehand would probably be a wise idea for those who never followed the story on the news .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After repeatedly pleading the 5th Amendment to every query , he then goes off on a Al Pacino level tirade trying to defend all of the crooked things he 's done .More than anything , this is a story about hubris and how it can lead to one man 's downfall , but Jack is never particularly likeable so it 's hard to imagine people will be able to empathize with him .As much as it 's fun seeing Kevin Spacey let loose and his charisma and personality is always enough to carry any movie , portraying Abramoff as a loveable rogue does a huge disservice to all the people he ripped off . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The sad truth is that as interesting as the Abramoff case may have been , embellishing that story with so much humor makes the film feel more like a political parody than a document of what really happened .If that 's what you 're looking for , you 'd probably be better off seeing Gibney 's doc on the subject instead .The Extras : This DVD is pretty light on the bonus features .You get an extensive gag reel that shows Spacey clowning around between takes .You also get a batch of deleted scenes .One of the more interesting things about the deleted scenes is seeing just how much they used green screen in the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
