{"text": "Rebecca 's suspicions arise after Justin makes an almost miraculous recovery .Kevin pushes Saul to the edge to get some answers .Nora , Sarah and Kitty decide to go to a spa .Tommy tries to make friends but ends up in an embarrassing situation .Relapse Written by Sherri Cooper And Liz Tigelaar Directed by Michael Schultz .It also begged the question - if Kevin knew or even thought that Saul might be gay would he have said something to Scotty about it ?As a Walker , he 's got a genetic inability to keep a secret but at the same he rarely confides anything outside of his family so perhaps .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It would be easy to attack Scotty because he can be very presumptuous when he wants to be but here his little slip up had no more to with being clueless rather than being vicious .Scotty might be many things but he 's not an outright nasty person .If he was then Kevin would n't be anywhere near him .Funnily enough Kevin is quick to refute Scotty 's claims that Saul might be gay even when Scotty takes an analysis at Saul 's relationship history .To be honest , it is n't Scotty 's place to really do that and while many of Saul 's patterns can be attributed to straight men too , there 's no denying that Saul could be gay .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A few episodes ago I might have rubbished the claim that Saul was gay but I have to admit that after this episode , it 's very likely that he is gay ( or even bisexual ) .During their argument , Kevin also throws in his own issues that he had to face when coming out .Getting anything on Kevin and William 's relationship is great and I really like that while Kevin is trying to get the truth out of Saul , he 's also attempting to be supportive and deal with his own issues at the same .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's by far the strongest one of the whole episode and their later scene where Saul once again refutes being gay is a nice way of ending things .It 's great that it was Kevin who apologised but its better that his concern for Saul is more vocalised as well .However as supportive as Kevin is , I did have a feeling that Saul would just go and say the same thing again .I 'm guessing there are more twists to unfold with this plot so for the time being , Saul is going to remain in the closet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Justin might have managed to get Nora out of his hair for a whole episode but he 's another person with major problems .He 's not making a faster recovery than he 'd like and it 's pretty much demoralising him .Even though at the physio , he 's being told by the therapist that he 's making good progress , Justin does n't feel it .It also does n't help when another wounded Army vet comes in and brags about being as high as a kite .I 'm pretty sure they are the exact words to not say to a drug addict who has to take medication .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A part of me would scold Rebecca but it 's so painfully obvious that Justin has just gone and done exactly that .Needless to say , he 's not going to come out and admit it .Instead he decides to make Rebecca feel as bad as she can about accusing him of relapsing and while Rebecca is a smart girl , she does manage to buy into Justin 's fake indignation .It 's too bad because she does actually end up admitting how much she gets on with him and Justin has made a total fool out of her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then again , Justin is n't the only one who seems happy to play with fire this week .The usually responsible Tommy also runs the risk of getting his hands burned .Given that things between him and Julia are souring to the point where she wo n't return his phone calls , was it really the smartest thing in the world for him to go and sleep with Lena of all people ?I know Tommy 's determined not to become like his father but sleeping with Lena is certainly not the way to avoid such behaviour .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Whenever Holly gets righteously moral , my mind goes to two places .Regarding this plot , I believed that she had every right to lecture Tommy on how sleeping with an employee could damage both his marriage and the winery business .That being said , Holly does overstep the mark a few times with the way she mentions William that you almost wish Tommy would channel Sarah and give her a verbal ass kicking .Now as for Lena , I know I should hate her but I do n't .Sleeping with Tommy was a bad idea and if it continues , she 'll basically be the new Holly in the show but she does n't strike as an altogether nasty person .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However much as I love this series , I really wished the writers had n't gone there with these two .I knew they were going to but I still wished they had n't .Thankfully this episode is n't totally devoid of fun .Sarah might be brooding about her ten year anniversary coming up and Kitty might have her own problems with Robert but that does n't stop both women from embarking on a relaxing weekend at a spa .Of course , that also includes a weekend with Nora who scores an invite with little effort on her part .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The girls might have able to enjoy massages and the works but bring them to a quiet room and they 'll make sure the damn place is noisy in seconds .If Nora is n't trying to dispense unwanted advice to both Sarah and Kitty , then Kitty irritates one of the employees by using a cell phone in the room .Needless to say that all the noise they manage to contribute gets them kicked out of the very room itself .Even if this lot were in a monastery , they 'd still manage to cause a racket .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nope instead Nora encourages her daughters to gatecrash a wedding and funnily enough , Sarah is the only one who needs seriously persuading in the matter .Part of the reason for the spa weekend was to cheer Sarah up so you ca n't accuse Kitty or Nora for shirking that responsibility , can you ?Plus once they are at the wedding , Sarah is also able to meet a fit bloke named Cliff but the chances of her engaging in any fun get killed by her lack of self - esteem .Too bad because Cliff is really hot and it 's not like Joe is pining for Sarah .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As for Nora , her issues seem to be the fact that everyone thinks she 's a general busy body .Given that she rarely leaves her children to get on with their lives , she 's only got herself to blame and even when she vows not to give advice on certain matters , both Sarah and Kitty is able to break her down .For Sarah she wants to move on from Joe .Not screwing Cliff meant that she had difficulty but after listening to Nora , she 's able to call Kevin to start getting the divorce proceedings cracking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kitty on the other hand has her own beef with Robert .One minute she 's happy to help Sarah , the next minute she does n't want to hear anything regarding divorce .Mainly because her and Robert have n't been communicating that well and Robert does n't help by ignoring her attempts to engage in better conversation with him .Personally , I 'm willing to bet that what Courtney said to her in \" History Repeating \" hit a nerve and if so , then good .Robert can be lost in his own little world and if he does become president ( which I 'm still hoping he wo n't ) , then he might even pay less attention to Kitty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Honestly I 'm in favour of them and I think it 's less about his faith in Kitty 's commitment to him and more about being financially solvent .Not that Kitty is the gold digger type anyway but you ca n't blame Robert 's people for being practical .Even Kitty sees the logic with the pre - nuptial and while she has a nice moment with Robert , it turns out that he does n't even want her to sign it anyway .Maybe Robert does n't think Kitty would cripple him financially .Looking at the amount of shoes she has in her closet , I would be a little worried .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kevin and Saul 's antics were particularly the most intriguing .more less .Great episode .Justin taking more drugs behind Rebecca 's back , not good .But I knew it was going to happen , he 's a drug addict and they should keep the pain killers away from him .Silly Rebecca and Nora .As for the spa get away I thought that was quite funny .I knew Sarah had the wrong door when she was with that guy .And Kitty and the pre - nup was funny too , how just was hinting to Robert but he was n't taking the bait .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was like that lady was following them just to tell them to shut up .But it was funny too .Kitty and Sarah begrudgingly take a spa trip with Nora .Rebecca takes care of Justin , and is suspicious when he makes rapid progress .Kevin confronts Saul over his sexuality and Tommy struggles to deal with his marriage problems .more less .An enjoyable episode of Walker fun and mischief , but not my favourite .There seemed to be a lot of conflict and despair in this episode without many of the sweet family moments that make this show brilliant .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For once all the siblings had a storyline , as did Saul , Nora and Holly which was nice to see .I loved the antics of the ladies at the spa , their conflict and eventual resolution .Justin 's storyline was inevitable but very strong in execution .I 'm not sure if I love Saul 's storyline but Kevin confronting him was interesting and it was nice to see some screen time between the two away from the Ojai problems .The wedding crashing was hilarious and typically Walker style .It focussed on Nora 's role as a mother and she feels her life essentially will and always will revolve around her children and her children not seeing this as the case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The struggle between parent and child is always going to be there in families such as the Walkers and I felt that it was really well done .Also Robert 's a bit stupid for not having a pre - nup .He off all people should know that marriages can go wrong .I think it was a bit sappy on the writer 's part to have them not sign a pre - nup .I think she could really use some fun after what she is going through with Joe .Kevin is probably the best person to deal with Saul 's confusion over his sexuality as he wo n't inform the whole Walker clan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's good to see Balthazar Getty getting some decent screen time and storylines for him to display his acting talent .Hopefully Julia wo n't find out about it , but lets face it , this is Brothers and Sisters !She is the voice of wisdom on the subject of cheating so it was good to see her try and protect both Tommy and the business .Overall a decent episode , though not my favourite , mostly due to the disappointing outcome of Tommy 's storyline .There were many classic moments in this episode mostly with the spa girls , though Justin 's storyline was also very compelling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of the better episodes of season 2 so far .The spar storyline was brilliant , hilarious .I really like Sarah and find her storyline with Joe very interesting , she is just a likable character .Nora brings a lot of humour to the episode and is definitely one of the better characters of the show .Tommy perhaps having an affair with Lena was kind of like , just do n't , I liked how Holly confronted him .Do n't like the Saul storyline , but that 's more because I do n't like him , Kevin is good though .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Justin is another character I 've never warmed too , but I actually did quite enjoy his story with Rebecca , who is getting better as the show goes on , still not a great character .I look forward to more , after this episode , I 'm looking forward to watching it a bit more .more less .I loved it , this is classic B&S stuff we 're seeing here .So lets start with the spa gals : Nora , Kitty and Sarah .This was my favourite story of the episode , I loved how Nora somehow managed to invite herself along , that was hilarious .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Getting kicked out of the spa in true Walker style for talking too loud was also great , and brought some much needed comedy to a bit of a sad episode .Which brings me to Tommy and Lena .Oh holy God in heaven .First Joe and Sarah , now this ? :D .Justin .Oh Justin , Justin , Justin .He 's gone back to his old ways , how disappointed I am .At the same time I also think it 's a clever storyline , and very realistic .People come back from wars , they develop addictions for their injuries as Justin did , so it 's great to see some of this awareness stuff happening on the show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
