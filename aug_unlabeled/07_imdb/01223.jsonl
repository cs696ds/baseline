{"text": "Dan Brown 's The Da Vinci Code ( 2003 ) caused controversy in the Western world , with the Catholic Church calling the contents of the book \" shameful and unfounded lies \" ( \" Church Fights Da Vinci Novel \" ) .in Pereli ) .In fact , in the Arab and Muslim worlds , the very issue of religion is considered taboo .The Da Vinci Code , like many other foreign as well as locally produced films , represents the constant clash between art and culture characterising Arab societies that are profoundly influenced by cultural and religious traditions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like domestic films , imported films are also subject to censorship and are often cut and modified to fit with what is deemed to be culturally , morally and religiously appropriate .With the advent of globalisation , and with the mass influx of film production coming from all over the world , censorship in the Arab region has become a tool to balance cultural relativism .Acting as a cultural mirror , film has always been closely connected with societies ' cultural identity - representing , reflecting , criticising and even stirring them towards change ( Hegab 5 - 7 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It has , moreover , promoted conservatism and pushed society to live in denial and dismiss the existence of societal problems as those represented in Dunia or Cairo Exit and even oppose their portrayal .This essay aims to analyse the role of censorship in the context of the relationship between Arab cinema and culture - a relationship often overlooked and perhaps intentionally ignored - and will focus on the case of Egypt .The Egyptian film industry being the biggest in the Arab world in terms of volume of production and popularity , it was once labelled as the \" Hollywood of the Arab world \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Arab Cinema and Cultural Identity : The Struggle to Represent the National Culture .Film relies on precise social , political and cultural contexts to reflect and mirror contemporary moral values , norms and attitudes while dramatising existing societal problems .The relationship between film and culture is portrayed rather vividly in traditional societies of the Arab world that aim to safeguard themselves from the inflow or emergence of cultural norms and values that are either deemed inappropriate or defy shared norms .Little attention has been paid in literature , however , to the subject of cultural identity and Arab cinema .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As a medium initially invented in the West , the art of filmmaking has been constantly evolving with the development of the Western world , especially in terms of the technical and artistic advancement of the medium ( 4 ) .Under colonisation , countries of the Arab world were represented as exotic lands by foreign filmmakers , who misrepresented the domestic cultures by portraying stereotypical perceptions of the Orient .The representation of the Other was nothing but mere surface depiction .According to Guy Hennebelle : .Cinematic production in the Arab world ... has been held back by the traumatic effects of colonialism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They became convinced that only an imitation of the culture of the colonizers would overcome national decline and backwardness .The result was a shallow and imitative cultural production .At the end of the nineteenth century , with the invention of the cinema in the West , almost all Arab countries were either under direct Western ( mainly British , French and Italian ) occupation or under a mandate system .Colonisation , nonetheless , helped in transferring the new invention to the Arab world , and especially to Egypt .As in much of Egypt 's history , its geographical location between the East and West gave it political importance within the region , thus making it into a meeting point and melting pot , and a gateway for all the latest inventions coming from Europe , including film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Colonisation , however , also prevented the rest of the Arab nations from representing themselves or reflecting the Arab social reality and culture by means of cinema until the mid - twentieth century , when Arab countries gained their independence ( Shafik 18 ) .In fact , even though the art of filmmaking reached Egypt as early as 1896 , only a few months after the first film was screened in Europe , it took Egypt another thirty years to see its culture reflected on the screen ( 10 ) .It was even said that , when Egyptians started to take control of their film industry and produce films that represented Egyptian culture , Egyptian films were censored and even banned throughout the African French colonies ( Shafik 15 - 6 ; Georg 33 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This hindered the development of Arab cinema and prevented its depiction of social and political events and changes .This was a trend that started in the first two decades of the twentieth century and continued until the Nasser regime ( Samak 1 ) .Quassai Samak contends : .This new artistic form was to become one of the means by which the bourgeoisie expressed its ambitions and aspirations .Cinema also became a major economic investment of the bourgeoisie and an important tool to perpetuate its control and cultural domination over the people in general and the urban population in particular .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With the 1952 Egyptian Revolution , the dominant ideology was an anti - colonialist one .Gamal Abdel - Nasser 's regime marked a turn away from Western domination and a resurgence of a nationalist Arab culture .Though the revolution did not produce a complete transformation , it came to energise cultural life with cinema becoming the main tool to promote the new nationalist spirit and an important part of the initial stages of nation building .Under Nasser , cinema transformed itself to reach all strata of society - especially the lowest social classes , peasants and farmers - and to reflect the national culture more faithfully .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "[ 3 ] Yet , as Egyptian cinema faced a severe financial crisis in the late 1990s , it was left with no other choice but to renovate and reinvent itself .Such films soon pushed the general preference towards the mass production of profit - oriented comedies that slowly lost touch with the existing socio - political context .With The Yacoubian Building in 2006 , Egyptian cinema started again to see a trend aimed at providing direct social critique of existing realities in the society while defying taboos .The Yacoubian Building had all the ingredients for success : a huge budget , a strong international marketing campaign and an international best - selling novel of the same title by Alaa Al - Aswany on which it was based .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact , as argued by Kholeif , the film seemed to aspire \" to its Franco - European influence , and in a sense elevates itself from culturally specific Egyptian popularism \" ( Kholeif 4 ) .This could be seen in the film 's highlighting of the European architecture and fashion of the early twentieth century in Egypt and the European traditions and customs adopted at that time by Egyptian society - especially by the bourgeoisie .Moreover , songs by French singer Edith Piaf could be heard throughout the film , with the character of Franco - Egyptian lounge singer Christine singing renditions of \" La Vie en Rose \" as well as other Western songs ( 11 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Arab cinemas are both the product and the expression of a long and unresolved struggle for the control of the image , for the power to define identity .( Miriam Rosen qtd . in Salem 1 ) .The above quote by film critic Miriam Rosen reflects the current reality governing the relationship between Arab cinema and cultural identity .According to a 1976 Egyptian law on censorship : . \"Heavenly \" religions [ i.e. Islam , Christianity , and Judaism ] should not be criticized .Heresy and magic should not be positively portrayed .Immoral actions and vices are not to be justified and must be punished .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also prohibited is the use of obscene and indecent speech .The sanctity of marriage , family values , and one 's parents must be respected .Beside the prohibition on the excessive use of horror and violence , or inciting their imitation , it is forbidden to represent social problems as hopeless , to upset the mind , or to divide religions , classes , and national unity .( qtd . in Shafik 34 ) [ 4 ] .In addition to the fact that the above - stated prohibitions prevent the accurate portrayal of real - life events and oblige filmmakers to observe regulations that are left open to interpretation , in a country like Egypt censorship is moreover always left to the discretion of censors ( Goerg 29 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In reflecting and depicting culture , however , cinema and art in general often clash with the taboos set by censorship bodies - whether they are taboos that relate to moral or religious values or even political taboos .Yet , there always are exceptions and it is often unknown why exceptions are made .In fact , while The Yacoubian Building contained explicit references to sexuality and homosexuality , police torture , government corruption and terrorism , it was passed by the censors without any cuts .Despite the campaign , the film was left uncut thereby violating all existing religious and cultural taboos and achieving groundbreaking box - office returns locally and international recognition and praise in the West ( \" Taboo - smashing film breaks Egypt records \" ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Cairo Exit deals with the issue of interfaith and premarital relationships while portraying the brute reality of living in poverty in the poorer suburbs of Cairo , thus bringing to life cultural realities that are rarely touched upon or even acknowledged .The main characters in the film are torn between existing cultural and religious taboos and a life in poverty - all motivated by the same goal : escaping those realities and exiting Cairo .Centring on the poor suburb of Dar El - Salam , an area in the outskirts of Cairo whose inhabitants are mostly lower and working class , the film portrays the relationship between an 18-year - old Coptic girl , Amal Iskander , and her Muslim boyfriend Tarek .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Interfaith relationships are considered to be an ultra - sensitive , taboo issue and are usually not passed by the Egyptian censors despite their existence in society .This is reflective not only of the fact that censorship regards the issue of religion as taboo , but also that the general public regards any mention or ( mis)representation of religion as being an untouchable topic .I Love Cinema ( Osama & Hany Girgis Fawzy , 2004 , Al - Sobky Video Film ) .Moreover , the bureaucratic procedure imposed by censorship bodies in Egypt requires a strict process of red tape and paperwork that is sometimes made even more complicated by corruption , which has also created bureaucratic and legal loopholes that have resulted in the banning of films ( Madkour ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These fees are decided on a case - by - case basis and are left to the discretion of the Censorship Bureau .The filmmakers of Dunia , journalists and critics alike believe that the real reason why itwas banned was its taboo topic ( El - Sherbini ; Purtill ) .Dunia deals with the issue of forced genital mutilation / circumcision ( FGM / C ) in Egypt and its effects on the life of the lead character , Dunia .Though FGM / C is originally an African tradition and Islamic clerics have affirmed it to be so , it is widely practiced in Egypt - especially among the lower and poor classes - as well as across the Arab region .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The relationship between cinema and culture is shaped by the decision of the censorship bodies as to what is culturally acceptable to the public , and which existing social and cultural norms can be shown and which can not for fear of spreading obscenity or debauchery .While cinema endeavours to mirror and bring to life our evolving cultural and social contexts , censorship , on the other hand , represents the patriarchal guard that hinders its true reflection .This is especially true when laws are vague and open to interpretation and censors are given full discretion to cut or ban films according to their own cultural interpretation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Arab cinema has for too long delighted in dealing with subjects having no connection to reality or dealing with it in a superficial manner .Based on stereotypes , this approach has created detestable habits among the Arab viewers for whom the cinema has become a kind of opium .It has led the public away from the real problems , dimming its lucidity and conscience .At times throughout the history of Arab cinema , of course , there have been serious attempts to express the reality of our world and its problematic , but they have been rapidly smothered by the supporters of reaction who fought ferociously against any emergence of a new cinema .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The last decade , as already mentioned , has witnessed a rise in commercial comedies welcomed by audiences both in Egypt and across the region .The public has been enthusiastically receiving light - hearted comedies , usually dealing with such themes as clich\u00e9d love triangles , claiming that such films help them forget their daily problems and give them relief .This market demand has created a major change in the genre of the majority of films produced in Egypt .Overwhelmed by poverty and a feeling of helplessness , the general public has resorted to cinema for relief and to enable them to cope with their often grim reality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At the same time , the reaction of the public to films that offer a rather raw representation of reality and of the lives of the poorest in Egypt is often extreme , claiming that such portrayals defame Egypt 's image .The 2009 film , Shehata 's Store , has faced three Hesba cases during its production , demanding the Censorship Bureau to ban it from release and accusing director Khalid Youssef of defaming Egypt .[5 ] The reaction of the public also took its toll on Dunia ; many prominent Egyptian actresses in fact turned down the title role of Dunia for fear of public reaction and even condemnation and boycotting ( Al - Sherbini ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The question , however , is whether the long trend of censorship has directly contributed to this reaction from a public that for so long has been accustomed to receiving filtered art and a redefined culture .Foreign Films : Balancing Cultural Relativism .In fact , in Egyptian cinemas , the very mention of God would ordinarily ensure that the ensuing dialogue would be omitted from the film .When The Devil 's Advocate was first released , instead , the whole final dialogue was uncut while the Arabic subtitles were completely removed .Despite this tactical move , the film caused a stir in the local media and was soon banned .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite the fact that these films are produced abroad and are thus reflective of a more open cultural and socio - political context , many films never reach Arab audiences .Censors in Egypt usually demand viewing copies of films intended for distribution in order to consider their suitability for domestic release .It is then common for the censors to request the cutting of certain scenes or dialogue or , in extreme cases , to outright refuse release .Censorship discretion is apparent in such decisions , a discretion that is usually based on the subjective evaluation and understanding by censors of the general context of the film ( Mumt\u0101z ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This in turn often results in excessive cutting that in some cases leaves Egyptian audiences unable to understand what they missed out upon while blurring the aims of the film .By cutting scenes and dialogue , censors aim to modify the contents of the film to fit with the moral context of the receiving audience , despite the fact that the film stems from and is reflective of another value system and cultural context .Such patriarchal methods aimed at separating art and morality prevent audiences from being exposed to a culture other than their own and strip films of their cultural contexts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Da Vinci Code is just one example of a film that was met with a complete ban .Yet , the same rule was not applied when Mel Gibson 's The Passion of the Christ ( 2004 ) was released across the region , with James Caviezel playing the role of Christ .These examples show how subjective and changeable censorship decisions are , and how discretionary authority on what is allowed to be viewed by the general public and what is not is applied .Conclusion .This trend of filtering norms and values can be said to have contributed to affect the socio - cultural context of the region in a way that pushes the public towards conservatism , rather than freedom of expression and thought .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Across the region , moral codes for censorship differ not only from one country to the other , but also within the same country , based on the discretionary subjective evaluation of the censor .This dilemma has forced society to live in denial regarding the existence of societal problems and even oppose social critique or the depiction of the existing realities within society .It has , moreover , pushed for the increase of profit - oriented , commercial and escapist comedies that only aim to act as a visual anaesthetic from the harsh day - to - day life in this part of the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The question that thus remains to be answered is whether the current rise of political Islam , particularly in Egypt , will have even more restrictive consequences on freedom of expression and thought .Acknowledgement .The author wishes to thank Lubna El - Elaimy for her much appreciated comments .Notes .In his article \" The Movie Business in Egypt \" , Guy Brown confirms that the Egyptian film industry remains the biggest in the Arab world .And these films are most likely co - productions with Belgium , France or another European country .This does not really count as an industry \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
