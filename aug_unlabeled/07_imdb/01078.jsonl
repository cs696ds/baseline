{"text": "Case Number 02368 : Small Claims Court .SAY NOTHING .Artisan // 2001 // 94 Minutes // Rated R Reviewed by Judge Dan Mancini ( Retired )// November 8th , 2002 .The Charge .Being unfaithful can be deadly ... .The Case .Former model Grace Needham ( Nastassja Kinski ) is sexually frustrated and emotionally drained from sparring with her unemployed , heavy - drinking , lay - about husband Matt ( Hart Bochner ) , so she hops off to Miami Beach and has a one - night stand with Julian Banks ( William Baldwin ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Trouble 's brewing , though , as Grace soon learns her one - time fling is the CEO of the company that hired hubby , and that it may be no accident Matt 's job woes ended just about the time she was bumpin ' Baldwin .Yep , you guessed it , old Julian is a megalomaniacal psychopath who will stop at nothing to possess Grace .I 'll leave the mayhem that follows to your imagination .If I told you Say Nothing premiered on Skinemax ... excuse me , Cinemax ... would that give you an idea about the caliber of film we 're dealing with here ? ; characters who fit one of two physical types : good - looking and more good - looking ; a tense and suspenseful score performed by the composer on some cheesy Casio synthesizer ; and the all - important brief music video - type moments in which dramatic and/or sexy stuff happens in slow motion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There just is n't enough nudity in this flick .I found it odd writing that sentence as I 'm not fond of gratuitous content in movies , but is n't that the point in this case ?I always thought the erotic thriller existed to meet the need of the guy who wants to watch soft - core porn while convincing himself he 's watching something Hitchcockesque .Maybe I 'm wrong .Anyway , there is a Grace Needham shower scene in this stinker , but it 's so obvious a body double has taken Kinski 's place it brings to mind the diner fight in I 'm Gon na Git You Sucka .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , let 's talk DVD .Say Nothing was pretty obviously shot on video and the transfer is fairly strong considering .Colors are vibrant , blacks are deep , and there 's little noticeable video artifacts .True , it 's not as sumptuous as would be if it were shot on film , but considering the source , it ai n't bad .The 5.1 surround track might as well be 2.0 stereo .Use of surrounds is almost non - existent , but the front soundstage is perfectly rendered , clear , and fairly dynamic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , let 's try to end this thing on a high note .As bad as this movie is , it could 've been far worse .At least Say Nothing is n't a low - budget sequel to Cameron Crowe 's brilliant romantic comedy Say Anything , with Baldwin and Kinski stepping into the roles of Lloyd Dobler and Diane Court .Now that would be a crime against humanity .This court is in recess .Review content copyright \u00a9 2002 Dan Mancini ; Site layout and review format copyright \u00a9 1998 - 2016 HipClick Designs LLC .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
