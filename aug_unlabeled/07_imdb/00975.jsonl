{"text": "It 's possible the most interesting thing about Meltdown : Days of Destruction is the origins behind it .Upon its impending release on DVD , press releases have been saying the movie is based on a story John Carpenter wrote in the 1970 's .There 's also various sources listing a different project with director Ate De Jong ( Drop Dead Fred ) attached as well as Dolph Lundgren in the lead role .It 's quite a mix - up , and obviously one distributor MPI are using to their advantage , and it offers insight into the , often messy , world of filmmaking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It also does n't help that he 's chosen to fill his screenplay with many dull speeches lamenting on the disintegration of human nature ( and such rank dialogue as when Van Dien mutters , \" they lured them here and kill them for their ... stuff \" ) .On top of that there 's many dumb things the story does n't address .Van Dien is a bland hero at best and has a hard time showing much in the way of emotion , but the rest of the cast actually does fairly well with Pfetten and Terzo quite solid in their roles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's nothing special and it 's pretty silly ( the whole ' exploding car ' scene proves that tenfold ) but at least Meltdown manages to stay watchable .It probably could 've used more action and a lot less scenes of the characters wandering about and blabbering away , but for a low scale made - for - TV flick it 's bearable .( Chris Hartley , 2/16/07 ) .Directed By : J.P.
