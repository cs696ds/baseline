{"text": "The movie is , overall , very positive , and there are plenty of genuinely funny moments .The homages to classic monsters are fantastic , with pretty much every monster you could hope for included in the mix .Skeptics of Tim Burton 's recent work will be relieved to know that neither Jonny Depp nor Helena Bonham - Carter make a vocal appearance .The cast includes some big - name talent from Burton 's previous casts of characters , including Catherine O'Hara and Winona Ryder from Beetlejuice .The larger performances were given to fresher faces , and their performances were very solid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even without a voice actor , Sparky is a very good boy .The score is fantastic .Danny Elfman returns as one would expect for a Burton movie , but his music is somewhat subdued , enhancing the scenes without stealing the scene .The only questionable choice is a song about the town sung by Winona Ryder 's character .The lyrics are hilarious , but Ryder is not exactly a vocal artist .Still , the song works for what it is , and the rest of the music fits perfectly with the offbeat environment .The movie is absolutely gorgeous .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The characters have a charming sort of creepiness to them , oddly proportioned and standing out against a classic backdrop of fifties suburbia .They are true to Burton 's original art style , down to the etched - in pencil lines around their oversized eyes .I adore stop motion , and Frankenweenie is no exception .The animation is amazingly crisp and fluid , and the odd character design makes them defy gravity in every shot .A lot of work was done in post to remove visible rigging , but there 's no mistaking that handmade touch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Generally , I 'm not a big fan of seeing post - converted 3D , but Frankenweenie makes the jump very well .There are only a couple of gimmicky , in - your - face effects , and they 're pretty minor .The 3D adds depth to the sets and helps with immersion .If you have a few extra bucks to spend on seeing it in 3D , go for it , but you 're not missing much if you do n't .If you 're bringing the kids , be prepared for a long conversation afterward .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's not an easy topic for anyone , let alone a child , and they might be pretty confused .The movie tries to downplay the scientific aspect of Sparky 's revival by mentioning the mystical aspects of the town of New Holland , but I would n't be surprised if a very young child still thought plugging a dead hamster into a socket might work .Frankenweenie is well worth seeing in theaters , but make sure to bring the tissues with you .If Tim Burton can keep putting out work like this , there 's plenty to look forward to .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Let 's be real : Tim Burton has n't exactly been churning out hits lately .Between Alice in Wonderland and Dark Shadows , it 's hard to have a lot of faith in the man anymore .What seemed to be passion projects seem more and more ... .We all know somewhere in the back of our heads that stop motion animation takes an insane amount of work , but it is n't until you see behind the scenes things like the above video that you really begin to understand just how ... .He has a gift that allows him simply to speak to people who do n't see much in the way of conversation anymore .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's talking to the living that seems to be the real problem for Norman , or more accurately , it 's the living 's inability to listen .He is n't ashamed of his gift , and openly proclaims to be able to speak to the departed , because as far as he 's concerned , it 's not that strange .It 's something he 's always done , so why should he have to hide it ?Of course , we know why he 's expected to hide it .Because it 's weird , it 's different , and weird and different make people uncomfortable and afraid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But when the chips are down and an ancient witch 's curse begins to raise the dead from their graves , Norman is the only one capable of saving the town and everyone in it .As far as plot goes , ParaNorman does n't really blaze any new ground .A motley crew of children and teens most overcome their differences and come together to fight a malevolent force .You have all of your requisite adventure movie kids .And then there 's Norman ( Kodi Smit - McPhee ) , who , despite his circumstances , is really just an every - kid trying to do the right thing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They 're all well acted and full of personality , with the exception of Norman , who comes across as just a little too normal and boring for a kid who loves zombie movies and can see dead people .Perhaps in an attempt to make him as easy to relate to as possible the creators faltered and made someone a little to common .He 's still likable , and easy to sympathize with , I just wish he was a bit more weird for supposedly being such a strange kid .And just as the characters are a bit on the cliche side , so too are the story beats .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is n't something I think is a problem , especially for a family friendly children 's movie , but a few of the gags and jokes fell flat for me , and seemingly even for the children in the audience .Several moments had children laughing out loud , but there were just as many that were obviously meant to be funny that did n't receive any reaction at all .Humor is a fine line to toe , especially across generations , but some of the gags are just unwarranted , especially one at the end of the film involving Mitch and his sexual orientation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's one scene in particular that references Friday the 13th that really warmed my cockles , but just as many jokes fail as succeed .While the humor may falter , the movie does shine in it 's message .What could have been a simple kid 's movie turned out to be willing to go to some dark places .Suffice to say , the story is n't as simple as good overcoming evil , and Norman 's journey gives him insight into the persecution of another not unlike himself .It has to be said that as a stop motion animated film , ParaNorman looks absolutely amazing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anyone who has witnessed the amount of toil that goes into stop motion animation will appreciate the work that must have gone into the film that much more .I 'll admit I did not see the movie in 3D , as I 'm not a huge fan of the of the technology , but I would assume from my digital screening of the film that it would probably translate very well into a 3D feature .As a paranormal adventure , ParaNorman is fun and exciting in equal measure , with some surprisingly moving moments and a message that should truly be taken to heart .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "A playful score keeps the tone jolly , although leaving out the brilliant shanty from the trailer ( above ) , or replacing it with a different one , was a serious misstep .The voice cast work hard to keep up with the high calibre of those production values , with Hugh Grant 's Pirate Captain swinging between bloody - minded gusto and eye - rolling despair on a turn of a doubloon .It 's not far from Grant 's usual brand of buffoonish charm , but it 's clear the actor is having a ball , and his enthusiasm ( allied with the outstanding animation ) is passed on to the audience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Her bombast is only overshadowed by an unexpected but cheer - worthy cameo in the shape of a Pirate King , who steals the entire movie in two short scenes .Of the main cast , only Martin Freeman can feel short - changed , playing the usual sensible sidekick as from seemingly every one of his screen outings .David Tennant 's stuttery Darwin is a more effective straight man to the Pirate Captain 's excesses .Their characters are reasonably vivid for their short time on - screen , but barely appear outside a single scene in a pub .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As with many of Aardman 's big - screen productions ( Chicken Run ) , there 's too much going on , to the extent that it can seem feel like the story only exists to accommodate the extensive background details , rather than the other way around .What 's left is a series of visually gorgeous , often hilarious individual sketches , linked by a common thread ( pirates ) too thin to hold everything together in a satisfactory manner .It 's too loveable and accomplished to not be enjoyable , but tragically difficult to wholeheartedly adore .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
