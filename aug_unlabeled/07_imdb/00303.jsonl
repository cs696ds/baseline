{"text": "Issues Views Reviews .Hey Baby Movie Review .They say that Heyy Baby has been inspired by the Hollywood flick , Three Men and a Baby ...I do n't know whether that 's true as I have n't seen the Hollywood film .So , what 's the movie about ?Three men and a baby ?Yep , that 's right .Casanovas Arush ( played by Akshay Kumar ) , Ali ( Fardeen Khan ) and Tanmay ( Ritiesh Deshmukh ) are living it up in Sydney , Australia .They hold down cool jobs - Arush is a manager of a night club , Tanmay is an entertainer and Ali a guy who makes money from betting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Love and marriage are words they scorn .Everything changes when a little baby arrives on their door - step .Their world is torn apart as they desperately try to bring the situation ( and the baby ) under control .Being totally clueless about babies , their attempts lead to some hilarious scenes .If a question haunts them ( who is the father of the baby ? ? ) it soon recedes into the background as they get increasingly involved with the little girl .There are some rather touching scenes as these three rakes , used to breaking a girl 's heart in the wink of an eye , get all choked up over a baby .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If that 's a trifle difficult to believe , well , these things happen in movies !Actually , the movie is so funny and all the guys put up such a good comic act and have such good chemistry with each other , that it does n't matter how unbelievable it all seems .Director Sajid Khan carries the audience along with him .And the baby certainly helps .A cute little damsel with an expressive face .The guys were not as good in the serious scenes , except for Fardeen Khan .Akshay was not at all convincing in the emotional scenes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sure , there are some comic scenes in the second half too , but I did n't like them as much as those in the first half .Anyway , the second half has a lot of Bollywood melodrama , and is designed to extract a few tears .I can enjoy Bollywood melodrama ...but I felt that it was rather overdone here .Even the comedy in the second half was less natural and was at times rather gross !Specially the scene with the three guys in the shower together .There were parts in the second half that dragged as well ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Vidya Balan , enters the scene in the second half ... as Esha , the mother of the baby .I liked her in the film .She acts in a restrained way and comes across as a strong , determined sort who will not stand for any nonsense , not even from the man she loves .Her lack of histrionics is unusual in a bollywood film , but I liked her acting .Her eyes are expressive and her expressions say it all .The music ( Shankar Ehsaan Loy ) was average , but some of the songs like ' Ishq Mohabbat ' were well choreographed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Shah Rukh puts in a short appearance at the fag end of the movie .Half a song .That 's it .And I almost forgot to mention Boman Irani .He plays Esha 's father .He 's funny , and acts alright , but he 's getting boring in such roles .Overall , this movie is okay ' time - pass ' - certainly not a must - see .It 's one of those movies one can catch on a lazy Sunday if there is nothing else to do .If one thinks of the movie as fare dished out by a first - time director , one can even call it good .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Whether you like it or not finally depends on what you expect and on your mood that day !Rambodoc ,Yeah you were lucky to escape during the intermission !But I think when people copy ideas this is what happens .The basic idea was n't Sajid Khan 's ( which automatically makes him a second or third level director , for even accepting such an assignment ) .Then he must have tried to incorporate some original scenes which resulted in a hotch potch .Neither a comedy nor a true bollywood melodrama !Bharath , you echoed my feelings about the baby .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't know what they did to make the baby act so well ... maybe it was some gimmick .I heard they used a lot of those in the movie .JV maybe it went into spam , but I do n't know how !Unfortunately today I deleted my spam without checking it properly .Sorry about that .Actually I was disappointed with the movie too , but yes , I found the first half a bit of decent time - pass .Guess wanted to waste my sunday !You know , I have n't seen a lot of the Bollywood cinema , but I have noticed that you can often see the plot of a hollywood flick torn raw and bleeding and inserted in them , with a few dance sequences inserted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Is it an inherent lack of creativity in the industry ?Hey Justin , the truth is that a lot of bollywood cinema is copied , and I wish I could give a ball park figure like say 50 % or 70 % but no one really knows I think .But the rest of the movies are not copied and many of these movies are absolutely fantastic .So I do not think there is an inherent lack of creativity , but the fact that there are a lot of people who want to make a quick buck .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Such people bring a bad name to the industry and in fact the word bollywood says it all !It is really sad because great talent also co - exists with these re - makes .Many bollywood films btw are produced with black money , and often producers know little about cinema .They pick saleable stars , copy a script , and think they can make some money .Actually they do , because the majority of Indians do not see hollywood movies .Its really a sad situation !Prerna , thanks for the info !Now I know why the first half was better than the second half ! really , these guys should be ostracized by the industry !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "JV , I did that deliberately because from the poster I realised that the real spelling is different .And I did it because I felt that most people when searching would misspell it .I would have if I was searching for the review .In fact if I had not downloaded the picture of the poster , i would not have known the real spelling , even after seeing the movie ! btw , I think my idea has worked . ;) You can see its been the top post for 2 days now .:D .I feel this is one of the worst movies made this year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The newspaper and magazine articles published on this blog are written by me .However , they may not be a word for word representation of the articles published in print .They may be abridged versions , or simply updated .It opened in classic 4:3 black and white , a story unfolding about a magician , Oz ( James Franco ) , who has dreams of greatness .After a visit from the woman he loves detailing her pending marriage , the Wizard seems torn between the simple life he rejected and the show business life he 's barely living .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We all know how cheesy some classic movies can be , and apparently so does Raimi , who has every actor in the prologue overdoing it in the most perfect way .Oz is a bit of a scoundrel ; one who seems to have a weakness for beautiful women .He 's pulled the same absurd line about his grandma 's music box a few too many times , and it 's all about to blow up in his face .After a less - than - successful magic act , he finds himself being chased by the new man of a former love interest - who happens to be the strongman in the circus .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "From there on out things got pretty boring .Oz the Great and Powerful is , to say the least , not the movie I was hoping for and , as someone who is both a fan of the 1939 classic and Sam Raimi , I 'm doubly disappointed .There are moments where Sam Raimi 's direction and wit shine like the yellow brick road , but mostly I just felt uninterested in what I was seeing .Sure , everything on screen is colorful , and the special effects are often beautiful to look at ( especially during the film 's climax ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Somewhere between that first hot air balloon ride and the film 's decent final moments , I nodded off as I learned about witches , talking monkeys , china dolls , and a quest to free the land of Oz from an evil witch 's curse .Oz the Great and Powerful suffers from the same condition that so many prequels do , in that it seems obsessed with explaining things that do n't require an explanation .How did the Wicked Witch turn green ?Where did the Wizard get his cool projection image ?Seriously , what 's the deal with munchkins ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Prequel films that focus on having a stand - alone story have the most success , and those who seek to give a so - that's - how - it - happened explanation seem to bomb ; largely because they force themselves in the shadow of the original .And if we 're talking about one of the greatest , most historically significant , films of all time - yeah , you probably do n't want to force your way into its story too much , because you just ca n't compare .Much like the failed sequel Return to Oz ( 1985 ) , this Sam Raimi product feels like little more than a cheap knockoff , with modern special effects thrown in to wow the kiddies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At times what 's on screen feels like a serious prequel , or perhaps an ode to the classic ; yet there are other moments where this adventure feels like a parody .None of these approaches work on their own , and all of these takes work even less when combined together .This inability to find its legs leaves the performances of the talented cast to feel flat and uneven .It has to be difficult to play a character when there 's no consistent tone to work with .Yes , there are moments where Franco really steals the show , but typically even he feels bland and distant .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Add in a huge budget and modern computer effects , and all that wonderful charm that comes from costumed characters is gone .It 's hard to relate to CGI characters , just as it 's more difficult to make computer - generated backgrounds come to life , especially when it 's the painted scenery that gave the original its unique appeal .I think part of the problem may also be that this script is too busy throwing one event after another at the audience to be concerned with character development .There is the occasional bit of family - friendly comic relief tossed in for good measure , but there 's only so many times a monkey can say something sarcastic before even the kids will lose interest .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I ca n't emphasize this enough : I am a huge Sam Raimi fan , and I was absolutely stoked when I heard he was entering the Land of Oz .With the Evil Dead creator at the helm and Danny Elfman in charge of the soundtrack ( which is admittedly excellent ) , I expected something a little darker and a little more self - aware of the innate silliness of L. Frank Baum 's children 's stories .I 've read that Raimi was forced to edit the film in order to obtain a PG rating , but I 'm not sure that you can chalk up the uneven tone and dullness of Oz to studio influence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It may be worth a watch if you 're just looking for some forgettable family entertainment .But to me that just is n't good enough .A prequel to The Wizard of Oz should be nothing less than great , or it simply should n't exist at all .About Chad Michael Van Alstin .Chad is an award - winning libertarian opinion columnist .He 's done with that now .Having earned himself a B.A. in Mass Communication , Chad now spends most of his time as a wage laborer , killing the pain by consuming as many video games and movies as possible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
