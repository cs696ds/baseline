{"text": "Through her experiences at camp and with her black friends at home , Mina eventually develops her individual philosophy about differences among people , a philosophy that is the basis for a maturity of behavior shown in her relationships .She initiates a friendship with Dicey and invites the Tillermans to her father 's all - black church .She maintains a platonic friendship with Tamer Shipp , a visiting minister , even though she has fallen in love with him ; and she hides the love and becomes a sincere friend of his family .A last glimpse of Mina comes in Seventeen Against the Dealer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Mina has learned to trust her own instincts and abilities .Perhaps Voigt 's most appealing character is Dicey Tillerman .The reader can follow Dicey from the age of thirteen , when , in Homecoming , she and her younger siblings are abandoned , to the age of twenty - one , when they appear in Seventeen Against the Dealer .From the beginning of the story , Dicey exerts her independence in solving the dilemma of abandonment .She concerns herself with keeping her family alive and together .The family journeys on foot from Connecticut and eventually arrives at their grandmother 's home in Crisfield , Maryland .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She assumes responsibility for the family 's finances and for their physical health and safety .She maintains the family 's moral strength and mental attitude as well .Dicey recognizes the dangers that arise along the way and relies on her own instincts and abilities to overcome them .One such situation occurs at Cousin Eunice 's , a place where the children think they will find refuge but do not .As Dicey thinks about their situation , she realizes that the four are about to be separated if they do not leave .A second example of Dicey 's recognition of danger and skill in avoiding it takes place when the children get themselves into another perilous situation by stopping to earn money working for a farmer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In many ways , Dicey is a very independent person who follows her own thinking .She decides that college is not for her after attending for two years .And her relationships with her friends Jeff and Mina are almost always on Dicey 's terms .However , although she is independent , she rarely isolates herself from the needs of her family .Voigt shows Dicey 's emotional strength when she finds out that her mother is in a mental hospital and later when she sits by her dying mother 's bed .She believes in her sister Maybeth and stands by her when Maybeth 's teachers claim that she can not learn .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dicey is unique .She is certainly not a stereotypical adolescent girl .The female protagonists brought to life by Lynn Hall , Bill and Vera Cleaver , and Cynthia Voigt provide appropriate role models for adolescent readers .The successful maturation of the characters in the novels mentioned presents excellent examples of independent , self - reliant young females .Such characters display traits that are desirable in human relationships and necessary in order for individuals to attain a sense of fulfillment and self - worth .Because there is no definitive plan for helping young people learn how to solve problems , develop inner strengths , and successfully make the transition from childhood to adulthood , the benefits of reading about characters who have done so become even more compelling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Volver .What does it mean to have a dead mother come back to life and nurture her daughters and granddaughter again ?Well that is in the meaning of the film 's title , Volver , which means to recapture again , in this case , the love that went missing years before .The movie starts out with the Pen\u00e9lope Cruz character , Raimunda , as well as scores of other women , cleaning graves .It should be known that death is a very important part of people 's lives in La Mancha , Spain , where Alm\u00f3dovar is from .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When Cruz 's dead mother enters the picture , we learn this soon enough .Family is also a very important part of life , at least for Raimunda and her folk , which includes a daughter , sister , aunt , and eventually mother .Not only do men not exist for these women , but they simply are n't important enough for them .We soon learn this when Raimunda 's husband Paco ( Antonio de la Torre ) tries some hanky panky with her , and she has none of it .The movie is colorfully filmed , but that 's not what makes it stand out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's not to say I did n't enjoy the mother character , Irene ( Carmen Maura ) , which I did .In fact there 's one terrific scene where Raimunda , who 's unaware that her mother is in her sister 's house , smells Irene 's farts , and Irene can barely control her laughter .When Raimunda and Irene finally do meet , it makes you wish that the afterlife really did exist so that you can make amends with the person you lost too soon .Connect with us .Our Comment Policy .Critiques of Elevate Difference and the content of any review on this site are welcome ; however , we will not tolerate flaming , attacks , or any form of abuse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
