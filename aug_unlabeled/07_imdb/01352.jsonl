{"text": "Mr. Bean is admirable because it translates to other countries so effortlessly - it is genuinely international humour .Watched a documentary on it a while back which pointed out the strong similarities with Monsieur Hulot , who also represents international comedy .Blackadder ( like Fawlty Towers ) is a sophisticated farce , and does n't translate so well .Incidentally , Wikipedia reveals what 's being sung in Latin in the Mr. Bean episodes : .Mr. Bean makes me so uncomfortable .I 'm the kind of person who ca n't stand watching someone embarrass themselves ( it makes me feel embarrassed , and watching Mr. Bean is just about the worst of the worst in that regard .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In spite of being a huge Blackadder fan ( and I think the last episode of Blackadder Goes Forth may very well be the high - water mark of television comedy ) , I have to confess I 've never really gotten Mr. Bean .I do n't hate it , and I do n't go about ridiculing people who do like it -- I just do n't get it .It just seems to have more in common with a Roadrunner cartoon than with Harold Lloyd or the Jacques Tati .And Roadrunner cartoons , funny as they are , would be much less so if they did n't come in five - minute bursts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
