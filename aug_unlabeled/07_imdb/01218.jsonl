{"text": "Masterwordsmith@Writers .Inc .Sunday , September 29 , 2013 .In 1983 , I was traveling with a tiny theater company doing vaudeville - type shows in community centers and bars - anywhere we could earn $ 25 each plus enough gas money to get to the next small town in our ramshackle yellow bus .As we passed through Bozeman , Montana , in early February , a heavy snow slowed us down .The radio crackled warnings about black ice and poor visibility , so we opted to impose on friends who were doing a production of Fiddler on the Roof at Montana State University .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Saturday , August 31 , 2013 .They 'd just finished lunch at a caf\u00e9 in Orange County - Chuck Rees , his wife , Laurie , and her mother , Ann Marie Effert .Then Rees , 51 , spotted smoke rising from a hill a few blocks away .\" Let 's get up there ! \" he cried .Keeping the dark plumes in sight , the trio drove through winding , unfamiliar streets and eventually came upon a white two - story house with black smoke billowing from the back .Rees pulled his car alongside a couple standing on the curb in front of the house . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" I knocked , but nobody answered , \" the man said .\" We 've called 911 .\" Rees threw his car into park .\" Chuck , do n't , \" Laurie said , although she knew he would n't listen .He 'd once dropped the receiver of a pay phone in the middle of a conversation with her to chase a purse snatcher .He pointed to the flames coursing up the back of the house .The woman looked at him , frightened . \"Laurie , I 've got to , \" he said , and jumped out of the car .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A locked gate blocked his way into the backyard .He considered climbing over it , but a large Labrador retriever mix appeared on the other side and bared its teeth at him .That means somebody lives here , Rees thought .He sprinted to the front door and tried the handle ; it was locked .He pounded on the door ; no one answered .Then he moved along the left side of the house , past what looked like a small addition .He grabbed onto a chain - link fence and pulled it back far enough for him to squeeze through .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As he scanned the back of the house for a hose , Rees noticed a small steel door in the addition .He banged on it with his fist .\" Is anybody in there ? \" he shouted . \"Your house is on fire ! \"No one answered .He banged on the door again .Soon he heard a woman 's faint voice from the other side of the door .\"Hello ? \" she said .Sunday , April 7 , 2013 .There 's a good movie playing down - town .How about let 's taking in a movie tonight ? \" asked my wife .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" I told her .I really did not like going to the movie theater .It was located right on the edge of a very seedy part of town .When we arrived we parked the car and started the block or so walk to the Florida Theater .Can you spare a dollar ? \" or \" Can you spare some change \" asked almost every person that we passed .Most people coming to this part of town to the movies had already learned that it was best not to speak and to just keep on walking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Next to him was a large duffle bag .He was very unclean and unshaven .Around his eyes were very dark circles .It appeared as though he had not washed his face for quiet a long time .His clothes were old and worn and there was very little doubt that they were in need of a good washing .As we passed him by he said not a word .My wife proceeded up to the ticket booth to purchased the tickets .Going to see the movie ? \" asked the man .Yea , my wife wants to see it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I do remember it being one of those women type movies .You know , the kind that make women cry .Every now and then I would see a tear rolling down Willy 's cheek , Each time a tear appeared he would turn his head to the side and wipe the tears away with his fingers .After the movie was over the three of us left the theater and headed back toward our car .All Willy could talk about the entire time was the movie .My wife and he were talking about the movie as if they were old friends .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "You take it easy , Dude \" I told Willy , as I shook his hand and we parted ways .Judy and I got in the car and we headed home .All weekend long I thought about Willy and why he had taken to the streets .I wondered if it might have been his experience in Vietnam that had something to do with him not caring about himself any more .Monday morning I drove back downtown to see if I might find Willy .I did not see him anywhere on the streets .I drove to the mission on Market Street to see if anyone knew of him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
