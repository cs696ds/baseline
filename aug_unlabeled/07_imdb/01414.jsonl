{"text": "Eclipse : To IMAX or Not To IMAX That is the Question .With apologies to The Bard , is Eclipse in IMAX the way to go ?One reviewer from ABC gives the IMAX experience a thumbs down talking about how it magnifies flaws not seen on the smaller screen , and in that regard , ruins a bit of what could be called \" movie magic \" making it harder to suspend disbelief .\" I could n't help but notice that IMAX is very unforgiving .So much of \" Eclipse \" is close - up shots , meaning that Kristen Stewart , Robert Pattinson , Taylor Lautner and the rest of the cast had their faces magnified to the point where they were two stories tall .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kristen 's hair was so obviously a wig and it was driving me nuts .Really , would it be so hard to give that thing a part ?Then it would n't be so glaring .Ditto for Ashley Greene - can't they use her real , gorgeous hair rather than that hacked - up wig ?Homegirl looks like she cuts her hair herself with pinking shears .Speaking of the Cullen clan , Edward and crew did n't look pale ; they looked like they had pan makeup congregating in the corners of their mouths .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I saw it in IMAX and while I loved the movie , there was so much I missed .You ca n't look everywhere at once and the movie just moves too fast for good IMAX viewing .I also agree with what they said about the close ups ... it 's unforgiving .The one thing I did love was the sound !IMAX domes have awsome sound systems and that was a huge plus for the atmosphere of this movie .I would love to see the movie again in a regular theater .I saw Eclipse 4 times regular and then today in IMAX .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
