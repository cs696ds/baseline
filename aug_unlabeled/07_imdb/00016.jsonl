{"text": "Review : I saw this movie last night after not watching it for a few years , and while it is very dated and the effects look quite bad in some spots ; it 's still a highly enjoyable film that is constantly entertaining .I 'll start with the good points , the acting is top notch , none of them are miscast and they all play their parts really well .The action is also great and some of the sequences are impressive to watch and extremely thrilling to see .Spider - Man 's costume also looks good but I ca n't say the same for Green Goblin , who looks very silly and more like a robot than anything else .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like I said the effects have dated quite a bit , and while that does n't diminish my viewing of the movie , it is quite distracting in some parts .Also the origin story takes far too long to get going , I like an origin story as much as the next comic book fan but it does n't need to take over an hour .But to sum up , a film not without it 's flaws , but still good to watch .Conclusion : The film was a massive box office success and was one of the highest grossing films of all time at the point of release , and both fans and critics strongly enjoyed the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Spider - Man is a sunlit hero and the makers of this film get that .It 's big , bold , colourful and romantic .Our entry into the film is endearing and enjoyable because it focuses on the character of Peter Parker .It 's prepared to develop slowly and does n't feel the need to blast us with action from the start as so many mainstream blockbuster films do .The second half of the film introduces the villain and inevitably piles on the action .It 's fun but not so effective as the first half I think .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The final rubble strewn battle between Spider - Man and the Goblin is certainly well staged though and a bit more violent than one would expect from a film of this type .The most inspired casting in the film is JK Simmons as a very funny fast talking incarnation of grumpy Daily Bugle editor J Jonah Jameson and Rosemary Harris always feels like a perfect Aunt May too .I like the romantic elements for the most part but I did think the famous kiss in the rain lashed alley between MJ and an upside down Spider - Man was rather corny and a bit too much .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Franco is not Sir Ben Kingsley when it comes to thesping .Raimi 's direction is solid and occasionally exciting ( although how much credit he takes for the digital effects sequences I have no idea ) but he does sometimes seem slightly reigned in by having to produce such family friendly fare .This is a film that wears its heart on its sleeve .It wants to be fun , family friendly , romantic , funny , bursting with colour , and big ( even slightly campy ) , like a comic that has come to life , and by and large it succeeds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Now with two super beings on the loose , one being evil , it 's surely up to Peter AKA Spiderman to be the one true hero and save the day .He 's got the physique , he 's got the strength and he 's got the ambition .Can good beat evil in this long crying battle over the City ?We can only hope .Spiderman , based on Marvel Comics , is a very enjoyable film .While not being exactly realistic , the boy meets girl , good meets evil factors show strong relationships throughout .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The life of Spiderman is undercover , mysterious and life saving , whereas the life of Peter Parker is completely contrasting .The story of Peter himself shows the reality of growing up as a shy guy in school .It shows the realism of taunting , bullying and even not being able to get that girl you 've always liked .The story of Mary Jane also shows the life some youngsters go through , with a disturbing and unwanted home life making people just a little more depressed .When I first heard Tobey Maguire to be the leading role I was surprised .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He plays the character of Peter Parker perfectly , while showing the ambition in his life playing the part of Spiderman .The special effects in the film are fantastic .While unrealistic , many of completely believable and even make you wonder what if this situation occurred in real life .Not a penny has been spared for the production of this film .It 's definitely a film to watch .Maybe not so one to watch time and time again , but on the odd occasion , a very enjoyable and heartwarming couple of hours .Comments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Spiderman really is a brillaint Action and Adventure and I really did enjoy watching it .It is full of entertainment and special effects throughout that will keep you on the edge of you seat !It was originally released in 2002 and it had been nominated for 2 Oscars which speaks for itself really .The film stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst who are just exceptional in this movie amongst many other very good performances .I really did think that the cinematic experiences is one of the best I have had in that the picture and graphics are exceptional .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie is about Peter Parker relises that from a school trip that he was on , has accidently been modified into a spider .After the trip he notices that he now has incredible special powers rather like a superhero and now a great deal of responsibility will fall on his shoulders .It is up to Spiderman to help protect the citizens of the city and get rid of the evil alltogether .The Green Goblin wants him to be killed and so the adventure continues .There is also a romance in the film between Peter Parker and girlfriend Jane Watson .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I really felt that this was a fantastic film for any spiderman fan and not to mention the music which was very good also .You can now attain this DVD for slightly less than \u00a3 4 from Amazon which really is very good value for money and I would really recommend it for its first class home entertainment value .I hope this was useful and thank you very much for reading .Comments .Rent it , Watch it , Love it , Buy it !In the summer of 2001 , while waiting for the main feature to start in a dingy cinema somewhere , I was treated to perhaps the most electrifying movie trailer that I have ever seen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The camera follows their daring flight through the manmade canyons of Manhattan until they end up snared in a massive web strung between the twin towers of the World Trade Centre .That one trailer sparked my imagination to such a degree that I can not even recall the name of the film I saw that day .Subsequent events rendered that trailer in bad taste , and I doubt the trailer even exists today .It 's certainly not on the Spider - Man DVD , though it may be the only thing that is n't .Peter Parker is your average introverted orphan kid with a crush on the girl next door .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Peter initially uses his powers for personal gain , but tragedy makes him realise the responsibility of his powers .After graduating from school he heads for the Big Apple to pursue his future , unaware that an explosive confrontation with the Green Goblin awaits that will define his character .Spider - Man comes with a 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer , which is acceptable .The picture is a tad grainy , a little soft and the contrast seems lacking .There were even one or two blips of print damage , which was surprising for such a recent film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The effects are also very well accomplished and Spider - Man is brought to life with verve and panache .The CGI is impressive throughout and the movie comes together as a seamless whole .That said there were one or two moments where CG Spidey seemed a little ' light ' and insubstantial , but this still proves a wonderful demonstration of what technology is capable of .A DD 5.1 English track is provided on this disc and it is a well - accomplished and impressive mix that immerses you in the film .The surrounds are put to notable use in the action sequences and suit this film well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The 2-disc set is a boon for movie fans and comic book fans alike and is almost overflowing with extras and goodies .The booklet , as well as containing much advertising has a couple of pages of production notes , and the discs have some brilliantly designed menus .On Disc 1 , as well as the film , it contains two commentaries , both in DD 2.0 Surround .The Filmmakers and Cast commentary is provided by Sam Raimi , Grant Curtis , Laura Ziskin and Kirsten Dunst , while the Visual Effects Designer and Crew commentary is provided by John Dykstra .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you enable the SpiderSense webisodes from the main menu , A little Spidey head will pop up from time to time in the film and allow you to access little featurettes pertinent to that particular scene .There are interviews with the Spider Wrangler , the wrestler Randy Savage aka BoneSaw , the model maker and more .I would have preferred to be able to watch the featurettes separately though .Weaving the Web is a trivia subtitle track that pops up comic book style captions through the movie with little titbits of info , although a couple flash by too quickly to read .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Entertainment Special is a 40 minute look at the whole Spider - Man phenomenon associated with the film and again contains interviews with the cast and crew but is plagued with an annoying voiceover and a tendency to frivolity .There is a Director Profile , 7 minutes , which looks at Sam Raimi but comes across as little more than an appreciation society .More interesting is the Composer Profile lasting a similar length of time that looks at Danny Elfman .He gives an insight into how he works which makes this a better piece .Finally there are some screen tests and some gag reel footage that lasts about 10 minutes in total .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Stylistically and in terms of narrative , films have to go the extra mile to impress , and Spider - Man does n't quite make it .It is perfect summer movie material , giving great visuals for you to chew your popcorn by , but there is a little something lacking that stops it being great movie and settles for being a good one instead .However Spider - Man is notable for reversing one particular trend , that of comic book movies having to be dark and moody to be interesting .Spider - Man manages to be light , bright and engaging , yet remains true to the characters and story without lapsing into shadowy brooding stereotypes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He nails the introverted teenager perfectly and gives him a sensitivity and humanity that really gives the audience something to relate to .Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin is excellent , and he takes what could easily have been a laughable role and makes it sinister and disturbing .But for me the star of the movie has to be J K Simmons whose character of J Jonah Jameson , the editor in chief of the Daily Bugle is inspired .The hard - bitten newsman is a joy to watch and is utterly entertaining .Unfortunately that is where the notable performances end .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Similarly , James Franco is hardly noticeable as Harry Osborn .The film remains balanced on a precipice for much of the 2 hours , poised between laughably camp and seriousness , but while there are laughs and thrills , it never strays from that fine line and Sam Raimi carries it all off with aplomb .Spider - Man is n't a great film , but it is a good one , and will be at home in any film collection .The picture quality is n't the best in the world , but the discs are overflowing with extras to sate the appetite of any comic fan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thoroughly recommended .Comments .Comic book super hero time .Spider Man is the first of the three movies so far made to star Tobey Maguire in the dual role of the super hero and Peter Parker his normal persona and it is also the best of the three by far .The action scenes in this film are excellent and I love the special effects using the New York skyline as a back drop .When you think about it then it is just as well Spiderman lived in New York as he would be stuffed if he lived in an English town as he would get splatted trying to swing from our low buildings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Comments .Product Details .Marvel Comics fans have been waiting for this big - screen Spider - Man since the character made his print debut in 1962 , which attaches impossible expectations to a film that rates as a solid success without breaking out of the spandex ghetto in the way that Batman Returns or X - Men did .Tobey Maguire is ideally cast as speccy Peter Parker , a high school swot with personal problems .The villain of the peace is Peter 's best friend 's industrialist father ( Willem Dafoe ) who has dosed himself on an experimental serum which makes him go all Jekyll - and - Hyde and emerge as the cackling Green Goblin , who soon gets a grudge against Spider - Man .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
