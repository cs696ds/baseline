{"text": "When reading about their lives , I find myself drifting to a similar tale from Greek Mythology , that of Medea and Jason .Separated by history and mythology , the lives of Anne and Medea have surprising parallels .Both women in worlds run by men , educated , and highly intelligent .Their courage and duality inspired change and elevated the men they loved to new levels .These women have controversial identities that historians debate even today .The world sees them as both heroes and villains because of their dual natures .We learn from them how to accept that responsibility and the consequences for the power we use .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Returning to Iolcus proved treacherous as well , passing Sirens and the bronze man Talos and only surviving again with the cleverness of Medea .Upon arrival in Iolcus , Jason discovered that King Pelias had no intentions of giving back the throne .In an attempt to help Jason again , Medea tricked the daughters of Pelias into killing the King by demonstrating a spell that turned a sheep into a lamb thus restoring its youth .Unfortunately for Pelias , Medea failed to complete the spell thus sealing his fate .For this trickery and the murder of the king , Pelias ' son Acastus exiled Jason and Medea to Corinth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In Corinth , they quickly settled down and began raising two sons .Soon Jason 's reputation as a hero and slayer of monsters reached the ears of King Creon who proposed Jason marry his daughter , Princess Creusa , thereby becoming heir to his throne .How could Jason refuse ?Medea confronted Jason about his engagement , reminding him of the sacrifices she made for him and their new family .Jason ignored her , accrediting his success in capturing the Golden Fleece to the goddess Aphrodite and not Medea .He rejected their marriage in favor of a royal one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "These views created an image of male superiority and female inferiority that would last for centuries .Greek sophist Gorgias defined the virtues of proper women .\" If you want a definition of female virtue , it is not difficult to provide ; it is that she must run the household well , preserve what contains and what belongs to her husband . \" 1 Her honor and reputation depended upon chastity and virtue .Society knew her only for these qualities and not as a source of gossip .Considered the property of her husband , her purpose in life was to conceive and bare heirs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These virtues hold true to 16th century Tudor England .At court , her reputation could make or break her family .\" The wealth , power and prestige which success at court could bring attracted countless young men and women to attempt their fortunes here .But the price was their integrity , their morality , their health , their spiritual safety and their self - respect . \" 2 It was a dog eat dog world where wealth and honor were made and taken away within a week as the whims of the king waxed and waned .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Married to suitors for her dowry and family connections , she was little more than a cow to be traded for , desired only for her milk and the calves she would bear .Indeed , the virtues of a male courtier dictated that \" if a female relative is attractive , then sell her for a good price to ' thy better . \" 3 And sell her he did .Her purpose and function was to aid the advancement of the family through marriage .Once married her duty was to conceive and bare heirs to continue the male line of her husband .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The question of the legitmacy of the marriages of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn and that of Jason and Medea eventually came into play .Both married by choice rather than an arranged marriage , almost unheard of during these times .This raised questions about the legitimacy and acceptance of their marriages .According to Athenian standards , the marriage of Jason and Medea lacked 1 . ) an agreement between the families , 2 . ) a procession from the former home of the bride to that of her husband , 3 . ) celebration of the family .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Similarly , the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn was not supported but on a much larger scale .The separation from Rome made it difficult to continue foreign relations .Rome finally decreed the marriage to Katherine of Aragon to be legitimate and excommunicated Henry for his refusal to return to that marriage .The large population of the English people did not back Henry 's marriage to Anne .People did not look up to Anne believing that she manipulated and bewitched the King .The importance of bearing sons is another common feature for the time periods of Medea and Anne . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "BETRAYAL .In a time where physical documentation was scarce , verbal oaths were the strongest kinds of agreements .Making an oath with another person was associated with religion due to the gods that one swore to .In fact , the king of the gods , mighty Zeus or Jove , is the patron of oaths .This involvement of the gods made the breaking of oaths a serious offense with serious consequences .\" Jason 's oath to Medea places him under a powerful moral and religious obligation to abide by his word . \" As a priestess , Medea knew the power of words and the gods .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Henry 's break with Rome and separation from Katherine was not accepted by public opinion .The kingdom was against his marriage to Anne Boleyn .They saw her as manipulative and power hungry .She spoke her mind and burned many bridges amongst the members of the court .\" The court made Anne Boleyn , and it would be the court which destroyed her . \"22 She had few allies and mostly enemies seeking to bring her down .\" [ F]emale power is often conceptualized as witchcraft . \" Medea 's knowledge of spells and herbs often reduces her position to that of an evil witch or sorceress .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , I always like to keep in mind that knowledgeable women were often condemned for their intelligence as it scared many people .Accepting that Medea is a witch , we learn that witchcraft was not the horrible thing it has come to be known as .\" In Greek culture magic can be positive or negative , but we hear much more about the latter variety .Destructive magic is strongly associated with women , sexual enchantment and female song . \" 24 The connection between women and evil comes from sexuality .As above , women .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fear too has power , fear of the unknown and unnatural .Intelligent women during the time period of both Medea and Anne were rare .The price of intelligence and education is the price for being accused of other worldly knowledge .For what could be more natural to call a smart and confident woman than a witch ? \"Much later the King would be said to explain it all away by reference to sorcery : he had been bewitched by Anne Boleyn .\" 25 Anne Boleyn was accused of bewitching and manipulating Henry VIII in order to become queen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Disfigurement rumors regarding Anne Boleyn was propaganda used to discredit her even after death .Nicholas Sander wrote : \" She had a projecting tooth under the upper lip , and on her right hand , six fingers .There was a large wen under her chin , and therefore to hide its ugliness , she wore a high dress covering her throat . \"26 Likewise , George Wyatt reported \" there were said to be upon some parts of her body , certain small moles incident to the clearest complexions . \"However , there are just as many reports describing Anne 's beauty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
