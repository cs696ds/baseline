{"text": "vote for this album : Vote 1 - bad 2 3 4 5 - average 6 7 8 9 10 - great .overall : 8.7 .Remasters Reviewed by : BLACKRAVEN , on september 07 , 2005 1 of 1 people found this review helpful .Sound : Perhaps the best known Led Zep album and to me personally the most influencial .This incredible EP contains 3 masterworks of 1 of the all time great bands .Tracks \" Rock ' N ' Roll , \" \" Black Dog \" and ofcourse the incredible \" Stairway To Heaven \" contain punchy riffs and epic solos from Jimmy Page , as well as the full vocal range from Robert Plant .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lyrics : The lyrics on most of the songs are incredible , one listen to Stairway To Heaven will prove the Page / Plant combination was in full swing by this time .Though some of the songs could have done with a bit more thought to the meanings , e.g. Four Sticks you are never quite shure about the pint of it .But then again this is balenced against tracks like Rock ' N ' Roll which are in their own right amazing songs .Also the re - mastering keeps the personality of the tracks and the classic almost live recorded Led Zep sound .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It contains in my opinion the best rock ballad ever written in \" Stairway To Heaven .\" The best songs I have named already in \" Black Dog , \" \" Rock ' N ' Roll \" and Stairway .I think this is a must own album for any Led Zep fan and for anyone who likes real music .Remasters Reviewed by : unregistered , on february 14 , 2007 1 of 2 people found this review helpful .Sound : This album is all you need to convert a non - believer .I found this record at the back of the cupboard when I was thirteen and it blew my mind .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "the Remasters has songs from every Led Zeppelin studio album ( Led Zeppelin I , II , III and IV , Houses of the Holy , Physical Graffiti and Presence ) .Because the album covers material spanning ten years , there is a wide variety of styles , as you would expect from Zeppelin .It ranges from the wierd prelude to metal ( ' Immigrant Song ' ) to the surreal but superb sounds of ' No Quarter ' .In general the album sounds fantastic , the only niggles are Plants ' vocals in ' Nobody 's Fault but Mine ' and a strange lapse in Pages ' soloing during ' Heartbreaker ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The weaker second disc features ' All my Love ' ( Plants ' tribute to his son ) which has a few good lyrics but apart from that is a bit boring . 'Trampled Under Foot ' starts of with an exciting funk riff but does n't really amount to anyhing and gets very repetitive .These are the only songs over both disc that I do n't like .the other 24 songs are an amazing collection of classic rock , blues - rock , rock and roll , metal , epic acoustics and a genre that can only be called Led Zepellin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "he provides an enourmous variety of sounds and anyone learning the guitar should buy this album just for that .His most prominent contribution is the eternal ' Stairway to Heaven ' , the solo ( Constantly voted he best ever)can be appreciated by anyone , regardless of musical tastes ( trust me on this ; I experimented ) .John Bonham is an inspiration , his obvious energy on the drums combined with his enourmous talent add an extra layer to every verse , chorus and bridge .In particular his intro to ' Rock n Roll ' gets you on your feet jerking about like a puppet before the song even gets under way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Robert Plants is , at times , the perfect voacalist .The mans thraot is as much an instrument as Jimmys ' guitar !In particular on ' Stairway to Heaven ' and ' Ramble On ' .The variety of sounds and styles on these two discs is alarming .However it all sounds like Led Zeppelin and so I defy anyone who listens to rock not to worship at least the first disc .Lyrics : Lyrically Led Zeppelin were not the best .Often their lyrics descend into mythology which , though iconic , can be a bit tedious .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However the lyrics do compliment the music very well in most cases .On ' All My Love ' Plant sings about chasing a feather in the wind , I think that this is one of the best lines on either disc .As this song is about plants dead son , the peotic imagry is beautiful ( Plants symbol on the fourth album was a feather ) .Other lyrical strong points include ' Stairway to Heaven ' and ' Immigrant Song ' .What more needs to be said about a song that debuted the term ' Rock God !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The number of artists that has been very obviouly influenced by him is astounding ( Axl Rose , Jack White etc ) and that alone is testament to his skill .Overall Impression : This album is essential listening for anyone who plays guitar , bass , drums or sings .Led Zeppelin were probably the most influential rock band of all time .It is easy to find traces of their music in bands ranging form Iron Maiden ( ' Achilles Last Stand ' ) to Franz Ferdinand ( ' Trampled Underfoot ' .Obviouly the best track is stairway , but songs like ' Achilles Last Stand ' , ' Babe I 'm Gon na Leave You ' and ' Dazed and Confused ' stand out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
