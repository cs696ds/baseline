{"text": "Post by GTSTfanMark on Apr 11 , 2009 10:41:43 GMT -5 .Finally !GTST is going to have a gay character .Ferry Doedens is going to play Lucas Sanders .I ( and others too ) have been saying for a long time that Lucas is the perfect character for a storyline like this .It 's great that the show is actually listening to us .Post by GTSTfanMark on Apr 15 , 2009 6:35:54 GMT -5 .There has been some controversy .Some of the male actors already on the cast were not too thrilled about the show adding a gay character , afraid that Lucas would be a love interest for their characters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A fan of GTST was disappointed in the actors and they went to the studio where GTST is filmed .They talked to Emiel Sandtke ( he plays Dex Huygens ) who said that he really likes it that there is going to be a gay character on the show .He said it was all a bit blown up by the media .When Emiel said he was n't bothered by a gay character being on the show the fan asked if he would n't be afraid to give him a kiss and this is what happened : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I heard and read about the controversy .I was a bit shocked actually ....I know media like to blow things up , but still : the rumor had to come from somewhere .I 'd always thought people over here were a bit more openminded ; especially since there are so many openly gay people in dutch showbizz .Post by GTSTfanMark on Apr 15 , 2009 12:16:38 GMT -5 .I guess there are closed minded people everywhere .It was probably one actor who talked to the producers and the media made more of it than it was .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Season 16 , 17 and 18 were n't that great , but things have really improved in the current season 19 .I 've always said Lucas would be the perfect character to do this storyline with so it 's great it 's actually going to happen .Post by amber80 on Apr 15 , 2009 12:46:41 GMT -5 .I guess you are right about that .I know you 're a real fan .;D I watched the first seasons , stopped for a few years and came back for another year or two .But right now it has been a while since I watched that closely , but luckily Lucas Sanders is someone coming from a family I do remember .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Post by GTSTfanMark on Apr 16 , 2009 5:55:42 GMT -5 .They often introduce new characters at the end of the season , so this did n't come as a surprise .I wonder if Lucas will be involved in the summer cliffhanger since I think it will be about the Sanders family ( they 're the A - storyline at the moment ) .Post by davedoty on Apr 21 , 2009 6:23:08 GMT -5 .I mean no offense to anyone with what I 'm about to say .We can disagree about an issue amicably , right ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If a straight actor is n't comfortable making out with a man , I do n't have a problem with that .I 'm going to tend to be more interested in the careers of people who ARE willing to go there , but I 'm not going to actively feel negative about actors who are n't .I think actors should be able to pursue , or not pursue , any roles they want without having their reasons judged .Someone does n't want to do horror films ?I 'm not going to take them to task for not being able to distinguish stage violence from real violence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm not going to judge him for not being able to differentiate himself from the role he 's playing .If an actress does n't want to do a simulated sex scene , I 'm not going to speculate that she may have sexual hangups .And if a straight guy does n't want to kiss a guy , I 'm fine with that .( But I 'm also going to be more interested in the guy who DOES play gay love interest . )I have even more trouble with the idea that straight actors playing gay have to have a certian attitude towards the kiss .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've kissed a couple of women , and you know what ?It felt VERY weird to me .If that makes me heterophobic , ah well .Like I said , no offense meant to people who may feel differently .We can all express our views , even strongly held views , and all be friends afterwards , right ? :p .Post by lolaruns on Apr 21 , 2009 6:40:42 GMT -5 .Agreed .We do n't know the circumstances .I also do n't think that every actor who does n't like the thought of their character going gay has to be a homophobe .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What if an actor feels it does n't suit the way they have played their character so far or if they are really invested in their het pairing .Not for reasons of \" I will get unpopular if I play gay \" but for reasons of character authenticity ?Let 's say the actress who plays Luise on VL was told tomorrow that they are scrapping the Luise / Gregor story and that instead she will fall in love with Stella .Would it really be that strange for her to be weirded out if up to now she has invested a lot of energy in making the pairing with Gregor seem believable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( just like there are a lot of pro gay or pro lesbian fans who are n't really happy about Olli 's aunt Charlie going gay when it seems very out of the blue ) .That said , smallmindedness or homophobia is probably a much more likely reason , but in theory , I do think that somebody can be unhappy about their character being turned gay for legitimate reasons .Another legitimate reason could be if it was too much of a clichee so that not even he gay community would benefit from it ( like a serial killer villain or really stereotypical pansy character turning gay ; ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fanfics in any language are permitted .Post by GTSTfanMark on Apr 21 , 2009 6:44:31 GMT -5 .Davedoty , I actually agree with you .I do n't really have a problem if an actor does n't want to play gay .There are enough actors ( even on GTST ) who are not against it .The other day I read an interview with Jan Kooijman who plays Danny on GTST .He played a gay character on a different soap and admitted that kissing a guy was a little scary in the beginning .I did n't have a problem with him telling the truth about that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm thinking the producer would talk to an actor first to ask him if he 's willing to play gay .I really doubt they would force an actor to play a gay role .Anyway , I think the media has blown this WAY out of proportion so it all probably looks worse than it really is .I usually do n't care too much about backstage drama .I just want to enjoy the show and not worry about other things .Post by GTSTfanMark on Apr 25 , 2009 8:10:51GMT -5 .It does n't have a lot to do with Lucas , but yesterday was his sister Nina 's 21st birthday party .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Toppers - Shine .The episode ended with an old fashioned friday cliffhanger : a gas explosion .From spoilers we know that Nina will be seriously injured .There are n't a lot of details yet but I think she might end up paralyzed .This could be the reason why Lucas will decide to return to Meerdijk .Post by jjose712 on May 1 , 2009 11:31:08 GMT -5 .I think that the problem with some of tv actors is that they do n't have any experience in theatre ( i never heard of a theatre actor who have that issues ) and are most concerned to make happy their female fans than to find an interesting role .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
