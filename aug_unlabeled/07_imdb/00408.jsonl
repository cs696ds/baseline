{"text": "Movie reviews .The Angel And The Sequel .With A Likable John Travolta , ' Michael ' Has Wings But Does n't Fly . 'Michael \" stars John Travolta as an angel down for his \" last blast \" on Earth .The role seems tailor - made for Travolta , an admitted hedonist who has been known to indulge his own lavish whims .Like the actor these days , Michael apparently can do no wrong , particularly in the dazed eyes of almost every woman he meets .The angel also has a whimsical streak , but it 's more along the lines of wanting to check out the world 's largest ball of twine and the world 's largest non - stick frying pan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Here 's an angel who 's battled the one and only Lucifer and penned a Psalm , for God 's sake .And the best he can do on his very last jaunt on our planet is to smother his breakfast cereal in sugar , chain smoke , hang around with Jean Stapleton and try to get William Hurt and Andie MacDowell together ?Is this anyone else 's idea of heaven on Earth ?Like its title character , \" Michael \" has wings but never flies .The movie is built around a few striking sight gags -- like Travolta with feathers sprouting out of his back -- and the good will transmitted by its star , but its zipless direction and writing fail to hide the strings behind the would - be magic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When we first meet Michael , he 's living in the rural Iowa house of an older woman , Pansy ( Stapleton ) , after answering her prayer that an angel come and obliterate the bank that kept her in debt .If they succeed , Frank and his bumbling colleague , Huey Driscoll ( Robert Pastorelli ) , get to keep their jobs .If they do n't , they 're canned , and Malt wins custody of Sparky , Driscoll 's mutt terrier famous for being photographed with celebrities .Along for the ride is Malt 's new hire , Dorothy Winters ( MacDowell ) , a dog trainer falsely touted as an angel expert .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He 's scratching his crotch , his long hair is tousled , and he 's sucking on a cigarette .They were expecting someone cleaner and with a halo , perhaps the glued - on kind .\" I 'm not that kind of an angel , \" he informs them in his borderline - boozy way ; he delivers many of his lines as if stifling a burp .So what kind of angel is he ?Hard to say , really .Aside from his slovenly appearance , he does n't turn out to be much of a vulgarian .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You never see anything beyond his disappearing behind a door with one or multiple starstruck lasses .He could be letting them stuff pillows with his plumage for all we know .The Michael of lore is a warrior angel , and this one does like battle , even if it merely involves head - butting a bull .But as time passes , he resembles more of your conventional movie angel .You got ta learn to laugh , \" he tells the grouchy trio as they drive him back to Chicago .\" That 's the way to true love . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So Michael , with his bloated body bespeaking the joys of decadence , is just trying to spread a little love and get everyone to appreciate life 's simpler pleasures .In other words , he 's not that far removed from another Travolta character who blesses ordinary folk with his angelic presence during his brief time on Earth : George Malley from this summer 's \" Phenomenon .Michael \" is not as shamelessly manipulative as \" Phenomenon\"--though you may disagree when the angel is called on to revive a dead doggie -- but it also does n't give its star as much meat to chew .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
