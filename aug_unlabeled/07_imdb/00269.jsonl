{"text": "That is where he observed the picture of Mr. Jones again and registered the maze pendant in his mind .I also do n't believe Alex was without guilt .This IQ thing does n't give him complete immunity .I am not slaying I would inflect the same torture as Keller but it was obvious the police did n't have Alex under surveillance .Keller had ample reason to believe Alex had information about the girls disappearance .He did n't relish the torture he was inflicting on Alex but he made a pact with himself to follow his course of action no matter the consequences to himself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But thanks for sharing .I think it was obvious Loki would find Keller in the end .His lingering on the scene implied it as did hearing the whistle .I think the point the director was making was , in as much as Keller made Alex suffer , the filmmaker had a moral obligation to let Keller stay imprisoned and suffer as well .After seeing the movie , I 've been discussing the plot with my daughter and we managed to put all the jigsaw pieces together .While talking I realised that one of the themes behind the story is that the same fanatism that people may have for a religion or other believe in something good makes the person do things that are in complete contrast with their fundamental good intentions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
