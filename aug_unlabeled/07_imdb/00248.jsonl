{"text": "NO REVIEWS AVAILABLE .Magical Journey To the Past .I LOVE THIS MOVIE .This movie is the best representation of the black genre of actors who were underrated in their capacity to entertain a wide audience .The story of W.C. Handy is just a backdrop .The real education for the uninformed is to see how Nat King Cole transcends all of the best in acting and singing to an audience of all people and not just for a select crowd .This movie needs to be in the annals of black education and is a tribute to the best of what black entertainment offers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Fabulous , plus you get to hear Nat sing , talk and relate to family , friends and fans , he embodies the role .Great Movie .I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it and that was in the 80 's .My favorite part is when Nat King Cole sits at the piano that he had bought and had delivered to his fathers home .His father approaches the home and hears Nat singing about his mother , that song is so beautiful , wish I had a recording of that song , but would be happy with it on DVD .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Thank you TCM , for today 's viewing pleasure .Eartha Kitt WOW !I only knew of this film because of a collection of Eartha Kitt songs on CD .The jazzy numbers spring from lively minor keys and complex bass lines , making complex thrilling melodies with clever lyrics that stick in your head for days .I 'm extremely happy to have caught the film on TCM .Eartha smolders as an ambitious chantuese who refuses to be controlled by smalltown prejudicies or her jealous club - owner boyfriend ( Cab Calloway ) .Discovering the talent of a young songwriter ( Nat King Cole ) as his band plays for change outside her club , she immediately sees a successful future for herself singing his songs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She never smiles , never flirts , never shows a vulnerable side .She 's amazingly cold , creating a character that is at once unattainably sexy ( her gowns reveal the body of a goddess ) and career - minded , with lines that shoot like straight arrows of truth through everyone 's hearts .Meanwhile her singing voice is angelic and arresting .Kitt should be remembered for this amazingly confident performance in a pre - feminist age , rather than her campy turns as Catwoman and aging nymphos in lackluster comedies .Truly great !A true musical enjoyment ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My 12 year old son plays the piano and trumpet and we sat and watched this movie together and both truly enjoyed it .He enjoyed it so much that he wanted it on dvd to take to school to share with his jazz band class .I REALLY hope that it will be available on dvd SOON ... it is a MUST have for any aspiring musician or any lover of truly good music .What a time capsule !I was born in 1958 and I just saw this movie for the 1st time .WOW !To have so many talented people portraying the characters in Mr. Handy 's life makes this movie a true jewel of American History ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
