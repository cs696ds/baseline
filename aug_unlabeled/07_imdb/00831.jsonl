{"text": "This super - realism apparently had its detractors ( most notably writer Alan Moore ) , but there 's no suggestion that the film is an accurate retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae , rather an accurate translation of the graphic novel .As it stands , the film is structured in such a way that the embellishments actually make sense , as events are communicated to the audience by one of the survivors as he tells campfire stories to rally the troops .Visually the film is quite breathtaking , looking every bit as good as Miller 's Sin City did when it arrived in theatres back in 2005 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The live - action elements integrate seamlessly with the digital backdrops in a manner superior to any other film I 've seen , creating some truly striking imagery that simply would not have been possible utilising conventional methods .It 's a great advertisement for the use of CGI in film , and proves that CGI is not necessarily a bad thing in and of itself when employed correctly .If action is your thing you certainly wo n't be disappointed , as 300 includes more than its fair share of combat .There 's something perversely satisfying about watching a group of stripped - down , oiled - up Spartans committing unspeakable acts of violence against mutant Persians in super slow - mo .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are decapitations , amputations , impalings and eviscerations galore , often performed concurrently on a single unfortunate soldier .The supporting cast of ' featured ' Spartans includes David Wenham ( Lord of the Rings ) , Vincent Regan , Michael Fassbender and Tom Wisdom , who deliver their lines with suitable machismo .Lena Heady steams up the screen as the strong ( and delectable ) Queen Gorgo , and plays her part in the political subplot opposite Dominic West 's ( Mona Lisa Smile ) scheming Theron very well .It 's unfortunate that both Rodrigo Santoro ( Xerxes ) and Andrew Tiernan ( Ephialtes ) are afforded so little screen time , but both are able to craft memorable characters nonetheless .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "300 arrives on DVD at its theatrical aspect ratio of approximately 2.40:1 , complete with anamorphic enhancement .Prior to this review I had read a number of negative comments about the image quality of the region one release , so I was n't quite sure what to expect .Many of the negative comments related to excessive grain , and while it 's true that there is a lot of grain on display , it was also present theatrically .It 's hard to criticise the image for remaining faithful to the theatrical experience , but there are one or two moments where it seems that the transfer ca n't quite keep up and some minor digital noise is visible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The image is also a little on the soft side ( again possibly because of the post - processing ) , and while both are relatively minor issues they are issues all the same .It 's odd to start a video appraisal with the negatives , but in this case it seemed the most logical choice because , frankly , there 's not a lot else wrong with the transfer .It 's hard to critique the image quality of something that 's been so heavily post - produced , so I 'm especially grateful that I managed to catch the film at the cinema ( at least I had something to go on ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The palette is comprised mainly of sepia tones and cold blues , with the occasional ( okay frequent ) splash of red and solid if not inky black levels , all of which showcases Larry Fong 's wonderful cinematography .While it may not be the best looking DVD transfer I 've ever seen , it 's a fine effort that more than does justice to the theatrical experience if you can get your head around the amount of visible grain .Audio .As is customary for Warner releases , the main audio track on offer is a Dolby Digital 5.1 affair .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are plenty of subtle ambient effects ; wind whistles through wheat fields and birds twitter as they flitter about , in a sort of calm before the storm .Of course things liven up again once Leonidas and the boys get stuck into the Persians , with numerous screams , slashing swords , gurgles and the like .There 's ample directionality in the mix , with every channel utilised to bring the battle scenes to life , while the subwoofer pumps out more low frequency rumbles than the footsteps of Xerxes ' huge army .Bates ' score keeps pace with the action , incorporating electric guitar to create a hard - edged sound for the scenes of all - out carnage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The exceptions to this are the Spartan war cries and Leonidas ' rousing speeches , which are as loud as anything you 'll hear .While not as accomplished as the very best mixes around - and I 'm talking about benchmark titles such as the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings trilogies - this is a great effort that makes for an incredibly atmospheric viewing experience that really draws the viewer into the action .The only other audio option on offer is a descriptive track , in which the action is narrated by a very posh sounding Englishman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Extras .The only advertised bonus material on disc one is a commentary track from director Zack Snyder , writer Kurt Johnstad and director of photography Larry Fong .Ordinarily I 'd listen to a commentary in its entirety , but I found it very difficult to do so in this case .The track really suffers from ' pointing out the obvious ' syndrome - specifically relating to the use of CGI - and there are also frequent periods of dead air to contend with .If you like your ' yak - tracks ' on the dry side you might get a little more enjoyment out of it than I did , but I would n't count on it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This short thank you is followed by a scrolling list of names set to music from the film , and runs for around eighty seconds .I found it most odd , but I guess it 's nice that these people got some recognition .300 - Fact or Fiction ' runs for a little under twenty - five minutes and deals with the mythology behind the movie .For me this was probably the most entertaining featurette on the disc , as it examines the various cinematic interpretations of the Battle of Thermopylae that have surfaced over the years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While they make no secret of the historical inaccuracies , they are eager to point out that this has been a constant throughout history and that the basic facts underpinning the film are sound .Director Zack Snyder and writer Frank Miller are also on hand with their thoughts .Who Were the Spartans ? :The Warriors of 300 ' is a short ( 04:24 ) featurette that examines the factual origins of the Spartans portrayed in the movie , providing superficial insight into their daily lives and social structure .This is really a thematic continuation from the previous piece , but this time the actors are on hand to voice their opinions and discuss their interpretation of the historic events .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Those interviewed include comic book author Neal Adams , DC Comics President Paul Levitz and DC Group Editor Bob Schreck ( who looks somewhat like his namesake ) , along with director Zack Snyder .The Making of 300 ' sounded like it was going to be a thorough examination of the creative process , but actually turned out to be a sub - six - minute featurette .It covers a lot of the same ground as the material that came before it , with footage from the film punctuated by sound - bites from the actors and creative team .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Making 300 in Images ' is a similarly - themed featurette that uses time - lapse photography to take the viewer behind - the - scenes through the various stages of production .I guess it was moderately entertaining , but everything flew by so quickly I had trouble maintaining interest despite the short ( three - minute ) running time .Three deleted scenes introduced by Zack Snyder come next .The first two concern Ephialtes , but really add nothing to the film so I can see why they were excised .The third scene was removed because it pushed the boundaries of believability even for 300 , and if I use the words ' midgets riding giants ' you 'll get the gist of what happens .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The final bonus features on disc two are the ' Webisodes ' , of which there are twelve in total .You can choose to watch them individually , or via a ' play all ' function , but with a combined running time of just over thirty - eight minutes it 's nice to have the option to watch one or two at a time .The Websisodes concentrate on such things as production design , wardrobe , stunt work , the principal cast , adapting the graphic novel , training the actors , glimpses from the set , scene studies and the fantastic creatures and characters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Overall .In bringing 300 to the screen , Zack Snyder has done a fantastic job of recreating the feel of Miller 's original graphic novel .This review marked my fifth viewing of 300 , and far from becoming tired of the ' hollow ' action I found that I enjoyed the film on a deeper level this time around .At the end of the day that 's all I can really ask of a movie .Technically the audio - visual elements of the disc are extremely impressive , but I was somewhat disappointed with the bonus material on offer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Considering this is yet another of Warner 's artificially inflated \u00a3 24.99 RRP DVD sets , I do n't think it 's unreasonable to expect more from the extras .With that said , you should be able to pick it up at a reasonable price if you shop around , and the quality of the film is such that I would urge you to give it a rental at the very least .Oh , and before I forget , brush your teeth !Message Enter the message here then press submit .The username , password and message are required .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But considering it 's being made from an Alan Moore graphic novel , substance wo n't be in short supply .The execution may kill it , though .I can see why some of you think I 've been a bit generous , but at the end of the day film is an art form , and as a piece of art this is pretty damn good .It 's beautifully shot , visually interesting , sounds fantastic , features solid performances and I enjoyed it almost as much as Sin City ( which I loved ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Did that ruin my enjoyment of 300 ?No .Would that have been any different if I was aware of the plagiarism ?Possibly .However , I can only review based on my experience at the time , so I again stand by the 9/10 ( the sound design as a whole is very nice ) .The whole homoeroticism / homophobia thing is interesting , and is one of the deeper meanings I was talking about .Miller states that some of it was in there to show that the Spartans were hypocritical , in that they call Athenians ' boy lovers ' while having pederastic relationships themselves ( although the meaning of the word ' pederastic ' is disputed ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He idealises his own people , whilst vilifying the Persians .There 's a reason so many of them appear to be deformed or mutilated as well .It was intended to be a visual representation of corruption , but again this is all coming from a Spartan point of view .Personally I did n't think it was as violent as it was made out to be .The CGI blood which was kept in line with the comic book look of the overall movie , dulled the violence IMO .I 'm an ' 80s child , raised on violent action films , and this was nowhere NEAR in line with those .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So the excessive grain appearance may have been attributed to that .But on second viewing a couple weeks ago , I thought the transfer was actually pretty good .Just like Chris said , there 's a few scenes that are overly grainy , and some that appear overly soft , but for the most part , the transfer 's pretty good .But for those looking for a companion piece film , look for the TROY : Director 's Cut that recently came out in R1 .It 's a much better film than the theatrical cut .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But so are the battle scenes .More violent and expand on the sheer greatness of the conflict .The sacking of Troy after the Trojan Horse is also extended with several more displays of brutal violence .Still not quite as good as the Kingdom of Heaven Director 's Cut , but it makes it a better film .Transfer is better , both in terms of clarity and in color saturation as the film is spread out over two discs .I was disappointed by the extras too but I suppose a special edition is looming in the future .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
