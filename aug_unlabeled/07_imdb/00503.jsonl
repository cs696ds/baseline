{"text": "I also liked the lighting of the Romulan Senate in the opening scene of the movie .Beyond those two shots , I get what you mean about the lighting not being nearly as impressive as in Generations .I 'll definitely give Generations beaucoup points in that area .The Ent - D closing on Amargosa Station was also a nicely done shot .I thought the cinematography in Generations was stunning , by far the best of the four TNG outings , and those pictures prove it .There 's no confusing them with the series , Nemesis was the second best in this regard with some great shots , but some that fell flat also .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In spite of my previous stance , I can definitely give Generations some major points in the cinematography department ... yes , even above Nemesis .For me , the biggest factor of big screen wow in Nemesis was the space battle .... one of the more weighted reasons , the battle took up practically the entire last half of the film ... and it was chock full of battle porn goodness .To get back to GENERATIONS , what I love most about it is that they got to use the sets and f / x in ways we never got to see on the TV series so it made the film feel more unique .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Click to expand ... . ...AGREED !The cinematography in \" Generations \" is outstanding !Gates & Marina look absolutely gorgeous in this movie , in a way that was never really recaptured , again .Their hair looks very healthy in this picture too , I 'm noticing .In later features , it never quite has the same \" body \" to it .By the time we get to NEMESIS , however , no effort - at all - is made to \" youthify \" their appearance , outside of their being under a coat of paint thick enough to stop a bullet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The lighting on the bridge , especially shows where the priorities are in this movie , as only the console displays are allowed to look fresh and vibrant .And the upping of contrast on Colaris III was so obviously computer enhanced that the effect is distracting .Even in the worst smog , I 've never seeen people shine like they had a lightbulb up their ass ... .Even though the ending of Generations was shit , how it looked at least and the location were both great looking , it was just the lack of ambition in what was supposed to be the climax of the film and the dreadful way Kirk died let it down .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
