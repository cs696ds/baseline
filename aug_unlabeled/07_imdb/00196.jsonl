{"text": "Three children are born during a solar eclipse ( with an unfortunate conjunction of Saturn , as we will later learn ) in the same US small town .This being a horror film and all , this accident of birth turns all three of them into nasty little sociopaths .The police is unable to connect the various murders ( and it sure does n't help that the sheriff who is also one of the kid 's parents is one of their first victims ) , so the nasty little buggers just go on and on killing .Only Joyce Russel ( Lori Lethin ) and her little brother Timmy ( K.C. Martel ) are slowly getting suspicious , but who else would believe these angelic little dears to be brutal killers ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ed Hunt 's Bloody Birthday is a curious example of early 80s horror .Clearly meant as part of the slasher wave , the film 's main claim to difference lies in its evil child trio premise .Unfortunately , that part of the movie is rather underdeveloped , with some astrological ( yuck ) handwaving meant to motivate a rather random killing spree that lacks any deeper connection that would make it more dramatic .Even poor Jason Voorhees has his motives , after all .A more clever film would be able to turn exactly this randomness of the killings to its advantage ; alas , Blood Birthday is not a clever film and just coasts on its not actually very transgressive killer kid transgression .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
