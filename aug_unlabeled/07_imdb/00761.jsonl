{"text": "The painting will not be on public display .The Vatican newspaper , L'Osservatore Romano , set the art world aflutter last week with a front - page article headlined \" A New Caravaggio .\" The article made clear that no certain attribution had been made and that further tests were required .But the definitive - sounding headline and the fact that the claim was made on the day marking the 400th anniversary of the master 's death had raised expectations .The Vatican has in the past announced such art - world news in L'Osservatore , sometimes coinciding with an anniversary .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "She said the hand of one of the executioners , holding a stick to keep the saint down , is also of good quality .But she and the other experts noted that elements were poor , such as the bodies of the executioners , the cloth covering Lawrence , and one of the saint 's legs , which appears to be awkwardly attached to the torso .\" The leg looks like a frog 's leg .Caravaggio would never have made such a mistake , \" said Marco Bona Castellotti , an art historian .Even as he saw the painting for the first time at Tuesday 's unveiling , he had no doubt it could n't be Caravaggio .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
