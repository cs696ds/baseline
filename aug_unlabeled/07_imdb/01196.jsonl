{"text": "# 35 in All Time Favorite Games # 1 Star Wars : Knights of the Old Re ...Ninersfan4926 's opinion : This game ranks right up there with the ME games for me .It has an awesome story - line and some fantastic characters .Feels just like Star Wars , but at the same time BioWare made something far more interesting IMO .The combat is pretty fun , especially some of the jedi powers .While this game has the good vs. evil choices , not my favorite since I prefer moral dilemmas , it does it as well as you can , as this is Star Wars , so there is going to be light vs. dark .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "# 3 in All Time Favorite Games # 2 Mass Effect 2 Ninersfan4926 's opinion : The game is phenomenal , as close to perfection as I have seen in a game , but not perfect so not a 10 .I loved the first , but the combat was improved for the second , including better gunplay .ME2 's story is great , but also a fantastic set - up for ME3 as it generates even more intrigue than the first .The game 's choices contain moral ambiguity even more than the first .Replay value is second - to - none , as there are different classes , different choices , different squad mates , and , with an imported save even more variety .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Play the first , but play this even if you do n't like the first .# 12 in All Time Favorite Games # 3 Red Dead Redemption Ninersfan4926 's opinion : This game is outstanding , bringing a refreshing setting with polished gameplay and one of the best narratives out there .It succeeds where GTA IV did not with its story , including a great cast of characters and one of the best endings in gaming .The Dead - eye mechanic enables great shooting to allow you to feel like a master by taking out many guys in a short period of time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "100%ing this game is great fun , complete with treasure - hunting and much less annoying tasks than things such as shooting pigeons in GTA IV .I can not really think of a flaw other than its overarching story taking a little bit of a backseat for parts of the game , but by the end you will not care about this at all .# 55 in All Time Favorite Games # 4 Batman : Arkham City Ninersfan4926 's opinion : This game is phenomenal .You feel like Batman , and the gameplay is second to none IMO .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The detective mode is improved in this game as it did not hurt my eyes like in the first ( may not apply to you ) .Everything is on a bigger scale than the first .The ending is very good , but that 's all I 'll say .One thing that is great about this game is the side quests .There are plenty , and they mix well with the main story with their added backstory .The music is good , and it 's overflowing with content .Going for 100 % will take a big chunk of time , with riddler trophies , challenge rooms , and side quests to boot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "# 21 in All Time Favorite Games # 5 Mass Effect Ninersfan4926 's opinion : My second favorite game to ME2 , this game is truly outstanding .It introduces a wonderful universe with great characters , an awesome story , and decent combat .There are some problems compared to the second , but most of them are minor .The soundtrack can hook you and make you feel awesome in the end .It has great replay value , with different squad members , different choices , and different classes , and indeed I played it 7 times , although that is a bit extreme .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even if you do n't like the combat , I urge you to turn it down to casual and rush through those parts , as this game is a masterpiece in interactive storytelling .# 93 in All Time Favorite Games # 6 Heavy Rain Ninersfan4926 's opinion : This game is simply brilliant .It is the most exhilarating game I have ever played .The story and soudntrack are top - notch , and I loved the QTE action sequences .I would recommend the playstation move for your first experience , as it does make it better .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is its own genre .Even Indigo Prophecy does not belong because in Heavy Rain you can not lose , there is no game over , the story just continues with the dead character .It has more memorable moments in 8 hours than any other game does in 50 .And that 's why few games have ever given me as much deep emotion as heavy rain , a phenomenal experience from start to finish .# 1 in All Time Favorite Games # 9 The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of ...Ninersfan4926 's opinion : Brilliant , revolutionary game .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The side - quests are great fun and take some thinking , as do the temples .The story is decent , nothing phenomenal though , but the gameplay is just so good .I will always remember the Gerudo Desert song , and the rest of the soundtrack is stellar as well .Just an amazing game , and I rank it slightly lower than some other titles because I enjoyed their stories more , but this game is a must - play .# 74 in All Time Favorite Games # 10 Assassin 's Creed : Brotherhood Ninersfan4926 's opinion : Definitely a better game than ACII .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's more variety in this game as well , and it is so much fun to play .I think people have this rated lower because there is n't as much change from AC2 to brotherhood as there is from AC1 to AC2 , but that 's because there was so much change from the first to the second .The greatest addition to this game is the killstreaks , as it made fun the big fights as opposed to AC2 when the big fights were just counter - fests .Brotherhood also adds in a multiplayer that is very different and fun .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I really do not like post - apocalyptic settings , but this game delivered an interesting world and a pretty good story compared to Oblivion .There are a number of improvements to Oblivion , too many to list , but the main one is the leveling system .There is a cool V.A.T.S targeting system , although it depends if you like leaving combat up to dice rolls , but you ca n't spam it .The perks system and side - quests are awesome .My biggest complaint is the weight system , but I hate those in general , as I end up spending too much time rearranging my inventory rather than playing in the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "# 10 in All Time Favorite Games # 12 BioShock Ninersfan4926 's opinion : This game is outstanding for a few reasons : a phenomenal story , a unique setting , and very cool gameplay .The story has an awesome twist , among the best all - time .However , that 's not the only reason it has a great story .The game represents the problems of human nature .I can really sympathize with the antagonist Andrew Ryan , as he really was just a man with a dream that failed .He is one of the greatest characters of all time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The under - water city is awesome with very cool enemies .The plasmids really change up the gameplay , and it helps to make the best fps ever , IMO . # 2534 in All Time Favorite Games # 13 Excitebike 64 Ninersfan4926 's opinion : Honestly , the Excitebike soccer mode is the greatness of this game .I have played hundreds of games , and it is so much fun and always full of laughter as two bikes struggle to push a massive ball into a massive goal .I am almost always laughing during the games , and it is for this reason , not the actual racing , that I gave it such a high score .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The gameplay is the best of any rpg I have ever played , as it 's just so satisfying to feel like a typical soldier in medieval times and rise to become a lord and even one day a king .There 's so many more options though , you can start your own kingdom , whatever you want .Recruit / upgrade soldiers in a fun economy .I highly recommend the Floris mod .The only bad thing really is the lack of siege weaponry ( just ladders / towers ) , the generic quests , and the cyclical wars that have little reasoning behind them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Still , it 's a great change of pace from normal save the world from monsters rpg 's with gameplay that puts other rpg 's to shame .# 37 in All Time Favorite Games # 15 Grand Theft Auto IV Ninersfan4926 's opinion : GTA IV is a great experience .I had loads of fun with it , as the missions they created felt truly epic , probably because they felt crazy in a realistic setting .Outside the missions , there is some hilarious satire of a lot from the real world .However , I experienced many minor annoyances , too many to list .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Rockstar created an okay story here , but nothing compared to RDR , especially when comparing the characters .While not as great as RDR , GTA IV is definitely still worth a play , although its expansions in Episodes from Liberty City are better in nearly every way .For the purposes of my rankings , GTA IV includes its expansions in the \" complete edition \" , as I played it .# 92 in All Time Favorite Games # 16 Final Fantasy Tactics Ninersfan4926 's opinion : This game has one of the best stories and soundtracks of all time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The strategy rpg gameplay is very fun , although the difficulty is inconsistent .There is one part of the game that could force you to restart the entire game should your character not be good enough and not having an alternate save file .Near the end the game gets too easy .All that said , the story is so brilliant from start to finish that these things did not concern me at all .The dynamic between Ramza and Delita is so compelling .What I love most is that the story is mostly political , full of treachery and intrigue and not some clich\u00e9 tale about invading monsters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of the most unique experiences I 've had with a game .Just 16 enemies , massive ones , but epic stuff .Great soundtrack , cool gameplay , although the controls are a little clunky .The story leaves a lot to your imagination .I ca n't even score this game , it 's that different from every other game I 've played .# 22 in All Time Favorite Games # 18 Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves Ninersfan4926 's opinion : Phenomenal game .It 's better than the first , but there 's something I liked more about the first , maybe the setting or story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also comes with a fun multiplayer .The characters are very interesting .Overall it 's just a great experience , a rush of immersion with very cool changes in scenery .# 30 in All Time Favorite Games # 19 Assassin 's Creed II Ninersfan4926 's opinion : Wow , biggest improvement in a series from the first game to the second I have ever seen .They actually allowed you to use stealth to assassinate most targets instead of the first game 's tendency to get into boring , massive counter - fest battles .They made the story make a lot more sense ( except weirder ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I still disliked the open fighting , although they fixed it to a certain extent with smoke bombs ( as you could toss one and run / kill everyone ) , and for this reason Brotherhood is a better game .Double - air - assassinations never get old .Some of my favorite gameplay ever , and the cities are beautiful as well . # 59 in All Time Favorite Games # 20 Dragon Age : Origins Ninersfan4926 's opinion : Phenomenal game .Not as good as the Mass Effect series , but still great .A lot of the choices were very good , although it still does too much of the very good / very evil choices , whereas I like more moral ambiguity like in the ME series .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I recommend casual if you are like me and dislike the combat , as it will go by much quicker .The story is great , as usual with a BioWare game , and it has a lot of replay value with different choices , classes , etc .I prefer talking main characters as well .It has issues , but DA : O is still a great game .# 43 in All Time Favorite Games # 22 Batman : Arkham Asylum Ninersfan4926 's opinion : Phenomenal game , with some of my favorite game - play of all - time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Its story is pretty interesting , but again the game - play is the star here .While some boss fights were certainly lacking , the only thing I can really complain about is that it really stresses one 's eyes .Some combination of the detective mode 's flash of light with its x - ray filter sort of hurts the game 's look .Other than that , however , this game is damn near perfect , and certainly some of the best game - play ever .I even replayed the demo it was so good .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "# 23 in All Time Favorite Games # 23 The Legend of Zelda : The Wind Wa ...Ninersfan4926 's opinion : Very cool game , the second - best of the 3 zelda games I have played .As with the other two ( OoT and Twilight princess ) , the game - play is fantastic , with cool items to solve cool puzzles .The story is actually pretty cool here as the game 's setting builds upon past Zelda settings .Mainly , I liked how different it felt from other Zelda games , with the entire world being filled with water .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As for the combat , the game includes some cool new moves .Overall The Wind Waker is a great game , but it does not have as much of the epic feel Ocarina of Time had .# 251 in All Time Favorite Games # 24 Ratchet & Clank Ninersfan4926 's opinion : Awesome game .Weapons are great , characters are cool and funny , and the story is okay .Just a load of fun , and the start of a great series .Actually my first ps2 game , and probably started the only ps2 series that I played that was actually great , as I missed out on a lot of great ps2 games .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "# 15 in All Time Favorite Games # 25 The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion Ninersfan4926 's opinion : This was my first game on the 360 , and it truly is great despite having a plethora of flaws .The leveling system is terrible , the main story is generic , and the voice - acting is horrendous .However , it is one of the most addicting games I 've played , with a great open - world ( although it does not have much variety in locale ) and some pretty cool combat .I put 100 hours into this on my first play - through , and it was extremely fun , especially two of the side - quest story - lines , the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves ' Guild , which actually had brilliant plots .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not as great as Fallout 3 , but still phenomenal .I love gaming but am also into watching sports , mainly the NFL .I have all consoles this generation .I do try and play pc games , especially older classics on the cheap .I am all about the single - player / co - op , so if its single - player / co - op alone is n't worth a purchase , then I wo n't buy the game .That being said , I do play multiplayer from time to time , mainly for achievements or with friends .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The legendaries are pretty damn cool , and there is pretty crazy quest line to get the regis even involving braille .It 's a solid game , but honestly the story is so generic , and I wish the game would have ended a couple hours sooner , it just started to drag towards the end .It is beautiful though , but I do n't think some things were implemented very well .For one , with both the controller and mouse it was hard to get the game to register that you were in fact trying to draw a square or triangle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You 're also fighting the same enemies for the entire game , and it just starts to wear down after a while .I really love the one main song that plays in the title screen and at certain other times , it 's beautiful .So , it 's a good game and just about worth the $ 2.50 I paid for it .The first Pokemon game I played , had a blast with it back in the day .Might have been the only Pokemon game in which I actually took a Pokemon to level 100 ( Pikachu , of course ) , but I ca n't quite remember .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
