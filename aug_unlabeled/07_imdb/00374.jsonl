{"text": "Can he track down the mysterious \" Christopher \" before his ruthless associates unmask and kill him ?Amazon.ca .The House on 92nd Street has solid claims to a place in film history , and not just as an engrossing true - life counter - espionage movie .Its working title was \" Now It Can Be Told , \" and its story -- about the F.B.I. smashing a Nazi spy ring in New York -- involved the stealing of atomic secrets .That surely upped the topical ante for 1945 audiences ( who , we may assume , had a lot less ambivalent feelings about the F.B.I. than latterday viewers ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The working formula of House and its successors was to fully incorporate documentary techniques into the storytelling , and to \" film where it actually happened .\" That included using some nonprofessional performers , sometimes people who had been involved in the case .but also the gangster movie Kiss of Death , the journalistic detective story Call Northside 777 , and another F.B.I. case history , Street With No Name .Even the storybook fantasy of the studio 's 1947 Miracle on 34th Street was charmingly validated by setting Kris Kringle down amid real New Yorkers and real Gotham grittiness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
