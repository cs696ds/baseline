{"text": "and I too would be interested in more info on the format .used to use super8 and 16 all the time in night clubs , thats how i started .Ill dig out contact addresses for you of dealers and cine clubs .quality depends on the projector , but good projectors are cheap . superp effects can be acheived by using two or more projectors on one screen - proper live mixing !why go data ? cos its nice and easy .I do n't think I 'd mess w/ super8 beamers at all , just take footage and rip it to DVD / HD or somethin ... more interested in a decidedly analog look ... plus I 'm a hopeless gear freak and am always interested in learning about shit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "some years ago i was in touch with a advertising filmproduction firm which produced some commercials on super8 and converted the material via filmscanner into video to get the special look of this format .Looks great .I have started to orginating footage on super 8 , it gives a lovly feel to things as it has far more exposure range .The film is about ?12 a reel and that will last 3 mins at 25fps .If setup right the footage can have a higher line resolution that miniDV .I got a nizo professional on ebay for ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have a couple of cameras and projectors ( maybe even an editor ) from my film school days .The cost of using them is just too expensive .Film needs a LOT of light to get good colors , though you use to be able to get tri - x b&w film that looked just beautiful grain and all ....I 'm looking to sell them if anyone knows a good place . just take footage and rip it to DVD .Click to expand ... .Ha ha ha ha ! \" rip \" to DVD .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Generally , it starts life as a cartridge roll of kodachrome ( like slide film , there is no negative ) that lasts only 2min , 50sec ( I 'm sure Tom will correct me if my memory is wrong ) if you shoot at 24fps .Common to shoot at 18fps to get about 3min,20sec ( ? ) or so .Then you run out of film and send it away for processing .2 weeks later you get it back and can watch it for the first time on a projector that will leave a nice long scratch down the center of the whole reel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Holly - you probably know this already , but I 've found the best place to sell super-8 equipment is at schools themselves - just posting up flyers with pics of the equipment .At my old school , the first production class is still in Super-8 , so there 's a rush for equipment at the beginning of every semester .Not sure about the schools in NY ... .And it 's true that it 's expensive , but you can certainly get some interesting effects .If you 're going for a real lo - fi look you can just project the film onto a screen and record it onto a dv camera .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "An example of this can be seen here : .On another note , I 'd be interested if someone could find a way to get the flicker out - seems you could regulate the brightness , sort of like normalizing a sound track , but my results have been futile so far .To video tape Super8 film when it 's projected on a wall , I 've had good luck messing around with the shutter speeds on the camera and always having it hooked up to a tv so I can see how it looks .It probably wo n't take all the flicker out like a real telecine would but it 's a good start .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Color can get a bit squishy , and I 'm not convinced that the merits offset the fuzziness .BUT Black and White looks great .I found a local place that does the developing , and another that does a fairly cheap transfer to DV .I transferred a bunch of old family films , and was surprised how nicely they came out .I think part of the reason I always discounted Super8 transfers was that everyone used to get them done to VHS .The quality difference in getting them transferred to a higher format makes a major difference .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you do shoot your own footage off a wall or screen , try playing with zooming in on the footage and capture the same footage 3 or four times .Make an edit of that , and you get a nice collage of your original subject .Hey Holly , if you have a good S8 projector I might be interested .Maybe a cheap camera as well .Let me know , I 'm on yr email list .Good telecine transfer makes a HUGE difference .I shot a bunch of S8 for a doc film I worked on and we initially did very cheap 1 light transfers in the back of this hole - in - the - wall film lab .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I highly reccomend VidiPax if you have the budget .Of course I was shooting Kodachrome ( the reds , man ... ) .People who have this stuff in basements just want to get rid of it cheap , but there 's quite a boutique market around NYC for the pro level stuff .Ebay the way to go , though I 've noticed a spike in scams and shady sellers .Hey Holly , if you have a good S8 projector I might be interested .Maybe a cheap camera as well .Let me know , I 'm on yr email list .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
