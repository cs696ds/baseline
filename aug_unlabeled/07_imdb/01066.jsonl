{"text": "[ Remember This ? ]What Movies Are You Afraid Suck Now ?There are some films that exist as sacred experiences in our memory , and it 's likely that our memory is the only place where they can exist in such a fashion .For instance , I adored Fright Night 2 as a kid .I remember it as a raucous romp wherein Charlie Brewster had a sexier girlfriend who could even make studying at the library look hot .I also seem to remember that , this time , Peter Vincent is the one who has to do the convincing - which is an interesting reversal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I imagine if I revisited the film today I 'd feel differently .Secondly , all of the things that made the movie a plus when I was in the 5th or 6th grade would likely bog it down with silliness now .I almost feel like a new viewing would turn me into Charlie Brewster at the beginning of the sequel , a once - believer who is now throwing away all of his crucifixes .Another film I hold in high esteem is The Monster Squad .I remember my Dad taking me to see this one and being blown away .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of course , Wolfman being blown apart by dynamite ( correct me if I 'm wrong ) remains a high point - I can still see those bloody stumps in my head and remember thinking \" man , this is hardcore \" .I think I caught up with the Squad again on home video ( which in those days was like a year after the theatrical release ) and , if memory serves , it had already started to diminish for me even at that age .Caveat ?The film was written by the amazing Shane Black , so maybe it 's a treasure trove of stuff that initially flew over my head that I 'd really respond to now .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "but I 'm scared .What are some films you 're scared to revisit out of fear that they 'll suck ?I 'm not saying the movies are bad , I 'm saying I 'm afraid that they might be even though I loved them as a kid .Have n't seem them in a while .Whatsamovie .All of these movies are still good in my book .I wonder what current movies people will look back at 20 years from now and wonder the same thing .Krug09 .Before i get heat for this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie is so over the top and cartoonish for its own good .Its still a good movie but i do n't remember it being stupid .Aaron Emery .I with you there .I liked it quite a bit when it came out but it definitely does n't hold up to a second viewing .It also does n't help new viewers by being known as a \" twist film \" because knowing that ahead of time makes the twist obvious from the start .Danny - E .When I was a kid I watched \" THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN \" and thought it was so scary and good .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Seal_Clubber .Hellraiser and Children of the Corn .Hellraiser still holds up after all these years thanks to the work of Doug Bradly .I would go as far to say that Hellraiser 2 enhanced the formula and made some very interesting and strong headways into the lore .When I was a kid I loved the ABC miniseries It .The acting by Tim Curry astounded and terrified me at the same time .It was even to the point I was afraid to wake up , open my door , and go to the bathroom because I was certain he was going to be there just waiting for me ( I was 7 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I read the book .Yeah ... that miniseries sucks now .dr.lamb .The miniseries is rather bad , especially part two , only Tim Curry 's performance still holds up .But at that time it was LEGEND among us kids (: .Joe - Banger .How about The Frighteners starring Micheal J. fox ?Wait that film already sucked did'nt it ?Rops .You take that back !The Frighteners is great . huntermc .The Frighteners was amazing !dr.lamb .I was a bit disappointed about \" The Omen 2 \" when I saw it again after nearly 20 years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Doornail12 .Maybe Rawhead Rex ...I bet the rubber suit does n't hold up .Event Horizon was that movie for me , when I was a kid , that absolutely terrified me and my best friend .We did the old VHS switcheroo , where we took the tape out of the box at a local video store and put it into a different box to bypass the parental units .We grew up in a small town and the video store clerk never checked anything , he just scanned the barcode on the box itself .So , we watched it late at night , freaked out , and thought it was the scariest film ever .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I had such fond memories of being terrified and it 's just not there .I still enjoy aspects of the film , but the awesome pedestal I had it on as far as a childhood memory has quickly evaporated .The one that still holds up for me , though , in terms of being a highlight of my youth and still fascinates me beyond words , is Big Trouble in Little China .I swear , that one gets better with age !deadsnow07 .The Dark Crystal & Black Sabbath for me .ThunderDragoon .Wow , got ta agree with The Dark Crystal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Oh my gosh , it was terrible !Mikieblade .I do n't know , I picked up The Dark Crystal on Blu - Ray and I think it was still awesome .They did a really good job transferring it .Wolf - man .Fright Night 2 is terrible .Do n't bother re - watching it .It was a sad attempt to cash in on the success of the first one .The first one is classic and should stay a single movie .I thought the remake was only ok but it was better than the crap that is Fright Night Part II .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It really holds up , even today .It has great practical effect and a really fun cast .It does depend if you like that kind of film .If you like 80 's \" kid 's go on an adventure \" films then you will like this .It 's basically a Horror version of The Goonies .Also it has one of the best Dracula performances since Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee .Kingdom of the Spiders is one for me .A little bit at least .I remember it being really great as a little kid then I bought the dvd when it came out and while it was still fun , it really was n't all that great of a movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sadly , Puppet Master ( well , any of the classic Full Moon movies ) .I still love them to pieces , but I realized how boring they are to people who may have never seen them before .Trioxin83 .Lol not too long ago I bought the Puppet Master Collection ( all 9 movies ) at Walmart for $ 5 ..... worth it .Sirengx .I did too .It 's so worth it , I just wish it had Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys ( even though it was horribly bad ) .Sirengx .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I remember that movie being really creepy , but I watched it recently again and it kind of sucked . diapers .I just rewatched that as well .I had forgotten how much of a \" buddy movie \" it is .I also like how there is absolutely no rhyme or reason as to why the alien keeps uttering the title line before he tentacles each victim in the brain .Trioxin83 .Do nt be scared to watch Monster Squad again .I just did a few months ago and I still loved it .It was awesome to relive those moments I loved as a kid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was thinking of watching it again because I probably have nt seen it in 20 years but I am afraid to lol .I learned recently that it 's a Troma movie ... .jchano123 .Silent hill .It 's not that old , but I saw it when I was around 10 .Skull - And - Crossbones .i remember seeing Halloween : Resurection shortly after it came out ( when it was first released on DVD ) and i remember really liking it .give me a break , i was only 17 or 18 haha . saw it again about , i do nt know , 7 years later and hated it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "the acting was atrocious .i remember there being some bad acting when i first saw it but not nearly as much as the last time i saw it .but this is a case where i m glad i watched it again because i 'd be embarrased running around saying i liked the movie .ThunderDragoon .I remember liking it when it first came out , too .Do n't know what the hell I was thinking !The mistakes we make when we 're younger ... lol .m - m - m - MONSTER_KILL .Most old Godzilla movies when watched in High def , sadly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was really sad , and as a result I try to avoid watching ANY Godzilla movie made before 1984 in HD .Zombie - Killa .This is going to sound realllly weird and awkward , but Congo ( 1995 ) scared the SHIT out of me , when I was a kid ! lol .It 's a movie about Gorillas that are supposed to be really smart , and they end up killing people , who are searching for some kind of rare diamond , or something like that .I think it 's based on a book .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Oh , and Bruce Campbell is in the movie , and to think , when I watched the movie as a kid , I had NO idea who he was , and I sure as hell did n't know about the Evil Dead films .lulz . diapers .Yeah , I rented Congo about ten years ago .I nearly set the tape on fire in protest .Zombie - Killa .LULZ !Grime .The House by the Cemetery and Dreamscape .Samhain2010 .The true test is to find a person that has not seen the movie , and then ask them what they think .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's not very good .I know that will break some hearts , but it is the truth .The effects were actually nice and the makeup in general was top notch , but the script and execution are a mess .MrBitchen .Treasure of the Four Crowns :/ . diapers .When I was a kid I owned a VHS copy of \" Madman \" .My friends and I watched it constantly , and we thought it was the shit .Then last year I watched it again , and BOY DOES IT SUCK !Especially the casio keyboard soundtrack .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just watched all the PSYCHOS again and I have to say I use to love all of them except for 3 , hated it .I really loved 4 back then .But now I think 1 - 3 are really really good and I think 4 is a disappointment now .Aaron Emery .That 's funny , when I was a yung jeezy I had them all on VHS .Part IV was my favorite , now I find it to be unbearable but love the other sequels .Aaron Emery .This one 's a tad embarrassing as it was only 6 years ago ; I really liked ' The Invasion ' ( Kidman , Craig ) the first time I saw it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Same thing happened with ' AVP : R ' , I enjoyed it now I ca n't even tell what 's going on .undertaker78 .Mine would be : 1 ) Shocker ( Kind of silly but still like it for its charm . ) 2 ) Black Roses ( Definitely an 80 's cheesefest . ) 3 ) House II ( I 've always had a soft spot for this even though I know its bad . ) 4 ) Cheerleader Camp ( I 'm embarrassed with how many times I 've seen this ) 5 ) Maximum Overdrive ( Who did n't love this when they were a kid ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "GothicGuido .Man I watched Monster Squad with my sister a while ago and I think it holds up today .Campy yeah and undeniably 80s lol but I thought it was great , the goonies with universal monsters basically .For me its not a horror movie , its dazed and confused lol .Everyone quotes that movie and stuff .When It came time to sit down and watch it with somebody else ( 21 at the time )I realized it 's god awful lol . joesey . joesey . ....so basically any movie with killer dolls or small puppet - looking things that were meant to be scary especially Critters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What 's the movie with Fred Savage ?Monsters under the bed ? ? used to love that shit when I was a kid .Speaking of Fred Savage , who remembers the wizard ? not horror bt when a kids movie is that awesome who cares .Horror & Nintendo , that 's my childhood right there . joesey .Little Monsters - his brother in real life played his little brother in the movie .Pali - Azzar .I 'll show my age here ....The original \" Invaders From Mars \" was my first time ever being scared by something on TV .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "First the parents get ' taken , ' then it 's the police , the girl down the street , it was truely frightening for this innocent child .The sand in the field , and that sound effect when it would open up .Then there was the ' brain ' onboard the spaceship , the operating table that would insert the mind control device .The flashbacks as the bomb ticker counted down , even the ' twist ' ending .Everything in that movie can give me chills just remembering when I saw it way back when .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A cheesy movie ?Maybe , but I still like it .big_daddy2323 .i remember seeing blade when i was 9 and it scared the shit out of me .So many parts of that movie stuck with me .I'll never forget that burned guy going nuts in the hospital , the really fat vampire , whistler getting tortured , and the heads exploding .i know that if i watch it now it wo nt be as good .i just hope the opening scene is as badass as i remember .LaughingMagician .Blade was the first horror comic done right as far as I 'm concerned ( and yes , have no fear !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I still watch it every once in a while whenever I 'm reminded of Constantine and the ridiculous weaponry or Swamp Thing in its campy glory .Blade successfully transitioned from the page to the screen with the horror aspect in tact ; they actually seem to have read the comic instead of just giving it what has come to be the dreaded comic book movie treatment that you witnessed in Blade Trinity .For me , one movie that scared the shit out of me as a kid was Leprechaun , and it still does ( and yes , I have been called Garth for this on numerous occasions ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "LaughingMagician .oh , and I ca n't leave out Hellgate !I do n't know who sharted that mess into existence , but they should pay restitution to the people that were duped into thinking it was a movie . redzombielove .Fright Night 2 and Monster Squad have aged a bit , though I still love them .FN2 was nowhere near as good as the first but I think it 's more endearing and entertaining than the remake .It sucked that they did n't bring back Evil Ed for it , and I think the script and direction was lacking ... it was n't terrible just could 've been so much better .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That irked me the most . huntermc .I know this is heresy , but I went back and watched the original Halloween recently and boy , it was kinda boring .This movie scared the shit out of me when I was a kid and I watched it at a friend 's house who had HBO .But watching it again now , not much really happens in the first 2/3 of the movie , just Michael ... driving around stalking Laurie in a stolen car ?Of course the last act set the tone for hundreds of knock offs that came later , but I 've been so conditioned on the MTV quick edit style of film making , that the slower deliberate pace of the 70 's movies is now hard to watch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
