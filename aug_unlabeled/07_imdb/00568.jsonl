{"text": "I 'm pretty certain that William Shakespeare never used the \" C \" word in his works ( and I do n't mean \" Chinese \" ) , but any adaptation by the people responsible for \" The Toxic Avenger \" is going to be twisted .When a classic tragedy is completely and utterly distorted beyond all belief ... ...you have now entered the Troma Zone .We all know that Ques and Capulets hate each other , much like the Hatfields and McCoys of American folklore .This is largely thanks to Cappy blackmailing Monty into relinquishing his share of a flourishing porn studio .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The two families take turns doing awful things to escalate the conflict , like tossing dead animals through each other 's windows , and events soon get out of hand .Want some examples ?Okay , not a problem .Sammy works himself into a frenzy ranting about his hatred for the Ques and their allies , then lays into a pair of nerds with his sock .No idea what they were doing at a grunge club , but being smacked with a sock full of quarters was the result .Meanwhile , Cappy displays his displeasure at Murray 's impromptu moonlight serenade by grabbing a crossbow !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Ah , a classic love story .You find the girl of your dreams , but she is an incestuous love slave .Plus your families are on opposite sides of a vicious gang war .Twisted , you people are twisted freaks !Perhaps the only troubling aspect of the movie is these two goofballs flinging Shakespearean prose at each other .Look into their eyes ; you can actually see the wheels turning as they recite lines .Not that anyone was getting an Oscar , but Cappy has some delightful quips at times .Just believe that finding any sort of acting award at Juliet 's house would prompt Federal investigation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And there are people dressed up like other Troma characters during the costume ball .If you noticed these little treats then you are a sick and twisted puppy .Well done .The lovers spark more than just their passions ; all heck breaks loose between the two factions .Fights , eyeballs being poked out , and beheadings are at an all time high .Cappy is furious with his dissenting concubine of a daughter , he will lose a billionaire stepson due to her change of heart .Really ugly stuff happens , that sees Tromeo hiding from the police for Tyrone Capulet 's slaying ( actually Trom just pushes the guy into traffic , chance took care of the rest ) and Juliet beaten into agreeing to marry London .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No faking death though , this elixir turns the girl into a ghastly hermaphrodite .The wealthy fianc\u00e9e is suitably discouraged and Cappy 's death means a happy ending for Tromeo and Juliet .Turns out they were brother and sister due to some adultery , but they always wanted a couple of six fingered children .Looking for most of this story in the original is a waste of time ; even by applying liberal interpretations of events the lesbian scenes are a mystery .And I tried to find them , believe me .Enjoy the movie for what it is , a twisted work of art from New Jersey .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Recent Troma fare like Tromeo and Juliet and Terror Firmer just prove to me that not all directors lose their fire when they get old .Lloyd Kaufman has been making sick little movies for thirty years , and he 's only getting more demented as time goes on .I tell you , I love that man .He is an inspiration to us all .For some reason , I can not bring myself to hate Troma flicks ! !I do try , believe me I do .... but in my efforts to find one I can truly hate of these offensive , disgusting , poorly scripted , visually nauseating , common sense defying , politically incorrect pieces of trash , I find my collection of this guilty pleasure growing larger by the month .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I love Loyd Kaufman and Michael Herz with all my twisted and perverted little heart ! ! !I rented this movie mainly for the alleged WESLEY WILLIS FIASCO SONG that was SUPPOSE D to be in the movie ( its in the soundtrack ) but got SO MUCH MORE .The intro by Lemmy was worth the price of rental , but the insane dialouge , lesbianism and funny masturbation scenes were over the top .I 've never been so impressed with a film , the pacing and every scene is great cept FU CHANG .Debbie Rochon rules .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
