{"text": "Reviews .Battleship Potemkin .Credits .What 's left to say about the cinematic monument that is Battleship Potemkin ?Its position in film history is assured and unchallenged , if only for the Odessa Steps sequence 's iconic demonstration of Eisenstein 's theories of montage , but I guess that most viewers respond to Potemkin with admiration rather than passion .But as effective as Eisenstein is at working his magic - meaning , when the stone lions leap to life through montage , I 'm ready to join the revolution - Potemkin is never able to move me at a deep emotional level .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps the problem here is the intellectual nature of Eisenstein 's filmmaking , the rather programmatic way he puts into effect certain ideas he has about cinema , above all his concept of dialectical montage arising from the \" collision \" of shots .( Still , the virtue of Potemkin is that it never runs to the simplistic contrasts like the attacked workers / slaughtered bull in Strike or Kerensky / the mechanical peacock in October . )David Thomson , for one , has based his own negative assessment of Eisenstein 's achievement at least partly on his declining influence on modern filmmaking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The faster cutting rates in modern Hollywood films have of course nothing in common with Eisenstein , being more a spin - off of TV commercials and music videos , and in any case having the intention of anaesthetising the audience into acquiescence rather than provoking them into changing the world .Still , there is one work of recent cinema that plays as an affirmation of Eisenteinian principles , and that is Godard 's monumental Histoire(s ) du cin\u00e9ma .Godard of course has always proclaimed a debt to Eisenstein , right back to his famous Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma article \" Montage mon beau souci \" , which title reappears as a refrain in Histoire(s ) itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even if Histoire(s ) stands out as a unique work in modern cinema , it 's at the same time a sign of how Eisenstein 's cinema still can have validity today .It 's not merely a historical artefact .The original plan of Eisenstein 's team was to produce an epic reconstruction of the 1905 revolution , the failed set of spontaneous uprisings that the Bolsheviks read as a precursor to the 1917 revolution .In retrospect , it 's fortunate that a lack of time forced Eisenstein to radically reduce the range of events being covered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Historical accuracy was hardly a central concern - this was after all a propaganda piece for the young Soviet state .On the other hand , it seems that the events portrayed in the film 's most famous ( and one of film history 's most famous ) sequences , the shooting down by Cossacks of unarmed citizens on the Odessa steps , never actually took place .Here , Eisenstein has created one sequence of events to represent a number of separate incidents that occurred all over Odessa where the Tsar 's troops clashed with and killed a large number of civilians .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( Even the revolution 's catalyst , the Bloody Sunday massacre outside the Winter Palace in St Petersburg , is omitted ) .This intense focus is then replicated in Potemkin 's structure : five chapters , each of which is narrowed down to one central issue of concern : .\" People and Worms \" The ordinary sailors on the Potemkin complain about the rotten meat that is fed to them . \"Drama on the Deck \" The attempted punishment - execution of a group of sailors turns into a general mutiny .\" The Dead Man Calls Out \" The body of the martyred Vakulinchuk is laid out on the Odessa waterfront , attracting the support of the townspeople . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In Potemkin Eisenstein was proclaiming a new kind of cinema , but this was not simply at the level of its editing style .New approaches to editing had been explored elsewhere .Eisenstein was creating something very different .An early intertitle proclaims the \" spirit of revolution \" in Russia , and then continues : \" The individual personality , having hardly had time to be conscious of itself , dissolved in the mass , and the mass itself became dissolved in the revolutionary \u00e9lan .\" On one level , the mass , the people swept up by this spirit of revolution , are the \" heroes \" of the film : the sailors of the Potemkin , the townspeople of Odessa , the fellow - sailors in the squadron .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Above all , there 's the figure of Vakulinchuk , the ordinary sailor who , in Eisenstein 's story of the mutiny , leads his fellow - sailors to revolt and whose death is the catalyst for the further events of the film .In one sense this is conventional dramatisation of a historical event , where the audience experiences that event through the perspective of and its identification with a central character .Yet \" character \" is hardly the right word to use here .There 's no depth to them , no psychology ; they 're \" types \" that represent nothing more than their surface appearance , their physical role in the revolutionary struggle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Each \" character \" in the story has already chosen sides , from the beginning either for or against the revolution , and Eisenstein has chosen his actors for the way the look of their face and body project that .The dynamism that Eisenstein 's editing style brings to Potemkin can still be felt today .Eisenstein builds up our understanding of a scene and leads us to an analysis of that scene through the way everything is broken down into an ever - varying series of individual shots .These shots may offer different perspectives , swinging between the points of view of oppressor and oppressed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Odessa Steps sequence is only the most famous example of a structural device that is repeated throughout the film .There 's a musical tempo to the structuring of the scenes , with the pace varying , slower for the introductions and scene - setting , increasingly faster in the cutting rhythm as the drama reaches one of its climaxes .Time in the Odessa Steps sequence is stretched out and slowed down to an unnaturalistic degree ( the Cossacks take an interminable time descending the stairs ! ) and yet at the same time , paradoxically , the sequence , with its rapidly edited - together shots , rushes to a conclusion almost too fast to fully comprehend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This makes the slower tempo of the Potemkin 's response , the slow turning of the gun turret before it fires on the Odessa military authorities ( and , through Eisenstein 's editing , famously awakening the sleeping lion statue ) , an appropriately deliberate one .I 've lost count of the number of times I 've seen Battleship Potemkin over the years ; familiarity with Eisenstein 's editing patterns probably does lessen the impact of those classic sequences as much as I still appreciate them .But what really struck me with this viewing ( particularly in a version that looks this good ) was the film 's less remarked - upon moments of moody lyricism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This occurs above all in the central section of the film where Vakulinchuk 's body is taken to Odessa to be laid out on the waterfront .Tisse 's camera highlights the sombre beauty and clean lines of the prow of the boat as it cuts into the wide , pure expanse of water , soon enveloped in wreaths of steam .There 's a real beauty to the view of the harbour from the angle of Vakulinchuk 's body , the criss - cross of sailboats passing over the ever - darkening water that is occasionally lit in patches by the light of the setting sun .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
