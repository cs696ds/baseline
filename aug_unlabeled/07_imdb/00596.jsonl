{"text": "Tag : movie .In a word , avoid .Unfortunately it 's a competently executed movie , at least as far as acting and cinematography - so sadly , I must break with etiquette and provide a synopsis .It 's the only way to explain how truly bad the movie is .Turner : Tails , then .But you get the idea ...Samuel L. Jackson .In a plane .And the plane is full of snakes .Ellis : So what 's it called ?Turner : No , it 's marketing genius .Nobody reads what it says on posters , we do n't need reviews , we do n't even need trailers - it 's , like , all there in the title .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On A Plane , man !Ellis : Wow .It 's almost Zen - like in its minimalism .So outline the plot for me .Turner : You 're still not getting it .I just did !It 's snakes ... on a plane .Obviously I 'll get a few of my friends to help pad it out to an hour and a half , but it 'll practically write itself .Ellis : OK , sounds good , get me a draft .Anything else ?Turner : There 's no telling where this baby could go .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Snakes On A Train .Snakes On A Bus .Snakes In A Restaurant .Snakes In A Goddamn Movie Theater , and we drop rubber snakes on the audience half way through !It 's fuckin ' genius , man !Ellis : Oh , yeah .I think I just creamed my pants .I 'm taking this to New Line , Emmerich will green light this faster than Terry Gilliam can blow a budget .Let 's do lunch next week .Constrictor gets into lifejacket , is worn around neck .Share : .My Netflix queue contains over a hundred items .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This was definitely the case for Timeline .I ca n't think why I would have put it in the queue ; I 'm not a big fan of anything mediaeval , I 'm not wild about director Richard Donner 's previous movies , and Michael Crichton has written some pretty cheesy SF .I certainly did n't pick it based on reviews .The movie got a complete critical savaging ; you 'd think it was Battlefield Earth 2 from some of the comments : . \"No film in recent memory has cried out this much to be mocked . \" \" Timeline may not be the dumbest movie to be released this year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" I find it interesting that there 's a massive disparity between the critics ' reviews , and the average rating given to the movie by ordinary people .I think the critics are way out of line on this one .If you want to see a really excruciatingly bad SF movie , one that 's so wildly implausible it makes Timeline look like an episode of Scientific American Frontiers , consider The Core .That stinking piece of cinematic excrement got way better reviews from the pro critics than Timeline , which tells me that there 's something seriously wrong with the critics ' sense of judgement .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "] There 's one criticism that leaps out as wildly inappropriate : .\" It looks like cheesy ' 60s television , with paper - thin characters and crummy special effects that would n't even have made it in the last season of Star Trek . \"-Stephen Whitty , NEWARK STAR - LEDGER .Since I 've had the benefit of watching the documentary extras on the DVD , I can reveal that there really were n't any special effects in the movie .They got the special effect of medieval trebuchets launching projectiles by actually building a bunch of full - size trebuchets and having them launch flaming projectiles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The people fighting in a burning smoke - filled courtyard ?Well , they set the courtyard on fire , then had a bunch of people fight .The metal swords ?Yes , they were made of aluminium , but they were still actual metal swords .And so on .Make no mistake , there are a lot of grounds for criticizing this movie ; but physical verisimilitude is n't one of them .Still , let 's get a few of the valid criticisms out of the way .First the plot .It 's easy to say that the foreshadowing is heavy - handed and the outcome predictable , so let 's put some numbers to it : I worked out the major plot twist and knew the basic outline of what was going to happen 12 minutes into the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Really , as far as the story goes there 's nothing you have n't seen in dozens of episodes of Star Trek - right down to the two red - shirted security officers who get killed almost immediately , and the anachronistic object found on an archeological dig .( At least this time it 's not someone 's head . )Then there 's the medicine .My history teacher ( yes , the one who 's now in jail ) always used to say that if you did travel back in time , the first thing you 'd notice would be the stench .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then there 's the language issue .The heroes take back a French guy to help them talk to the locals .The trouble is , we 're heading to the 1300s , when English looked like this : .Love is a gretter lawe , by my pan , Than may be yeve of any erthely man .And therfore positif lawe and swich decree Is broken al day for love in ech degree .A man moot nedes love , maugree his heed , He may nat fleen it , thogh he sholde be deed , Al be she mayde , or wydwe , or elles wyf .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'll let you extrapolate to French .Maybe you can piece together what most of the above is saying - but speak it ?With passably correct pronounciation , good enough to fool knights on the lookout for foreign spies ?I do n't think so .Yet nobody in this movie , whether English , French , Scottish or ( god help us ) American , has any significant trouble understanding anyone else 's accent or vocabulary .Which is a pity , because the situation could have been so much more tense and menacing if they had .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Finally , there 's the essential countdown to doom caused by technological limitation .You 've seen it in countless Bond movies ( and movies based on Michael Crichton stories ) , but let 's overlook the clich\u00e9 .Instead , let 's think about the fact that a team of half a dozen engineers somehow manage to rebuild a destroyed multi - million dollar computer - controlled time machine , one which it took years of research to construct .And they do it in under 5 hours .In reality , they 'd still be installing Windows XP Service Packs by the time everyone got permanently stranded in the past .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , some of it is pretty bad , but what do you expect ?It 's a Hollywood action movie .In the documentary , Richard Donner mentions that in Crichton 's book the technological detail and the characters arguing over what to do ran to around 100 pages , but that they managed to condense it down to 5 pages of movie script .Well , yes , I guess technically all the essential plot points were left intact , but ... .Enough negativity !Because if you can somehow look past all that , it 's really not that bad a movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The pacing is evenly fast , so you do n't get bored , and there are some satisfying moments .So in summary : it 's some painstaking attention to detail that really belonged in a better movie .Sadly , it was stuck into this overgrown B - movie instead .It 's an enjoyable but mindless couple of hours , basically a mid - point between The Messenger and Bill & Ted 's Excellent Adventure .And I promise you , it 's better than The Core .Share : .I thought at the time that that was pretty cool .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I got my answer .Amazon and Disney sent me an advance copy of the new remastered DVD release of Bambi to review .Yes , Bambi .I can only assume they did n't pick me based on what I 've reviewed in the past .Either that , or they noticed I 'd been browsing for books and movies about skunks , which would be worryingly efficient of them .Anyhow , I watched the movie and reviewed it .Hey , why not ?Ignoring the plot , the animation is beautiful , and I 'm a sucker for anything with a cute animated skunk in it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "How can I tell ?Well , Bambi is male .He 's referred to repeatedly as the new young Prince of the Forest right at the start of the movie .Bit of a giveaway , that .I know it 's crazy , but I kinda feel that movie reviewers ought to watch at least part of the movie .I can understand book reviewers not finding time to read the entire book in every case , but come on , how much effort is it to watch \" Bambi \" ?Meanwhile , I could get to like this Amazon reviews thing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
