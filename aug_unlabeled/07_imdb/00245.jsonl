{"text": "The BBC refused to show the film because it was \" too disturbing . \" Watkins went on to the influential but now little - seen mainstream film Privilege , about a rock star whose popularity turns him into a religious figure .But Punishment Park is , to say the least , a radical leap forward .The War Game remained banned in England for a long time and was eventually shown on American public television .But after being yanked from theaters after only a few days , Punishment Park has been screened only at a few film festivals and film studies classes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now it is on DVD .Synopsis : 1970 .With growing activist resistance to the Vietnam War , President Nixon activates provisions in the 1950 McCarran act and sets up detention centers for undesirables deemed a threat to national security .In California 's Mojave Desert , groups of dissidents are summarily convicted and given the choice of long prison terms or a 3-day ordeal in Punishment Park .While the tribunal starts to process a second group of belligerent , sullen detainees , the first group is sent on their 53-mile marathon across a desert where daytime temperatures soar over 100 degrees .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even before they begin , most of the detainees - draft evaders , political activists , protesters and a couple who attended a poetry reading - believe that the police will simply murder them under one pretext or another .Punishment Park is an angry scream of a movie that makes the ' reasonable ' stance of most modern activist films seem like soft soap .An old Cold War law basically legitimizes the formation of political concentration camps , and Watkins ' bitter film simply imagines what a political death camp , California - style , might be like .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We see the young policemen and National Guardsmen being over - prepared for the use of deadly force against people they are told are the scum of the earth and the enemies of their country .Already paranoid , the harrassed prisoners are given a two - hour head start for their goal , but are not told what the police will do to apprehend them beyond a vague statement that forceful resistance will be met with force .Watkins retains his preferred pseudo - docu format by having the camera represent the filmed record of a foreign television crew .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The handheld camera was more of a novelty in 1971 and surely added to the \" reality \" of the events in the desert chase .Things go wrong almost immediately .Several of the more cynical and rebellious dissenters refuse to play the game , hang back and murder the first pursuing officer , taking his pistol and rifle .Outraged , the police immediately decide that all of their prey have violated the game rules and that deadly force will be used .We never find out if this is an atypical ' run ' or if other groups of detainees are treated more fairly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are some brutal scenes , but strangely enough , the strongest violence is back in the trial tent where the next group is being ' arraigned ' without benefit of trial by jury .Watkins apparently first thought of doing a movie about the trial of the Chicago Seven , and the same kind of confrontational rhetoric is used here .The judges accuse and condemn each defendant of basically being what they are , unhappy malcontents .Those defendants that are genuine dissenters openly defy the tribunal with obscenities and counterthreats , and are beaten and gagged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A bitter female tribunal panelist is all too eager to see them all sent to \" the Park .The way it is mentioned , Punishment Park begins to seem like a Guantanamo Disneyland , a Gulag Magic Mountain .The judgments all seem pre - ordained .On their refreshment break , the judges voice their pride in saving the country from these destructive elements .They insist that their own children are \" under control , \" and have nothing in common with the radicals .Is Punishment Park credible ?That 's a tough call .Nixon could have invoked the power of the McCarren act , but would probably have been checked by congress and the Supreme Court , and perhaps even by the military .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Watkins pushes his metaphor just far enough to raise hackles and expose raw nerves .His film is not a fair look at anything - it 's meant to agitate .Watkins claims that his cast of non - professionals included some people ( not all ) playing that fully supported the rhetoric of their characters , judges , detainees and police as well .Much of the the \" script \" was unwritten and improvised .One police commander seems all too authentic when he proudly demonstrates the lethal utility of pistols and shotguns and voices his eagerness to deal out justice to the enemies of his country .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Those advocating its suppression would probably liken its effect to the act of yelling \" Fire ! \" in a crowded theater , and call it an irresponsible film likely to incite trouble .Watkins would doubtlessly argue that yelling \" Fire ! \" is the only responsible thing to do , if the theater is on fire and nobody listens to reason .Project X 's DVD of Punishment Park is at this point available only in Canada , through the Canadian Amazon .A company representative says it will soon be able to be ordered from diabolikDVD.com .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The government has barred many foreign pictures as propaganda but supposedly has no right to ban a domestic film - unless the Patriot Act now trumps the First Amendment .In the case of Punishment Park , the producers ran up against a stone wall in 1971 when trying to book the show into established theater chains .The assumption is that corporate chains would n't touch the subject matter with a ten - foot pole , but there 's no actual proof of a no - show conspiracy .The image quality is excellent , bright and colorful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The sound is also clear , making the removable English subs a necessity only for the hearing impaired .The extras on the disc range from a scholarly commentary to text essays and the original , unorthodox 1971 Press Kit .Filmmaker Watkins is present on camera for a half - hour ' introduction ' that is the star extra attraction .He uses prepared papers , as if he were a radical filmmaker reading a blunt statement written for his own arraignment at Punishment Park .He 's convinced that civil liberties are far more threatened now than they were in 1970 , and he impresses as a very serious , idealistic man .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Punishment Park is an artistic attempt to throw down a gauntlet , but it must be stressed that even now , 34 years later , not very many people have seen it .I suppose that conservatives would fear and loathe the film as pro - revolutionary propaganda , although only a couple of the detainees express sentiments of that kind .Most are just insolent , or silent pacifists looking for a way to personally get clear of the % $ # % war .I can also see anybody with a connection to the police or the military being bitterly offended by this portrayal of law enforcement officers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .A Horrible Way to Die reminded me , in many ways , of the French - Dutch film , Spoorloos ( or The Vanishing , to English audiences ) ; more character study than straight up horror film .Through its characters , it examines the means by which violence twines its way into the lives of many , connecting them in unexpected and often tragic ways .Sarah is a recovering alcoholic trying to move forward with her life , even beginning a new relationship with a fellow group member , the endearingly awkward Kevin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At times , the film seems to drag a little , but these slower moments are like troughs in an unsteady sea , luring the viewer into a false sense of security only to jar you with a swell of violence .Still , the violence is restrained .The terror here is psychological .Most violence is shown only after the fact in sudden , gory flashes that barely allow you to process what you 've seen .It 's an effective strategy that makes A Horrible Way to Die a more accessible film than the average slasher flick .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is true that the unsteady camera sometimes goes too far , dipping from stylish to annoying , but I personally found that the documentary look served to imbue the film with a stark , cold realism .The overworking of the camera 's focus ring , however , did often feel intrusive and could have been toned way down .Overall , I was impressed with writer Simon Barrett 's and director Adam Wingard 's film and look forward to seeing their latest , You 're Next .A Horrible Way to Die is an intelligent horror - thriller that successfully creates tension through tone and mood rather than violence and gore .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .The movie opens with a murder during the cold of fall .A man wakes up from dozing off in his car .He gets out and opens the trunk and removes a bound and gagged woman .He apologizes for having nodded off , assures her everything is going to be alright and then kills her .Note when he gets out of the car , the door does not chime , i.e. keys are out of the ignition , but then when he gets back in it chimes , i.e. keys are somehow in the ignition .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Is this by design a clue or stupidity on the director 's part ?We switch to a dowdy looking blond ( Amy Seimetz as Sarah ) is at an AA meeting .She is 3 months sober .Some guy hits on her and they go out , and we discover that alcoholics are socially inept .Meanwhile the subplot continues with a prisoner looking like Zach Garifalakis ( AJ Bowen as Garrick Turrell ) is being transferred in a police car under guard and carefully watched .Garrick espies a small screw rolling around on the floorboard ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Got the plot figured out yet ?But things are n't that simple .The mystery of the movie is what twist is this thing setting us up for ?There are clues along the way as things do n't fit .The car door chime was n't one of them , that was just poor editing .Clever ? yes .Entertaining ?Not really that powerful .The movie did n't feel like a slasher film .It felt more like a mystery or drama .The stabbings , wounds , and blood appeared realistic enough , which means bright red liquid does n't squirt 3 feet into the air .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The title of my review would be ' A Horrible Film to Watch ' .All I had to do now was sit through this direct to video dreck and then slap out a review .Problem is the movie was n't bad and I had to shelve my snarky review title .Sure it has problems but by and large I think it 's successful in achieving the director 's vision ( for better or for worse ) .The story basically follows two threads .First , we follow serial killer Garrick Turrell as he escapes police capture and resumes his killing spree .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This could have been handled in an eye rolling manner but I thought it was actually done quite well .AJ Bowen gives a pretty good performance as a self loathing killer .In fact I thought the casting overall was well done .The other storyline follows a pair of recovering alcoholics , Sarah and Kevin , who begin a relationship after they meet at an AA meeting .Based on the title I assumed that at some point Sarah , Kevin and Garrick would meet and someone , maybe everyone , would die horribly .It was n't something I looked forward to since the director did a good job of making Sarah and Kevin both believable and sympathetic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wo n't spill the beans on what happens but the ending was not as I predicted .So where does the movie go wrong ?The photography is vomit inducing .The camera pans in , the camera pans out , we get weird little cuts and sometimes it feels like the cameraman just sort of gently goes to sleep as the camera slowly falls away .Most scenes end with the camera losing focus causing me eyestrain .The romantic scenes were filmed through Christmas lights creating obnoxious light globes on the screen .I guess this is supposed to be some kind of voyeur cam as if the viewer is watching the events from a hidden location but my vision does n't constantly go out of focus and my head does n't shake like I 'm having an epileptic seizure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact it 's generally quite tame given the subject matter .If you can get past the horrible and amateurish camera work it 's actually an intriguing film with an unexpected and satisfying ending .Many of the scenes are presented out of chronological order which is somewhat confusing but works fairly well to keep the audience off balance .This is n't Silence of the Lambs quality stuff here but for a direct to video film it 's pretty good .Now if director Adam Wingard can just stop with the artsy film editing and camera work he might be able to make something suitable for the big screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then he breaks it . \"Um , no , that is not the plot of the movie .I am not sure why but I expected so much less from this movie when I popped it in my DVD player .I can not explain why I had this bias , but I did .I am very happy to say that this movie surprised me .I found it to be very engaging , different , disturbing and ( somewhat ) believable .In other words , I really liked it .To summarize the plot , Sarah ( Amy Seimetz ) is recently sober and has been attending AA meetings for about four months .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In her home group she meets Kevin ( Joe Swanberg ) and an awkward intimacy blooms between the two of them .Meanwhile , Garrick Turrell ( AJ Bowen ) is an extremely dangerous serial killer who has just escaped from prison and is on the run .As he eludes the authorities he begins killing again .Garrick 's goal is to go after Sarah ; she is both his ex - girlfriend and the one who turned him in .I do not want to minimize the plot , but this is basically the story .I am not attempting to belittle the story , but it is n't very complex .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The narrative is interwoven ; the present and former events are blended together .A perfect example of this is Sarah working and then going to AA meeting morphs to her being at home with Garrick .The movie is n't very linear .I actually find non - liner to be very refreshing , yet even I was befuddled at times .As for the violence , it is true dualism in the sense that it is subtle and graphic .Some of the killings are left to the imagination and others are a splatter fest .This is a movie making ruse I have n't seen before and I welcomed it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Amy Seimetz was very believable as the fragile woman with a damaged past .Sarah was a low key character but I had an investment in what happened to her .I have only seen AJ Bowen in \" House of the Devil \" ( which was a great horror flick ) but his performance in that film was a little one dimensional , good but one dimensional .In AHWTD Bowen 's acting was very , very layered which gave his antagonist depth .The pace of the movie is slow and at times it is like treacle dripping off a spoon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , I could see how it could turn some viewers off .There were a few scenes that I felt were a bit too winded .Nevertheless , the one aspect that really keeps this film from being a five star movie is the cinematography .There are more scenes that I can count where the camera goes out of focus for no apparent reason .In addition there are scenes where characters are talking and the camera just wanders off , drops up , drops down or all of the above .I am not sure if the camera man was somebody 's drunken uncle who begged for a job but it was very obnoxious .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yet what really seals the deal for this movie is the denouement , it blew me away .How the events all tied to together was marvelous and really set this movie apart from the mindless drones of modern horror cinema .I would strongly recommend this movie for the horror fan who wants a little drama and a little intelligence with their blood .Do n't be misled by A Horrible Way to Die 's misleading grindhouse - tastic title .Up until the film 's final minutes , there is but one onscreen death , and every Argento fan has seen much worse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is a slow - burn lead - up that takes two character threads and slowly brings them together into one of the most never - see - it - coming sequence of twists I 've ever seen .Up until then it 's not really a thrilling film , and actually seems to suffer from an identity crisis of sorts while leaving questions unanswered ( like \" how does seeing a screw on the floor of a police car equal an escape from custody ? \" ) in it 's push to get to the finale .But if you are a fan of serial killer films , I ca n't honestly say you should pass this one by .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A Horrible Way to Die is the story of two people .One , a notorious serial killer with a rabid online fan base , and the other an innocent woman trying to get her life together through Alcoholics Anonymous .While the killer evades police and racks up his body count while on the road , the woman begins a relatably awkward romance with a fellow recovering alcoholic .What these two stories have to do with one another , you will have to wait and see .The film takes it 's time slowly filling in backstory and details of the past using flashbacks , but once it gets there AHWTD really earns it 's stripes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This one is first and foremost about the characters , and the cast does an excellent job of portraying the vulnerability of it 's characters .In fact , at the Fantastic Fest film festival , this film earned not only a Best Screenplay award , but Best Actor and Actress awards as well .It 's not the scariest film or the goriest , but it is definitely different , and that scores a lot of points with me .In spite of the film 's uniqueness , AHWTD does n't always live up to it 's award - winning pedigree .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Second , a film should n't really feel as slow as this one at a mere 85 minutes .There 's a lot of character work that the actors should be commended for , but much of it is unnecessary to the story , such as the focus on AA .The climax is intense , delightfully ironic , completely surprising , and really makes this film .The ending is a little bit abrupt , but it certainly does it 's job of really changing the way you look at the killer .Serial killer fanatics should absolutely give this film a watch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hardcore horror fanatics looking for a cheap - thrill - a - minute with buckets of gore and girl - girl love scenes with hulking killers chasing stumbling teens around and/or spending minutes on end in graphic torture sequences should definitely give this one a pass .There is some genuine brutality here , but it is brief and never lingered on or glorified .Basically , if you 've got patience and an appreciation for the original , give this one a shot .I find it very sad that people nowadays can not enjoy a well thought out thought - provoking indie film and instead spend their time watching repetitive , overdone , glamorized Hollywood flicks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After watching this film and \" Pop Skull \" I believe Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett are quite the team .The scripting and plot are way out of mainstream and are extremely clever and original .I do not think everything is perfect about this movie ( hence one star knock off ) .For example the title is terrible .Extremely misleading and unoriginal compared to the originality of the film .The film also is n't a gore fest or torture porn yet is wildly disturbing and surprisingly realistic .The directing , as said before is outstanding and contrary to other reviews the acting is believable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The cinematography is terrible .It truly surprises me Wingard allowed it to be this way .Go into this film with an open mind as , chances are , it is n't what you 're expecting .This is a very good indie flick , enjoy it . nothing overly memorable either .It 's low - budget , and while the cast and crew do an admirable job of covering up most of the rough edges , the usual sub - par acting and middling plot are unshakable .The movie deals with a recently escaped serial killer on a quest to find his true love , with a trail of bodies left in his wake .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
