{"text": "Archive for July 13th , 2009 .I was minding my own business after coming home from a doctors appointment , and my girlfriend is watching The Rendering .It is one of those crappy chick flik dramas and stars Shannen Doherty .I mostly ignored it by surfing the web for info on the new Champions Online game and the upcoming Star Trek Online , but I was able to pick up a few key plot points .Shannen Doherty is a police sketch artist and she does a sketch of a serial rapist and it looks just like her husband .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It ends up that her husband was framed by some guy , I do n't know his name but we will call him Dick .Dick had attacked her in the past and had been sent to prison for whatever he did or tried to do to Shannen Doherty .I missed the beginning of the movie so I am not sure about exactly what happened in the past , but I do know Dick held a grudge against Shannen Doherty .Later I catch a detail where Dick convinces Shannen Doherty that he will promise to keep her husband safe in prison if she testifies at his parole hearing and he gets out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In shocking plot twist , it ends up that it was a mistake for her to trust the word of the guy who attacked her and framed her husband for crimes he did n't commit , but she does and Dick turns on her .Again , I missed how this criminal was able to arrange it , but he gets the guards to move a killer to Shannen Doherty 's husbands cell .The guard even gave an evil / maniacal laugh when putting the guy in the cell with her husband .But , miraculously when the rumble takes place , after lights out , her husband ended up killing the killer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Apparently she missed some details while I was critiquing the film , so she rewinds it and that 's when I realize this is n't live tv and she got sucked into a bad movie .Noooo .She recorded it on the DVR .Now , before we continue the review , lets get something straight , my girlfriend has a knack for hogging all the space on our DVR with cooking shows and crime dramas .It is usually so full there is no space to record what I want , even though I am supposedly the one that ca n't share , because I am an only child , but unlike me , my girlfriend , the eldest of five , has sharing mastered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , almost immediately , the police realize she was right about the plot to frame her husband , they arrest Dick and let her husband out of prison immediately .This time I did not miss how this happened , they just realized the dead guy in the cell was a murderer and that was all the proof they needed to let her husband go .How they caught Dick , I 'll never know .But you see cops bringing him in as they let out Shannen Dohertys husband .Fortunately this gives Dick the chance to practice his acting and make a menacing face at Shannen Doherty and her husband .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They then decide they are going on vacation because , \" they both deserve it after all that has happened .\" While the happy couple packs , we cut away to Dick in the back of a cop car , where he fakes a heart attack or something and one of the cops climbs in the back seat to help , without his gun drawn or his partner covering him .( The partner stays in the front passenger seat ) .Dick chokes the cop with hand cuffs and gets his gun .Now the partner gets on the radio and Dick shoots them both .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When she comes out her husband is gone and Dick left her a note on where to find them .She shows up , Dick tries to kill her .She fights with him and holds her own against a hardened criminal who was recently released from prison and only prevails when Dick accidentally hits his head on a nail sticking out of the wall and is killed .Shannen unties her husband , and as they walk off , she says , \" Lets go home .\" Neither of them looks even remotely upset or distressed or even relieved that they just got out of a life and death situation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In short , I think the writers , the directors , actors and even editors just gave up at the end of this film .So as a movie I give it one out of five stars .As a movie that is MS3TK - able , I give it four and a quarter stars , and a full five for the last ten minutes .I would say check it out , but really , I do n't know that it is a good idea .Somehow , around the time when Watchmen came out , I had a feeling we would see this sort of thing , but apparently , they have been doing this for a couple years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is just too deeply ingrained in the culture for someone not to give it a go .I have to comment that the Shadow Hare sounds like a dork .There is a certain quality to his voice that just screams , \" I am a big , giant nerd , \" and it was probably during a particularly harsh swirly in high school , that he decided to help protect the weak .Unfortunately , he does not appear to have realized that working out in a gym might be a good idea .Speaking of working out , I love the chubby guy in costume walking with him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I bet in their daily lives they are sweaty all the time , because they have their costumes on under their clothes so they are ready at a moments notice .Being a superhero can be kind of gross at times .As weird as this all is , they are not alone .There are do - gooder dorks like them all over the world , and they can all be found on the World Superhero Registry .Based on the entries , MySpace is also a great place to find a superhero .But , the supergeekery does not end there , there are villains too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
