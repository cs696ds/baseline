{"text": "Check Out My Chuck Norris Style , Sexy Violent Vigilante Action Film Trailer !Chuck Norris Vs David Carradine Climactic Final Fight - Lone Wolf McQuade Knowing that Lone Wolf McQuade casts Chuck Norris as a Texas Ranger , one might be inclined to think that this was a preview of his later Walker , Texas Ranger series .But one would be sadly mistaken .McQuade is far from the straight arrow that Cordell Walker was on television .He 's just not a people person which is why he likes to work without a partner .When one is forced on him in the person of Robert Beltran , he greets him with a weapon when Beltran goes to his house to wake him up for what the day might bring them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This was a worthy finish to a fantastic career by a first - rank filmmaker .--Tom Keogh --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title .Top Customer Reviews .This movie is hardcore John Wayne at his finest , and terribly authentic .The movie begins with Union Colonel Wayne nervous ( with good reason ) about a gold shipment during the latter stages of the civil war .He is only nervous about sending it through territory where he knows the famous 1stLouisiana Cavalry is lurking .What follows is absolutely the greatest train robbery in movie history in my opinion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then John Wayne picks up the chase .Great photography , and it posesses all the ear marks of a Wayne - Hawks western .The plot later in the movie follows along the same lines as previous Wayne - Hawks classics \" Rio Bravo \" and \" Eldorado \" .Do yourself a favor and add this one to your western collection .2 of 2 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I am a big John Wayne fan , and frankly , he is the only good thing about this movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When I decided to see this film , I had high hopes , but was sorely dissapointed .This is not one of Howard Hawkes ' best directorial efforts .The major problems with this film are two fold .One , the acting for many of the leads is painfully bad , and the script is absolutely unbelievable , even for a western .The dialogue is painful to listen to at times , and often seems forced .The fact that Jennifer O'Neil and Jorge Rivero can not act only makes it more painful .Even the great character actor Jack Elam is dissapointing in his role , since his over the top performance makes his character more suitable to a comedy than to a western that seems to want to be taken seriously .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This film is only bearable entertainment for the true John Wayne fan .I personally watched the whole film simply because I enjoy watching John Wayne perform .If you are not a big John Wayne fan , this film is a waste of time .6 of 7 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .OK , it 's not the best western ever produced .It 's more of a full color film in the style of the old Republic westerns of the 30s and 40s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "John Wayne is moving from leading man with love interest to lovable old coot .Jorge Rivera takes over as the hunk .This is early in his acting career and very early in his English , but he 's a doll to look at and OBTW , he does an outstanding leap over a fence .Christopher Mitchum looks very much like his father , and the chemistry between him and Wayne is similar to that of his father and Wayne ( see Bob in El Dorado and Chris later in Big Jake ) .This was Jennifer O'Neal 's first movie , and it shows .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Must have been because of the way Wayne himself was mentored in the 30s by John Ford , et . al .Watch his early work and see his own improvement .Sherry Lansing was sexy and later vengeful .In the latter role , she , too , chewed up the scenery .She could have had a respectable acting career , but chose to shatter the movie mogul glass ceiling instead , and more power to her .Then there 's the scene stealers .David Huddleston can steal one just by being in it .Victor French is both scary and a coward simultaneously , a hard combination , but he can certainly pull it off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And finally , Jack Elam was a scenery chewing , crazy eyed loonie , with some of the funniest lines in the whole movie .No , it 's not the best , but I like it .It will always be in my personal movie stash .4 of 5 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I 'm a die hard John Wayne and director Howard Hawkes fan .If you own Rio Bravo do n't waste you money on this one even in blu ray .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That one is five stars .If you 're a Robert Mitchum fan skip this and buy El Dorado ( 5 stars ) -- they 're the same movie w/ Robert Mitchum replacing Dean Martin .Luckily Ricky Nelson disappears since he was only added as box office attraction as a teen idol .Rio Lobo is a poor repeat of the first two films w/ only JW giving a decent performance .The rest of the cast is so memorable i forget who plays JW 's sidekick .Waste of time and money .Though cut from the same narrative cloth as \" Rio Bravo \" and \" El Dorado , \" Howard Hawks ' \" Rio Lobo \" ( 1970 ) remains a solid Western and a fitting end to the veteran director 's career .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
