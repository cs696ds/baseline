{"text": "Once the killing starts at the house they 're partying in they ... get this ... they LEAVE the house ! !Wow ; what a novel idea ! !As well as believable characters there is also really well placed humor here that never takes away from the horror and scares .You can tell Sabatella loves the genre by the way he places the humor .He 's not going for a horror - comedy ( thank god ) but is using humor in some places to alleviate some of the tension .And it works .In one scene the teens are rummaging through a bunch of old vinyl records and they come across a Tom Jones album .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Apparently he once caught his dad \" fucking his mom in the ass \" and Tom Jones was playing in the background and it traumatized the guy for life .It 's an extremely funny scene that lightened up the mood before the carnage ( re-)starts .The gore , as mentioned above , is very well done and the kills will remind you of some of the classic slashers from the 80 's .Jeremy Selenfriend did some great f / x work here , and there was n't a hint of CGI ( and if there was any CGI there was very little of it and it was well incorporated so it looked natural ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The f / x , done by Marcus Koch , Kristi Boul , and Mike Oliver , were incredibly juicy and extremely well executed .But I 'm getting ahead of myself .Let 's start with the plot : A group of 20-somethings break into an abandoned ( ! ! ) warehouse in order to throw a rave .These just are n't a bunch of punk kids though .Our group has done this many times before and you could even call them professionals at it .The \" leader \" Charlie ( Ashley Kay ) tries to run the show as a business and has the rest of the group setting up for the rave the minute they get there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I ca n't think of one time when I felt someone in the cast was overacting or pandering to the camera .The characters were also believable so you got pulled into the movie and were able to have a really great time .There were times when I felt the movie started dragging along but as quickly as I felt that way Davidson would grace the screen with a very messy and gory death .Overall I felt the movie could have shaved off about 10 minutes to tighten everything up and help the pace .Now lets get to the man of the hour .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nothing .Nada .We never know who they are , where they came from , why they 're killing ... nothing .I 'm assuming , by the title , that the old warehouse use to be a sweatshop that had horrible working conditions .But that 's a total guess .And the Beast 's weapon of choice ?An anvil attached to a long steel pipe .Yes you heard me ; an anvil attached to a steel pipe .Just wait until you see how he puts that thing to use .WOW .The gore is both fun and will make you flinch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We get a lot of crushed body parts , dismembered limbs , and very juicy gore scenes .You 'll love it .Overall this is an effective and fun old school slasher flick complete with an old school slasher .You 'll dig the kick ass soundtrack and the original score ( by Dwayne Cathey ) and incidental music ( by Shikhee ) .Even the soundtrack has an 80 's feel to it .Davidson does a great job with leaving the audience wanting more .I definitely wanna see the Beast revisited and find out SOMETHING about him ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
