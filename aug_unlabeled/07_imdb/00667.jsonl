{"text": "Mysjkin with Woody Allen .As close as she fears she 'll get to him !We 're getting to know the Film Experience community .Should this be a weekly feature ?Today we 're talking to Ann - Mari from Norway who goes by \" Mysjkin \" in the comments .Quick what 's the last movie you watched before I asked you to do this reader spotlight ?MYSJKIN : I finally got around to watching Let the Right One In after finally having read the book .As a librarian I am intrigued by how page translates to screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Let the Right One In was to me a really well judged adaptation , focusing on what I found to be the heart of the novel ; the relationship between Eli and Oscar and their fragile , violent and compelling coming - of - age .When did you start reading The Film Experience ?MYSJKIN :I discovered TFE back when IMDB had links to fun stuff at the bottom of their page and I clicked to read Unsung Heroes : The SFX of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , that being one of my favourite films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was so sad when IMDb stopped that link feature but I 'm glad you stayed - that was just before the site overhaul .MYSJKIN :I love the mix of old and new and the unabashed obsession with actresses and Oscar !All your contributors are excellent and reading the comments is highly enjoyable , that last bit is in itself a rare online treat .But most of all , it 's your writing , your warmth , wit and creativity that keeps bringing me back .Tusen takk !Do you remember your first movie ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was Pete 's Dragon .Whenever someone claims to have seen something weird , \" A dragon , a dragon , I swear I saw a dragon ! \" is the first thing that pops into my head .Let 's move on to more adult matters .Have you ever broken up with someone because of a movie ?Haha !Almost ...When I was 19 , my boyfriend of about a month wanted me to watch ' the best film he had EVER seen ' .It was Braveheart ...I had my first portent that it would'nt last right then and there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Not only is this a good , heartwarming film , but it also features yours truly as an extra !Yup , ( as you will see from the attached picture ) that 's the back of my head right there !I 'm only visible for a few seconds , but it was enough to secure the film an Oscar nomination ! ;D .Oh boy , Pete 's Dragon played throughout this one summer during my childhood and it was definitely an early obsession .Between that , Mary Poppins , Space Jam , and Who Framed Roger Rabbit ? , animation and live - action crossing paths never crossed my mind as wrong- just magical .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "through facebook shares , e - mails , subscribers , personal e - mail messages , a few i 've met in real life ( which is quite rare but i probably meet a few a year randomly -- usually at movie events ) .anyway ... this is a small effort to investigate who reads since otherwise it can feel like typing into the void ;) .He shot a few scenes of Vicky Cristina in Oviedo .I guess the City Hall decided to give him a huge thank u. Woody 's very popular in Barcelona too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Pete 's Dragon really is a gem !I 'm glad to hear that I 'm not the only one with fond memories :) .@brookesboy : Candle on the Water is one of my favourite songs and Helen sings it beautifully !Wonderful voice !It would have been in place when VCB was shot , so the film might be a \" thank you \" to Oviedo rather than the other way around :) .August are perhaps the two best Norwegian films ever made !Not perhaps , they ARE the two greatest norwegian films ever made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Norway has produced many great writers , playwrights , painters- but never a great , or even good , filmmaker .Denmark had Dreyer , has Trier .Sweden had Bergman , has Roy Andersson , Finland has Kaurism\u00e4ki .Now Norway has a Trier as well , and he 's a good one- and like von Trier in Denmark , who almost singlehandedly put Denmark back on the cinematic map 20 years after Dreyer 's death , Trier .NO is slowly but steadily putting Norway on the map .And now Trier is doing a film in the US , pretty exciting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
