{"text": "Generation Ex- .To judge from magazine covers , the American divorce rate is either a disaster for children or no problem at all .First came the famous \" Dan Quayle Was Right \" article in The Atlantic in 1993 , with a cover line that said divorce \" dramatically weakens and undermines our society . \" Then , in 1998 , Newsweek heralded The Nurture Assumption , whose author , Judith Rich Harris , argued that whether parents divorce makes little difference in children 's lives because genetics and peer groups determine their problems .This September , Time featured The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce , a book whose authors , psychologists Judith Wallerstein and Julia Lewis and journalist Sandra Blakeslee , brought the gloomy news that a majority of children of divorce still suffer twenty - five years later .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
