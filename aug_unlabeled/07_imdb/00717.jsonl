{"text": "That is because Earth to Echo is a mediocre amalgamation of the 80 's science fiction adventure story .The acting from our main cast is fine , but the script that they must bring to life is dead on arrival .There is a reason that Disney walked away from this project after its completion .It 's awful .Even if it did n't make the viewer feel as though they were on a badly synchronized virtual ride , the film would be a sad shadow of better films .Having read this I thought it was extremely informative .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
