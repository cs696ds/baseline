Parkinson .Richard B. Parkinson is a Professor of Egyptology at the University of Oxford , a fellow at The Queen 's College , and the former curator of the Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan at the British Museum .His scholarly interests focus on the interpretation of ancient Egyptian literature , especially the poetry of the classic age .In 2013 , Professor Parkinson agreed to include his landmark translation of The Tale of Sinuhe on Oxford Biblical Studies Online ( OBSO ) , making it available online for the first time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In an interview with OBSO editors below , Parkinson discusses the work that went into this scholarly endeavour , along with misconceptions about how ancient Egyptian literature relates to the genres of the Bible .The art of translating this work is a truly astonishing scholarly endeavor .It seems that , along with the linguistic differences , you were also dealing with the problem of fragmented and scattered documents .What were the biggest challenges with translating this text ?Richard B. Parkinson : The fragility of the manuscripts is astonishing , and I am always unnerved to remember that without one particular discovery made in Luxor in the 1830s we would lack the texts of some of the most famous works of Middle Kingdom Egypt .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thinking about the manuscripts in a very specific material way is something I personally find helpful in trying to imagine the sense of the original words .Poetry is by its very nature untranslatable , and such ancient works raise the difficult issue of how to balance the needs of literal and free translations .But I find the translations to be horrible failures ; I am always ashamed when I compare them with the poetry of the originals .These ancient works are written in a style that is so far removed from what the modern reader is used to seeing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Can you tell us a little about this unusual style ?What should a modern reader expect when engaging a text such as this ?RBP : The style is simply unfamiliar to people used to reading only Western prose , and its apparent strangeness tells us more about our expectations than about the poems themselves .I must admit I find reading Chinese or Arabic poetry in translation much more of a shock stylistically .For me , a key thing is to remain open to different possibilities in reading , and to try to understand the style in its own terms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The common assumption that the genres we are used to must be universal and somehow essential to human literature seems to me to be a sign of cultural arrogance .As E. M. Forster once commented : \" Always remember that the writer you are reading was once a living man , and that he is talking to you .This is the golden rule .\" Not just the style , but also the values embodied in these texts may strike a modern audience as alien .For example , The Tale of Sinuhe depicts the concept of love in what you call a \" didactic \" rather than a \" romantic \" way , with the emotion appearing mainly as a form of devotion to one 's ruler and country .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "How do these texts defy our expectations about storytelling and poetry ?RBP : The Tale of Sinuhe is a very good example of this issue .Most modern readers , as is obvious from modern film versions and modern retellings , tend to assume that Sinuhe was in love with the queen who features in the poem .Most modern heterosexual post - Romantic readers expect the most significant relationship in any text to be between the main man and the main woman .But of course not all readers are heterosexual , and certainly for the original audiences the key relationship was the \" homosocial \" one between Sinuhe and the king .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The conventions and expectations are different , and the words resonate very differently .For me , the iconic moment is when the queen sees her servant ( not lover ! )Sinuhe after many years ' absence : instead of reacting with joy and wonder ; she gives a \" very great cry \" of shock and horror .That reaction strikes me as recognisably human across the centuries and across all cultural differences .I am starting to prepare a commentary on Sinuhe , so this episode is very much on my mind at the moment , and will deliver my inaugural lecture on the queen 's cry .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
