{"text": "The entire production has this air of Ray Harryhausen without coming on too strong .Very enjoyable stuff .Fantasy at its best ! \" -- Wildside Cinema .Attention Hollywood : MORE DUNE BUGGIES !Top Customer Reviews .Lots of movies have been made in that style .Not on par with Indiana Jones , but compares to the Mummie .Not the best acting , but tolerable .The whole idea of the film could have been better exploited , more spectacular .Picture was good on blu - ray .I think that the movie Stargate was better than this one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Jeff Coatney and Kevin VanHook have written an intriguing , fresh , and \" factually \" based story .I certainly do not know how they came to incorporate what they did , but in telling their story they actually do a very good job of \" getting it right . \" Demille 's \" The Ten Commandments \" was filmed at Nipomo Dunes ( now a National Natural Landmark ) , San Luis Obispo County , California ( near Pismo Beach ) , which is now an archaeological site ( officially called Ten Commandments Archeological Site ) .The film location was originally chosen because its immense sand dunes provided a superficial resemblance to the Egyptian desert .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The character of Im - La - Ra , the Left Hand of Set , appears from my research to be completely fictional .Regardless , it is clear that the \" avenging one , \" Im - La - Ra , is a manifestation ( i.e. , the \" left hand \" ) of Set , capable of using the powers of the desert and storms .[ I should point out that if you go to IMBd , this character is casted as Anubis Creature .While I have yet to clearly hear the name Anubis used in the film , it would not be impossible to understand , since Anubis was a jackal - headed god associated with mummification and the afterlife in Egyptian mythology .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like several other reviewers , I thought that the cast was wonderful .Dan Castellaneta ( famous as the voice of Homer Simpson ) was absolutely perfect as the lovable , but tyrannical Cecil B. DeMille , while Richard Kind ( of \" Mad About You \" fame ) gave a great cameo as Ira , DeMille 's accountant .The real treat , of course , was the chance to see 83 year old George Kennedy again , playing the \" pivotal \" role of the old John Tevis .It is also John 's father , Cully Tevis ( uncredited ; Anthony Reynolds ? ) , who , we find out through the course of the film , was responsible for integrating real Egyptian artifacts and \" magic \" into the production of the set , and helping to lock inside the set the \" god - creature \" Im - La - Ra .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The plot of \" Sands of Oblivion , \" then , is that Cecil B. DeMille has \" destroyed \" the set in a ploy to hide the fact that he was actually entrapping Im - La - Ra in one of the stages using an ancient curse .This fact is analogously presented in the scene where young John Tevis is burying a \" treasure \" box / time box .The key here is that the box contains the same Amulet of Ra used by the ancient Egyptians to originally entrap Im - La - Ra .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of the \" artifacts \" they discovered and brought back was the Amulet of Ra , which , of course , they did not know was for .While burying his box , John uncovers a \" prop , \" the Amulet of Ra ( dropped by a set guard just before he was killed ) , which he adds to the box .\" The gist of this action is that this was really what kept Im - La - Ra prisoner after the set was \" destroyed . \"Years later , when older John Tevis finds the box he had buried and opens it , the over - arching protection against Im - La - Ra is lifted , and Im - La - Ra tears off John 's arm ( which kills him ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you did not catch the point through the indirect dialogue , white phosphorous burns at an incredible intensity , and a box of them set off at the same time just might turn sand into glass just like a lightning strike can do .The use of WP to stop the \" creature \" was very inventive -- even if the shot of the LAW missile showed it missing the box of WP by an easy 10 feet !If this review was not helpful to you , I would appreciate learning the reason(s ) so I can improve my reviews .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , if you only disagree with my opinion , could you please say so in the comments and not indicate that the review was not helpful .Thanks .While this movie suffers from the usual low budget for visual effects that plagues most of the movies offered by the Sci - fi channel , the story is actually fairly well - written and interesting , although it has a lot in common with the \" Mummy \" movies .The big bonus of this film is that we get to see Adam Baldwin amd Morena Baccarin playing husband and wife - a really strange pairing , for fans of Firefly , but one that works surprisingly well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This movie probably is n't for everybody , but if you love Jayne and Inara , it 's a must have .And in a sand covered nutshell , that would describe \" Sands of Oblivion \" .The actual plot is a little more complex , with the 1923 set for the Cecil B DeMille film being excavated before it washes away .George Kennedy stars as John Tevis , a dying grandfather to Jesse Carter , a young man who buried his treasure in the desert .Returning 80 years later to find his box , he and his grandson unleash the spirit of Ra and death !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Cecil B DeMille , the talented eccentric director is central to the set up .What seems to be just a movie set turns out to be filled with authentic Egyptian artifacts and the throne room , a prison for the evil spirit that stalks the team of student archaeologists .The ' beast ' travels from hotel room to tomb , to storage area and threatens death .Dan Castellaneta portrays DeMille effectively , and gives the film a sense of mystery AND nostalgia .In terms of characters , Buford is a joy and is perfect for the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Too bad he did n't have more lines , or at least flip flops to wear while he dug through his garage .One of the best things about the film is that the factual evidence supports the tombs ' existence .Today , the sand dunes where the film was made in 1923 is littered with debris from the dynamited set .Unfortunately , the spirit of death does not walk here .Just tourists !As a film - maker and writer , Kevin Vanhook produces a thrilling film that runs just 30 seconds too long !Sure , the ex - soldier may be testosterone filled , but cut the last scene !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Um ... wait .... that CGI is really terrible .Whoa , Egyptian curse !But the CGI is just TERRIBLE .And the sets are awful .And it 's all low - budget , but well - lit .That 's a bad , bad combo .Deliberately bad ?This movie is frankly terrible beyond words .On the other hand , it 's chock full of cliches and Hollywood mythology and looks like it was excellent fun to make .This might be the sort of bad little gem that actors put on at parties to laugh over ; it looks like something deliberately done for schlock effect .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I know !It sucks .But ...I still sort of like it anyways .Oh , wow .There 's a scene in Sands of Oblivion that actually made me gasp .There 's a decapitation scene , with the usual tremendously bad special effects you expect in any Sci - FI Channel Original Movie ( and , for that matter , any movie written by Kevin Van Hook ) .Business as usual .Until the camera focuses for a few seconds on the decapitated head .I actually said out loud ( in an empty house ) , \" my god , am I really seeing that ? \" SO I hit rewind and watched it again , and I really was seeing it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I could n't help it -- I burst out laughing .It does me good to know that sometimes , the people making these movies take them about as seriously as the people who will ultimately end up watching them .Plot : Cecil B. DeMille 's filming of The Ten Commandments is plagued by problems caused by bootleg Egyptian artifacts , one of which houses a nasty spirit .After the filming is over , the crew bury the set in the desert .Eighty years later , an archaeological crew uncover the set and release the beast , which starts killing them off while looking for an Eye of Horus necklace that can protect against it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Which for any script written by Kevin Van Hook is a giant step forward .That , however , makes the second half of the film , which devolves into the usual idiocy one expects from a Kevin Van Hook joint , all the more disappointing .The first half has some half - decent acting and does its best to build suspense , but then we get right down into the effects - heavy unnecessary - plot - twists kind of thing that Van Hook does so well ( or so badly , depending on your point of view ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
