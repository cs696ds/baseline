{"text": "I 'll try to explain it in short : Story : Starts like a kind of gruesome murder accident anime where it looks as if humans are fragile as fuck and they break within the slightest accident .The accidents in this anime did not really impress me as they were n't really triggered by anything or follow up a chain reaction , something just breaks or someone falls and he / she dies .Why ?Well that 's kind of the mystery here .Probably the lamest ... read more .Accel world is a combination between what could have been a good plot , and screaming to become stronger .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
