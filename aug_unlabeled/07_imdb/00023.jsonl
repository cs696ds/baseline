{"text": "User Reviews .This movie is definitely something extremely different from any other horror anthology that I 've seen in a long time .A lot of really original stuff and some good scares from time to time .If you like genre bending stories then this is the movie for you . ...Expand .Extremely fresh on the scares , definitely scarier than most of the found footage films .Although the plot remains unexplained and the camera work is sloppy , the movie delivers for the horror fans .5.5/10 for me if judged fairly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No , it 's not different from any other horror anthology .The only satisfaction is that all the annoying hipster victims get deserving deaths .The VHS stylization is a welcome change , and the effects look decent enough to be believable , but the whole film approaches a campy horror film than a snuff film .V / H / S takes a completely different spin on the horror genre with multiple episodic plots loosely connected through the findings of VHS tapes .Though extremely dated , even for its release date I may add , the concept is refreshing in comparison to other \" found footage \" pieces of the past few years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Though extremely dated , even for its release date I may add , the concept is refreshing in comparison to other \" found footage \" pieces of the past few years .Though several of the episodic plots are legitimately scary , inventive , and suspenseful , others seem to be thrown together to make V / H / S a feature length film .Had the plots connected in a more rewarding way , the main story line been explained more fully , and the question of \" why ? \" been addressed the film would succeed on all fronts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Unlike many horror flicks which spend the bulk of their running times in mundane establishing scenes , this one gets right down to business .There are some good laughs , and some truly gross and gory moments , along with some Paranormal Activity - esque jump - out - of - your - seat moments .The integration of sex is obviously nothing new to horror , but the recurrent sense of coercion makes the proceedings feel a bit more taboo & dangerous , which works with the rough and grimy feeling of the movie .I 'd recommend it to mainstream horror fans looking for something a little different . ...", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The story is really simple , it 's a group of guys who get hired by some unknown party to break into some old man 's house and retrieve a video .However , it 's not as easy as it seems since there are stacks of VHS tapes so they have to start watching them in order to find the right one but that 's not their only problem as something else lurks in the house .Before I say anything , none of these movies are ever boring .With that being said , some videos work better and are genuinely a lot creepier than the others .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I see what they writers were trying to do(a side note : each video had different writers and directors ) but it never came off as creepy or suspenseful , luckily it 's not long .The 3rd film is also not that scary , but it does have two generally creepy shots and I like how they actually made the camera a crucial part of the video .The 4th film is scarier than the 2nd and 3rd as it does provide a nice \" Boo \" moment or two but compared to the first and last film , it 's not as effective .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The first and last movies are so well done , beautifully told , and creepy that they make up for the lack of scare in the movies in between .The actual story itself is extremely creepy too , as once they break into the house you know they 're not alone .A lot of scary stuff happens in the breaks between each short film .In first and last film , the person either has the camera in their glasses or in their costume so they manage to avoid that pitfall .I 'm trying to avoid describing each film because it 's more fun when you do n't know much about a movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
