{"text": "He was making an effort to assimilate , as the other kids already knew the class routine .His mom said , \" I 'm sorry , he just does n't know anything yet , this is his first class , and his first lesson was just a few days ago . \"\" Do n't worry ! \" I said , smiling , \" We all start out that way here ! \"During today 's recital hour , a boy from our Pre - Twinkle class played a rhythm repeatedly on an open E - string along with the pianist playing \" Twinkle , \" in what had to be his first public appearance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then came a little girl who played a Suzuki Books 2 piece .Then Liz Arbus , the teacher who leads our group , announced that an alumnus of our Suzuki program would play for us .She played the Lalo Symphonie Espanol with accompanist Sharon Wu .Let 's just say , from the opening on , I was smiling , big time .If Suzuki programs are supposed to turn out amusical audioanimatronic robots , this program has failed miserably .She played with such musicality , solid technique and maturity , it was just thoroughly enjoyable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have only been with this group for five years , so I did n't see Jenni grow up , as her other teachers , Liz Arbus and currently , Cheryl Scheidemantle , have .But I could n't help imagining this lovely 18-year - old as a four - year - old girl , coming to class for the first time with a cardboard violin .His presence certainly inhabited this party , in the memories of people who were his former friends and students , in the spirit of the violinists who performed for the evening and even in a few of his possessions that were on hand .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I did not grow up listening to his music .My childhood teacher was accepted into Heifetz ' studio at USC and actually decided against taking from the master on the basis that Heifetz was more a performer than a teacher .So my first impression of Heifetz was of someone my trusted teacher avoided .Then I went to Indiana University , where my teacher , Henryk Kowalski , asked , \" Who is your favorite violinist ? \"Well , being a Colorado girl , I was true to both the Broncos football team and Eugene Fodor , our local hero , violinwise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "NO ! \" boomed Kowalski .\" That is not your favorite violinist !Your new favorite violinist is Heifetz !HEIFETZ ! \"So I got a few recordings .But I still did n't get it .The sound on the recordings was not like the pillow of sweetness one finds in many modern recordings , and I do have a bit of a sweet tooth .I was fond of his Sibelius , but I did not turn into a Heifetz nut .Then more recently I carpooled to a distant gig with cellist friend , Michael Masters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He has every recording ever made , and he knows them inside out , note for note .So during the course of several carpools , he played recordings of nearly every major concerto , plus many showpieces , rhapsodizing the entire time ... \"Listen to the way he does that ... that spiccato !And that turn of phrase , like it 's ironic .Then ah , up to this , and that run , that RUN ! \" You get the picture .I was seeing it now , and I was hearing it , too : Heifetz had an acute musical intelligence , and he had complete control , the kind of technique that no one but he has ever achieved .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So back to this lovely gathering Wednesday of people who knew him personally and professionally .The evening , and the entire concept of the \" Jascha Heifetz Society , \" was arranged by the elegant Claire Hodgkins , a violinist who was an assistant to Heifetz .During its five years of existence , the Jascha Heifetz Society has awarded 150 scholarships to young musicians , presented master classes with Ruggiero Ricci and Sherry Kloss and put on various recitals and educational forums .The birthday party included a recital by violinist Min - Jin Kym , who received the Society 's first - ever Heifetz Prize in 2004 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "About 50 people gathered in the cozy recital room at Benning Violins , with a 1946 picture of Jascha Heifetz sitting atop the grand piano , casting a contented expression over the events .Cellos hung along one wall , with some 60 violins in rectangular cubbies along another .Behind the piano hung a large photo of violins drying in the sun , as if on a clothes line , over a tulip - lined garden path and among blooming trees , an old - world building in the background .For the occasion , Min - Jin played a range of works , from Bach and Beethoven to \" Meditation from Thais \" and \" March from ' The Love of Three Oranges ' \" on her 1697 Stradivarius .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Here she was , playing for some of the finest and most accomplished violinists in Los Angeles who personally knew Heifetz .No pressure !She played with poise and elegance , though I 'd be curious to see her play with her regular pianist , her sister Min - Jung Kym .Apparently she had not much rehearsal with pianist Mark Richman ( they both had been sick all week ) , and this made for some disconnect .Heir to Heifetz ?Well , those are big shoes .He is the one who blazed that trail .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She had some lovely moments in the Bach ( this was Heifetz 's arrangement for violin and piano -- I confess that I think the Bach stands alone better , call me old - fashioned ) and in the \" Habanera \" by Ravel .After Min - Jin played , Hodgkins introduced everyone to a 17-year - old violinist named Sean Lee , a current student of Ruggiero Ricci .Lee played Paganini Caprice 24 for us , then the Largo from Bach 's C major Sonata .What relaxed octaves he had , what a fluid left hand !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He had the manner and gait of a high school kid , but something very close to full maturity on the violin .To play Paganini is to challenge the technique , to play Bach is to challenge the mind , and he was up for both .I looked at his long red tie and black suit , just a tiny bit big on him , and thought , \" Looks like he will grow into this just fine ! \"The frosting on the cake was Bruce Dukov , who played his \" Happy Birthday \" variations duet with violinist Ron Folsom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The variations are extremely virtuosic , peppered all over with quotes from Wieniawski , Paganini , Bach and the like .Visually , they come off like a comic duel , with \" Happy Birthday \" so intertwined in the two parts that one ca n't tell who has the theme and when they switch off .The two also played Dukov 's new arrangement of \" Stars and Stripes Forever , \" which he has promised to tell me more about once he gets it up online .Dukov 's penchant for crafting delightful and virtuosic showpieces from familiar tunes recalls another facet of Heifetz ' legacy : that he created so many arrangements and transcriptions of pieces for violin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After all the violin playing came the champagne , chocolate , conversation and instrument ogling .A man named Kenway Lee had brought an old violin case of Heifetz ' , lined in light green and wearing the initials \" J H \" by its handle .Though he did not have Heifetz ' violin in the case , he did have Fritz Kreisler 's Hill bow , which I took in hand , wondering if a bit of magic might rub off .At one point , Hodgkins was showing one of Heifetz 's mutes , one he used himself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Min - Jin looked at it with some awe and asked , \" May I touch it ?\" I think that 's what we 'd all like to do , just touch a little bit of that magic .One thing is abundantly clear : his great legacy has reached around the world and touched us all , whether we know it or not .It will live on , through his students and their students , through his recordings , through his transcriptions , and through his sheer example .I discovered last night that adults crave educational concerts as much as children do , and this came as rather a surprise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We had played the same concert a few weeks back , for the Pasadena Symphony 's children 's educational program , and we thought it would be nice to air it out again .Last year we toured more than a dozen schools , playing for first- and second - graders , and our show was fun and successful .This year we wanted a new show , but we wanted to keep that balance of music , education and fun .We decided to write one about Mozart .We called it \" Maestro Incredible , \" and made Mozart the \" Superhero of Classical Music ! \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After starting by playing a bit from Divertimento K. 136 , we then tried to take them back to the time of Mozart .We said there was a lot less noise in 1756 .Then we said that all you could hear were horses and birds during Mozart 's time , for which we had a big red bird that makes very convincing North American chirping sounds when squeezed in the middle .They liked that silliness , and hopefully it made a point .We asked them if they 'd ever heard this : then we played the theme from the piano variations on \" Ah !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" It 's ' Twinkle , Twinkle Little Star ! ' \" Indeed , would a couple of Suzuki teachers ( both Marisa and I ! ) forget such a thing ?But Mozart 's variations are so beautifully elegant , I ca n't say the same for ... well , we need n't get into that ! \" Mozart 's superpower , \" I revealed , \" was that when he heard a song like that , he could turn it into this ! \" Then we launched into the next variation , which is a clever volley between right and left hand , or in our case , between first violin and viola .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After this , we played a bit more from the Divertimento and concluded with everyone 's favorite Eine Kleine .I noted that the performances of it may well number in the million , and possibly that each of us has played it that many times and yet we still love it .After the show , the children came up to the stage , along with the parents , to chat with us .They were so happy and appreciative .But what surprised me was that the adults talked about how much they craved this kind of an educational concert for themselves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Wow !Imagine this : educational outreach concerts for adults .I think some people miss the boat with classical music , then , sadly , they think they ca n't catch it .As teenagers , many ( most ? ) people are happy to listen to popular music , and its mostly uncomplicated and repetitive nature goes unnoticed .But as people get older , they crave something a little more sophisticated .Britney Spears just does n't cut it any more .They like the little snippets of classical music they hear , but they do n't know how to identify them , or find them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
