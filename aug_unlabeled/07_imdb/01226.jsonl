{"text": "Real Steel Movie Review .I liked the idea of a Rock Em Sock Em Robots movie- maybe one day we will get that movie because unfortunately though REAL STEEL features fighting robots , it 's much more a father / son movie than it is actually about fighting robots .I really had zero interest from the trailers to ever see the movie and I have to say that I 'm actually glad to have seen it- that has to say something about the film right ?I was entertained more often than not but I was really hoping for some more robot on robot throwdowns than I got .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A string of bad luck finds him struggling to pay people he owes money to and looking for parts to make a new fighting robot at the same time he is saddled with a kid , Max ( Dakota Goyo ) , that he does n't want .On a late night hunt for parts Max comes across the remains of an early model robot used mostly for sparring and brings it back to clean it up .Max convinces Charlie to enter it into some fight and gives it the name ATOM .After ATOM shows itself capable of taking a beating and winning some fights Charlie sees the bot as his ticket to finally making some money .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Based on the Richard Matheson story it definitely is not the Rock Em Sock Em Robots movie most thought it 'd be when it was announced and trailers emerged .The fighting scenes were a lot of fun though and if this movie inspires the Rock Em Sock Em Robots movie then I hope they takes some notes from the fighting scenes in REAL STEEL .The special effects used for the robots are actually pretty great- not quite photorealistic , but just seamless enough to not pull me out of the movie when on screen interacting with human characters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was convinced by the trailers that I was going to hate each and every story aspect in regards to Hugh Jackman 's character .Everything up until I finally started watching the film said it was going to be painfully generic and hokey but as it started unfolding I actually started to enjoy the dynamic between Charlie and Max .Jackman plays a character that is extremely selfish and has a one track mind and the things he says to his own flesh and blood are somewhat shocking .His transformation to a more likable father figure was believable and lends to how satisfying the conclusion is for me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For one the relationship between Jackman 's character and Evangeline Lilly 's character was n't entirely fleshed out thus somewhat meaningless and tacked on .When it is later revealed that ATOM has a shadow function and mimics everything the person in front of him is doing and there are some interesting things done with them , but dancing had equal parts goofy laughs and genuine charm .I also feel like there are some missed opportunities with certain characters as well as an interesting aspect of ATOM that kind of gets pushed under the rug .I would have liked to see more done with Anthony Mackie 's character mostly because he added quite a bit of fun in his stretches of the movie and he was quite good in the part .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The robot fighting is easily one of my favorite aspects in the movie and there are a few really fun scenes with the fights which just made me wish certain weaker elements had been scrapped for more extended fight sequences .REAL STEEL emerged as one of those pleasant surprises- a film I expected nothing from and ended up with an emotional resonance I was totally unprepared to experience .Jackman gives a pretty good performance as the jerk you love to hate but with a good guy underneath his rough exterior .The film is not without its flaws mostly in the unrealized depths with its central robot character and characters that I wish had had a bigger role .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Share this : .One Comment .Fabulous review !I was hooked on this movie when it hit theaters , I did n't think it was going to be good .I 've watched Real Steel a few times now , using my Blockbuster @Home service .I get access to an extensive library containing thousands of movies , TV shows and games .The DVDs by mail are convenient when I do n't feel like going out in traffic .While I wait for movies to arrive , I have the ability to stream to my iPad or TV .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It 's a pretty simple fix .Do you bring your kids to see PG-13 movies in the theater ?I think a family friendly track is lame .I have less problem with the language and more problem with the violence in the movie .I do n't get the point you 're making about me not watching PG13 films whenthe kids are in the room .Do n't get me wrong , I m not spoiling for an arguament , I just do n't know how you arrived at that statement from what I wrote .I may be especially slow today so the problem might be mine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then I 'll try to answer ?I do n't take my eldest daughter to 12A ( PG-13 ) films in theaters as they are that rating for a reason usually .In the home environemt however , if a more adult word or theme needs explanation , you can pause the film and attempt to explain it more readily than you can in a cinema .Plus the visuals and volume can be overwhelming to a 7 year old and that was my feeling when I first saw Avatar . 'There are moments ( the Thanator chase ) that would be too much for her ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The volume can be moderated but as I said in previous post , the swearing , when it occurs , does jump out of what is otherwise a family friendly film .I 'd have thought that given FOX would be trying to maximize the return on their investent , the language could have gone or been replaced with something else .The other thing that stands out is Sigourney Weavers character smoking .I think we 've grown accustomed to smoking being gradually erased from maintstreme film that when it crops up in one , it calls attention to itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Either way , I 'm not really advocating cleaned up audio tracks .I 'm just saying that as long as they do n't impact the final product adversly , what harm are they .All kids are different .Some are not affect by or copy bad language heard in films others do .If , as a parent , you have the option to let your kids see a film like Avatar without the swearing then I do n't think its a bad thing .My other point about the swearing is its often the element that puts otherwise PG rated action films out of the reach of children .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These are just random titles .With the latter , I never really understood why it had the recently restored bad language restored .It 's good to have full versions of films but why was the swearing in there in the first place .My view is that it did n't need to be cut out because it had no place in a kids film .A fact that most rating sysytems agreed with .Now I had n't seen Goonies for a long time and I thought my kids might like to see it .I found it cheap , they watched and enjoyed it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Make one or the other .Do n't faff around .Received ratings aside for a minute , I would say Goonies is bang on with a PG and as such , swearing , however mild should have been dealt with at the script stage .Avatar 's action scenes are a bit too intense for a some under 10 's I would have thought .But I know some friends 7 & 8 year olds that absolutely lap it up .They can deal with it and recognize it for what it is so I think broadly speaking Avatar should ( like Jurassic Park ) have been designed as a PG rated film with the inclusion of a clear parental advisory caution for intense action .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Someone obviously felt the swearing and smoking were integral to the story but there has obviously been enough feedback for Fox / Cameron to prep a clean track which should have told them something about the actual nature of the film they set out to make .My apologies as I 've rambled on and I 'm sure my point has been long lost amid repetion and waffling .If this comes across as ill thought out piddle then that is probably an acurate assesment .I disagree with family friendly tracks in principle , but IT IS OPTIONAL .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
