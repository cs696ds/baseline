{"text": "Film review : The Raven .posted at 8:01 am on April 28 , 2012 by Ed Morrissey .Edgar Allan Poe has reached the end of his literary and artistic rope - broke , alcoholic , and unable to sell even his literary criticisms any longer .The only hope he has in his life is his beloved , Emily Hamilton , who wants to marry him .When an evil lunatic begins re - enacting his most macabre stories in a series of murders and then abducts Emily , can Poe rise to the challenge , both as an investigator and a writer ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Poe was an American literary pioneer of the macabre , and his death was almost as mysterious as his fiction , some of which plays into the film .John Cusack is a capable leading man who gives a credible - if at times over - the - top - performance as Poe , as does Alice Eve as Emily and Brendan Gleeson as Emily 's wealthy father Captain Hamilton , who hates Poe .And yet one leaves the theater thinking that The Raven tries and fails to occupy the same space as Sherlock Holmes in the macabre , perhaps because it tries so hard to succeed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The resolution of the elaborate mystery does n't make a lot of sense in the end , nor do the interactions between some of the characters throughout .Captain Hamilton goes from wanting to kill Poe ( and not for entirely incomprehensible reasons ) to practically embracing him without the audience given much reason for the transformation over just a day or two .Luke Evans ' portrayal of Detective Fields seems pretty quick to discount the disreputable Poe as a suspect , and Evans himself gives an uncanny Clint Eastwood impersonation through most of the film , and that 's not a compliment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps it will be enough to convince moviegoers to purchase a Poe collection , or a worthy biography .( One of the victims in the film , with whom Poe had a bitter rivalry , actually outlived Poe in real life and wrote a horribly libelous but popular biography that concocted his supposed drug addictions . )Otherwise , The Raven might work for Cusack fans , but otherwise probably makes a better Netflix choice .The Raven has an R rating from the MPAA for graphic violence and \" grisly images , \" according to its IMDB listing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Why not just a straight - up , fairly factual biopic of Poe ?I suspect it 's because writing the script would take more literary talent than our Hollywood hacks have at their disposal .I 've loathed Cusack since before he started shooting his mouth off about conservatives .He , along with the equally egregious ( and 100X more pretentious ) Edward Norton are my least favorite \" name \" actors .Norton , to give credit where credit is due , has given a few decent performances ; Cusack , on the other hand , is always bland cheese .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is obvious to me that Cusack only got the role when Robert Downey Jr. turned it down .I suspect the script was written with RDJ in mind ; that marvelous actor 's well - documented troubles with drugs and alcohol would have added an extra dimension to the performance .Downey probably did n't want to repeat himself after the Sherlock Holmes reboot .Based on the trailer , The Raven looks to have great Gothic / Victorian atmosphere that avoids parody or cartoonishness .Cusack actually seems to be acting , which is a new approach for him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
