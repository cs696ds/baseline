{"text": "Pages .Wednesday , 14 August 2013 .I 've changed a lot since I first started this blog , but I still remember the events that made me create this .Originally , I hoped for this to be the kind of blog that I could share with my friends .That 's why in my first post I avoided outrightly mentioning Dev .Of course , I was quite bad at concealing my love for him , since he was the reason why I made this blog , so I quickly ended up deciding that this would be just my blog .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Over the next few months it evolved into a place for my little ramblings and silliness , which is so much fun to look back now .I 've changed , and lately my eyes have been roving .Sure , an adorable laughing James Stewart adorns my iPod wallpaper and Leslie Howard rules my home screen , but I can never forget Dev .He was the first person I ever allowed myself to fall in love with , and that I did , hard .Everyone has these other guys who are amazing too , but for me , there 's only one king of my heart .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He has given me so much happiness , so many late nights , and god , do I love him .But of course , I did n't make this post just for that .I 've seen all these great blogs , and all of them just ended abruptly .Just a post , and nothing after that .So this is a sorta \" auld lang syne \" thing .A farewell post .Now , that 's not to say I will never , ever post on here - who knows ?Maybe I will .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's just not right , for a blog which enshrines and keeps all my happy memories of those 2011 afternoons , those lazy days , which are now gone with the wind .Monday , 23 April 2012 .SERIOUSLY .Seriously , seriously , maar daala .No , it 's not Dev 's dialogue from Nau Do Gyarah , but ! hfjdskl KA , J DWKSG TGFMB FN CGIH;LBT , GFK , LG NGLHJL GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGFKY . -lying dead on floor- .No .No .No .Nahin .Nahin .Nahiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin .Long story short , my English teacher gives us compositions to write , with a given theme and all that stuff .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't overdo the masala and all that , but I did it twice this year .And my teacher liked them so much ... .The first one 's theme was , \" write about a time when you felt powerless to stop something \" .I got an idea .Tere Ghar Ke Samne ? :DSo I did write about that , but I had to leave out the EPIC ROMANCE !I know , it was really bad .I did n't take the POV of Rakesh or Sulekha , ( I was afraid of going out of character and ruining it completely - besides , I ca n't describe Dev .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I feel embarassed to go further .Long story short , I BUTCHERED the ending ( I took Padosan 's ending .Please do n't kill me . ) , left out the epic romance ( No mention of Qutub Minar !I feel so bad ! ) , and did n't even get to the main point .I had only an hour to write the story , so yeah .:PAfter that , I felt so bad , so bad , SO BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD .-cries- .Now , I have no idea how and why my teacher liked it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "-CRIES- HOW ...GOLDIE MUST BE STARING AT ME FROM UP THERE .Saturday , 24 March 2012 .Do n't worry , I have n't died .I have n't abandoned this either .I just started focusing on my new blog , Bombay Noir , which is hosted on Wordpress .I do n't know - I do n't think I can ever be the crazy Funtoosh who spazzed like heck over Dil Ka Bhanwar , or the one that wrote the sweet and childish descriptions for the YouTube videos .Ever since Dev was gone ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I try to pick fights with everyone there is , and Goldie and Rafi are like , \" No , stop it .\" I do n't know , I do n't feel as angry as before .I just want to cry all over again and rewind the clock to those days .I melted twice over the past month - not the insane four - minute melt , neither the two hour slow melt , but a mix of the two .I do n't spaz - I just become so absorbed in the song that anything else does n't matter anymore .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I decided to come back because this holds a lot of my c- .WHY IS THIS GUY 'S NAME HEMANT ?SERIOUSLY ?THAT IDIOT DIDN'T SING HAI APNA DIL TO AWAARA OR YAAD KIYA DIL NE .HE SOUNDS LIKE A CONSTIPATED IDIOT .WHAT A DUMB VOICE .AND YOU STEAL THE AWESOME SINGER 'S NAME TO TOP IT ALL OFF ._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm currently working on improving the Tere Ghar Ke Samne article on Wikipedia , so I was scouting around on Google for external links to add in .And I came across the Rotten Tomatoes thingy for it .Never mind the site , IT WAS LISTED AS 1951 .WOW WORLD , YOU FAIL .Everyone knows it 's a 1963 movie , that has been engraved in my mind too .1951 was when Baazi was released .Come on .He looks so different .And by then , Kalpana Kartik had already quit films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I demand to know why . xD .But the tantalizing dates ... they 're there all right , but I do n't know whether to trust them or not .Oh , and speaking of dates , I recently found out that Guide was released on 6 February 1965 .That was cool !Now , if it was on 9th February ...xDDDDDDD .Well , anyway , I 've improved on the plot , and also found a review that made me get hyper while the cold wind was blowing through the door .Yay for Dev .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Most satisfiying ...I think Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai and Solva Saal count for that .Dev bashing up the villian ?Oh yeah ! xD .Sunday , 5 February 2012 .Yeah , I made history with this movie .It was really a roller - coaster ride to seeing the movie - 3 days straight .I bought the 5 CD pack with Dev 's songs ( more on that later ) , so this was on disc 2 . \"Chupke Se Mile Pyaase Pyaase \" .I love this song . xD And the other one , \" Aye Kash Chalte Milke \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even though I think Tere Ghar Ke Samne is better .Anyway , I YouTubed it up , listened , then did the usual night routine .What I did out of the ordinary was ... well , there was the movie in the recommendations .With subbies .Now , you tell me , how do I resist that ? xDSo I watched it .What I DIDN'T expect , was ... .IT WAS SET IN SHIMLA .I THOUGHT THE 1940 COIN IN \" TERI DHOOM HAR KAHIN \" WAS BAD ENOUGH , BUT 1929 ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "LIKE WTF .GOLDIE TOLD ME TO CHILL .I COULDN'T CHILL . X_X HOW COULD I CHILL ?It bugged me throughout the whole movie , though .And Dev did n't have any costume changes .Any .He just took off his coat , and that was it .Except for the horrible looking jacket which scared me .Just use your Khoya Khoya Chand outfit , Dev , and we 'll all be happy .You did that in Nau Do Gyarah too , but your outfit was just EPIC there .Seriously , Dev .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His is orange .Yeah .My grandma has it .Ever since I started liking Dev , I wondered if they had one for him too .Yes , they did .I found out on the main page of webmallindia .You know ?They show it .So , I 've been wanting it ever since , and I got it , although a small voice within me told me to make the last disc vanish .I do n't want to scare the wits out of myself .I started with disc 2 , which covers the time from ' 56-'60 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": ":D I was introduced to Manzil in this CD too , and it was actually epic . xD .Looks like I 'm gon na go on a CD - listening spree .The booklet had B / W pictures too , but nothing too great .The only worthwhile one was from Tere Ghar Ke Samne .With the tie and all .It 's a classic shot .Why not other stuff , like this ?Goldie told me , I 've been getting preachy lately .Over old films and new ._ .Okay , fine , I do make some comparisons and all , but nothing like Dev 's rambling in the later years ( sorry ! )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Figured that since I can troll , I may as well put it to good use . xD .Why must actressees be so indecent nowadays ?I mean , come on , must you wear a bra and dance in songs ?Like what the hell ?_ .Back then , they were fully - clothed in plain saris , yet they were so beautiful and the chemistry was perfect .Yeah , like you need 50 - 60 people dancing behind in a song , in public .You 're supposed to romance the girls in private , not in front of the whole world !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And vulgar .God .Last time , they did n't even need to dance , except if it was an item number .Think Shree 420 .Or Jewel Thief .The quality of music .Back then , there were maestros like S.D. Burman , Shankar - Jaikishen and O.P. Nayyar .Now , what the hell has become of the music ?Crappy idiotic songs ?Lyrics that are so vulgar ?Go die in a hole , composers .Acting .Yeah , yeah , right , you need to be muscular to be an actor ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
