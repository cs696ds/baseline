{"text": "The \" Cyber - Horror Elite \" Present : THE HORROR CANON .Just when you thought the web was safe from horror snobbery , here I am back once again with another pontification from on high .Many of you , no doubt , remember how I gathered together a veritable \" Justice League \" of horror bloggers and writers on several occasions in the past and polled them on very relevant issues .The results included our \" Top 50 Horror Films of All Time \" and the first - ever Cyber Horror Awards , amongst other things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As an English Lit . major , I was very familiar with the concept of a \" canon\"--specifically , an agreed - upon collection of \" great works \" that should be read by every student / scholar .And so , I decided , why not take this concept and apply it to horror movies ?My plan was to create a list of absolutely indispensable horror films that every fan needs to have seen in order to consider themselves a proper horror geek .This is not to be confused with \" The Greatest of All Time \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Think of it this way : If someone came to you and said , \" I want to get into this whole horror thing , what movies do I need to see ? \"Which movies would you give them to watch ?In another scenario , let 's say aliens came down and asked you , \" What 's this horror movie business all about ? \" , what movies would you give them to take up in their ship ?Each participant provided me with their essential ten , and I tallied up all the votes using my byzantine points system , resulting in the rock - solid list of 35 which you will find below .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As was to be expected , there is a bit of overlap here between this and the \" Top 50 of All Time \" list .Specifically , the top two films are the same -- guess there 's just something about those two that seem to make just about everyone agree as to their greatness .However , I 'm struck by the amount of contemporary films on this list of 35 , much more than the Top 50 .There are a total of five films ( 1/7th of the list ) from the current decade , with the most recent of them being Orphan , still in theaters !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , the fact remains that no film in the top 15 of this list was made in the past 20 years , so let 's not break out the confetti just yet .I 'm impressed with the showing of Dracula , which scored a lot higher here than it did in the top 50 - -I think people recognize it as somewhat inferior overall to Frankenstein , yet nevertheless an extremely important film for any horror fan to see .I 'm also impressed by the amount of foreign films on the list -- a total of eight , or just under one quarter of the entire rundown .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's not only about the obvious choices , folks .I think the list is mostly spot on , though it does seem like Orphan and A Tale of Two Sister are a little out of place , considering American Werewolf in London is not present .And both Scream and Blair witch are strangely absent .... probably two of the most important horror movies of there time .It also would have been nice to see Candyman on the list over Saw .If Saw can make it on this list , then why not a Friday the 13 film , right ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's not as if either film has mad any impact with quality , at least the Friday films changed the game and influenced / created the standard for Slasher films in the 80 's .So there could be a few film swaps in my opinion .Six of my top ten essentials are in the top ten totals , so I am happy with the results .There were so many films that could have easily made it , and a lot of those are on this list .I like seeing The War of the Worlds , Zombie 2 , and Cannibal Holocaust on here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I look forward to what everyone else has to say about how the list turned out , and I am glad to have been a part in the decision - making process .I am reasonably geeky .I have n't seen the newer ones ( have n't been to a movie in a theatre in more than 2 years ) and that Italian cannibal one -- sheesh !Yes , my short term memory really is that bad right now .I am delighted ' A Tale of Two Sisters ' made the list !Sometimes the obscure gives you the pinch on the arse you most desire !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also ecstatic to see that a modern classic in my opinion LTROI made a good showing as well .Bravo !Nice to see that A Tale Of Two Sisters finally gains some recognition .But The Orphan ?Now I have n't seen it , but I 'm pretty sure there must be a few other movies that are more Must - see than that one ?Also how House On Haunted Hill can be above The Haunting is beyond me , one is superior to the other and it ai nt the Price version .Completely baffled by the absence of Scream and The Balir Witch Project too , regardless of what you think of them they were still the two biggest horror movies of the 90s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'd agree with Seth there about Ringu .Not only was it a staggeringly influential film , it was also a far better film than the remake .So much more subtle , slow burning and brooding than Verbinski 's brash , flashy and effects laden version .I guess I always find it depressing when a remake overshadows the original , and I think that 's part of the reason I find issue with remakes in general .However , it is interesting to see how this list has turned out , having contributed to it .The inclusion of A Tale of Two Sisters is excellent , which hopefully shows that it 's a film not in danger of being overshadowed by an inferior remake .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'd say Horror has seen a good few exceptional films lately , and that 's definitely an influence ( I know I could n't help but include Let The Right One In and Pan 's Labyrinth in my contribution ) .Considering Drag me to Hell , we 've seen an absolutely exceptional horror film that was a big success in the summer months , a time we 'd usually never see horror .I know myself that films like the above , along with others like [ Rec ] and Martyrs have been some of the best horrors I had seen in years , so I 'd certainly think things are looking up for fans of the genre .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps a suggestion for the next list ?I concur that Ringu should have made it up there instead of the re - make , but people know my feelings about Asian cinema western remakes vom !I has quite a few foreign language horror in my list including Wicked City an anime .Alas we must follow the formula in the interest of equality !I think this is a really diverse list of some classic films .I would have liked to have seen Friday the 13th on the list , possibly Re Animator and/or Basket Case as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Pretty cool though .I know that every list will have some choices that will be debated , but how Orpah made it in the list of these films is unbelievable .If ti was to have a killer - kid entry , there are much , much better ( Who Can Kill A Child ? )But how Orphan got on this list over a slew of other classics ( like AWiL as another poster stated ) sullies up what is otherwise a decent list of horror films .I applaud my horror cohorts who contributed ( and many thanks again to B - Sol for allowing us to also do so ) for including more modern films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Both have had a more lasting impact on me and in my guestimation , will in future years have a more lasting impact on the genre itself .As suggested , maybe we should do a list of best foreign horror ?And Cannibal Holocaust ?Holy jesus , I would only show that to someone who I would NOT want to be a true fan or neophyte of the genre .You have to have the right mindset ( and lack of stomach contents ) to watch that film .Its NOT something you go back to time and time again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is nothing intrinsically interesting about Blair Witch except that it was mainstream 's first exposure to v\u00e9rit\u00e9 - style horror .Holocaust covers this formula quite well already , and Blair Witch does n't bring much else to the table .Martyrs not being included on this list I can understand .As B - sol posed the question , what would you tell someone who asked you where to start , what would be a good introduction to horror .Films like The Shining or The Exorcist are fantastic starting points , but Martyrs would probably be far too heavy going .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It just left me staggered .But it 's not something I 'd use as a starting point . @B - Sol .Ok , must 've forgot about that one .How about something different ?Instead of tallying top tens , ask the Cyber - Horror elite to recommend one obscure horror film each , and write a paragraph about it .Try get more left of field , underground films out there .I 'd say everyone could bring something unique to the table .I can see that arguement In my humble opinion , I do think that Exorcist is just as heavy a film as Martyrs is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not too mention the topics of the film were completely unsettling ( especially to a mainstream audience which had never seen anything like it on the big screen ) .Martyrs struck me in a similar fashion in its heavy handed way of questioning religion .And that is why I would recommend it as a good starting point .To me , The Exorcist and Martyrs are great bookends in that one espouses the existence of the devil and the other god .Brilliant stuff !Full disclosure , this is the note I emailed with my list .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like The Vault on Facebook .Welcome to the Vault .... .I 've been fascinated with horror ever since my parents let me watch The Exorcist at 8 years old ( what were they thinking ? ? ) and I ran up to my bed screaming when Linda Blair 's eyes rolled into the back of her head .Although it often gets a bad rap from \" mainstream \" critics and audiences alike , horror has often been the most creative and vibrant movie genre of all , from Nosferatu to Saw .Some of the finest motion pictures ever made are part of the horror genre , including Frankenstein , Psycho , The Shining and my personal all - time favorite , George Romero 's Dawn of the Dead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Cliver , who plays Jeremy Taylor , wins by default because his daughter does n't want the cannibal to die , cause maybe she 's in love with him ?I do n't call that victory .That 's sort of a good way to sum this film up : nobody wins .This is truly The Searchers of giving up .Maybe the reason Franco phoned in his direction was because he had n't discovered a way to find the fun in the cannibal genre .His next film , while not measurably better , is definitely a return to form for our auteur .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Feedback Search -------------------- .Valentine was essentially self distributing this picture , and you could buy a DVD from him if you so inclined , and it was easy enough to find as the dude was posting on message boards to try and get the word out , again , ours included .The film was the first part of the Vomit Gore Trilogy and it did come to some notoriety upon its initial release .And then it more or less faded away only to resurface again when Valentine unleashed two sequels .Leave it to Unearthed Films to resurrect all three entries of this vile cinematic bile for a larger audience with this new DVD boxed set , now containing a bunch of extra features for those who just ca n't get enough .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I always wanted to become a ballerina when I grew up , instead I became a stripper . 'For those who have n't seen the movie , it essentially documents the life of a nineteen year old bulimic runaway named Angela Aberdeen ( sometimes porn actress Ameara Levay ) who becomes a stripper and then a hooker to support herself .As her life becomes more and more insane , so too does the film which eventually just becomes a barrage of surreal images bordering , no , surpassing what most would consider to be sensory overload .And lots of people puke - sometimes vomit , sometimes blood , but there 's quite a bit of it here , and some crazy gore and plenty of frequent and graphic nudity to boot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even by the standards of fringe cinema , however , Slaughtered Vomit Dolls is pretty out there .Cut with all the enthusiasm of an epileptic seizure , it 's a film that 's been put together with such manic ferocity that it is at times almost headache inducing .But there 's something going on here ( and hey wow , is that a Mario Bava reference ?Tell me you did n't see Blood And Black Lace before making this movie , you rascally Mr. Valentine ! ) - though just what exactly that is can be tough to say .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You would n't have thought the first movie needed a sequel but three years later that is exactly what we got with 2009 's follow up , ReGOREgitated Sacrifice , in which we once again catch up with the troubled Angela .More or less picking up where the first movie left off , she 's essentially cashed in her one way ticket to Hell and on her quasi - spiritual journey to the place way down below she meets up with two sexy twin demons .It all culminates in a sequence where one character takes out another using a hand saw and it 's shockingly realistic and plenty disturbing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Again , however , as it was in the first film so too is it this second go round - there 's some interesting cinematography here and some strange surrealist touches at work that blend certain arthouse aesthetics in with the harsh content .There 's definitely a noted improvement here in terms of flow , pacing , shot composition , lighting , angles and all the other things that go into making a good movie .There 's also a bit more of a point to some of it as plot points from the first film actually carry over fairly well into this sequel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Slow Torture Puke Chamber ( 2010 ) : .The third ( and final ? ) film in the trilogy takes some interesting twists as it introduces us to an alternate Angela character ( Hope Likens ) who eventually meets up with the original Angela ( Levay again ) as part of the ultimate plan that Satan has had for her all along .Going into plot details on this one is tough without heading right into spoiler territory but the film jumps along in the timeline of the story in some strange ways and the film actually tones things down in the gore and violence department .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What the film sheds in carnage , however , it more than makes up for in the bodily fluids / vomit area and in the graphic sex area , at times coming across as a twisted porno movie ( it comes dangerously close to hardcore at times ) .In terms of the performances , both Angela 's are well played here by Levay and Likens , two genuinely pretty women who allow themselves to be completely debased in this final part of the trilogy .Say what you will about the film 's content but the acting here is nothing is not brave and if everything is taken over the top , nothing feels out of place or out of context .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The three movies in this trilogy definitely succeed on that level , pushing the envelope in ways that a lot of more traditional horror fans will be incredibly put off by .This is n't the faux snuff type material that has been semi popular in underground horror circles for years , the kind shot fast and cheap on a handheld camcorder .No , this is far more polished and calculated than that , far more deliberately paced and surreal .It 's not going to appeal to everyone , in fact , it 's likely to appeal to very few but with that said Valentine deserves full marks for trying something new within the confines of a genre that relies on formula .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Video : .As far as the quality of the video goes , the movies were shot on video , the first two in fullframe and the third in 1.78.1 anamorphic widescreen , which is how they 're presented here on DVD .Considering the films ' low budget origins and shot on video roots , the picture quality on these DVD is actually pretty strong .The progressive scan image is as colorful as you 'd want and as detailed as the source material probably allows for .Some of the darker scenes do show some compression artifacts and it 's hard not to notice the macroblocking that appears in the picture , but there 's nothing in the way of dirt , debris or damage to note .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sound : .The Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo tracks for the three films are alright for what they are .This is n't are n't movies that need a big , booming surround mix and so the two channel party going on right here does just fine .Dialogue is easy enough to follow and understand and any level fluctuations appear to be intentional and somehow manage to add to the completely surreal vibes of the movies .Extras : .Writer / director Valentine offers up commentary tracks for all three films , joined by producer No Body on the second film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He occasionally comes off as nuts , and he occasionally comes off as well grounded and intelligent and more often than not it 's a mix of both .No Body offers a separate commentary on the first movie as well , talking about the production from a different point of view .If you want to know more about the movies , this is the way to go about doing that as the discussions do get pretty in - depth .Ameara is interviewed by the director in two separate featurettes entitled It Really Hurts To Laught and Self Inflicted , and the two , who were involved at the time , have an interesting dynamic here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's also a seventeen minute featurette on the disc called The History Of Vomit Gore in which Valentine serves as your own personal tour guide through the genre he basically created .Rounding out the extras on disc one are some still galleries , a collection of Production Notes , trailers for the first two movies in the series , animated menus and chapter stops .Disc two also features a making of documentary that , like the one on the first disc , features some on set footage and some insight from the cast and crew .Again , it offers us a look into what was going on during the production and what those involved in it were into .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Closing out the disc are a still gallery of Ameara 's Drawings , a still gallery , and the same trailers that were on the first disc .Menus and chapter stops are found here as well .The third disc includes an interview with Hope Likens in which she talks about playing her alternate Angela character in the movie and what it was like working with the other cast and crew members on the project .Ameara also gets an interview segment here that somehow winds up turning into an almost XXX rated watersports bit , playing it up for the camera .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's an interesting look at how the practical effects were done for the fetus scene at the end of the movie that 's pretty interesting as well as a look at Hope Likens eating crickets off of a cake .In the Ms. Lucy & Natas segment we get some more interview footage and clips of their work on the film that culminates in some graphic strap - on footage , and the disc closes off with Valentine reading some production notes , menus and chapter stops .If that were n't enough , there 's a forth disc of bonus material included here starting with Valentine 's short film A Perfect Child Of Satan for which we also get a commentary from the director and a lengthy behind the scenes documentary .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Final Thoughts : .As shocking and downright nasty as some of this stuff is , there 's more to the three movies that make up the Vomit Gore Trilogy than just vomiting and gore .There 's a fairly personal rumination on the effects of sexual abuse running throughout the movie and while you ca n't call them message films , these three pictures do a fairly impressive job of putting us in the fractured psyche of someone suffering from the after effects .Just be forewarned this is not material for the easily disturbed or the faint of heart .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Shock !Pop !He likes NYC a lot , even if it is expensive and loud .Horror movies are like kids in a way .Most are normal , but then there are a few that are just off the wall and insane .Er go , it 's only natural that the genre would have a few wacky ideas here and there .So in this article , we will explore those insane , utterly hilarious , and downright head scratching genre films .Films born from the most unexpected and out of left field concepts imaginable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is n't the first movie of it 's kind , by that I mean little people running amok on the lives of innocent people .We 've had \" Troll \" , \" Dolly Dearest \" , and the infamous \" Childs Play \" .However , this is the first ever movie where a mythical creature which represents good luck , and through pop culture , is shown in a kind spirited light , has been tuirned into a bloodthirsty , maniacal on screen villain .Then there s the fact that it 's a leprechaun .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Another thing about the film which was the total opposite of the pop culture view of a leprechaun , was that this particular leprechaun had rotted teeth , and sharp claws .Not to mention that he was as greedy as can be .I think it 's safe to say , had this leprechaun been in any Lucky Charms commercials , things might have turned out a bit differently for those pesky kids .Warwick Davises spot in horror movie history is forever rooted based solely on this movie . \"Leprechaun \" is the figurehead for out of left field ideas , that made for quite an entertaining film , atleast IMO .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It just goes to show how the genre has evolved .Amidst all of this though , is the downside .Which is that the first film spawned 5 sequels .Taking the character from the suburbs , to Vegas , to Space , and then to the ' Hood ' , twice .While the first film showed a nice flash of creativity , this goes to show how an odd idea can be taken way too far .The series should 've ended at 2 , and a character like this should never be taken into space .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Another film from the files of the strange and odd was a DTV film called \" Pinnocchios Revenge \" .With a title like this , one has to ask the question , revenge for what ?The film itself played out in typical killer marrionette fashion , but did show some signs of creativity and intrigue by throwing the viewer for one hell of a loop at the end .Sadly though , this film still does n't make the grade .Granted the idea was certainly weird , odd , and unique .But the film itself was lacking in many areas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm sure they had ideas of taking it to theatres , but when a film about Pinnocchio slaughtering people gets made , how much red tape would possibly prevent it from ever hitting theaters ?A whole damn lot most likely .Another film along these lines , and that stole from \" Leprechaun \" a bit , was \" Rumplestiltskin \" .This film involved an evil old troll like creature challenging a single mother for her child .Like \" Pinnocchios Revenge \" , it barely saw the light of day , went DTV , and did n't make any noise at all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A slew of other films have come out along the same lines , and seemingly trying to out do each other .We 've had \" Killer Tongue \" , about a woman who s tongue gets taken over by aliens , \" Killer Condom \" ( do n't ask ) , and \" Killer Eye \" .and Just when you thought things could n't get any more insane , a film in the mid 90s was released called \" Jack Frost \" .The Jack Frost everyone sings about , has never been seen before , so the idea of making a Jack Frost horror movie was kind of puzzling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The DTV film developed a tiny cult following surprisingly .People actually liked it despite it 's cheesey , absurd , and totally unrealistic villain .I even have to admit I found this movie entertaining .It had gruesome kills which are always a plus , and it also made horror movie history for having the first ever carrot - rape scene .The film was then followed up by a sequel , which you could tell even more than you could in part 1 , that it was made on a shoestring budget .The sequel added more comedy , but took the word unrealistic to frightening new heights .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
