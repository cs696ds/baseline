{"text": "A few nights ago , I was lucky enough to have caught a film just by chance .The Little Girl Who Lives Down The Lane is a 1976 thriller / drama starring Jodie Foster .While it ca n't be called a horror film , there are elements within it that bring to mind a few horror movies , namely Psycho , among others .I 'd never seen it , so thought I 'd watch a bit of it and see what it was like .I 've always enjoyed Jodie Foster 's acting , but for some reason she never comes to mind when people ask me my favorite actors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
