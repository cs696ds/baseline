{"text": "UGLY .Simply un - FABULOUS !But that does n't stop armies of 14-year old boys from wishing they could date a Japanese girl .Riiiiiight .Because 1)All anime otaku are 14-year - old boys , and 2)They all want to date someone who 's Japanese .Funny , anime never made me want to date a Japanese boy , just made me wanna date the anime characters .( because I 'm sure Japanese girls love knowing that when they 're making out with their boyfriend he 's imagining she 's the heroine of his favorite low - quality \" adult cartoon \" ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And stop acting like you actually care about how it makes women feel .And another thing , WHAT IS WITH THE BIG EYES !All the better to roll at your utter ignorance , desu .The women in animes pretty much always have only one of two cardboard personalities : The man - woman : A woman who acts like a male stereotype , and is able to beat up the male character in the show .Because being able to beat up a male automatically makes you \" mannish \" .Gee , you have insecurities about your um ... \"guy - thingy \" ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's right folks : Sailor Moon , Tokyo Mew Mew , Shugo Chara , hell , even some shonen leading ladies like Maka Albarn from Soul Eater and Moka Akashia from Rosario+Vampire ; they 're all a bunch of man - ladies cause they can all kick ass .Because real women ca n't kick ass .The girlie - girl : Most of the girls in anime take on this role .Frankly , I find it hard to imagine you know even half of what the girls in anime take on as a role .A women who is completely ditsy and retarded , DRINK ! yet drawn like a super model .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Do n't forget the green hair .What the hell do you have against green ? !And it 's not just green , either .Oh , and not merely girls in anime are capable of having wild hair color ; Yu - Gi - Oh , anyone ?Oh , did you hear that ?There 's only so much chauvinism that this guy can take in one sitting !Hm , nah , I 've read some of your other rants , this is rather hard to believe .There may also be other cardboard stereotypes animes employ , but I have n't seen enough of them to know .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" I have n't seen enough of them to know \" ?Then why exactly do you tout yourself as some anime \" expert \" in the first place ?Then again , it 's self - contradictions like this that inspired me to MST the hell out of you .Typical anime - girl with oddly colored hair and hideous clothing interacts with the show 's \" cute fuzzy thing \" .And frankly , I find that outfit to be kind of neat , as far as anime goes .It is .Yes , even MSI is legit , and I do n't even like them that much .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Believe it or not , I actually write poetry .but nowadays they just turn on the Cartoon Network Because all anime comes from Cartoon Network . and watch a ragtag team of 1-dimensional characters ride robots and fight predictable bad guys .I 'm not saying that people ca n't enjoy different forms of art .You just did .I 'm just saying that there should be a standard for what is considered art and what is n't .Like , artist who swallowed a tube of gouache and puked it up on a canvas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If anime is what is considered art these days Shakespeare must be rolling around in his grave .Fun fact everyone : A lot of the stuff in Shakespeare actually had a lot of sex jokes in it .Like \" Villain , I have done thy mother \" .The animators of this show did n't take the time to draw this guy 's teeth .They just drew a big white rectangle instead .Also , note the floating eye brows , lack of a nose , and mouth half the size of his face .If each tooth were drawn individually , it would actually look like they were false teeth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lest their stupidity rub off on all you \" jenius folkz \" out there .When I see the Japanese culture spread to website design and so forth I begin to worry about the very state of our society .What the hell 's next , Africa becoming industrialized ? !Shortly after Anime hit the mainstream the hideous \" Matrix \" movies came out , which were basically anime storylines ( well , lack thereof ) done with real actors .Really ?Matrix was \" hideous\" ... hold on , there 's an anime out there of the Matrix ? !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then came Tamagotchi pets , the Pok\u00e9mon fiasco , You know Pokemon is an anime , right ? and \" anime emoticons \" ( like ^_^ and O.o ) in chat rooms and bulletin boards .You just ca n't win with this guy , can you ?The Japanese have already gotten everyone hooked on their high tech gadgets , now they are attempting to take over our entertainment industry as well !Because God forbid a nation should profit from a form of entertainment it markets to other nations .How dare Japan want to make money !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yeah , it 's all America 's fault .No scapegoat there .Seriously , a society full of morons is much worse than a few dead sailors .His actual words .And it was more than \" a few dead sailors \" Toobis , thousands died from that attack .But I guess it 's okay since they are n't Canadian like you .Bout time .Well , there it is , my first ever MST .Tell me what you think of this guy , point out a typo I made , whatever .Anyway , I hope you all enjoyed !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
