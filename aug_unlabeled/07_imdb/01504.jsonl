{"text": "Hamlet really does deserve such treatment : Some of the \" less important \" material that has been cut in other versions is in fact crucial .It is , for instance , common to remove or shorten much of the fourth act , when the protagonist himself is absent from the action , traveling to England with his turncoat buddies , Rosencrantz and Guildenstern .While the story may seem on hold with Hamlet missing , his prolonged absence -- roughly a half hour here -- is what gives his Act Five reappearance in the graveyard such power .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This flies in the face of the usual interpretations of their relationship , but at least it 's provocative .And it could be taken simply as Ophelia 's fantasy -- a consummation she devoutly wishes .But Gielgud , Mills , and Dench show up to no effect at all : Their casting was either the result of some kind of government senior - citizen make - work project or Branagh coveting the imprimatur granted by having the greatest living Shakespearean actors appear in his film , however briefly .A final cutaway during the \" Alas poor Yorick ! \" speech provokes as much unintentional laughter as Lemmon 's arrival : Branagh shows us a flashback of the clownish Yorick , cavorting with an eight - year - old Hamlet ( played by some kid in a hideous blond fright wig ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Scenes that are usually played for maximum laughs -- such as Hamlet 's feigned madness before Ophelia -- are given far more emotional gravity .In his introduction of the Players ' performance , Hamlet is like a slick M.C. , driven increasingly manic by anxiety and anticipation .Jacobi is perfectly oily as Claudius , and Christie is quite perfect as Gertrude .But , outside of Branagh , it 's Winslet who leaves the strongest impression .Ophelia can sometimes come across as a pathetic wimp , but Winslet makes her deeply moving .Given the care that went into the production design and the promise of the opening shot , the visual style is disappointing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
