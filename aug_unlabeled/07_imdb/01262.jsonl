{"text": "Manoj Bajpai as Veerendra was a little too \" filmi villain \" for me .It was mostly his look that was a bit ridiculous and he had a few OTT moments .I think a better actor could have won the audience 's sympathy more at the end when I think we were meant to feel something for him .I was too distracted by his filmi moochie and straight from the 70s wardrobe to feel anything for him at that point .Nikhila Trikha is the debutante actress who plays the mother of the family .She was much better in the scenes where she was a young woman opposing her father 's political party than she was as the present day 50 - 60ish mother of Ajay , Arjun and Ranbir .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maybe it was because I could n't find anything sympathetic about her character at that point in the film .Any woman who allows herself to be controlled and then allows the same thing to happen to her children and lets them be raised to be what they become gets nothing but contempt from me .Finally , Nasserudin Shah .He has a very small role in the film but he made the most of it .He was wonderful for the few minutes he was onscreen and I wish he was in more films .So , Raajneeti is definitely worth seeing in my opinion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I , however , think that you 'll find this case study of the human hunger and quest for power compelling in and of itself .There is a lot packed into the last half of the film and I 've already heard some people say it gets too filmi but when you play as deep a game as these characters do , consequences are to be expected .What goes around comes around .This is why I call it Shakespearean in scale .It is a heightened version of life ... an absolute version , if you will .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
