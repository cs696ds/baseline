{"text": "# 8 : \" Sin City \" ( 2005 ) .One of the most uncompromising visions ever brought to screen ; Frank Miller 's and Robert Rodriguez 's \" Sin City \" blends classic noir motifs with state - of - the - art technology , creating a virtual cinematic comic book .The film 's visual style underscores its status as a noir film , using lighting to underline the difference between black and white in this stylized world .While its gratuitous violence and , shall we say ... underdeveloped ... female roles have made it a divisive film , you could just say this gives it an even closer relationship with its noir forbearers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With a gory murder representing each one , you 'll never forget the deadly sins again .David Fincher 's 1995 detective flick pairs young hothead Brad Pitt with Morgan Freeman , who - you guessed it - is days from retiring .Together , they tries to solve the maniacal Kevin Spacey 's master - plot to rid the world of evil ... by being ... evil .Though at its core is a formulaic whodunit ripped straight from a classic mystery novel , \" Se7en \" rejects the trope by giving us an ending no one expects .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Remaining true to the genre , but twisting its conventions just enough to be fascinating , \" Suspects \" is full of great writing , great performances and great surprises .# 5 : \" Brick \" ( 2005 ) .Of all the films on our list , none may be a more cut - and - dry homage to the work of early noir masters than \" Brick . \"However , the setting is a contemporary high school , where bullies take on the role of muscle ; popular kids , the role of social elites ; and outcasts play private eyes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "# 4 : \" L.A. Confidential \" ( 1997 ) .Each scene virtually dripping in style , Curtis Hanson 's late-'90s masterstroke pairs a handful of the generation 's best actors with a flawlessly executed script .In a world of corruption and deceit , even the heroes have villainous qualities , and by the end , the film expertly brings together seemingly disparate elements to build a cohesive story .Like all the films on our list , \" L.A. Confidential \" finds its roots in film noir , but it also transcends the genre to stand as its own striking achievement .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If the plot of a good noir is supposed to confuse the audience and distract them from the main point , then David Lynch is a true master of the genre .# 2 : \" Blade Runner \" ( 1982 ) .One of the greatest science fiction films of all time , Ridley Scott 's \" Blade Runner \" is essentially a film noir set in the future .As Harrison Ford 's Rick Deckard searches the deepest depths of a dystopian Los Angeles for the human - like robotic replicants , all the noir tropes are there : from stylized camera angles , to dark lighting , to Daryl Hannah as the ultimate femme fatal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lots and lots of rain .# 1 : \" Chinatown \" ( 1974 ) .It was directors like Howard Hawks and Billy Wilder who pioneered American film noir , but Polish director Roman Polanski helped perfect it .With a protagonist who 's at once a typical noir hero and an atypical one , \" Chinatown \" is a dark and cynical tale that 's shrouded in mystery .And every detail , from a glimmer in a pond to a face - plant into a steering wheel , helps lead to one of the most thrilling yet disturbing endings of all time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
