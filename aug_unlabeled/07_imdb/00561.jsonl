{"text": "Whoa yesterday was messed up !It started out pretty good .We sang \" Once Upon A December \" in choral and I adore that song .Then , I 'm told that my best friend is pissed at me and has told everyone else why .I had already known she was angry at me and that blew it up for me .We got into a huge arguement .It lasted all day .We finally both apologized at night though .And I saw The Klumps last night .It was so funny , I had forgotten how funny it was .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's one of my favourite animated movies of all time .The music is hauntingly beautiful , and the animation is quite nice !And the subject , based on the story of the daughter of the last Russian Czar , always interested me .The movie is so dream - like !Much lighter , obviously , than the real story , being a children 's movie , but I just love watching it !Except I did n't like how the bat could talk but the puppy could n't .Minor details .:DYeah , I justwanted to add that ... :) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Enjoyable nevertheless .The best and the worst thing about the film : the screenplay .Based on real - life events , it 's wants to be a mature film from time to time , but why did they had to add the Rasputin character and his side - kick Bartok ?It 's conflicting .Either do it good , try to make a real character driven animated film about real life events , but if you 're gon na use that kind of villian and sidekick , make a complete different film .The bat is to blame .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's not the best animated film I 've ever seen , but it 's certainly a good one .I do get a little nervous when they change things so much from history or classical myth , but as Anastasia is presented as an alternate history and a fantasy , it 's not as annoying as it might be given poorer handling of subject matter .The songs and score in this movie are fantastic , and there have n't been better songs in an animated film in the 6 - 7 years since .\" Once Upon A December \" is haunting and memorable , I could still clearly remember it having not seen the movie for 5 years . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are some really great scenes in this film , such as the opening , those three song sequences , and when Anastasia is reunited with her grandmother .The only thing that stops this movie from being truly great is that the script is extremely patchy .There are cheesy moments that make me cringe a little , and the comedy is for the most part not quite funny enough .The major script flaws do n't stop it from being a good movie though , and the animation is good enough to keep you watching through the poorly written parts ( which are n't in the majority , but are there ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What a legendary old crone .Bruce Almighty Jim Carrey is back to his antics , and this was a very fun movie .The laughs were frequent enough to keep me entertained and the quality of the film in general was good , about on par with Liar Liar , if not slightly better due to some cleverer writing .By the end of the film I actually really wanted Jim Carrey to end up with Jennifer Aniston .Aniston is slightly typecast in this role , but she is convincing nonetheless .She 's better as a lead actress as she can really sink into a character , as she does in The Good Girl .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I liked this movie but not enough to want to buy it on DVD .Great movie , I think I 'm on this cartoon kick lately .I bought about 5 cartoons in the past month , I 'm pretty picky , but I like this show .If you have n't seen it you should , good voices , Cusak , Ryan , Landsbury , and more .It 's about 7 - 8 years old , but its a classic in my book .THE LEGENDARY STORY OF THE DAUGHTER OF CZAR NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA IS AN UNUSUAL CHOICE FOR AN ANIMATED DISNEY FILM .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Any day I 'm sick or just feeling lousy , I pull out this movie .I love the songs , and usually sing along .Of course , after actually hearing what happened to Anastasia in real life , the movie was somewhat spoiled for me , but I still love to pull it out with a bowl of popcorn .I love this movie and I never get tired of it .I think it is such a sad story and I like thinking that Anastasia found her family and love again .I know that 's stupid but I do .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I love him .I 'm not a big John Cusak fan but his voice is so sexy in this .I love the charcater of Anastasia , i think that Meg Ryan did an awesome job .I just love this movie , what more is there to say ?Great music , characters , story and I cry every time that the grandmother finds Anastasia again .\" Once Upon a December \" Dancing bears , Painted wings , Things I almost remember , And a song someone sings Once upon a December .Someone holds me safe and warm .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I used to lie on that rug and oh how I missed you while you were away ... .This is a pretty decent animated telling of the missing Romanov princess story .The animation is very good as is the music .The voice work does well for the characters .The plot is interesting with a nice balance between the intense drama and the comic relief .It makes for a fun film to enjoy with the kids .It was my favorite ( not counting the Disney stuff of course cuz this is n't Disney ! ) animated movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have the soundtrack too and I can listen to it over and over again .It 's just THAT good !The voices of the characters were all done by famous people ...John Cusack was Dmitri , Angela Lansbery was the Empress , and last but not least , Anastasia herself was done by Meg Ryan .With an all - star cast like that , how can you go wrong ? ? ?I do n't have much to say except to tell you to go watch it !Plot / concept : 8 Screenplay / dialogue : 8 Acting : 8 My personal enjoyment : 9 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
