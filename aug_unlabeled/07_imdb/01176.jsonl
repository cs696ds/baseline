{"text": "There can be no conversation beyond the prevailing conversation .The echo chamber must be maintained .The \" No Girls Allowed \" sign must stay by the ladder to the treehouse .Boys will be boys .My friend Michael Carlisle had a great metacultural read on Kylo Ren in The Force Awakens following the film 's release , one shared by Damien Walter at The Independent .As a villain , Kylo Ren embodies all the worst male geek tendencies .Heck , Kylo Ren 's main adversaries are a woman and a person of color -- it 's a little too perfect , so much so that it had to be just a little bit intentional .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The thing is , there are models for better male geekdom in each of these films .Walter 's piece in The Independent is all about trying to find a better kind of geek masculinity in 2016 , one that 's less like Kylo Ren ( or Emo Kylo Ren ) or his PUA and MRA ilk .Poe and Finn seem like good guys , so maybe that 's a potential place to start the conversation of a healthier male geekdom .Angie Han at /Film had a great piece about heroic masculinity in Mad Max : Fury Road , and how Max and Nux embody better ways for men to be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is n't to say that you ca n't disagree with a feminist read or SJW interpretation of something you enjoy .I do n't agree with Anita Sarkeesian 's read of Mad Max : Fury Road , for instance , in which she says the movie glorifies violence and engages in the type of objectification it 's trying to critique .Violence is the only viable mode of discourse in Fury Road , and as in many great action movies , there winds up being a disjunction between the violence being aesthetically and viscerally awesome and the violence also having emotional stakes and tragic consequences .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Similarly , I think a disjunction necessarily has to exist with regard to Immortan Joe 's sexual slaves .Since they are on the one hand objectified while also asserting they are not things , the film plays with this tension of images and how they 're interpreted , and how competing and even paradoxical interpretations can exist simultaneously in the same image .While I disagree with Sarkeesian in this regard , that does n't mean I want her to stop engaging with culture .It 's the opposite , in fact .She 's got insight , she 's got opinions , and she should keep engaging with culture and the way culture manifests ideologies the way she does .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And just because I do n't agree does n't mean an opinion has no merit or value .Sarkeesian made me rethink some of my assessments of Fury Road and realize what else might be going on visually , and also made me think about how violence functions as rhetoric and discourse in different kinds of action movies .The point is that rather than trying to shutdown discussion or threatening someone because of matter of taste or opinion , we should get into discussions .Male geeks should n't be so frightened of new ideas , and we should n't be so insecure about our opinions changing or being malleable either .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
