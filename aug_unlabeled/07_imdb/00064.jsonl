{"text": "Noology : Time , Memory , Knowledge and Information Technology .Preview of Vol II of the Noology - Series .What is Noology ?The word Noology derives from the greek words \" noos \" or \" nous \" and \" logos \" .[ 1 ] The meaning of both is quite similar . \" Noos \" is a term roughly covering the semantic field of the present colloquial words : .The word \" logos \" has a very similar semantic field , but with a slight bent towards systematics and ordering .For this reason , all the names of present - day sciences are constructed by using some field indicator like \" psycho- \" with the appendage \" -logy \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "[ 3 ] The main aspect which distinguishes \" logos \" from \" noos \" is this admixture of \" ratio \" which also means proportion , measure .[ 4 ] That was between ca .500 BC and 300 BC .Noo - logy thus outlines a systematic study and ( attempt at ) organization of everything dealing with knowing and knowledge .Of course there are already quite a few philosophical and scientific schools dealing with these matters , like Epistemology , Knowledge Organization , Classification , Library Science , and Mind Sciences .What is the use of this special term , and what can be offered with it ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One main reason for using some special vocabulary is simply a necessity of dictionary ordering or rather , dictionary confusion .Everyone who has some experience with the history of philosophy realizes that the terms used throughout the ages have seen a quite large variation of meaning such that it is very difficult to really outline the semantic field of any of them clearly .Of course this is partly due to the matter itself : mind , intelligence , understanding , etc . are still quite elusive subjects , even after 2500 years of philosophical examination .The other reason why I use some special terms ( more will soon come ) is that they can not easily be mis - translated .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Especially with works by Hegel , Schelling , Fichte ( the idealist school ) and later , the works of Heidegger .The other reason why I use this specific term is to indicate a certain orientation on which I want to focus : .\" Time , Memory , Knowledge and Information Technology \" .Part of this enterprise may be called philosophical , but another important part deals with technical information matters .I have a background in computer science and I have done quite a bit of programming myself .I have also dealt with philosophy , cultural anthropology , semiotics , and a few other fields like ( paleo-)linguistics , neuro sciences , and pre - history of civilization and culture .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So I am forced in some way to \" roll my own \" .Noology thus indicates that I put a strong emphasis on the \" living \" memory aspect of knowledge , and its interrelation with time , and the phenomenological aspects of time , ie . reminiscence and forgetting .In my opinion , these aspects have been dealt with inadequately by the physicalistic oriented natural sciences .More on this later .LaKnowledge or LhWissen : Time , Memory , Knowledge and Information Technology .The terms \" LaKnowledge \" or \" LhWissen \" are a shorthand for this specific orientation on \" Time , Memory , Knowledge and Information Technology \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No scientific or other endeavor would be possible without human memory , but this is hardly ever found in any scientific text dealing with time and information .[5 ] The other gap which seems problematic for me is the frequent confusion of knowledge and information .With this I will deal now : .Probably everyone dealing seriously with knowledge and information matters will already know that the mathematical Shannon definition of information and its many interesting applications in concurrent information technology have little relevance as to matters of knowledge in real - life or real - business application situations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Among the many efforts to brindge that gap between \" information \" and \" knowledge \" I believe that a valuable approach was presented by Rainer Kuhlen who has coined the adage : \" information is knowledge in action \" ( Information ist Wissen in Aktion ) .Of course this is not a definition in formal terms and therefore the mathematically oriented computer science and computer information community could not make very much use of this .But it introduces the notion of action .Action belongs to the domain of the \" real world \" because \" facts \" are created by \" actions \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am not trying here for \" yaaardi \" ( yet another approach at re - defining information ) for the purposes of action in in real - life or real - business application situations .For now I will just coin that special word , which I introduced as \" LaKnowledge \" or \" LhWissen \" which means \" real - Life application Knowledge \" or \" Lebenspraktisches handlungsrelevantes Wissen \" .The other crucial factor of LaKnowledge is human memory .Again , there is a lot of confusion around memory going around in the information industry , because someone at some unfortunate moment decided to reference the various computer storage technologies as \" memory \" like RAM , while it is nothing but \" data storage \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This misunderstanding has served to render much of concurrent information technology pretty much mis - informing .In some respect , this is also due to a congential deformation of the mathematical foundations of computer science ( Informatics in computerese ) .All the while computing is crucially dependent on time factors , its mathematical foundation is pretty oblivious of time .This can be demonstrated with a very simple , striking example .Let us take any programming code line like this : .By the identity axiom , A must at all times be equal to A. The requirement \" at all times \" can also mean \" without regard for time \" and this can be called the Platonic foundation of mathematics , and without it , mathematics would be senseless .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Properly written , the above code line would have to be : .This indicates that a time step of computer processing lies in between the right and the left hand side of the program statement .The first example above is just a shorthand , but it ( introduces / indicates ) a kind of obliviousness towards time factors in computer science since the engineers always assume that some later generation of computers will overcome any computational time barriers that may exist now .In a certain respect , computers are \" time machines \" , meaning that computer programs formulate strictly and rigrorously highly complex sequences of time - step - actions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That is : It is in practical programming usage very hard to ensure that a variable or more general , an area of data storage , has been properly initialized or declared , before it is referenced .Conversely , this means that one part of a program expects some data value , which has not yet been produced ( or something different than expected by the program was produced ) by some different part of the program .While the control structure of the program is a formal mathematical affair that can be validated by a compiler , the sequencing of computing actions is given by the interaction of this control structure and the data .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All approaches to ameliorate this fundamental problem , like Structured Programming , Software Engineering ( SWE ) , Object Oriented Programming ( OOP ) , etc . have not proven to give any better overall results .These methods introduce their own specific drawbacks and complexities , mostly through overblowing the size of the code , and the complexification of the syntactic rules which force the programmer to take all kinds of detours for solving a computational problem .[ 6 ] .But there is a deeper problem for the mathematics underlying computer science .Mathematics is , by the history of ideas , a Platonic affair .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By Platonic I mean , that Platon the ancient Greek philosopher actually did n't quite believe in time .He was mainly concerned and strived for \" a timeless universe of eternal ideas which is where resides all the truth , the goodness , and the beauty \" ( Das Wahre , Gute und das Sch\u00f6ne ) [ 7 ] .[ 8 ] .I am not concerned with theology here .[ 9 ] But the other application poses a real problem .Mathematics is entirely oblivious of human memory .Although mathematics is unquestionably a trade that requires extremely stringent human memory training to be proficient in , the human memory itself does n't show up anywhere in its formulas and equations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But human memory is one of the most crucial factors of programming .Storage Synchronization Errors .As mentioned above , a main cause of programming errors is due to the fact that some programmer had forgotten that s / he had declared a variable here different than s / he used it there , or that a pointer had no reference , or something of the like .This can be called broadly \" Storage synchronization errors \" .Logical Interdependency Errors .The next class of errors can be called \" Logical interdependency errors \" .This means that the program logic is flawed because there are overlapping or incomplete subsections of the boolean logic driving the code .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Documentation / Specification Errors .Another main class of errors is that the applied subroutine or subprogram does something else ( or has some other preconditions ) than what the documentation says or what the programmer interprets the documentation to mean .This applies as well to program libraries that are supplied by a compiler vendor , as to those routines which the programmer / s write / s themselve / s .In large project teams dividing up the task of a project , this is a very common problem .But it applies as well to one single person when one has written a function library and one has forgotten later what the exact preconditions and what the exact workings of a function are .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This science is ( a subset of ) Noology .Of course there exist already a lot of approaches to \" human factors \" in computer science , and it needs to be explained of what use is yet another try in this direction .In my opinion , there must be more solid theoretical foundations than what I can find in the \" human factors \" movement in computer science .Even if I will probably not arrive at any better theory than what the others have , at least I can combine some of my practical and theoretical results into a coherent edifice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the english language , there is still a meaning of \" philosophy \" as a common sense mindset , or frame of ideas , which makes the \" Philosophy \" of this website .In a short aphorism , the difference between Mathematics and Information Science and the LaKnowledge of Noology is the \" Inequality Axiom \" .When human memory comes into play , then the following statement is true : .This is because there is the memory of \" A \" present , and one knows intuitively that the newly presented A ' is not the memory of \" A[t0 ] \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Friedrich Nietzsche also devoted some effort to these paradoxa .In the objective Newtonian / Einstein conception of time , human memory is simply disregarded , it is a phenomenon of the observer , or of subjectivity .Physically , that is due to the second law of thermodynamics or the entropy law .Phenomenally ( in the mind ) it is the difference between observing something \" A[t0 ] \" for the first time , and then observing the A[ti ] in superposition with the memory of \" A[t0 ] \" .This process is quite unconscious , but without the effect of memory , recognition would not be possible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Noologic Domain : Categorization and Category Systems .The noologic domain ( or short : the domain ) is the term used in my system of Noology for everything which can or could be known .The noologic domain is also colloqually known as \" the universe and the mind \" , ie the domain consists of everything : . a ) exists factually , or .b ) could exist possibly , probably , and/or according to \" the laws of nature \" .2 ) that we perceive as ( processes in / apparitions of ) our minds , . that can or could appear somehow in our minds as feelings , thoughts , ideas , phantasies , wishes , emotions , impulses , etc . .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Systematically , categorization is the design of a category system .In Noology , a category system is a construct of ideas .This is also a question of philosophical debate , since the Platonic schools in Mathematics and Natural Science assume that humans can only trace and track a pre - existent ordering of the Kosmos [ 10 ] .The use of a category system is to specify any given item out of the noologic domain exhaustively by its attributes , and ideally , it should be set - theoretically clean .This means that all items of the domain categorized by our system should form disjunct sets .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Something of the like is the rationale behind the information technology of the relational DBMS which is the machinery behind the current SQL query languages and most commercial Database systems .The difficulty of correctly designing the logical structure of a relational DBMS , called \" normalizing \" has the same logical reason that makes a categorization so difficult .Since Noology is not dealing with \" ideal \" worlds , but with organizing the knowledge of the messy world of humans and society , its category systems can not give those ideal clean sets .Rather , it works with fuzzy sets .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Categorization is the most crucial task for setting up a knowledge system .If you have the wrong categorization then your knowledge system will most likely be skewed , flawed , or outright useless .Needless to say , a good category system is hard to come by .[ 11 ] .Many philosophers have come up with many different types of category systems and have given their reasons for designing them .Up to now , no philosopher had information machinery in mind when he designed his system .So for the present purpose , the design criteria for the category system are influenced by these factors : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My working assumption about this is that any categories are imposed on the world by : . 1 ) our nervous system ( which is of course biological , and in some sense also natural ) and by .2 ) our thinking patterns and habits ( which are partly cultural , ie dependent on upbringing and education ) but also subtly influenced by what our nervous system takes for granted before we even start to think .We can think of categories as \" flavored containers \" somewhat like variable types of programming .There we have integers , floating , strings , arrays , truth values , and the OOP languages go so far as to construct a specific object type for any data item .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The mnemonomic factor of Noology is expressed best by the famous dictum \" five plus minus two chunks \" [ 13 ] .Ie . a category system should not have more than about 5 to 7 basic categories , while of course there can be many more subcategories .Natural language gives a few basic patterns for the Noologic instrumentarium since it has served the human mind and memory factors for countless ages to prove that it works .The interesting factor there is that so many and so different languages exist , and all seem to be workable somehow , since the peoples that used them , survived up to our day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In German , this is : . 1 ) Wo ? -Where ?This is already a categoric framework that can carry us quite far .But for now , I do n't want to delve too much into matters of content , but will deal more with the logical structure of the framework , or with the empty categories .[14 ] .A phonetic category framework .I will first construct an empty framework for a database retrieval system , which has a mnemonic factor .It is more or less given \" naturally \" by the capabilities of the human phonetic instrumentarium .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By use of this construction method we have the benefit that we can name anything that we want with a string of pronounceable words .This is primarily a memory requirement ( also called mnemotechnics ) , because it is harder to remember something for which one has no pronounceable word .( There are exceptions : Feelings and physical sensations , like smells , of course can be remembered very well without words ) .The string formation follows the regular expression rules and always starts with a consonant .In hebrew ( mytho - poetic ) usage , the aleph is called the mother / father of all sounds , because all pronounced sound formation must start with a breath ( ruach , pneuma ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It must be an ASCII consonant that is in the ordinary 7-bit character set available on every keyboard , and it must not collide with any other of the characters in the set .Because y is also used in indo - european languages as both vowel and consonant , this makes it a suitable candidate .Another requirement for a category system is that it should be frugal , ie that it should be easily memorable .The decimal multiplication table has 100 elements , and that is about the memory capacity that one can assume for normal iq primary school students .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As can be observed in actual language use , most indoeuropean languages do n't use the full vowel or consonant table , so that in effect the actual size of the table comes more close to 100 elements .Also some vowels and consonants are used more sparingly than others .Reference to ancient memory technologies .This table was constructed with reference to the ancient memory technologies of the distant past , before writing was invented .That means those at least hundred thousand years during which some kind of human culture was transmitted by memory alone .The last 3 - 5000 years of writing civilization are very short compared with that time depth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have extensively researched on these techniques and written about them in some of my publications .[17 ] From these times , only some rudiments have passed down to us , and probably with distorted meanings and connotations .For example the well known vedic mantra \" aoum \" contains the primary vowels ( the in - between - vowels can be produced when one lets the sounds slide into each other ) .Likewise for the christian mantra \" amen \" .In ancient greece , the word for hearing was \" aio \" , and the \" aoide \" was the ancient memory bearer , the singer of the ancient lore ( like the Homeric epics and Hesiod 's works ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the germanic tradition , the god \" odin \" was the bearer of the memory knowledge .In Africa , there exists a similar tradition of \" griots \" .The order of consonants .The order of consonants is given somewhat approximately how they are produced in the vocal tract : First come the \" deep throat \" sounds , of which the semitic languages have a richer variation than indo - european .Here the sound is produced by the voice box only without use of the tongue .Then come the gutturals .The tongue moves from the deeper posterior parts of the palate upwards and frontwards , until it reaches the dentals , labials and nasals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of course the spiritual aspects of these techniques are of no concern here , but the ordering function can profit from the ancient principles .The nesting of categories .So far , this table gives us only an empty framework but this is a powerful technique to generate unambiguous strings rith the regexp principle , which is very important for computer processing .As to the task of categorization , we have a rich literature of different systems that try to \" pigeonhole \" the world knowledge for bibliothecary uses into sets , by which the library stacks and catalogs can be ordered in some manageable way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Usually , these schemes give only very rough distinctions , like the Dewey classification system , but here the governing principle is more to provide a financially adequate system ( ie cheap enough ) for ordering the library stacks and catalogs .It depends more often than not purely on the interpretation of the library personnel into which class a book will be more or less properly fitted .And more often than not , a book is classified in this way never to be found again .Since so many category and classification systems have been devised , it is not really useful to add yet another version to this material .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This problem will not concern us for the moment .Instead I will embark on something that today is technically easier than what the philosophers of the past had to their avail : The nesting of categories .The nesting of categories is a quite ancient technique for which Aristoteles gave a famous quote : \" man is a featherless biped animal \" .[ 18 ] In all the sciences , the nesting of categories is well developed and presents a formidable edifice , like the classification of organisms .The principle is to identify a class by a certain set of attributes , like : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The rationale is that \" attr1 \" and \" attr2 \" are of a more general kind , and \" attr3 \" is a more specific kind .Likewise one can define different subclasses with differing sets of further attributes like : .In present information technology , this classification technique is the principle of \" object oriented programming \" and is also called \" ontology \" in current www organizing systems .Unfortunately , time and again , it appears necessary to reorder these categorizations according to different principles .To implement these changes in the textbooks and library systems is usually a quite monumental task .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So we can view the above table actually as a stack of tables which can be searched with computers .Each table houses a number of strings which are [ primary , secondary , tertiary ... ] retrieval keys for a database system .Permuting and reordering these strings is technically quite easy , and with the capacity of computers also within the technical and practical usability .After all , the time factor is crucial and one must search any number of permutations and combinations to find a specific item when one is not sure where it is exactly stored .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fuzzy categories and fuzzy logic .For 2300 years , from around 330 BC ( the time of Aristoteles ) to around 1970 the scientific progress of humanity dealt mainly with disjunct sets .[19 ] This is the base of Aristotelian logic , and the Boolean logic which drives our computers .Any item X either belongs to some class or set Q or it does not .[ 20 ] .The relational DBMS technology is an implementation to extend this principle to practical data processing applications .Example : An item X which is characterized by attributes ( attr1 , attr2 , attr3 , attr4 , ... ) is either present in a warehouse Q or it is not .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For example : . \" Day \" means : attr : sun is shining , stars are not visible , it is bright .\" Night \" means : attr : sun is not shining , stars are visible , it is dark . \" Morning \" and \" Evening \" are terms for describing phases of the diurnal circle , where the attributes are neither really dark nor really bright , some stars are visible , etc .But it is not possible to exactly give the attributes which characterize \" Morning \" or \" Evening \" .Their attributes form a \" fuzzy set \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The same is the case with the phonetics that are the base of the alphabet .While the alphabetical letters give the impression of outlining a clearly distinct set , the sounds they represent are a quite fuzzy set .This is more apparent with the vowels .In the english language , the \" a \" can stand for almost any vowel sound , depending on context .It is also possible to slide through the above sequence of \" a i \u00e4 e \u00fc \u00f6 o u \" and produce all sorts of intermediate sounds which can belong to either one or the other vowel class .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Therefore such similar consonants are grouped by linguistics in classes like nasals , labials , dentals , glottals , etc .In this way , the different variations of phonetic values of characters of the alphabet are more close to fuzzy sets than to the strict disjunct set theory .This is another reason for the letter classification presented here .The issue here is mainly how to deal with the information technology of fuzzy sets .[ 2 ] It seems as if the modern english word is a direct descendant of the old greek word .[ 3 ] The traditional latin rendering of \" logos \" was \" ratio et oratio \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "What Aristotle lacked was the concept of value .The word , the name that contained the simple abstraction of value did exist in his time , of course , as in his time , too , there existed merchants who regarded all things from the abstract viewpoint of buying and selling .But the concept of labour did not exist in that epoch .That merely shows , once again , that in Marx 's terminology a concept is something different from an abstract general notion fixed in a term .What is it then ?The concept of labour ( as distinct from and opposed to of it ) assumes a realisation of the role of labour in the overall process of human life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A concept exists where the particular and the individual are realised as more than merely the individual and the particular ( though recurrent ) - they are realised through their mutual links , through the universal construed as an expression of the principle of these links .Aristotle did not have such a conception of labour , for mankind had not yet worked out at that epoch any clear realisation of the role and place of labour in the system of social life .Moreover , Aristotle 's contemporaries did not believe labour to be a form of life activity that might be included in the sphere of human life proper .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not surprisingly , he failed to understand it as the substance of the exchange properties of a thing .In Marx 's terminology , that means precisely this , that he did not have a concept of labour and value but only an abstract notion of them .This abstract notion could not serve as the key to understanding the essence of commodity exchange .The classic representatives of bourgeois economy were the first to perceive labour as the real substance of all forms of economic life including , first and foremost , such a form as commodity exchange .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The reason for that is not , of course , that English economists proved to be greater logicians than the Stagirite .The reason is that the economists studied this reality within a better developed social environment .Marx showed clearly what was involved here : the object of study itself , in this case human society , matured to the degree that it was necessary and possible to study it in terms of concepts expressing the concrete substance of all its manifestations .Labour as the universal substance , as an ' active form ' appeared here , not only in consciousness but also in reality , as that ' proximate real genus ' which Aristotle failed to see .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Value became that goal for the sake of which each thing was realised in labour ; it became an ' active form ' , a concrete universal law governing the destinies of each separate thing and each separate individual .The point is that reduction to labour devoid of all differences appears here as an abstraction , but as a real abstraction , ' which is made every day in the social process of production ' .[ Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy ] As Marx puts it , this reduction is no more and no less of an abstraction than resolution of organic bodies into air .

{"text": "[ ibid . ]Here labour in general , labour as such appears as a concrete universal substance , and a single individual and the single product of his labour , as manifestations of this universal essence .The concept of labour expresses something greater than merely the identical elements that can be abstracted from the labour activities of individual persons .It is a real universal law which dominates the individual and the particular , determines their destinies , controls them , makes them into its organs , forcing them to perform the given functions and not some others .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Distinctions between individuals themselves prove to be a form of manifestation of the universal rather than something standing side by side with the universal and having no relation to it .A concept is a theoretical expression of this universal .Through a concept , every particular and individual element is apprehended precisely in those aspects which belong to the given whole , is an expression of the given concrete substance and is comprehended as an emerging and disappearing element of the movement of the concrete specific system of interaction .The substance itself , the concrete system of interacting phenomena is understood as a system that was historically formed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Something quite different takes place in the concept : the individual object is reflected in its particular features which make it a necessary element of some whole , an individual ( one - sided ) expression of a concrete whole .Each separate element of any dialectically divided whole expresses , one - sidedly , the universal nature of this whole precisely in its difference from other elements rather than through abstract affinity to them .The concept ( in its strict and precise sense ) is not therefore a monopoly of scientific theoretical thought .Every man has a concept , rather than a general notion expressed in a term , about such things as table or chair , knife or matches .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Things like the atom or art are quite a different matter .Not every artist has a well - developed concept of art , by any means , although he may create magnificent works of art .The present author is not ashamed to admit that he has a rather vague notion of the atom , as compared to a physicist .But it is not every physicist that has a concept of the concept .A physicist who shuns philosophy is not likely to acquire it .To avoid misunderstandings , we shall have to make the following qualification .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This restriction on the scope of the work does not at all mean that the so - called everyday thinking is not worthy of logic as science or that it develops according to different laws .The whole point is that scientific theoretical thought is the best developed form of thought .Its analysis therefore permits to establish , with greater facility , the laws which operate in thought in general .On the other hand , thought as it is practiced everyday does not so easily lend itself to the discovery of these universal laws and forms of thought : they are always hidden from view by a mass of complications , of various factors and circumstances .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These laws operate here permanently , but it is much more difficult to study them in isolation from the effect of complicating circumstances than in the analysis of the scientific theoretical process .Proceeding from this general methodological assumption , we consider the laws and forms of thought in general mostly in regard to the way they appear in scientific theoretical thought .We thereby obtain the key to comprehending all other forms and applications of thought that are in a certain sense more complicated than scientific thought , than application of the ability to think to the solution of scientific theoretical , problems , of clearly and strictly delineated problems .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
