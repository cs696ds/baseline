{"text": "Woke up this morning and it seemed to me That every night turns out to be A little more like Bukowski And yeah , I know he 's a pretty good read But God who 'd wanna be ?God who 'd wanna be such an asshole ?God who 'd wanna be ?God who 'd wanna be such an asshole ?-modest mouse .This movie is the reason Bukowski wrote Hollywood .Pretty much sums up whatr he thought of it .As far as portraying Bukowskis life , its a complete load of BS , the other film Factotum is really no better .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He did not want to screw up the good job that he had , going on over ten years at the post office .He never lived as they portray in this movie , he never lived as a bum on skid row , that s just the hollywood image .Typical hollywood , they take a fascinating character of a man and turn him into a joke .You want to know about Bukowski what he was like , watch Born into this , there you will get a taste of the real Charles Bukowski , or Hank as he was too his freinds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm glad we finally got this exceptional film -- always been one of my favorites .I know many hardcore Bukowski fans do n't like this film adaptation of his book , but I enjoyed it immensely .It 's a completely different medium , with another viewpoint and interpretation , so I never really try to compare movies based on a book anyway ; it ruins the experience .5/5 Stars .I do n't see how so many people can say this was a top film .The connection between Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunaway had no chemistry .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Furthermore , Rourke 's affect was super annoying .It was n't a bad movie , but most definitely not a great movie .Whether the depiction of a character is exact in the fashion of perfect mimicry is often irrelevant to me in relation to biopics .As a matter of a fact , I often find it the downfall of some biopics , where the physicality may be captured , but the meat and potatoes of the character 's are often left by the wayside .Not so in the instance of \" Barfly . \"Rourke nailed Bukowski / Chinaski 's crazy , alcoholic , free spiritedness brilliantly , I felt .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She plays the subtleties and intricacies of Wanda with such aplomb , offering even this - the most pathetic of her roles - a dignity and a sad beauty that not many actresses can pull off .The casting of this film deserves a round of applause !Frank Stallone 's swaggering , bully - of - a - bar tender , macho - man Eddie is hilarious !Gloria LeRoy as \" Grandma Moses \" the ancient prostitute infamous for her ability to \" swallow paste \" is priceless .I could go on and on , but I wo n't !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With males being force - fed the over - sensitive , turn the other cheek , annoyingly \" metro sexual \" kinds of roles models and ideals these days , it must be a strange look back over the evolutionary shoulder for some men to see the realities of people like Bukowski !Do n't get me wrong - I 'm not applauding all of the Chinaski character 's behaviors , but I think that some guys could learn a thing or two about themselves from the worst example of the diametric opposite of what they 've been told they should be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Bukowski has always dared to put to page whatever entered his head , and did so with a twisted lovely flourish .This is all counter - pointed wonderfully by the use of Mozart and Beethoven under Rourke 's voice - overs of Chinaski 's writing ., I look at this movie as a wee gem and as a masterpiece daring enough to capture life 's underbelly with an acuteness and accuracy many would n't dare to put to screen .I noticed when I was watching films in Hungary that the two people given top credit were the screen writer and the director .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Being interested in the craft , I know the screenwriters get overshadowed by the director and actors .Not .No screen play no film .Remember the writers strike in Hollywood a couple of years ago ?Everything came to a screeching halt . \"Barfly \" is bursting with the force of the script ... shows how it is the screenplay that is first and foremost in morphing a film into existence .The dialogue is so witty and catchy , there must be a couple of dozen memorable quotes .An autobiographical story of Charles Bukowski 's adventures as a schmuck .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
