{"text": "Pages .I 've met a couple of people who were ex - Pfans .Yes , ex .They fell out of Pfandom over the years when her movies became less successful .I can understand their opinion .People who are a fan of her movies , not her , but just her films , would inevitably fall out of Pfandom .The last big success of Michelle 's was ' White oleander ' in 2002 and she only had a supporting role . 'Hairspray ' was also a success , but I do n't count it because I 'm sure that a lot of people only went to see it for Zac Efron or John Travolta .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was n't a Pfan yet , so I count myself lucky ( even though it looks like she 's planning a break again :( ) .The movies that followed were probably below expectations .First there was ' I could never be your woman ' , a movie way below her level , which went straight to DVD .Next was ' Hairspray ' , a fun movie , but as said before Michelle only had a small role . 'Stardust ' was next , personally not one of my favorites .I loved Michelle as the scary , hideous witch , but the story was really not my taste .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I seriously dislike this movie so much .Michelle was ok , but certainly not at her best .I love her with all my heart , but I 'm not afraid to share my true thoughts about every single performance , even when they 're not great .I mostly blame Ashton , my God , he was bad in PE !But so was the script , the lighting and the story overall ( I 'll do a review on it one of these days , before this post gets too long ) .And last ' Ch\u00e9ri ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She had the lead role , the story was appealing and her performance astonishing .But back to the point .I think what struck the ex - Pfans the most is that the wait of four ( ! ) years was n't worth it .Two miniscule roles and two unsuccessful movies ( not just my opinion ) .I know we all say that we 'll remain Pfans forever , and we mean it .But maybe it 's a little na\u00efve to think that .Do n't get me wrong , if anyone told me now that in 10 years I wo n't be a Pfan anymore , I 'd laugh my ass off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maybe the ex - Pfans thought that they 'd remain Pfans forever too , but look what happened .We need a new Pfilm ; the movies we already have of hers are great , but is it reasonable to think that we can live on that our whole lives ?We ca n't dwell on the past forever .I said to myself I would n't post anything until June 25th , when the votes were in .But , I could n't control myself :p So here 's another review : .One of my Pfriends asked me why ' Frankie and Johnny ' is my favorite Pfilm .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I prefer drama , while F&J is a comedy .I love romances in which they do n't end up together , and in F&J they do .But still it 's the Pfilm I love the most .It 's the first movie I specifically watched for Michelle .I saw ' Grease2 ' and ' Hairspray ' before , but that was before I was a Pfan , by coincidence .I saw the trailer , and it looked very promising .So when I ordered my first batch of Pfilms , F&J was the first one I watched .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There were times when I laughed , but it was the dramatic scenes that blew me away .It started somewhat clich\u00e9 , a look in the lives of the head - characters who were obviously going to end up together .But as the story progressed it got much deeper than just a cheesy romantic movie .I have to say , I still gulp when I see Michelle crying in the bus .You can tell both characters are really broken .Frankie , a deeply unhappy woman with absolutely nothing to look forward to in life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Both very realistic .That 's what drew me to the movie .The characters .They 're so real , honest , almost blunt .Frankie has good reasons to have lost her faith in men .But it 's like the tagline says : ' You never choose love , love chooses you .I really love Pacino 's character .He 's the exact opposite of what usually happens .Typical scene : ' girl and boy go out , both like each other , are insecure about the other one 's feelings , they test the fields , hesitate , hold back and ultimately keep their feelings a secret . '", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No teasing , no hesitating , no games .If only everyone was like that .The scene at the bowling alley was genius .Telling a woman you love her after just one night together is a lot to take , but that 's what I like about it .Honesty .And Frankie 's reaction !Absolutely priceless .It played very well on Frankie 's shield around her heart .She 's certainly an interesting character too .Low - educated , disappointed in every relationship she 's had , and just very , very unhappy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She 's completely blocked herself out .Until the last scene of the film .That scene was heartbreaking .Michelle was so good in that final scene .Just to see all her emotions come out after 1,5 hour of a closed book .And to finally see her giving love another chance .It was definitely one of the moments that got closest to making me cry ( I have this weird thing that I ca n't cry at movies ) .The final lines were so convenient .It represented Frankie letting Johnny in ; the beginning of their relationship ; finally no more lies and no more games .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( You 'll only get this if you 've seen this movie . )Frankie : \" No matter what ? \" Secure nod from Johnny .Frankie : \" I 'm 36 .\" Both smile happily .The critics were tough on Michelle .They said she looked too beautiful to play the part of a plain woman .I find this total nonsense .I completely agree with Michelle 's comment ; \" pretty people have problems too .\" Seriously , like having a beautiful face will guarantee happiness in your life !On the other hand , I did n't think Michelle looked too beautiful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think it turned out fine , I found her most convincing as an ordinary woman .That really shows how talented she is .The most beautiful woman in the world yet can still handle the part of a plain woman .All in all , F&J is not the most beautiful Pfilm ( ' The age of innocence ' in my opinion ) , or the one that should 've won Michelle an Oscar the most ( ' The fabulous baker boys ' ) .But it 's the most honest one .It did n't show the clich\u00e9 story of two people magically falling in love , being each others soul - mate and happily ever after , blablabla .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But that 's life right ?Taking chances and risks without knowing the result .That 's reality . 'Frankie and Johnny . 'A story that could be happening right now , to anybody , somewhere in the world .Favorite scene : at the flower market .That little awkward moment when Johnny tries to kiss Frankie , followed by the sweetest , romantic kiss ever .I get butterflies in my stomach every time I see it !Also , I 'd kill to know what Johnny whispered to Frankie by the truck ; the music was way too loud !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Favorite quote : \" Fuck you how I talk , I 'll talk any fucking way I fucking feel like .This is my fucking bowling - night and who the fuck are you to fucking spoil it by fucking telling me you love me ? !\" We all agree that Michelle should 've won a dozen Oscars by now , but we ca n't change the fact that her Oscar - closet is totally empty .Anyway , I decided to organize my own ' award - show ' .Only Pfilms are nominated , so she 'll go home with all the prices anyway :) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
