{"text": "Mario Kart is a system seller .It was for the DS and it was for the Wii .It 's no wonder that Nintendo tried to slap down Mario Kart 7 onto the 3DS as soon as possible .And what did we get from it ?A solid Mario Kart title that could have been a whole lot better .Let me start off by saying that Mario Kart 7 is a great game .But when it comes to first impressions , 7 is truly lacking , which is quite apparent when you first start the game .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Unlike Mario Kart Wii , all 3 difficulty classes are unlocked at the get - go , but only by playing through the 150cc difficulty will you any new characters , which basically means that the first to cc difficulty levels are completely useless .Mirror mode can also be unlocked , which allows you to play through each of the 32 courses with each turn reversed .But even though you 're unlocking things along the way , Mario Kart 7 's Grand Prix is tiresome and tedious , and proves that Nintendo has to do something drastic in order for Grand Prix to feel fun again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "You ca n't drift while doing tricks anymore , adding a ( probably unwanted ) sense of strategy to Mario Kart .Along with the old mechanics , Mario Kart 7 includes several new ones .Upon hitting blue ramps , your kart will now sprout a hanglider that adds a lot of strategy into the game .You 'll be steering your Kart in the air naturally in no time as you glide to dodge numerous enemies and obstacle while you try your best not to land outside of the course .Gliding is a very welcome addition to Mario Kart and adds a new layer of depth to the franchise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Coins also make a return to the Mario Kart series after being absent since the GBA 's Super Circuit .Coins are scattered around each course and function in a number of ways in this game .First off , coins give you a small but immediate speed boost when you come in contact with them .Coins also increase your kart 's max speed , with a maximum of ten coins per race .Last of all , coins allow you to unlock new kart parts that you can customize to alter the stats of your vehicle .Reach a certain amount of collected coins , and a random part will be unlocked for your liking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Some other courses like Music Park or Piranha Plant Slide seem to have too many obstacles and feel a bit annoying .Despite some lackluster new tracks , there are many that pop out and shine like Rainbow Road and Bowser 's Castle .Also , Nintendo took the time to mix things up by adding long one - lap tracks that are separated into three sections .The music in this game is also mixed .Some courses have very annoying songs like in Daisy Hills , some that do n't really sound like anything like in Shy Guy Bazaar , and others that sound great like in Neo Bowser City .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fortunately , such a slight downfall is covered by the addition of the new \" first place beat , \" which adds an extra layer of percussion to the music when you 're in first place .The retro courses have undergone major redesigns , as courses like N64 Koopa Beach do n't even look like it did in the original .These retro courses have also been altered to fit new glider and underwater segments , which makes me wonder why Nintendo did n't choose to go with N64 Royal Raceway or Wii Wario Goldmine and instead opted for N64 Luigi Raceway and Wii Coconut Mall .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have nothing against Wuhu , and the courses are really actually quite fun , but Wuhu has no place in Mario Kart , and seems to reflect the laziness in the Mario Kart team to create new and exciting courses .Of course , what 's Mario Kart without items ?Along with the usual banana peels and Koopa shells come an updated spiny blue shell ( now wingless a la Mario Kart 64 ) and 3 new items : the Tanooki Suit , the Fire Flower , and the Lucky 7 .The Tanooki Suit allows you to whack your tail around at opponents and obstacles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Lucky 7 is a unique item , which gives you 7 random items that spin around you .But be careful ; other players can steal those items from you if you do n't use them immediately , making the item feel more like a strategic tool than a cheap way to win .In fact , all of Mario Kart 7 's items have been balanced out , making you feel a lot better when you 're racing alongside the CPU .Surprisingly , Nintendo has done away with the fake item block this time around , which is n't really at all noticeable until you really think about it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As always , each character is set in a specific weight class with specific base stats ( ultimately , it is the kart parts that really change the stats on your character ) .You can still race as the classic 8 characters from the old Mario Kart games , but several new ones like Wiggler and Queen Bee just feel out of place , especially when iconic characters like Waluigi and Dry Bones did n't make the cut .And Metal Mario as a playable character is just a sign of laziness .Time Trials has gotten a significant upgrade since we last saw it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You can race against these ghosts as well as your own ghosts while you try to get the best time .There are no worldwide leaderboards this time around , but Mario Kart does n't really need it .You can see , though , the trendline in which where most time - trial ghosts fall into in terms of racing times for each course .Gather enough ghosts , and you 'll be able to race against seven of them at the same time .All of these added features make Time Trials the best it 's ever been in a Mario Kart game .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Interestingly , the single - player vs. mode has completely disappeared from Mario Kart 7 , which means that if you want to play against the computer player on a course like Rainbow Road , you 're going to have to play through the entire cup to get there .It 's a bit strange that Nintendo did n't care to include it , as it 's been available for quite some time now in the past Mario Kart games .Also gone are the DS ' mission mode and its follow - up the Wii 's Tournaments .Without these elements , Mario Kart 7 's single - player experience is absolutely abysmal , and further reestablishes the fact that Nintendo only spent a little more than a year to make this game .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Though I do have many complaints the single - player experience , the multi - player is , as always , where Mario Kart shines .You have the option to choose between local or online play .Local multiplayer allows you to play either with single - card download play or multi - card play .Single - card play only allows the person with the game card to choose their characters or carts with non - Mario Kart 7 owners being forced to use Shy Guy ( which is n't that bad of a choice considering the rather disappointing roster ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You can even customize your own rules ( like bob - omb only balloon battle ; sound familiar ? ) to your own liking , though it is a bit limited ( you ca n't turn blue shells off ) .Online play has greatly improved since Mario Kart Wii .Along with the ability to play random players worldwide , you can now race against people you 've recently played against as well as in new online communities .Anyone can make communities and set certain rules for them ( once again , these rules are very limited ) and share a very long code online .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In terms of the online experience , Nintendo has delivered .There is very little lag ( and when there is , the game does a good job in hiding it ) and , like all of the other modes , it runs at a glorious 60fps .Winning online races allows you to gain verses rating points to prove to your opponents that you are indeed the best in the group ( or the worst , it really depends ) .Of course , losing the race causes you to lose VR points .Communities also now have their own leaderboards , which uses a point - based system found in the Grand Prix instead of the VR scale in the other online modes , which is a bit strange , but still well - done .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You can also change your Mii and your default kart here , along with your online stats including wins , losses , and VR .It 's a fun little addition that integrates itself seamlessly into the game ; you do n't even have to go into the Mario Kart Channel to access most of these features .As a whole , Mario Kart 7 is a great game .It has robust multi - player and online options , some awesome courses ( especially the retro ones ) , cool new in - game mechanics , great new time trial options , and the ability to download new ghosts , all of which enhance the Mario Kart experience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "As if one racing game was n't enough , Nintendo decided to throw in another one , this time a Mario Kart title .And I 'm just going to put this out there .I hate Super Circuit .In fact , I think Super Circuit is the worst Mario Kart game to date .But surprisingly , after playing Super Circuit with the circle pad , my perception has changed , though ever so slightly , to the better .Mario Kart : Super Circuit is actually kinda fun .For starters , the game features a whopping 40 different tracks , including EVERY track from the SNES original .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But fans of modern Mario Kart games will receive a rude awakening : Super Circuit has some of the slipperiest physics in any Mario game , making the game extremely hard to control even at 50cc .Also worth noting : no multiplayer .The game has multiplayer modes , but Nintendo did n't include that into the Virtual Console service , which is a bummer , because it effectively renders half of the game useless .Wario has a lot of character .Sure , it does n't do anything ground - breaking in platforming or puzzle - solving , but it 's a well - rounded package that is also a ton of fun .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'll just leave the game to you and let you feel surprised at how fun this game is .I remember loving Yoshi 's Island .I remember trying to collect all of those red coins and flowers to unlock every secret level of the game .I remember playing those extra levels that were hard as hell .I remember hating myself for trying to beat the Endless World of Yoshis .Everything , including the classic Mario Bros. arcade game ( though the 3DS VC currently has no multiplayer support ) , returns in this version of Yoshi 's Island .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Controlling Yoshi with the d - pad is the best idea overall , due to the many tricky platforming segments that require precision .But though these things may take a while to get used to , Yoshi 's Island is still as good as you remembered it .The art design for this game is totally unique , and it is one that holds up well to this date , even when the screen is stretched to fit the 3DS , and the platforming is still as hardcore as it can get .To tell you the truth , I 've never ever loved Metroid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But for people like me , this game was made with simplicity in mind .Unfortunately , like Yoshi 's Island , anything that requires you to slide the circle pad downwards will not always connect properly , making me opt out for the d - pad at some points .But though I 've only played through half an hour of the game , I 'm surprisingly enjoying this fun little sci - fi shooter .You 'll hate : . - anything that requires you to slide down on the circle pad ( including ducking and morph balling ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "no multiplayer support ( and not being to complete the game because of that ) .Do you love puzzles ?Do you love Mario ?Did you absolutely adore Donkey Kong ' 94 on the 3DS VC ?Well here is its sequel .Mario vs Donkey Kong is the direct sequel of of DK ' 94 and is arguably one of the best Mario & Donkey Kong games ever made .The game may look simple at its premise , but as you play through the worlds , you 'll be surprised by how much depth this game actually has ( and the amount of moves Mario actually can do ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I hate strategy RPG 's .I do n't know why , but they just feel a bit boring to me .This game changed my mind .The second Fire Emblem game to come to America , Sacred Stones provides a deep story and gameplay that actually felt fun .If you felt the same way as I did about strategy RPG 's , give this game a shot , and perhaps you 'll feel the same way as I do now .Even though I 've only played the first two chapters of the game , there is no doubt in my mind that Fire Emblem : The Sacred Stones is a surprisingly fun and robust game .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Mario 's somersaults , long jumps , ground pounds , and wall kicks all make a return in 3D Land .In fact , the only move that has n't returned is the double and triple jump moves that Mario used to possess in his other 3D outings .A few new moves have been added as well .Mario 's backflip has been replaced with a crouch jump first seen in the original Mario Bros. arcade game .Mario also has a new roll move , which has no attack power whatsoever .However , with the roll move also comes the rolling long jump , a move similar to the long jump but only much faster .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite having a 360 \u00b0 Circle Pad , Mario 's movements are limited to 16 directions .This is both a good thing and a bad thing .The good thing is that if you want Mario go run right , he will run right , not right and a little bit downwards , and not right and a little bit upwards .This digital control really helps in several platforming sections .However , the downside of having this digital control is that you sacrifice true 360 \u00b0 accuracy , causing some sections to be difficult to play through , especially when you have a fixed camera that wo n't budge .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This means that Super Mario will become little Mario if he gets hit by an enemy , and he will have to collect power - ups in order to survive more hits .Power - ups include classics like the Super Mushroom and the Fire Flower , and newer ones such as the Tanooki Suit and Boomerang Suit .The Tanooki Suit allows you to hover for a short amount of time .This is extremely useful in very careful platforming sections .The Tanooki Suit also allows you to swat enemies with your tail by pressing Y or X , turning rolling long jumps into destructive tail - wacking spinning long jumps , a useful tool when attempting to speed run through levels .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately , other than collecting far - away items and coins , the Boomerang Suit is rather pointless due to its lack of range when trying to beat enemies with it .Though the amount of power - ups in the game are decent , it saddens me that Nintendo did n't feel the need to go all out and add even more items into the game to add variety .When it comes to levels , 3D Land 's level design is quite impressive .As mentioned before , most of the game is involved with platforming .Even the boss battles somehow involve platforming elements into them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's not to say that this game is difficult .Though the game looks and feels like the more linear Galaxy games , it 's fairly easy to play through the stages without too much conflict .And even when you get stuck , Nintendo was kind enough to put in a few extra power - ups to help yo .u out .Once you die five times , a white Tanooki Suit will pop up , giving players both star power and tanooki power at the same , allowing them to run through the levels .Once you die five more times , you will receive the classic P - wing , which warps you to the end of the level , allowing younger players to skip a level if they 're struggling too much on it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately , the game falls short in its boss battles .Sure , the Bowser battles are absolutely brilliant and fun , but there are only two other bosses in the game , in which you fight them multiple times , just on a different stage with different hazards .This is quite a disappointment , but it was also probably the result of Nintendo trying to appeal to all audiences with this game .Levels also use the system 's gyroscope functionality at certain points of the game .For instance , if you step up to a pair of binoculars , you can zoom in and out to survey the level by moving the system around .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These sections can also be controlled with the circle pad if one wishes to do so , but the novelty of the gyroscope functions add some variety into the game .At first glance , the game may seem a little on the short side .With 8 worlds of 5 - 7 levels each ( including castle and airship levels ) , the game is indeed a bit short .The first few worlds are also quite easy , allowing most players to zoom right through them without dying once .But upon beating the final level , 8 more special worlds appear .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
