{"text": "Sundance Review : Quentin Tarantino Presents Hell Ride .If you loved Grindhouse , then you 're in for a treat .Hell Ride is a biker flick produced by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Larry Bishop that pays homage to the old school biker movies of the 60s and 70s .It 's one 83-minute non - stop biker party that exploits the three Bs : bikes , beer , and booty .If you 've been anxious for another edge - of - your - seat grindhouse fix until Tarantino and Rodriguez team up again for the sequel ( if it ever happens ) , then this is it !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In Hell Ride , two rival biker gangs , the Victors and the Six - Six - Sixers , have been at war for years .On July 4th , 1976 the Six - Six - Sixers kill and burn the Victors ' president 's wife , now 32 years later they 're getting revenge .The Victors are headed up by the gang 's president , Pistolero ( Larry Bishop , who played the \" asshole on the elbow \" guy in Kill Boll Vol . 2 ) , The Gent ( Michael Madsen , who played Budd in Kill Bill Vol . 2 ) , and recently added member Comanche ( Eric Balfour ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I love movies that can keep up the energy and action the entire way through and never let down and it 's rare to find these nowadays .For the exact same reasons that I loved Grindhouse last April , I love Hell Ride .It 's full of so much intensity , endless hot women , awesome gun fights , and badass characters that you would n't dare mess with .If anyone calls Hell Ride boring , than they 've got some serious ADD issues , because this is packed with more guns , tits , and action than even all of Grindhouse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I said it before and I 'll say it again , Hell Ride is a fuckin ' blast .I loved every last minute of this film and ca n't wait to see it again .It 's Grindhouse but with bikers and endless hot women .Hell Ride is a full - on 83-minute thrilling ride to hell and back .Hi , this is envy speaking .Your review differs a lot from the one I just text'd with , but Peter does n't get down with biker movies .Bring on the Hell Ride trilogy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Man , you must be retarded .That movie was so awful that I nearly shit my pants .No amount of boobs or gun fights could save the atrocious storyline , acting , direction , dialogue , art direction , costumes , music and everything else .So painful .Enola .The movie looks good , but Grindhouse was crap on a silver plate ... Death Proof was just bad , first QT movie I 've hated , did n't like KB I and II , but DP was nothing to me .Just waste of film ...", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Fake Trailers were good as hell , but the main movies kinda sucked . nick .That jeff kid has a real attitude problem . jeff .If you saw this movie you would have an attitude problem too .It feels like my whole psyche was raped and the dirt wo n't wash off .This was worse than anything I have seen in a long long time .I do n't know why you have such a big problem with it Jeff .Maybe the subject matter just was n't for you ...I 'm sorry that you ca n't handle the kind of stuff in this , but I loved it as much as I loved Grindhouse ...", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was expecting some semblance of talent with regard to writing and directing .The story was so convoluted and hackneyed that I felt a high school A / V student could do better .It was simply a big amateur attempt at making a Tarantino movie complete with blatant rip offs ( or \" homages \" as Pee Wee put it ) .The safety deposit box \" secret treasure \" was ridiculous because it was the focal point and driving force of all the characters .The reason it worked in Pulp Fiction is because it was n't center stage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You liked the gunfights for the sake of gunfights ?You liked how the whole thing was basically \" really really stupid dudes follow other dudes right into a trap multiple times and then get shot really easily \" ?There was never any tension , no challenge , no reason to give a crap about any character !Any screenwriter with half a brain could have made that basic story good but instead we have Larry Bishop who obviously has nothing but an ego .Oh and lest we forget the amateur slam - poetry - esque scene in which Bishop and that chick trade horrible \" fire \" innuendo for a painfully long time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You 'll get some kudos for that from writing afficionados !Dave .we will never see another pulp fiction or resevoir dogs in our lives , so do nt compare qt or qt presents movies to it or you will be let down every single time . nick .\" from writing afficionados ! \" lol nice .Rob .I must have seen a different version of ' Death Proof ' , where there was n't ' action and energy ' all the way through .Just endless scenes of pretty women talking a whole bunch of crap with 2 very ho hum action sequences thrown in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Enola .I guess I watched the same print of Death Proof as Rob .Bad dialogue with pretty women and Uwe Boll action scenes ... .Scott .I admit DP was n't that hot but if you have any interest in those types of movies at all then you should have loved Planet Terror .Mind .... blown .DarkDhalia .Well , I can not let say Death Proof is shit since it is certainly not .Death Proof has 4 fucking different layers of meaning -- intersected 2 by 2 .Death Proof is a fucking mix of Grindhouse movies and art project ( the sexual outline ) Death Proof 's content is rich when you dare analyse it -- do n't be fucking passive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's it .Joel M. .In my opinion Death Proof is Tarantino 's first real failure , artistically .There are tons of good things about it , but the movie just falls down .If I had to speculate , I 'd surmise that Tarantino has trouble when he moves away from his comfort zones - everyday dialog said by big genre characters ( instead of small everyday characters ) ; a cast of criminals .I 've never felt that violence and foul language were what makes Tarantino 's great work great ( he 's a helluva storyteller ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you imagine Pulp Fiction without the offensive language and violent , it becomes a cartoon .See Kill Bill for more examples .Having said all that , Death Proof is no worse than the other thousand scary movies that come out each year and are heralded as the second coming of George Romero .In may ways , Tarantino has done it better than anybody , but only if you focus on the details . blackmoto .are you bashers fuckin ' retarded ? ! ?IT 'S A B MOVIE FOR FUCK 'S SAKE ! ! ! ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "anyone looking for some kind of hidden story , moral of the story , production values etc .. well , you 're fucked .art ? ! ?it 's a biker movie ass - clowns .maybe it 'll only appeal to real bikers .blackmoto is right , this is a b movie and it 's meant to be crappy and fun , I guess .Even though I 'd say it did have awesome production values , but morals , fuck morals , it 's all about how much badass shit you can throw into it , whether it 's girls , weapons , bikes , or anything else .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Little Richie .Grindhouse is da kind .I say that cause I 'm a Taratino junkie and he is da Man .I thought Death Proof was fucking awesome to say the least .I ca n't wait for Hell Ride , release it quickly please .Little Richie .Jumpin ' Jack .This just cracks me up .I have n't seen the movie yet but I absolutely plan on doing that .It 's a $ 10 ticket , some popcorn and Cokes , a date , at a drive - in if those were still around .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you want to be serious , read the Wall Street Journal where you can REALLY get depressed .I figure a few bucks for a good time , some road trip gratuitous ( not - real ) violence and some drop dead gorgeous scantily clad babes who do n't look down their noses at anyone over 25 , who could ask for anything more ?It 's a popcorn movie , be happy you 're not on the bread - line somewhere .Chill .Get some viewer - friendly vicarious thrills .Enjoy and mellow .Jumpin ' Jack .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "does anyone know if going to be shown anywhere anytime soon ?i have to see this ... .Dash .I have n't seen this yet , and since there is literally nothing about it ( save this review and a few others ) , I ca n't speak directly on the film .What I can say is that the Grindhouse films were supposed to be GRINDHOUSE films .Grindhouse films take something and exploit it .Both Planet Terror and Death Proof succeeded in doing that .I highly doubt QT or RR had any hopes of being praised by the Golden Globes or the beloved Oscars for those films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Zombie movie fans/ Old School Car Chase fans .I think they succeeded there .As far as Hell Ride , I 'm sure its in the same vein .I 'm sure its supposed to be pretty light on story and heavy on tits , guns , and badassness .So if you do n't like tits , guns , and bad ass shit for the sake of bad ass shit , then do n't see the movie .I can think of much worse ways to spend 86 minutes .You want a good story , go watch the Godfather ( one of my favorites ) but if you just wanna zone out and watch some cool shit , maybe check Hell Ride when it comes out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "83 minutes .Zach .Well ... QT is nt just a fucking director or producer or any of that , he is most of all a fan .If you had the power to make any movie you wanted ( which he pretty much does ) then why the fuck not .I ca nt wait to see Hell Ride .I want you fuckers to stop over anaylizing everything and have a good fucking time .That s what QT 's shit is all about .The Big Boo .I am a fukin biker and ca n't wait for this to hit the screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Man , Australia sucks .I want to see the tarantino movies before they come on DVD or critics ruin my excitement .Poo .Michael Livingston .I agree with the comments by The Big Boo and would add that biker movies are definitely not for everyone .But for people who do enjoy them they have a very specific kind of look to them .Most people do n't understand that in a biker movie the acting and the plot is not real important .A lot of it is watching people ride motorcycles mixed with over the top gratouitious ( sorry spelling ? ) violence and sex like the orgy in the church at the end of The Wild Angels .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "MOTORCYCLE CLUBS THE BROTHERHOOD MENTALITY VERSES THE GANG MENTALITY This Month I want to talk about the Brotherhood mentality verses the gang mentality in the Motorcycle Club world .Now for those of you who may be asking what is the difference ?I will set up a scene to help give you an idea !At a small Bar a member of a Motorcycle Club walks in he sees four Bikers playing pool , He can tell they are a bit nervous , They see his patches and they know who he is with .Now how does he act ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "They were looking for that feeling of Brotherhood here at home that they had been left behind .These were good men seeking adventure , looking to ride their Motorcycles and have a good time with others like themselves .Today most Motorcycle Clubs have gone back to that way of Club thinking , There are very few Clubs left that still have the Gang Mentality that was seen mostly during the 70 's threw 90 's .Many Clubs who had been friends were now fighting with each other .No one wanted to wear club support gear and things were just not fun anymore .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well the answer to how is during the 50 's and 60 's the golden age of the Brotherhood years of Motorcycling , The Motorcycle Clubs were really huge .During this great time many of the Biker Movies that came out showed Motorcycle Club Members as Bullies and Thugs .The Bikers in these movies would pick on those weaker then them , take over small towns and the Clubs in these Movies all fought each other just like the street gangs of the time !So of course over time many new Bikers came to believe that this was the way it was .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
