{"text": "A bit of a disappointment but not an utter waste of time to read .I 've read Koontz novels before and loved them so I was looking forward to this one .Unfortunately , despite it still being a descent read , it was n't as good as I had hoped because of the writing style .The tag line on the front cover reads : ' The terrifying new thriller ' .I would n't really say it was terrifying , but it just about fits into the crime thriller genre .We do n't see the FBI and criminal profilers or private investigators , rather , this book puts the protagonist at the forefront .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Could he have been poisoned ?When he gets his transplant things start to settle down , but not for long .It looks like someone was n't too happy with the way things have turned out for Ryan , one of the lucky ones who got a donor ... .I wo n't say anymore about the plot incase too much is given away , but there are some twists that make the novel , well , novel .I liked the characters and the scenes that were painted by Koontz and I felt at times that I could envisage what was happening .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps it was the writing style itself , which I noticed particularly when the plot had slowed down considerably , that just was n't quite fluid enough or natural enough .It was still an enjoyable read , just not one that I found as gripping or thrilling as it could have been .Praise on the back cover for the book includes : ' There 's surprise after surprise , including a killer finale ... a read - in - one - go novel ' - Independent on Sunday and ' Psychologically complex , masterly and satisfying ' - New York Times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was n't as complex as it may seem from the second quote either , but it had enough characters and plot to keep it interesting and within the crime / thriller genre .Overall , this was a little disappointing when considering what I had expected .However , it 's worth a read as long as you do n't necessarily anticipate it being a thrill a moment , it being an addictive novel you ca n't put down , or it having a spectacular ending .An easy read that 'll grab your attention immediately .Great if you like your thrillers and mysteries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Had n't heard of the title , but had recently been introduced to Dean Koontz novels .I was keen to read a few more .This was the only one of his books they had , and it seemed as good as any to go with !PRICE / AVAILABILITY .As I said , I picked this up from an Oxfam store .Charity shops and bootsales are great places to pick up books cheaply , especially if it 's something by a best selling author .They 'll be quite easy to come by !You can purchase this one for as little as a pound if you type the title and author into Google Shopping , and it 's available from all the usual places such as Amazon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I was surprised , although not put off , that the opening chapters were so long , detailed , and in depth .I was surprised because they did n't really develop into much in terms of the main story , but not put off because , like all Dean Koontz ' writing , it was interesting and made you want to keep going .If you 'd read the back , like I had and like most people do before chosing a book , you 'd wonder when the inevitable heart transplant was coming .And I think it would have been more enjoyable reading up to this point without knowing it would happen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Each clearly marked .Before the transplant , during , and after .The story starts by introducing you to the main character , Ryan Perry , who is a young and wealthy internet entrepreneur .You also get to know his girlfriend Samantha .These characters are developed throughout the opening chapters , and in the first third of the book you do n't really get to know much about any of the other characters .The only people who are mentioned briefly are a private security firm working with Ryan , medical professionals and the staff at Ryan 's home .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "From the start , the writing is good ; it flows well and you 're soon drawn into the story .I 'm someone who struggles to get into a book , but have n't found this with both Dean Koontz novels I 've read .The scenes are set well with enough but not too much description , the characters develop , and you can quickly relate to the main character , Ryan 's , way of thinking .So much so , that you can get as tunnel visioned as he does !( Although I wo n't say too much and give the whole plot away ! )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A lot of the beginning and middle sections seemed to be filled with red herrings .Some of these were explained in part , but no \" oh wow !I did n't see that one coming ! \" style twists .Some of the previous happenings were not elaborated on at all .This is the second Dean Koontz I 've read ( as I said before ) , and the second time I 've been disappointed by an ending .I 've seen the same thing mentioned by other reviewers , so it seems to be a bit of a trend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I enjoy Dean Koontz style of writing immensley , he really does tell a story well and it 's clear he has a good working knowledge of whatever subject he 's writing about .What did bother me in this book , right towards the end , was some of his ' non PC ' terms .He refers to a young boy with Down 's Syndrome as a ' Down 's Syndrome boy ' which I was quite taken aback by .I 'm sure this was an oversight , but could potentially offend a reader !OVER ALL .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A very well written story , that will draw in even the most impatient reader within a few chapters .Some good twists at the end , although nothing groundbreaking .A little more focus on the ending , and a little less on the beginning , and this book could rate much higher !I 'll definitely read another Dean Koontz novel ( in fact , I already am ! )Comments .Your Heart Belongs To Me by Dean Koontz .I have read a few Dean Koontz books but this one was proper boring and I could n't wait to finish it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's about a man called Ryan who is a millionaire after he sold his internet company so he has loads of time on his hands and spends it wind surfing with his girlfriend .He finds out he only has a few months to live and goes on the transplant list for a new heart .He gets a transplant in double quick time and you can probably guess what happens then from the name of the book .Even though you think this is going to be a horror story it 's more of a thriller because a lot of the story is about the emotions of Ryan when he realises that frightening things are happening to him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The book is n't frightening and did n't make me think or feel anything about the characters even when they are scared or upset .When Ryan starts sussing out that somethings wrong he starts investigating it and that s why the story gets so boring because everything is too easy for him .He gets help from a private investigator and it makes it too predicatable because Ryan does n't have to do any proper investigating and everything falls into his lap too easily .The story moves dead slow because nothing much happens at all apart from a few pages where there s a bit of action but there is n't very much .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's written cleverly and the story moves forward smoothly but Dean Koontz has changed his writing style and now it 's too descriptive and flowery .Like when he takes 3 pages to describe the outside of someones house , its too much and makes it feel like he is just dragging the pages out because there is n't enough story to fill it .Comments .Recommended but be warned about the obvious ending !I 've been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years now and have read everything he 's ever written except his newest book .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The first thing that struck me about this book was how thin it is .It 's 400 pages and quite large text which I knew would n't last me beyond a sitting and as far as Dean Koontz goes this is a very short book .He seems to produce at least a couple of books a year and this one he probably knocked out in a couple of weeks !The basic storyline for this is Ryan Perry is 34 , loaded and successful and happy until he finds himself with a heart problem that needs a transplant or he will die quite quickly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This book started out with all the promise of Koontz from years gone by .Mystical and supernatural happenings mixed with human faults and desires and I could not put it down .I could n't wait to read the next line , the next chapter , and I sat through an entire afternoon and read this right the way through without stopping .I 've found in more recent books Dean Koontz seems to be trying to express and explore how good good people are against an evil force and his books have a slightly melancholy feel to them but this one was like revisiting the Koontz who wrote Watchers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The supernatual happenings really add to the story and make it all the more confusing .I spent most of the book not having a clue what was happening and how things were happening and not really knowing at all !In fact I think I thought about it too much because when we reached the conclusion I was really let down it was such a simple and obvious ending .The character of Ryan Perry is very well written and you do feel like you know him but the girlfriend Samantha is a pointless character in my opinion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some of the supporting characters are also very good , mysterious and efficient and necessary to the plot .This is a really good book for most of it and took me right back to Dean Koontz 's early work . and he was right the main character of the last few could be the same guy in each of them .Ryan Perry you 'll be pleased to hear does drink more than one beer !But the ending left me so deflated .Worse , the last chapter where we see what the characters eventually did have many of Koontz 's obsessions slotted in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Overall this is for the most part an excellent book , the characters are well described and with the exception of Samantha add alot to the plot .It 's definitely worth a read for the first three quarters but expect the obvious for the ending .I 'm going to give this 4 stars because when it 's good it 's really , really superb but I have to deduct one star for the truly awful , unoriginal ending .Comments .A guy with a heart transplant gets stalked- by the owner ?From the various things i had read about this book ( and a Dean Koontz fan )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The character Ryan Perry is not a sympathetic character and you are not drawn to him at all , therefore you do n't really feel much sympathy for him .In some ways the storyline feels rushed , and rather vague .DK is usually pretty good at building up suspense and tension , but in this book it is completely lacking .You also do n't feel that time is slipping away from him , and that his health is deteriorating .During this time he also experiences some paranoia , but again this is n't discussed in depth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Again it all seems a little too contrived and not at all believable .His paranoia returns , and he repeats his actions of part 1 , but not for any good reason .The annoying thing for me is that it could have been really good , the subject matter of organs for sale is interesting and that alone could have made a good thriller .It did n't need the supernatural element at all .Part 3 is the denouement and probably the best section of the book , as you finally understand the reasons behind the stalking and the consequences .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
