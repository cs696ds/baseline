{"text": "But what makes this scene the most upsetting one yet is that the director did n't realize he was filming a rape scene .This is what Alex Graves told Alan Sepinwall over at Hitfix : .Well , it becomes consensual by the end , because anything for them ultimately results in a turn - on , especially a power struggle .Nobody really wanted to talk about what was going on between the two characters , so we had a rehearsal that was a blocking rehearsal . ...Nikolaj ( Coster - Waldau , who plays Jaime ) came in and we just went through one physical progression and digression of what they went through , but also how to do it with only one hand , because it was Nikolaj .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In fairness , not everyone involved with the episode feels the same way .Showrunner David Benioff in particular has a far clearer take on what happens : \" She 's saying no , and he 's forcing himself on her . \"Although rape is often handled badly and sensationally , that does n't mean there 's no place for exploring it in fiction .Indeed , media that can illuminate the often - obscured reality of rape would be a welcome thing , particularly compared to the sort of the destructive , dangerous messages that so many works thoughtlessly reinforce .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
