{"text": "Tag : Masamune Shirow .Story and art by Masamune Shirow Translation by Dana Lewis and Toren Smith Lettering and retouch by Tom Orzechowski .After finishing the first two books of Appleseed , Shirow decided to try his hand at lighter fare .The result was Dominion , a series which has humorous moments , but which is n't a comedy by any means .In the bacteria - ravaged environment of Newport City , Police Sergeant Leona Ozaki and the Tank Police relentlessly pursue the notorious Buaku gang .But when Buaku kidnaps Crolis Greenpeace , an artifical life form designed to clean the atmosphere , he graduates from nuisance to global threat ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On one hand , Shirow wants it to be a light - hearted action comedy where cute mini - tanks chase each other through the city .On the other hand , he wants it to be a serious ecological story that scolds humanity for ruining the environment .Unfortunately , the two halves never quite meet .The environmental aspects seem shoehorned into the story - it 's strange to see the police so concerned with matters well out of their jurisdiction .The action comedy is a lot more appealing , but it degenerates into more serious - minded action in the final act , which does n't quite mesh with everything that 's come earlier .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They key is simplified , open panel compositions , combined with less realistic character designs and more exaggerated poses .Here 's a sample ... .There 's more linework here than in Shirow 's earlier work , but because each panel composition is boiled down to the bare essentials - just Leona or Buaku - the results feel less cramped and more open .The storytelling is equally simple , alternating between shots of Leona and Buaku , each of whom gets one side of the page all to themselves .Dominion also features the lettering of Tom Orzechowski , possibly the only person crazy enough to touch up compositions which feature transparent letters over fine hatching and forests of speed lines .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In these days when most manga sound effects go completely untranslated , it 's nice to see an example where the translated sound effects actually enhance the story .Sometimes , that extra effort is worth it .I 'd say more , but Dominion really is n't strong enough to support a more complex analysis .Ultimately , it 's a diverting but hardly memorable comic .Its sequel , however , is another matter entirely ... .Dominion : Tank Police OVAs .In 1988 , Toshiba produced a four - part straight - to - video Dominion prequel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The police torture suspects with grenades , take potshots at the soft - on - crime mayor , and casually blow up buildings - which we 're supposed to laugh at .There 's a secret government project to change the nature of the human race , and an insinuation that a - bombs would make effective police tools - which we 're supposed to take seriously .Buaku 's origin is revealed - and we 're supposed to feel sorry for him .It could all work if the series went over the top , but it does n't have the balls .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of all the adaptations of Shirow 's work , the Dominion OVAs are easily the weakest , and that 's saying quite a lot .Post A Comment .Your Name : Phone : E - Mail ( required ) : Web Site : Comment : .As his first professional work , it 's not nearly as published as it should be & mdash ; but the first two volumes , at least , have held up over the years .When the war ends , the world begins to rebuild under the direction of Olympus , a city which claims to be the last hope of the human race .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Instead , key decisions are made by a Council of philosophers and enforced by a guardian caste .In Shirow 's version , the the philosopher and guardian castes are not drawn from the human population & mdash ; instead , they 're composed of \" bioroids , \" genetically engineered to rule .In theory , the bioroids should be freed from base material desires and capable of operating as a single unit to enforce the will of the state .In practice they seem all too human & mdash ; driven by conflicting personalities and engaged in bureaucratic turf wars .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A group of human refugees conclude that while the comforts the Olympian system offers are mere distractions & mdash ; the city has robbed them their ability to set their own destinies .Led by a terrorist named Chiffon , they try to destroy Gaia , the supercomputer they ( falsely ) believe is running the show .In \" Prometheus Unbound , \" the challenges come from above .Chiffon 's revolt forces the council to conclude that human nature is incompatible with the Olympian system .Their proposal to curtail freedom and regulate thought paralyzes the bioroid population & mdash ; it might be the only hope for the human race , or it might destroy human nature itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Deunan and Briareos are incurable skeptics & mdash ; they do n't buy into the Council 's lofty ideals , but are n't persauded by Chiffon 's revolutionary rhetoric or Gaia 's meticulous reasoning , either .When they 're placed in a situation where the fate of Olympus rests in their hands , they 're finally forced to choose sides .In the end , they prove to be realists .Olympus may ultimately be a dead - end & mdash ; but half a chance is better than none .Shirow 's dialogue is still filled with technobabble and philosophical posturing , but the philosophy is integral to the story rather than a meaningless aside .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Furthermore , the story successfully functions on two levels & mdash ; casual reader can ignore all of the Olympian politics and focus on the killer robots , while those interested in a deeper experience are more likely to be entertained by Shirow 's philosophical meanderings .Shirow can be unfortunately obtuse & mdash ; even after multiple readings , it 's can be hard to figure exactly what 's going on .He 's also in love with his own technology , and has a tendency to keep dragging it out to the detriment of the story .His underlying style has n't changed much & mdash ; a side by side comparison of Deunan and Typhon would show little difference & mdash ; but his compositions are greatly improved .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The individual panels are remarkable images & mdash ; the image of the gun platform shooting up a city street is a dynamic , exciting composition .The design of the gun platform gives it a lot of personality .The rendering is phenomenal & mdash ; every piece of shrapnel and debris seems to be rendered in exquisite detail .And yet , the actions do n't flow from one panel to the next , and while individual panels have great depth .there 's no overall sense of the space these actions are taking place in .The individual character poses seem a bit stiff , which works for Kotus and Briareos but not for the human characters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Katayama manged to cover the key plot points of both volumes , but seems to have missed the point & mdash ; the politics and philosophy are pushed into the background to give us more shots of Deunan blowing things up and Hitomi in her underwear .The animation is also a bit underwhelming , and the style has n't aged well .The bioroids might not have any material desires , but they 're certainly capable of coveting power and influence .There 's also an implication that the bioroids might need these qualities to successfully perform their duties & mdash ; a dispassionate party is frequently a disinterested party , after all , and conflict prevents stasis .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is apparently an important plot point , but there 's never any payoff , which is frustrating .Sure , they look cool , they establish that Olympus has a lot of high - tech toys , and they certainly spice up the action sequences , but it 's not like they 're integral to the story in any way .Why not use some of that space to explain exactly what a \" bioroid \" is instead ?It 's such a contrived scene , though , that Shirow would have been better off leaving apple seeds out of it and letting the title stay mysterious .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When Zeus , the leader of the executors , attempts to seize power for himself , Nemesis unleshes the ultimate executor & mdash ; Duna Typhon & mdash ; to stop him once and for all .Sound familiar ?It should .The prologue introduces Typhon and her rag - tag group of rebels .Of course , they do n't actually figure in the next two chapters & mdash ; \" Bowman \" is about a Zeus 's operatives sabotaging an attempt to terraform Earth , and \" Booby Trap \" is about a special forces unit trying to stop a trio of ramping robots .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Finally , the epilogue lets us know that everything ends happily & mdash ; Zeus steps down , Typhon retires , and a year later everyone on Venus is wiped out by a nuclear war .The plot structure is weak & mdash ; it feels like three unrelated short stories shoehorned into a framing sequence , rather than three stories in sequence .The dialogue is full of technobabble and grandiose philosophical posturing .The characters are poorly defined and wooden , and there 's little in the way of character development .The beginning , ending , and all other plot twists come entirely out of left field .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This can work well if the story is engaging on a surface level & mdash ; casual readers can enjoy the explosions , while more serious - minded folk can be entertained by the philosophical underpinnings .Furthermore , the surface level is totally uninteresting & mdash ; a random string of pointless fight scenes and political posturing .He 's not a particularly accomplished draftsman or storyteller at this stage & mdash ; the art here is serviceable , nothing more .To simplify the story he snipped out all of the Venusian politics and added two cute girls for the M-66 to chase around town .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
