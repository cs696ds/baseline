{"text": "Paradoxically , it seems those express concern about how women are being depicted are the ones drawing these unfortunate lines and missing the point entirely .Essentially , I think much of the criticism leveled against Dragon Tattoo based on misogynist grounds is even more misogynist itself .Dismissing graphic depiction of this sort of violence once again marginalizes the importance of highlighting and talking about it , and covers this marginalization in a nice sheen of concern for the poor women .Which means they also do n't get the first thing about why a character such as Lisbeth Salander is at the center of this tale .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When it comes to my reading or viewing preferences , neither do I. I appreciate the fact there are so many people worried about these implications .But they do n't have the right to dismiss those , and further , implications because it 's distasteful to them , or deny the positive implications of talking about how women have to deal with them .What I think people are n't getting about the evolving depictions about women in popular literature and on screen is that the goal is not to have nothing but perfect women in perfect situations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's not always going to be pretty .It should n't be , if it has any truth in it , and the more important the truth , the messier it 's probably going to be .The whole idea is learning to see it all in a new perspective .A perspective in which women , including their challenges , failings and endurance , are taken seriously , both inside and outside the story .When it comes to the Millennium trilogy , there is something here , and whatever crime story wrappings it comes in is not justification for denying it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I agree wholeheartedly .Probably the most ridiculous example of criticism I heard of the books from a feminist was her complaining that the relationship between Blomkvist and Salander was \" typical Hollywood fantasy between a greying older man and an attractive younger woman .\" I wonder where she got the idea that Lisbeth was supposed to be mainstream attractive .She 's described as frail , menacing , and punkish , not like a Zooey Deschanel or Mary Elizabeth Winstead manic pixie dream girl type at all .Plus , their relationship went beyond the \" Hollywood \" boundaries , making them more collaborators than anything , and Lisbeth saved Blomkvist 's life more than once . @", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not sure .Thank you !I thought these books were so good , because not only did they tackle the violent ways in which women are treated badly by society , sex trafficing and rape and torture they also tackle the subtle social ways .Erika Berger 's treatment at her new magazine is such a great example of how women in the business world struggle , even when just voicing their opinion in a meeting .I was surprised that so many feminists were decrying these books , that was really disappointing .I certainly think the books get MORE feminist as you go on , which I appreciate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "shinobi42 : Thanks for pointing out Erika 's treatment - I know I missed mentioning a lot , and that was one I should have remembered .Excellent example .I also think you 're right about the third book - Annika kicks ass in that .I also loved the books .Here in Poland the first book had the true title ( \" Men Who Hate Women \" ) , which I really appreciated .That dragon tatoo marketing bull goes so strongly against Larsson 's matter - of - fact quasi - documentary approach ( btw , was I the only one strongly reminded of The Wire and Generation Kill while reading this ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think it 's fantastic to see women on a blog like this writing in defense of the trilogy .Meh .I do n't know , personally I really adored how human the books were .Salander 's dualistic nature struck a note : opinionated and dedicated on the one hand , but on the other burdened by the fact that her instinctive courage to act was long ago beaten out of her .All that pacing for dozens of minutes at a time before doing anything big certainly struck a note .And the talk about consequences .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
