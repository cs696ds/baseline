{"text": "We would always kid around with each other , and this particular day , was one of those 95 degree days , and I had been working outside on her property , so I was really sweaty and in dire need of a shower .Mary Louise felt bad for me and suggested that I take a shower before I go home .She said that she could help with the underwear since she had just purchased a new pack for her husband before he died and he never even got to open the bag .What could I say ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was shocked , but I also continued to remove my clothing .I think this was the first time that I realized that Mary Louise is a submissive female .So I thought that I should probably test out my theory .Mary Louise was done to just her bra and panties , and I was standing there stark naked .I was checking out her body when I realized that she to was checking out mine .I again commanded her to remove her bra , and to get on her knees in front of me .I told her since she is there she had better start jerking me off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was really enjoying the feeling of her hand going up and down my cock as I was playing with her tits and nipples .I noticed that if I pulled on her nipples , she would respond with several soft moans .These were the very same lips that I had tried to imagine how it would feel if my cock was placed into her mouth .I thought that I should test my submissive theory a little further , and told her to get up off her knees and lay on the bed with her head hanging off the side of the bed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I move toward her open mouth and reinserted my cock as I pushed her panties down around her knees , exposing a lovely hairy pussy .I told her I was going to fuck her throat , and then I was going to eat and fuck her lovely pussy .Since she still had my cock deep in her throat , her only response was a nod of her head and a muffled ok .I continued to play with her pussy and her great clit , which was driving her crazy , as she ate every inch of my six inch cock as I pushed it in and as far back in her throat as possible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Again , just a mumbled , ok .Her pussy was very wet , and I had three fingers in her pussy as I shot my load of cum into her mouth .She accepted all the cum that I was providing her , and just kept swallowing .This was great for me , since my wife has not swallowed my cum in over fifteen years .I told her to lick my balls while I continued to play with her pussy and tits .I could feel the inside of her pussy grabbing my fingers as I was going in and out with them , and I soon felt her beginning to cum as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She said that even though they make look somewhat alike , when it comes to sex , they are very different .I told her now that I know she is a submissive , that I plan to take advantage of her submissive nature more often , and if I had known before , I would have been fucking her for years .My last command to her was that she was not to mention any of the things that we did , or that she would never again get an opportunity to play with my cock .She agreed , and we both headed for the shower .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
