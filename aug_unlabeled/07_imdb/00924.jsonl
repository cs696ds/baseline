{"text": "Has the Downfall of Mike Myers Truly Begun ?If you went down to your local movie theater today and asked any average moviegoer who they thought was funnier , either Adam Sandler or Mike Myers , the answer you would hear most often might shock you .Sandler 's summer flick , You Do n't Mess with the Zohan , was a flop itself with a box office revenue of only $ 80 million so far .That should 've give away the answer already : Mike Myers .But the earnings have start to trickle in for Myer 's The Love Guru and it does n't sound good ( or maybe it does ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , I 'm not here to talk about actual earnings and the revenue potential of Myers , I 'm here to talk about the decline of a comedian who once was funny .Back in February I posed a similar question after Semi - Pro failed at the box office : Is Will Ferrell Burning Out ?In retrospect , I realized that was more of a talking point than an actual theory , primarily because Semi - Pro was a problem itself .Ferrell 's Step Brothers is going to hit big this summer , that 's pretty much guaranteed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And that answers Ferrell 's question - he 'll be good as long as he 's in the right movies .Myers , on the other hand , is n't working like this .The Love Guru is his first on - screen performance since 2003 and it 's downright atrocious .And now that it flopped financially , it 's time to ask : is this the start of his downfall ?There was a time , back in the early 90s , where Mike Myers was a comedian with true talent .Wayne 's World and So I Married an Axe Murderer both became instant classics and set a precedent for Myers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then again in 1999 , he followed it up with a great sequel , titled The Spy Who Shagged Me .But when the world celebrated a new millennium , it seemed like Myers started to lose his edge .He did a great job voicing Shrek in 2001 , but 2002 's Goldmember had lost that magical disco spirit that made the first two Austin Powers movies so great .And in 2003 he hit a new low - The Cat in the Hat .Now five years later he \" returns \" and it 's even worse than before .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've already shared my utter distaste for The Love Guru in a previous article and thankfully it seems the world has come to agree with me as well .The film has a measly 16 % on Rotten Tomatoes , with the only positive reviews coming from a few no - name critics , and barely made enough money to even make a dent in its rumored $ 62 million budget .I guess this goes to prove that great marketing means nothing if the movie looks like complete shit .I have no remorse for Myers and The Love Guru and can smile when I say that I 'm happy to see him fade away .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So to tie this all together with the opening question , I 'm amazed to hear that people actually prefer Myers over Sandler when he 's already six years into his downfall .What 's so great about his comedy that makes him loved by so many people ?Or is it simply his adherence to such iconic characters like Austin Powers and Wayne Campbell that they 've come to appreciate him for what he once was and not what he currently is - a comic on his way out the door .I really hate to speak so negatively about a comedian that I at one time did love myself , at least back when I was younger and when Austin Powers was funnier .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So let 's ask the audience again ...Has the downfall of Mike Myers truly begun ?well look on the bright side , atleast The Incredible Hulk could make it big no . 1 for a second week .Spider .I do n't believe that the downfall of Mike Myers has started .The reviews for this flick suggested a stupid - funny(or stupid - stupid ) movie , with a not very interesting lead character .Shades of an Austin Powers wannabe lingered in many minds , including mine .I 'm sure we 'll all be there in line if we get another Austin Powers flick .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was pretty sure that from Elf onwards , all were the worst of Will Ferrell .But he 's done one film since Elf that I 've actually liked , and that was Stranger Than Fiction .I have to say , on the Myers side of the argument .I preferred Goldmember over the other Austin Powers movies .I loved the opening to it and it was funnier .anyone who 's read my thoughts on Myers on the other page about The Love Guru knows what I think .Poor Myers is done .Pickle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The same sentiment was echoed when Jim Carrey 's \" Fun With Dick and Jane \" under performed .The best thing about Hollywood is that with the right script and great decision - making from the actors they can skyrocket to a higher level of super stardom at any given time !Best example : Robert Downey Jr. .Thoughtless .Darrin : Not happening .Estimates show Get Smart debuting at $ 39 million .Besides that fact , The Incredible Hulk is going to drop 61 % to around $ 21 million .Hell , Kung Fu Panda is tracking at that same amount so TIH may actually fall down to third with KFP edging it out with a 35.4 % or better drop .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As for the article itself .Calling Zohan a flop is a stretch in itself .Sure , it has a higher budget than most Sandler movies , but box office wise it will meet and exceed that number even if by a tiny amount ( Not counting marketing / promotional ) .Overseas wise and DVD sales will probably determine if it is a flop .However , I do n't think it is a success .More like a below average performance .A very below average performance .Prince Caspian is a flop .The Love Guru is a flop .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then again , the use of the word if ' flop ' is relative , I use it to label movies that performed abysmal .I do n't think Mike Myers is done .Is he in a downfall ?No doubt about it .But this is hollywood and a turn around is always possible ; Eddie Murphy 's late career .I do n't think it is Myers himself , acting wise , that is doing this fall , but it is the projects he is attached to .Creativity wise , he has been in some movies that range from god awful ( Cat in the Hat , Love Guru ) to completely lackluster ( Goldmember ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Myers is n't bringing anything new to the table .It feels like he is beating the same drum over and over .What Myers needs to do is take a break and tackle something new .Maybe a drama .Maybe a different brand of comedy that does n't involve toilet or slapstick humor .Maybe he needs to try something new .Knocked Up and Superbad proved that you do n't need a mega a - list star and a giant budget to make a good , entertaining and successful comedy .What Pickle said earlier is right .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But if you keep sticking to the same thing you 'll end up a joke .Alex .Should n't a downfall at least have two or more movie included .It 's one movie .I 'm not defending him .The movie blows hard .But let 's give him another chance to prove us right and bring out another flop .But something tells me with \" The Crap Guru \" having such low marks , a 4th Austin Powers will be on its way .And Verne Troyer should thank God for that because that 's the only time he ever gets work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Devon Shaw .In short : Yes .The dirty secret is , Mike Myers has n't been funny in quite a long time ... the first Austin Powers movie was like striking gold , but midway through the second movie it was pretty obvious he was just milking it for as long as it 'd go .From a personal standpoint , I have n't laughed at Myers since Wayne 's World ... but Axe Murderer was enjoyable for what it was .What this really is , is yet another SNL actor living on borrowed time .As the Queen Victoria loved to say , \" We are not amused . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Eddie Murphy 's late career has been terrible , and it seems to be getting worse ( Meet Dave ?Are you kidding me ? )Probably not even the return of Beverly Hills Cop will revitalize his career , although it 's his best shot .I think Mr. Billington is right- Mike Myers is done .Yeah , he might continue making movies , but he 's run out of material .I certainly do n't think I 'll watch any more new Myers movies , not even a return of Austin Powers .Goldmember killed that character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If Myers is smart enough to try something completely different , I might come back for him .I may be alone here , but I thought Sandler was best in Punch Drunk Love . \"Begun \" ?Marqwest .Why was this article not written after Shrek the Third ... was it not obvious from the trailer for \" The Love Guru \" that this was happening ( no pun intended ) .Btw Sandler delivered an amazing performance in \" Reign Over Me \" as well .Conrad .In response to # 1 , what the hell does bringing up the Hulk have anything to do with the question : \" Has the downfall of Mike Myers begun ? \" have to do with anything ? ? ? ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Number 10 , \" Reign Over Me \" was a dramatic performance by Adam Sandler , far from comedic .The Shrek movies got worse as they went along .I did n't even bother to see Shrek 3 cause it looks like absolute garbage - so I hear , it was . \"Cat in the Hat \" - yep garbage too . \"Goldmember \" had a great opening sequence , great cameo w / Speilberg , Cruise , Spacey , Paltrow and DeVito .But the rest of the movie was pretty lame .Not to mention the ending ! -", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think its time for Myers to either come up with better ideas or team up with someone else i.e. Will Ferrell and make a hit .Cause \" The Love Guru \" looked like garbage from the first time I heard of it , let alone the first time I saw the trailer . -Considering Alex of FS.net 's review and 16 % on Rotten Tomatoes tells me I was right .Couple more things : \" Punch - Drunk Love \" and \" Stranger Than Fiction \" were not your traditional comedies - they both fell into the satire genre .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thoughtless .Actually , looking back , I want to retract my mention of Eddie Murphy ( And him turning his career around ) .For some reason I was under the assumption that Eddie had something else going for him aside from the Dreamgirls fame .But looking at the list of movies he made in recent years , if you take out the Shrek series , it is just horrible .Norbit ?The Haunted Mansion ?Daddy Day Care ?I Spy ?I confused a sudden blip of good fortume ( Dreamgirls ) with a turn around .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Meet Dave ?Who comes up with this stuff ?Seriously .To make a comment on the Mike Myers ' question .He has n't really had that huge of a film career to truly say he 's having a downfall .Love Guru was only like Myers ' eighth staring role ( not couting Shrek ) and five of those roles were either the Wayne 's World or Austin Powers movies .Myers ' problem may be more that he insists on creating his own characters than staring in films written by other people .Ricky .Meyers has a limited amount of ammunition in his comedic arsenal , which means he 'll only be appealing in times when his sort of comedy is big .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you released \" Something About Mary \" today , I do n't think it would do as well as it did back in the 90 's .Meyers is n't necessarily washed up , he 's just pushing a type of crap that is n't going to float in todays comedic waters .What seems pretty big right now are ensemble comedies .The Apatow gang are dominating because they stick together , and the same can be said for Will Ferrel and his crew , Ben Stiller / Owen Wilson and company , and most importantly to this discussion Adam Sandler .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That guys career should be done , but he 's still around not because he stars in great movies , but because he sticks with good comedic actors .... who on their own would make terrible movies ( see Rob Schnieder films ) , but as a collective group do really well .Meyers , and Eddie Murphy for that matter would do themselves a favor by working in a good ensemble comedy .I think they 're both kind of egotistical , and want to be the star .Unfortunately I do n't think any comedic actor has staying power as a star .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now he 's just average , and I expect the same fate for Steve Carrel eventually .He 's riding high right now , and he 'll probably stick around in some capacity because he 's been a part of the Apatow / Will Ferrel groups in the past , but as a lead he 'll fade .So to answer the question , yes Meyers is past his prime , but that does n't mean he 's washed up .It just means he needs to fall in line and work on projects written by other people , and with other comedic actors who have in their own right fallen a bit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't want to see Meyers go out on the bottom , so hopefully he finds an ensemble comedy to shine in . interloper .How did they spend 62 million on this piece of trash ?Not the same genre , but for example , Serenity was filmed for 44 Mil , and is beyond infinitely better than Guru will ever be .I will always love Waynes World and Austin Powers , but he does seem to be losing it bad .Reverend .@11 , nobody was claiming that Punch Drunk Love , Stranger than Fiction , or Reign Over Me were traditional comedies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These actors can perform at a higher level when they are not in one of their traditional roles or movie styles .Movie Lover .I am one that never got the Austin Powers thing .I saw the first one in the theater .Barely laughed .There were painful , long moments of silence when really godawful jokes were made .So I never saw another one .I am not surprised this movie tanked .If Austin Powers was a D in my book , I 'm guessing this was beyond F. Mike Myers should stick to Shrek voiceovers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , in fact his downfall is about halfway through I 'd say .Tom .Axe Murderer an \" instant classic \" ?Is this a joke ?Brett .I am always amazed that people love to put he boot in and see other people fail .I intend to see The Love Guru .I think Myers is just giving people what they want and expect from him . crabby .Yes .Mike Myers has \" jumped the shark \" .You can give people what they want and do new things at the same time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Apart from hearing that Myers is an absolute ass on the set , I think the problem stems from the fact that everyone thinks he 's some sort of comedic genius and therefore no one around him dares say the word \" No \" .\" No , that 's not funny . \"\" No , that script sucks . \"\" No , I wo n't give you $ 15 million to star in that film . \"\" No , I wo n't go get you another latte because that one is not 135 degrees exactly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He should allow others to write his scripts , and immerse himself in the various characters that they create for him that he excels at so well .Comedic genius should be reserved for the like of George Carlin , who passed away last night .It 's hard to talk someone down if they made one of the most quoted / referenced franchises in the last decade .I think he just ran out of accents ; he used them all in the last Austin Powers .I think that the downfall of Mike Myers has been going on for a bit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
