{"text": "I 'm going back to watching true classic acting on TCM .P.S. Meryl Streep is in a class all her own - no one today can hold a candle to this lady 's multi - talents .She is for sure the greatest female actress alive .Now just why is n't Ryan Gosling 's name on this list of Best actor Nominees ?Somebody really messed up bad when they left him off ... also The Ides Of March and Drive should have both been on the Best Movie lists .The critics gave them high scores , the movie goers noted them as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What 's going on here ?The Descendants was one of the worst movies of the year for me .George Clooney is so monotone there is no way he can be called a great actor .Now , Meryl Streep on the other hand is a treasure for the century and she did an outstanding job with The Iron Lady .I would vote for The Actor as best film ; Jean Dujardin as the best Actor and Meryl Streep for best Actress .Best film : The Actor .George Clooney and Brad Pitt do not deserve nominations for Moneyball and The Descendants .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm never a fan of Pitt , although I am adult enough to admit he was amazing as Benjamin Button and did deserve that Oscar !I am a fan of Clooney , although I 've discovered I 'm more a fan of his face and good looks than his acting .His acting never fails to make me sleepy .I 'm not sure that he even acts rather than just plays himself in all his movies .If Clooney and Pitt get noms this year then I certainly think Dicaprio should be nominated for J. Edgar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In addition , at least his movie had some true meaning behind it .Moral of my story , whoever nominates and chooses the winners for the Oscars are the most annoying people I 've ever not met .It 's all about politics and has nothing to do with true talent .I 'm convinced Clooney and Pitt are either paying people or they 've agreed to date someone 's daughter .Pitiful how such a great movie with great acting ( Albert Brooks especially ) gets the cold shoulder because it is \" too violent \" or \" different \" than these typical Best Picture garbage spit out each year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I still ca nt understand why Jim Carrey did n't get nominated for \" Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind \" .Its my fav movie .The more I see this movie more I feel that the nomination are prejudice .Why did that chick form \" Brides Maid \" Melissa McCarthyget a nod ?she just played the role Zach Galifianakis plays in all his movies , was there something special about her part that I didin't catch ? or is it becase she 's a woman in comedy and she 's fat ?Please enlighten me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Moneyball ?Really ?What is Hollywood 's obsession with Pitt 's lack of talent .Watching him try to act is more uncomfortable than watching a little kid sing \" Tomorrow \" in a bad key .And how is there no rule against nominating a movie that was already done before and BETTER ?Without a doubt , I will not even be watching .This year was a failure .Sorry , Wes , the Acadamy eliminated best teenaged boy 's fantasy wardrobe last year .Not after the scandal of Megan Fox not getting a nod for any of the Transformer movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Wow nice Belgium film nominated ! 'Bullhead ' has a good chance , now that Iran is being sanctioned internationally surely an Iranian film wo n't win and that leaves only Bullhead since it has won a lot of awards too .Very happy mediocre films and actors like Dicaprio , Harry Potter , Twilight and others were not nominated .Biggest mistake : choosing Kung Fu Panda 2 and Puss in Boots and not Tintin ?That 's one of the best animated films ever .Plus , Bridesmaids ? C'mon , films like that are not worthy of even being invited to the Red Carpet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now it 's a minimum of five and a maximum of ten .The nominees need to have gotten a set number of top votes .It 's difficult math , but this new formula allows for a changing number every year and it assures the nominees are the ones most enthusiastically received .Wow nice Belgium film nominated !

{"text": "That 's one of the best animated films ever .Plus , Bridesmaids ?

{"text": "This is what upsets me about the Oscars : it is completely political .Where is ' Drive ' ?Ryan Gosling played an extraordinary role in this film not to mention one of the most stellar soundtracks to any film I have ever seen and not one bid in any category .Once again Leonardo DiCaprio gets the shaft from the Academy .I ca n't believe Michael Fassbender did n't get a nod for Shame .I 've been watching the Oscars for years and every year deserving actors , actresses and pictures get overlooked because the academy members do not take into account the movie going public in their decisions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Leonardo DiCaprio is LONG overdue for an Academy Award .He 's had numerous deserving roles , but he never gets the credit for it .He 's one of the greatest actors of this generation , but he never gets the respect he deserves from the Academy .This year has been really lacklustre for movies .This should make the run for best picture interesting because there is no clear cut winner .I am very unenthused about this list .Where are the powerhouse films ?Every year in recent memory has had at least one film that could sweep audiences out of their chairs and leave them stunned , but this year , nothing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Meryl Streep again ? really again ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?how can you say this is n't a political best friends party self suckfest when its the same crap every year .I 'm so glad my generation is burning and looting this industry with the help of the internet .We saw Contraband and War Horse , both great and exceptionally good .I am surprised that Contraband did n't get in there .The reason why I think this is because it is such a good movie about smuggling , a violent and dangerous ' occupation ' , but not displaying a lot of violence , more mental strategy , great movie and Mark Wahlberg , is great in it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's also a terrible movie , it only got a 48 % fresh rating on rotten tomatoes .Looks like another dumb Marky Mark action movie like Shooter .And you wonder why it was n't nominated for an oscar ?Seriously ? \"The Tree of Life \" was nominated for best picture , and Malick for best director ?I heard many people actually booed and walked out of this film , because it was so bad .I guess the Hollywood \" elite \" think more of it than the commoners ... .The Tree of Life is the best movie ever !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Did you watch it at least twice ?I did , 6 times ! ! ...:P .I think Meryl Streep should win best actress .As a matter of fact , I think she should have won several times before this , but I guess the Academy thinks after you 've won a few times or if you 're over 40 that you 're done .She 's the best actress of our time and for someone to beat her again for an Oscar is a joke .No one is better than Meryl .Maybe that 's the problem .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's been nearly 30 years since Ms. Streep won for \" Sophie 's Choice \" .She is inarguably the most spectacular film actress of our time .Her body of work is astounding .She is long overdue for the Academy Award and deserves it for Iron Lady \" .Trevor , I agree with you .I wish they would make better movies and then maybe I would go back to the movie theatres .I prefer watching TCM for their wonderful classic movies and save money at the same time .Yet , you care enough to read through an article and take time out of your day to post about it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'll be awaiting your \" The Oscars suck so bad \" comments after you spend 4 hours watching the entire telecast just to let people know how much it sucked .Get a life , man .it is a SHAME that Michael Fassbender did n't get nominated for shame -_- Oscars are getting a lil old when the same people win every time by that I mean Clooney / Streep do n't get me wrong they are good actor but just give a recognition to new talent ! !The Help nominated for Oscar ?Why ?Because it was about black people who were working ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "People are trying to show they are not racist too hard .The Help sucked as a movie .My vote would go for Hugo or Midnight in Paris .You are probably one of those racist people making this comment !If it was an all white cast you probably would think it was the greatest movie such as ..... drum roll please ................ Girl With The Dragon Tatoo !Yuck ! merit ? are you kidding , you must be kidding .you know that they lobby and spends lots of cash to influence the voting .you probably think the motion picture rating system is unbiased and solely based on content applied fairly and squarely accross the board as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am white and not prejudice as you seem to be and if you want people of any color to work then get rid of Obama .Now as to The Help , it was a good film that had heart and humor with great acting from two black actresses .But Hugo and Midnight in Paris ? ? ?Just more artsy films from Scorsesse and Woody Allen ( critics favorites ) who 's best work is behind them and no matter what they make the Academy swoons over them .The Academy has lost it 's credibility years ago anyway and their little awards mean nothing , i mean come on The English Patient , Shakespeare in Love and Crash as best picture ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
