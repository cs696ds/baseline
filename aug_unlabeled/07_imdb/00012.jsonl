{"text": "Sometimes they 're a metaphor .Mostly they 're just a lot of fun .But the best movie monsters have a way of terrorizing audiences long after they 've stopped terrorizing their respective villages ( or what have you ) , even the monsters we know do n't exist in the real world .From a great white shark to parasitic extraterrestrial life forms , here 's a ranking of the top 10 terrorizing movie monsters . \"Gremlins \" ( 1984 ) : When gifting your teenage kid a pet , stick to dogs .Because if you buy him an exotic pet from a mysterious Chinatown antique shop that comes with a rule as nonsensical as \" never , ever feed it after midnight \" ( when does \" after midnight \" end ? ) , of course he 's going to break it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And just because the film is funny does n't mean it is n't scary ; good luck ever watching \" Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs \" again without half expecting a horde of tiny monsters to claw through the screen and attack you . \"Jurassic Park \" ( 1993 ) : It 's hard to believe this movie was made more than 20 years ago .Not because it makes us feel old , but because a film this special - effects heavy usually does n't look so fresh after a couple of decades .But if anyone knows how to use special effects to enhance a story 's telling , it 's Steven Spielberg .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's a cautionary tale about playing God wrapped in that billion - dollar - grossing thrill ride , but you 're more likely to spend your time from that first reveal of a Brachiosaurus to the final roar of the T. rex wondering where Spielberg found real dinosaurs .The special effects may have gotten better , but none of Godzilla 's iterations subsequent to director Ishiro Honda 's introduction captured the monster as a metaphor for the nuclear age in the same way . \"Alien \" ( 1979 ) : \" In space no one can hear you scream .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And plenty of people did scream when that first chestburster ruined dinner ( and John Hurt 's torso ) in Ridley Scott 's sci - fi - horror masterpiece .And that was just the first of many screams as the seven - member spaceship crew is systematically slaughtered by an alien life form designed by surrealist artist H. R. Giger - one that terrorized its way into the movie - monster hall of fame ( and a few sequels too many ) . \"An American Werewolf in London \" ( 1981 ) :Well , of course the guy who made the \" Thriller \" music video also made a perfect horror film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But part of what makes that transformation so good is the writing and character work that surrounds it ; it 's a charming mix of gore and guffaws , a horror film with the wry smirk of a black comedy .\" Frankenstein \" ( 1931 ) : With all due respect to Lon Chaney and Bela Lugosi , Boris Karloff was the best movie monster of the Universal Horror era as Dr. Frankenstein 's mad - science experiment gone awry .\" The Fly \" ( 1986 ) : Most monster movies pit a human hero against an inhuman foe , with a clear - cut line demarcating good and evil , and who should have your sympathies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Progressively more horrifying makeup work and creature effects transform Brundle into \" Brundlefly \" until a final transformation strips away everything that was human about him , save the emotions .\" The Thing \" ( 1982 ) : Horror - movie master John Carpenter unleashed some of the most terrifying creature effects ever put to film and sent bearded Kurt Russell after them with a flamethrower in the most viscerally upsetting film on this list .A small crew cloistered from the cold at an Antarctic research station spirals into paranoia when they unearth a parasitic alien life form that assimilates and imitates other organisms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But the physical horrors are just as unsettling , taking different forms - mutilated dogs , a chest cavity with teeth , a decapitated head that sprouts spider legs - and never allowing the viewer to acclimate . \"King Kong \" ( 1933 ) : It 's an icon for a reason .There 's the fact that it was a hugely ambitious special - effects spectacle when it was made , a treasure - trove of stop - motion animation complete with Kong fighting a T. rex .There 's nothing not cool about that , but the film is more than just the sum of its groundbreaking special effects ( if that 's all it took , we 'd hold Peter Jackson 's 2005 remake in much higher esteem ) . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
