{"text": "The film is colourful beyond all reason , witty despite its inflated sense of broad comedy , and most importantly , an entertaining take on a tired formula .Miike has slowly grown from a capable technician into a truly incendiary modern filmmaker , and has often proven a more acute authority of his craft than most of his form over function contemporaries , who tend to lose control of coherency while embracing their flash .In my review of the director 's second attempt at children 's entertainment , The Great Yokai War , I praised Miike for his intuitive streak , and once again he manages to create indelible and creative images on a small budget and quick turnaround .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite the title , and early word , Sukiyaki Western Django is n't a remake of Sergio Corbucci 's seminal and often mimicked Spaghetti Western classic Django .Accounting for Yojimbo and Fistful 's statements on American Western , and their post - modern nature , Sukiyaki Western Django is actually some kind of third generation comment on popular Westerns ( a post - post - post modern film ? )To this end the film is chock - full of in - jokes and references , not only referring to Corbucci , Leone , and Kurosawa , but to just about every other home town influence on Miike 's craft .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like Tarantino 's Kill Bill movies , Miike 's film will likely divide viewers between those of us susceptible and accepting of a feature that runs on referential imagery rather than traditional narrative , and those of us bored by statements on films we 've never heard of .Miike is n't able to make an ' important ' film with the material , but I do n't think I 'd consider it disposable entertainment , though I 'm guessing Miike 's less supportive critics are n't going agree with me .Video .Miike 's pallet is just about colourful enough to induce an epileptic seizure , and his contrast levels are enough to blind a gopher .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The results are a clear cut case of style over substance , but it 's hard to resist these harsh whites , deep shadows , and over - saturated colours .Picky viewers may complain about a few bleeding hues , but I 'm reasonably sure this was Miike 's desired effect .I would n't call this a reference disc , but you are n't likely to find brighter or more solidly represented colours on many other live action discs .Sometimes the transfer can become very grainy , but this is also obviously done on purpose to further the over - the - top stylization .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Concerning the dialogue track , the back of the box is n't lying when it refers to the language spoken as English .As part of this whole weird experiment Miike opted to record the Japanese actors speaking phonetic English .Unfortunately , most of the dialogue is so butchered that the English subtitle track is a requirement .Extras .Our rather slim extras begin with a fifty - two minute long making - of featurette , made up of oodles of behind the scenes footage and interviews with the key players , all narrated in Japanese .Next up are a series of deleted scenes ( not in hi - def ) , all of which would 've slowed the film 's breakneck pace , and a collection of trailers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
