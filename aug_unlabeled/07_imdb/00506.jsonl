{"text": "Theaters Working To Make Even The Pre - Show Ads More Entertaining .from the good - for - everyone dept .That 's why it 's somewhat encouraging to see that movie theaters are now experimenting with much more entertaining and interactive \" pre - show \" advertising .They 're doing things like using motion sensors to have the audience \" play \" a game as a group , or having them use their mobile phones to vote on certain questions on the screen and immediately showing the results .That latter example may be doubly surprising considering how theaters these days are so anti - mobile phone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Improving the overall experience is much more important than making the pre - show ads better , so hopefully this is only one small part of what theaters are working on these days .It 's a relief .I just saw a movie , and while it did n't have any interactive content at the beginning , the ads were almost all creative and entertaining .There was one ( IMO ) boring , same - old soft drink commercial , but compared to when I would grit my teeth and consider complaining to the management that I was paying to watch commercials , the rest of them were a pleasant surprise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I will accept advertising at a movie when they can get the things framed and focused .Oh and appropriate sound levels to allow pre - show conversation would be great too .The last two movies I went to were out of focus and out of frame .When I went to tell someone , they looked at me like I asked for free popcorn .The last movie I had to go out twice during the movie before they would fix anything .Fix the movie experience and I do n't care what content you throw at me before the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have a huge TV , a nice surround - sound system and a comfy couch .The last time I was in a movie theater was 4 years ago and I 'll probably never go to one ever again , unless it 's for a presentational meeting for my job .Movie theaters are , for the most part , out - dated , badly managed and do n't make for a very good time , as far as experiencing a movie goes .Making the advertising that you see before a movie more entertaining is sort of a step in the wrong direction , or at least blatantly ignoring the real issues that people have with going to see movies in a theater .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Clean up the pee / vomit , mercilessly kick out the talkers , tone down the air conditioning and we 'll see .I 'll pay to avoid ads .Open a theater that has reasonable pre - show entertainment , and I will cheerfully go 20 minutes early to see it ( and probably spend $ 20 for a popcorn and a drink ) .There 's no scenario where I will seek out ads , period .Right now my strategy is to get to the theater 5 minutes after the advertised show time .Of course , I do n't get a great seat , and sometimes I still get advertising , and sometimes I miss a few minutes of the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's true that advertising should be entertaining if it must exist , but many of us will spend a price premium ( in the form of higher ticket prices or more concession purchases ) to avoid it altogether .Cell phone voting .That latter example may be doubly surprising considering how theaters these days are so anti - mobile phone .Actually , I think it might benefit as it helps make sure people 's minds are engaged about their ' phones right before the movie starts , and it gives them a reason to have them out so they can silence them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My two cents on the eve of a long weekend .Keep your fingers , everyone .Re : Cell phone voting .People do n't turn their phones off because they 've forgotten about them .\" Turning off phones is something everyone else should do , not me .\" I bit the bullet and went and saw \" Indiana Jones \" in a theater a few weeks ago instead of waiting for the DVD like I do most movies and it was ridiculous .One teenage asshole even went so far as to start playing his mp3s out loud on his iPhone during the parts of the movie he found boring-- basically anything without explosions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've never seen anything like it .Of course it 's situations like that that make being a cop rather convenient .Tell the kid to turn it off once and after you get the finger , yank him up and start putting the cuffs on him for disturbing the peace .His \" fuck everyone \" attitude suddenly disappears and the tears and begging and apologies take its place real quick .Bottom line , that 's the last movie I 'll go to in a theater for the foreseeable future .My home theater 's visual and audio capabilities rival a theater presentation without any of the crap-- babies crying , people talking , cell phones ringing , parking charges , lines , uncomfortable seats , traffic , drive time-- none of it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Games .I played a group game like this while waiting in line in Disney World .It was a lot of fun and get the crowd doing something other than sitting around .But the quality was pretty bad .If you 're able to identify your personally little blob on the screen and start waving to pop the balloons ( or whatever it is in the game ) , it seems woefully inaccurate .The most fun was the racing game where the crowd steers by leaning .I do n't see how that would work on a theater , though , with one crowd .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a good time waster , but not fantastic .Here 's my take on this .I do n't care how freakin ' entertaining the ads are , I just want less of them .The last two times I 've been to the theater , I had to to endure a whopping half hour ( read : 30 MINUTES ) of trailer previews and corny theater ads before the movie I paid to see actually started .That is from the advertised movie start time until the time the movie actually began .I can understand 10 or 15 minutes , but 30 minutes is absolutely outrageous ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Um , yes , we know the theater is a digital theater .It looks great .We do n't need a 5-minute commercial with a dozen corny testimonials from \" actual customers \" to tell us that .If anything , that makes me want to not want to come back to that theater even more so .Another thing I seem to recall that while waiting for Kung Fu Panda to start ( great movie btw ) , some of the trailers being shown had more adult - oriented ratings than the movie I actually paid to see .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That is completely unacceptable .Trailers shown in a particular theater should never exceed the rating of the feature movie you 've come to see , for obvious reasons .Plus , they should be relevant to the type of film you 're seeing as well .There are movies I still want to see on the big screen , but I am going to think twice before going to the theater again and having to sit through all that crap .My home theater is pretty darn nice now with a 40 \" LCD and surround sound , the couches are much more comfortable than the theater chairs , and the snacks are a heck of a lot cheaper .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Amen Brad !I 'll give ya ten bucks to sit on the floor , if you 'll share your junior mints .( Junior Mints is a registered trademark of Tootsie Roll Industries , Inc. used without permission , though in sincere admiration .... please do n't sue . )Ads .I do n't mind seeing a few ( meaning 4 or 5 ) trailers before a movie , but I 've enough with the commercials which were literally shown on TV the night before !If I wanted to see TV commercials , I 'll stay at home .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was about to say \" get the movie on DVD \" , but we all know how loaded DVD 's are with commercials and trailers , and other junk you ca n't skip .Are we talking about pre - show like the stuff that plays at 9:30 for a 9:30 showing , or the stuff that plays at 9:15 for a 9:30 showing ?Big difference .I think most of the comments here are about the former , not the latter .Re : .It seems to me that people are talking about the former , rather than the latter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I like to see the big - screen trailers of upcoming movies , most of the time .Even if it 's a movie that I 'd never consider watching in a million years .I think of ads at the theater , I think of the stuff that gets played before the scheduled start time .I have only rarely seen true ads after that point .Why even go to a theater anymore !You end up wasting money on a half - assed movie with pathetic CGI ; with highly anticipated preview - scenes not even being in the final cut .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Darn it I miss the drive - in theaters , sitting in my dads 53 merc with my date snuggled up next to me , 6 pack of beer hidden under the seat , the movies may have been garbage but we sure did enjoy going to the movies .Ads suck -- especially army ads .I hate the advertising .I 've grown to accept ( and sometimes enjoy ) the trailers ; but the ads are just an invasion .My pet peeve : I think the US uses its military as a bully tactic : killing innocents ( and some bad guys ) and ruining cultures and economies ( including our own ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So when I have to sit and watch an add for how great the army is , I just want to puke .They show those ads on TV too , but at least I can change the channel or turn off the TV .It just really pisses me off at the theater .I still like going to the movies with my friends .Recently I realized that I am the only one of my RICH friends who does n't through my drink on the ground at the end and then walk out .I think people need to learn a bit more respect .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think that the theaters need to change and get a bit cheeper before people stop complaining .Another thing that would help the theater industry is some good movies .And interactivity would be great .Because in the past I have considered taking my iPod out so that I could listen to some music I got board during the movie .I did n't because it makes me look like an ass hole .But I am still willing to go to a theater vs downloading off the internet because of instant gratification .I would also say that at times that the projection is way off the screen and I would say they could start with that fix that takes about five minutes or less to accomplish .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
