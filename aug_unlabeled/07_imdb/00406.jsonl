{"text": "The recent surge in use of remotely - controlled robot aircraft by US forces for the Wars on Stuff has meant that substantial numbers of American pilots are now being pulled off normal flight status and assigned to drone - driving duty , according to reports .An AP article revealed the trend on Wednesday .Many current American robo ... .Sad .Just sad .So those flying \" robots \" , which are truly just costly RC - planes , allow thickly bespectacled lard - asses to be \" fighter \" pilots .Wow .You had to be a highly trained specimen of physical excellence to be allowed anywhere near the controls of a fighter jet up until now .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But in the medium term they 'll realise that what makes ' pilots ' special is mostly training and physical requirements , neither of which is anywhere near as important when driving a drone from a desk - even if the desk is in a combat zone .The actual job of flying is pretty simple , especially in more complex aircraft .The systems management bit maybe is n't so easy , but that can be spun off to a specialist trained in operating the hardware , with the person flying the platform not having to worry so much about what the systems are up to .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
