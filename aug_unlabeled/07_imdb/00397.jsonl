{"text": "The Last Airbender 2 - Sequel Plans .There 's been a lot of Last Airbender 2 talk in recent weeks .So what has been said and how likely is a sequel ?With a production budget of $ 150 m , and $ 130 m spent on marketing , Paramount want a worldwide take of $ 280 m before greenlighting any Last Airbender sequel .The first movie has grossed $ 115 m so far in the US and will likely finish around $ 140 m , but it is yet to open in most major territories around the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Significantly , a Last Airbender sequel would reportedly cost less than the original movie .But while a healthy number of people flocked to see it ( based on the popularity of the TV series , Shyamalan 's name still being a draw , and the family - friendly subject matter ) , the reaction from nearly all was crushing disappointment .92 % of critics disliked or hated it .While the fans had this to say - .Remarkably , this reaction does n't seem to have phased writer - director M.Night Shyamalan much .Maybe he 's used to it after Lady In The Water and The Happening .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The 3D will be much improved , as M.Night plans to actually shoot in 3D this time , rather than convert after filming is complete .So the question posed here is can a movie that is hated equally by critics , fans and general audiences alike , but that breaks even financially and has a director determined to push forward , get a sequel ?Paramount will probably wait for Blu - ray / DVD sales before deciding .Watch this space .What would you like to see happen in any Last Airbender sequel ?How can they improve on the first movie ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Share This Post .From Around The Web .I 'm sorry , but comparing The Last Airbender movie to an x - men movie is like comparing a gourmet meal at a 4 star restaurant to a piece of garbage out on the street .There 's no way you can compare the two .Bryan Singer made the X - Men movies very exciting , there 's absolutely nothing exciting about TLA film !The filmmaking in TLA was awfully boring ( despite the unfair representation of the casting ) .I did n't give a crap about any of the characters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

K.

{"text": "And to say that it would be hard to take the effects in the cartoon and make it realistically believable in a movie is another dumb excuse as well .Technology has come a long way and Shyamalan was working with a really big budget .Unfortunately , he lacked the expertise in this movie genre which would have been more suited for someone like Steven Spielberg ( just as an example ) .Well , i know exactly what it takes to make a film and all the hard work and technicalities that it involves .There was no excuse for the M.

{"text": "But what I realized is that every director is going to make their own changes .The thing is , they have to make these movies to appeal to a wide range of viewers .not just the immediate fan base .So its understandable that Goku was a dweeb in the movie , and that the Piccolo(namkien ) story is all jacked up .So then its understandable that abilities were changed where the fire nation can not normally create a flame , it appears that only a master of the fire technique or during a comet can the fire nation members create a flame .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But honestly ; they 'll go see it anyways .Just like I 'd go see another terrible attempt at a Dragonball Z movie - its because I 'm a loyal fan of the show and like to watch it come to life .I love this kind of logic , I really do .So do you not hate any movie , ever ?Because I do n't see you directing anything .That must mean everything is AMAZING because you ca n't do it !Oh wait , life does n't work that way .Just because YOU can not do it does n't mean that YOU can not tell when it is crap .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "He could 've made the effects seem real like X - MEN , Spiderman , or Batman films considering the budget .I do n't see how this is the best he can do when he had such a big budget for this film .It 's as if he just wanted to get the film done quickly as possible just to make money and not really care about the quality of the animated show .If you 're going to adapt a full feature from a popular show that was known for being high quality , you better at least let the audience care and be interested in something besides just the special effects ( even if he has to make more films ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I can understand Shyamalan 's need to minimize the humor , but he completely diminished Sokka 's character as a whole .Rathborne 's acting did not make it any better and any attempt at humor on his part just went over my head .There was a reason Sokka was the way he was and I felt as if this was not explored at all in the movie .... hence what most people 's complaint is about : lack of character development .That does not require the use of additional screens and extending the length of the movie as opposed to what most people think .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Lastly , my biggest complaint about the movie will always be about the casting .No I will not give a lengthy speech about the unfairness of not using Asian - American or Inuit - based actors or whether or not I think Shyamalan and Paramount are a bunch of racists .Simply , I do not know nor do I understand their reasoning for doing it .However , I will say that simply saying that they used Asian and other ethnic actors to portray the cultures of the different nations and especially casting Dev Patel as Zuko is a dumb excuse to something that they know that they knowingly and personally did .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So what if they made me believe that the culture of the film was highly diverse and Asian - inspired ?It did absolutely nothing when I look at the main characters and all I see are a bunch of White - American children acting as if they fit into Asian society .It was just another way of forcing American viewers to associate White - Americans as the heroines in society .That story is old and I am tired of it .So there ....I may not have convinced you that the movie was horrible , but I gave you my reasoning in order to justify why I thought it was not as good as people try to make it seem just simply because they wish for an ATLA movie . which was what the movie was based upon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And somehow I doubt anyone will really attempt to cross that road again unless they continue to re - birth that franchise .The same could be said about Harry Potter .I read all the books and really love them .I think the movies absolutely do not justify the books ; however , I have seen every movie and like every single one of them in their own way .I believe despite the many changes , and the omitting of important plots and events that causes fans to create uproar , the movies were a huge success and utilized every dime awarded to them to make the best of them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "just one fight after another .but they have to continue the series .they ca nt make one movie and stop .there are 3 books so there must be 3 movies .i think mikes right .it jus seemed as if they were jumping from scene to scene and the only thing that supposedly kept the story together was the girl tellin it inorder to fill the gaps .Hello All , I am a 33 year ole father and never really got into the cartoons untill my kids got the avator ( last airbender series ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As a first - timer to the last airbender , i found myself and my family lost through the first - half of the movie .We like the story and would like to see the sequel , but would like to see more cohesion between scenes and story .I understand the fire nation is cracked(or seems to be)but there was not enough of a backgound in the beginning to make any of the characters all that important .Whoever wrote the script is the one to be crucified , for not following the storyline to begin with .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie feels lioke the person who made the script did not care about the story or have any feeling what - so - ever , they just put things on paper to make someone else satisfied and not even happy .My 5th grader puts more care and cohesion into what she writes than the person who wrote this script(sorry ) .It 's good to give opinions but give solutions too .Chose someone else to write the script , actors do what is put before them ( though there are bad actors ) but if you give bad bad will come out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I watched Book One when it was aired on television , and I admit that though this movie could be better , it was n't as horrible as everybody seems to make it out to be .Also , stop telling these people to get lives .Clearly they 're passionate about this .I 'm the same way with Harry Potter ( btws , Chris Columbus and Richard Harris made the first two movies so fantastic . )Yes , some of the graphics seemed cheesy , but , think about the special effects that are needed to create the water bending the way it is portrayed in the cartoon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I agree M. Night could have definitely put more effort into this , though .The characters were very impersonal , and I think that could have been corrected if they focused more on character development instead of FX .HOWEVER On a whole , this movie was good , and I definitely want to see the other two Books be created .They may definitely want to find a director who is much more used to action movies that get your adrenaline going , though .But seriously people .Real life can only do so much .It ca n't replicate cartoons , because cartoons are fantasy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'd be fine with M. Night directing it .Have someone else write it , preferably Mike and Bryan spearheading the writing .Also get Sifu Kisu to help with directing the CG for the bending arts .Although , a remake would be nice ; perhaps even a computer animated remake with the original voice actors as well ?Also recast Zuko , they did in Twilight , they can do it here .Bumping it up to PG-13 would help a lot !If kids are watching Ironman 2 and Transformers they can handle a bit more violence and scary sequences in the second Airbender movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "T_T A little more character development and Aang and Appa time would be nice too .I 'm a huge fan of the series and it sucks to know that there is more overall awesomeness in a 23 minute tame episode of Avatar than in the movie ...Also PLEASE make it longer !Perhaps that could fix some of the HORRIBLE pacing issues ! !If a sequel is created , I only hope that Mike and Bryan can play a bigger part , and that more emotion is put into the characters . also IT 'S AANG ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "WOO for the Cabbage Man ! !I do n't know why everyone 's freaking out over this , it 's just a movie .And of course it 's not going to follow the series exactly , that 's not even possible without making it ridiculously long .But I would agree that pronouncing the names RIGHT would be a good thing !And whoever said to re - cast Zuko , I could live with that as well .But in all honestly , calm down people , you all sound obsessive and kind of stupid .If you have such strong opinions over a simple movie , you have bigger things to worry about .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For one , the actors WERE decent , just of the wrong race .If actors are given BAD direction , well , TLA will be born .I wrote a screenplay myself ( I am not a professional ) and it was 60 pages for the first movie .You just take out the superfluous stuff .That cut out a significant chunk of that particular episode , and made it go faster , but still had fun , and had the major plot points .Taking a lot out , but putting the MAIN parts in !It 's possible , and snippets here and there make it manageable without completely putting the middle finger up to the fans who loved the playfulness and non - Americanness of the show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I DO like M Night Shymalan 's PREVIOUS movies , my fav.s are The Sixth Sense , Signs , and The Village .NOW , I hesitate when it comes to his movies , because he did such a terrible thing to TLA .Not only did he butcher the screenplay , but he made it so that it will be a long time before a GOOD movie is made of it .Just like what happened with The Golden Compass , even though that was n't a bad movie , because it was ' controversial ' nobody will touch the other books ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I thought the fight scenes and the special effects were great .I loved the way they blended martial arts with magic to make the bender fights .That saying I can recognise that some of the writing was really quite bad .I love M. Night 's movies , so i would be happy to see him direct the next one but i would n't be unhappy if someone else put their own stamp on it .If anything get new writers at the very least .But it would be a shame if they just left it to rot without trying anything , this series has the potential of being fantastic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His piece of crap movie is universally hated and panned by fans , critics , and even kids who do n't know any better hated it .WHHYYYY the hell does he want to do a sequel ?Does he not see that we all hate him and his cruddy work ?Does he not see that no sane person would let him touch any more of the Avatar series with a 10 foot pole ?I do n't normally wish people physical harm , but does he not see that we all wish someone ran over his fingers so that he could just stop writing ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like I do n't even understand why he even tacks his name to movies anymore .His name serves as a red flag for me to stay the hell away .What this movie needs is a do - over with a different director , not a sequel .And it also needs a Restraining Order from M. Night Shyamalan ASAP !If they make a sequel with M. Night , I wo n't see it .He is a douche !I could n't agree more with you guys .I 'm huge fan of the series and I never liked the idea of M. Night directing this movie because I saw Signs and The Happening and they are just awful , awful movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I really would like to know their reactions on this mess of a movie .I do n't believe that they agree this movie is good .Can someone please let me know if they react to the movie .AAAHHH ! ! !THE SKY IS FALLING ! , THE BRITISH ARE COMING ! , M.NIGHT SHYLAMAN DIRECTEDA MOVIE ! ! !LOL .M.Night FIRED ! ! !and Peter Jackson HIRED ! ! !So much so everyone is concerned of M.Night direction .the hoops & the blah blahs bluffing idiots .calling end to his movies direction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I truly hope The Last Airbender makes 380 mil .I ca n't believe how low you guys are .You have never created anything so it seems like you should attack anyone that can .M. Night Shyamalan is an incredible director and if all of you could think for yourself you might see this .Instead you jumped on the bigot bandwagon- hate everything M. Night Shyamalan does .The movie has made 133 million and has only opened up in 7 overseas markets .Which means a whole lot of people liked it .People will enjoy this movie because it has a good story and badass action scenes with great cgi .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She could n't have raised here eyebrows anymore when speaking .... but there were also the actors that really shined like Dev Patel , as well as the uncle .Aang was n't the greatest but he had the perfect look for the role , which went a long way .The environments were nice and music was solid .Like any movie you can sit and criticize it all day long , but none of the fanboys posting here have made a movie , and 99.9 % never will .So come off of your lowly horses , sit back and enjoy a great piece of film . lastly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Come off it Fanboys !I am a huge fan of the TV show .I bought all episodes off Itunes and watch them quite a bit .Remove the problems with the names ( Ahng instead of AAng was the worst ) , the acting was fine with what they had to work with .( The poorest casting was Admiral Zhou .Must have been a friend of MNS ) .My problem with the movie was that there was no character development .In any book or movie , character development is one of the main pieces that have to be there - and there really was n't any .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What would they do in this sepcific situation .Without character development , you have nothing .Another part that I am upset about is many of the very important pieces of the movie are missing .There is no connection to the past Avatar 's , instead , Aang has a connection to Roku 's dragon ?What is the Avatar state .Is it a connection to Roku , or Roku 's dragon .Can he control the Avatar state ?Looks like he can in the film .So now we have removed a ton of the best story writing for garbage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That is totally missing from the Movie .So what is going to happen in book 2 and 3 when this suddenly appears ?Or is MNS going to leave that all out as well ?What about Aang 's avertion to killing ?We saw he had an avertion to using Water Bending in the movie , but we have no idea why .And Aang 's avertion to killing is at the heart of the third book .We also do n't see his aversion to using Fire Bending , which is also an important part of book 3 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Otherwise , he might as well re - write the whole story line and call everyone by a different name , and call the movie ( The Last Guy that can move Air with his mind ) because it will be nothing like the TV series at that point .Or maybe it sold so much because despite the directors horrid directing the fans of the series want to support it ...Honestly if you have n't watched the tv series then stfu .Your opinion fails for ignorance .The entire thing would have been better if the shows creators had been given the chance to help .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "So what if people are blaming Shyamalan , he did it to himself .Instead of trying to adapt a beloved animated series ( that was well liked by kids as well as adults ) into live action , he 's actually made it worse ... makes the cartoon look bad .That is true that some movies are better , but I did n't think it was horrible at all .I ca n't remember the water bender 's name , but the brother was not as funny in the movie as he was in the cartoon .I really liked the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My three year old daughter even liked it and usually she does not get into the adult type movies .Instead give them advice rather than criticize them ; for example make the water benders brother more comical in his actions .I thought The Last Airbender movie was pretty good , even if it did cut some parts out of the series .But also keep in mind that it takes alot to make any movie .Finding the right actors for the parts , sets , costumes and filming .Plus maybe this was some of the actors ' first time doing a film , perhaps they were nervous .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
