{"text": "Instead they found a new \" star , \" one - hit sexploitation star Shulamith Lasri ( christened onscreen as \" Sharon Lesley \" ) , who , to state the obvious , is no Laura Gemser .Fortunately the sequel offers a string of other insane ingredients to compensate , starting with an opening montage showing our new Emanuelle in a variety of ridiculous degradation scenarios ranging from a police state inquisition to a southern plantation .It turns out these scenarios are all part of the warped psyche of our title character , who 's suffering from a series of sexual neuroses and acute amnesia at a posh mental clinic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Cable viewers probably did n't care , though some of the more sadistic moments wound up getting excised from many TV and video prints .Fortunately Severin 's disc appears to be complete , and while the feel is very , very different from the Laura Gemser cycle and often feels more akin to a sexy blaxploitation outing translated by a lunatic Italian , trash fans should find plenty to enjoy .The anamorphic transfer looks fine given the source ( do n't be alarmed by the scratchy opening logo ) , though the photography is pretty much confined to bland medium shots .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Extras include the English theatrical trailer ( \" Love and cruelty can unite in the strangest of human needs ! \")Though no characer in the film is actually named Emmanuelle , director Brunello Rondi ( best known for writing lots of Fellini films ) keeps things well within the series template by including lots of travelogue footage interspersed with plenty of softcore sex scenes .The real curio factor here is the fact that Gemser and Belle happen to be teamed up with their real - life boyfriends at the time , Gabriele Tinti and Al Cliver respectively , though oddly enough their screen time together ranges from bland to flat - out unpleasant .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They also spend some time with new age mystic Horatio ( Cliver ) , who expands his spiritual horizons by having public three - ways in an Egyptian temple , and Laura and Pina make out here and there .Other miscellaneous supporting characers including breast implant queen Susan Scott drift in and out , usually without even getting character names , and ... well , that 's pretty much it .Usually circulated in drastically edited prints which excise most of the good stuff , the film was also one of the few Gemser vehicles shot in scope and has naturally suffered terribly via lousy pan and scan transfers for years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The image quality ranges from scene to scene depending on the film stock and lighting conditions , but the transfer itself looks fine ( albeit interlaced for some reason ) .Surprisingly , the disc includes both the familiar English dub ( which is n't bad ) and the Italian dub track as well , with optional English subtitles .Both ways work fine , though the latter feels a bit classier with better - matched voices .And finally we reach the big prize of the set , Emanuelle and the White Slave Trade , the last and rarest of the Gemser / D'Amato Black Emanuelle films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "D'Amato keeps thing moving fast and hilariously throughout , and the dubbing is even more absurd than usual with the quick - to - peel Galleani saddled with one of the goofiest British accents you 'll ever hear .Nico Fidenco 's score is easily his most disco - influenced , dropping the familiar \" Black Emanuelle \" theme in favor of a bouncy , wildly overplayed ditty entitled \" Run Cheetah Run . \"Gemser and Tinti have even less interaction than usual , mostly observing each other covertly or from afar and sharing an occasional drink here and there ; luckily the story itself is so lunatic that most viewers wo n't even notice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "However , a sure contender for the second most outrageous entry is easily Emanuelle Around the World , a flagship title in Severin Films ' marvelously titled collection , \" Black Emanuelle 's Box .\" The original Italian title of this particular 1977 film is Emanuelle - Perch\u00e9 Violenza Alle Donne ?( or , roughly translated , \" Why Is There Violence Towards Women ? \" ) , which pretty much encapsulates the entire focus of the story .When she gets wind of an international human slavery ring that preys on nubile women , she decides to recruit her blonde friend , European activist Cora ( a pre - porn Schubert ) , for an expedition into the darker side of human nature .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A perfect tour of all things wonderful about the Emanuelle series , Around the World features perhaps the series ' finest score by regular composer Nico Fidenco , with an ABBA - esque theme song you 'll be humming for days .Fidenco also finally speaks on the boxed set DVD about his career , how he got into film scoring , and the differences between scoring sex scenes and horror movies .( He also holds up some very tasty - looking vinyl soundtracks of his scores . )The DVD itself is quite fine ; apart from some print damage in the opening shots and somewhat hazy credits , the quality is very nice with rich colors that blow away all those miserable VHS bootlegs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Apart from the boxed set , Around the World is also available separately in a rarely - seen , alternate \" XXX European Version \" ( no extras ) containing some hardcore footage obviously shot during filming .In either incarnation , this entry represents the best of what the spin - off Emanuelle series has to offer ; it 's fast - paced , aware of its own absurdity , and still just socially acceptable enough ( i.e. , no fake snuff footage ) .Hot - to - trot masseuses , loudmouthed tourists , and horny politicians soon enter the mix , along with some out - of - left - field mondo footage of a moongoose ripping a snake to shreds in a cage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Not surprisingly , the DVD edition christens the film as Divine Emanuelle : Love Cult -- presumably to avoid confusion with Jess Franco 's Love Camp , which is another ball of wax entirely .Austrian - born actor Christian Anders steps up to the director 's plate here ( with some purported help from Greek sexploitation pro Elia Milonakos ) to chronicle the story of the Children of Light , a sex - driven cult led by \" the Divine One \" ( Gemser ) .Her Aryan boyfriend , Dorian ( Anders ) , is responsible for scouting out new members , and anyone who does n't screw like a bunny is trussed up in front of everyone else and viciously whipped .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Packed with sex , nudity , and oddball performance art / dance numbers , this film is a prime example of early ' 80s Eurotica at its strangest .Gemser 's icy demeanor serves her well here , and as usual her real - life husband , Gabriele Tinti , pops up for a steamy sex scene as only these two could deliver .Most of the carnal encounters are fairly graphic and push the softcore limits about as far as possible ( no wonder this rarely made the rounds on cable ! ) , and Gemser fans will certainly get an eyefull as she delivers some of the most extensive nudity in her career .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Though the back of the box indicates an anamorphic 1.85:1 transfer , the film is actually presented completely open matte at 1.33:1 , leaving lots of extraneous room in the upper and lower portions of the screen .This also means a lot of extra incidental nudity , so if you 're a stickler for seeing this in the same shape as a movie screen , just zoom in on a 16:9 TV and lose on the good stuff .Image quality is very sharp and colorful , far exceeding the very soft past VHS releases , while the English - dubbed audio sounds ... well , about the same .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Crammed with sex scenes but rather lethargic compared to the more imaginative Black Emanuelle genre hybrids before it , Queen of Sados spends much of its time following each of the characters on labyrinthine routes to each other 's beds while barely advancing anything resembling a plotline .As usual Gemser and Tinti get a scene together , but the rest of the encounters are pretty standard late - night filler with plenty of face - touching and soft moaning .That said , the locations are quite spectacular , and Gemser 's scenes are always fun to watch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Extras include a small reel of outtakes ( nothing terribly salacious ) without audio , plus a nice gallery , two trailers , and more Exploitation Digital trailers .There 's barely any plot to speak of here as unhappily married Emanuelle goes to discos and makes the moves on anything in pants , whether it 's her female friends or a male pick - up she decides to dress up in female lingerie .She also whines a lot about her longing for emotional commitment and her need for sex , when she 's not busy pointing her mammaries at the camera .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The female leads all fit the bill and certainly seem game , but the narrative and emotional content ( yes , you do need 'em in sex films ) barely strive to justify their adventures between the sheets .Joe D'Amato was doing this same kind of thing much better around the same time with films like 11 Days , 11 Nights , but if you 're looking for a way to pass a slow evening with a few mildly kinky touches , this could fit the bill .Presented in anamorphic widescreen , Lady Emanuelle certainly looks lovely on DVD , with powdery but vivid colors aplenty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
