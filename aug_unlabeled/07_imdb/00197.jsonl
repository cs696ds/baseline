{"text": "Relic or Russia : Who 's Rewriting History in Company of Heroes 2 ?Despite his histrionics , TheBadComedian 's video is convincing .During cutscenes and gameplay , retreating troops seek to deny the Germans shelter by burning down houses with civilians still inside , and destroy fuel stores and bridges without regard to the safety of fellow soldiers stationed nearby .Officers summarily execute soldiers who disobey orders while trying to rescue a talented superior .One major character murders Polish partisans in cold blood after collaborating with them to capture an important German prisoner .Relic claims that all these incidents are based on historically documented cases , which might well be true .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "According to Campbell 's sources , there 's absolutely no historical evidence that incidents like this ever occurred .The Siege of Stalingrad was a grueling , brutal conflict , but the Red Army had plenty of rifles .Soldiers in Stalingrad were executed for retreating without orders or desertion , but not mowed down with machine guns , within sight of the enemy .And though there are some examples of \" blocking detachments \" placed behind formations of troops that were likely to retreat , they were generally some distance from the front lines .It 's easy to understand why Russian gamers are so angry .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
