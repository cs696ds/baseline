{"text": "The stagebound bombast of the play 's dialogue is purged entirely , as is the \" colored \" humor that was hopelessly dated by 1935 ( albeit replaced with humor that looks equally dated to us today ) .In the play , Virgie saves her father from the firing squad by appealing for clemency to Gen. U.S. Grant ; having her appeal to President Lincoln in the movie was an obvious improvement .And , of course , song - and - dance opportunities were inserted for Shirley and Bill Robinson because it would have been plainly stupid not to do so . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If he wanted to see a movie that really had no trace of its original source , he need only have waited for the picture that 20th Century Fox hustled Shirley into immediately after shooting wrapped on Captain January .Do n't be misled by the picture 's title as it appears on the cover of this sheet music ( and on several of the posters and lobby cards ) ; the title was Poor Little Rich Girl , with no \" The \" .There 's another distinction that Poor Little Rich Girl has all to itself : It 's one of Shirley 's decidedly odd , even bizarre , pictures .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Once again , as with Captain January , the script is by Sam Hellman , Gladys Lehman and Harry Tugend , this time \" suggested by the stories of Eleanor Gates and Ralph Spence . \"In order to clarify that \" stories of \" credit , we need to go back to the beginning , and it begins with Eleanor Gates ( 1875 - 1951 ) .She published her novel The Poor Little Rich Girl in 1912 , then turned it into a play that ran for 160 performances on Broadway the following year .The novel tells of seven - year - old Gwendolyn ( for the play her age was upped to 11 and she was played by 15-year - old Viola Dana , the future silent movie star ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "A casual reading of Poor Little Rich Girl 's credits might seem to imply that Miss Gates and Ralph Spence collaborated on the \" stories \" , but they did n't ; they may not even have ever met .Why he got story credit on Poor Little Rich Girl might have remained a mystery , but Shirley herself offers a convincing explanation in Child Star .It seems two writers filed a nuisance suit over Poor Little Rich Girl , claiming it had been stolen from a story they wrote on spec for Shirley and submitted to Fox in 1934 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So if Shirley 's recollection is right ( and it sounds reasonable to me ) , 20th Century Fox bought Poor Little Rich Girl 's title from Eleanor Gates and its story from Ralph Spence .It is , however , about a poor little rich girl .Shirley plays Barbara Barry , the daughter of young widower Richard Barry ( Michael Whalen ) , multi - millionaire owner of Barry 's Beauty Soap .Barbara is pampered to the point of absolute boredom , with no friends or playmates .If she sneezes more than once in an hour , she 's shunted off to bed by her nursemaid Collins ( Sara Haden ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There she 's run down by a car and winds up in the hospital , unconscious and unidentified .In this guise she meets Jimmy Dolan and his wife Jerry ( Jack Haley and Alice Faye ) , vaudevillians down on their luck and looking to break into radio .Taking little \" Betsy \" into their act , they rename her \" Bonnie Dolan \" and make the rounds as \" Dolan , Dolan and Dolan \" -- and sure enough , before you can say \" audition \" they 've landed starring spots on a radio show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "His presence is never explained , but he gives Poor Little Rich Girl a gruesome undercurrent of creepy menace that 's hard to square with the picture 's musical comedy trappings ; he 's like a scorpion on a wedding cake .No two ways about it , the Hellman - Lehman - Tugend script for Poor Little Rich Girl is one screwy piece of work .The movie 's saving grace is its score by Mack Gordon and Harry Revel , one of the best ever composed for one of Shirley 's pictures and one of the few that can properly be called a score as opposed to simply a collection of songs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "A standard love song , \" When I 'm with You \" , introduced by an unbilled Tony Martin at the very beginning of his career -- and one year before his three - year marriage to Alice Faye .The song is then reprised by Barbara , singing to her father ( and including the rather alarming line , \" Marry me and let me be your wife . \" )These and other songs , often heard in different forms in the background , on pianos , hand - organs and what - not , add to the varied musical texture of Poor Little Rich Girl .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Nonsense .I did n't believe these stories in 1972 and I do n't believe them now .They simply fly in the face of everything -- everything -- that everybody else who ever worked with Shirley had to say about her .We can only speculate on what prompted such melodramatic yarns ; both Shirley and Alice -- and for that matter , Frank Moshier -- are beyond asking about it now .In any event , Alice Faye was not through playing second fiddle to Shirley Temple .Within a very few months , she 'd be doing it again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
