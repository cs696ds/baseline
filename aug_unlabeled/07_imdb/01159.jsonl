{"text": "\" Update : 01/05 02:57 GMT by KD : Reader davecb pointed out an ABC News blog that comes to pretty much the opposite conclusion as to the import of the executive order .This is really a change of a default assumption than freedom to do anything without penalty .If INTERPOL starts going crazy , it only takes a presidential signature to take this exception back .So if the INTERPOL guy says \" I wo n't , and I do n't have to ! \"and the fed guy says \" It 's a matter of national security ! \" ... all he needs to do is get the message up to the top of the chain - of - command , and suddenly that fed guy can grab whatever info he wants .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If INTERPOL starts going crazy , it only takes a presidential signature to take this exception back .No one is taking this exception back , it was granted in the first place .The question might be why was this ever granted in the first place ?Easy - the government wants to make it easier to hunt terrorists on U.S. soil or any other citizen not following the rules .This basically allows to the U.S. government to go and ask interpol to conduct unconstitutional activities on U.S. soil and report their findings .Clap , fail .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Goodness me .More seriously , remember INTERPOL actually has very little power - they 're a coordination agency .They have no powers of arrest .They do n't even DO investigations .What they DO is if a cop in Australia is tracking down a criminal who 's fled to Los Angeles and therefore needs the LAPD assistance , INTERPOL is the agency that makes that inter - police - force connection happen .There are no \" INTERPOL \" officers in L.A. that do the arrest - that 's for the LAPD ( or FBI ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like much stronger diplomatic or consular immunities , they are not individual rights ; particularly , the institution to whom they are granted may waive them , whether or not the individual affected wishes them to .( Note , all of this is laid out in TFA ) .All the Obama order did is remove the special limitations that were applied to INTERPOL ( and which were irrelevant at the time of the Reagan order , since INTERPOL did n't have offices in the US at the time . )No special privileges beyond those usually granted to international organizations that the United States participates in ( and some that it does n't ! ) have been granted to INTERPOL .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Prior to this order , they could not use these pouches in the USA , though they can elsewhere .So , the FBI finds out information on a major international crime ring , gives that to INTERPOL to give to the corresponding agencies in other countries .Without the pouch , airport security can read and/or seize it .They work for a private security company , too .Better hope they do n't have a vested interest in intercepting that couriered envelope !Now they can get the same protection as diplomats get , for their envelopes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's all .Well , their offices ca n't be searched , either , but they do n't have offices , they just have some desks at the DoJ. And basically this is saying that records INTERPOL passes back are free from being intercepted by anybody in the feds who want them .If the feds need them , the correct call in your example should be to the LAPD .This is not diplomatic immunity .This is just protection against searches , IRS , etc .This basically allows a law enforcement officer to carry out his duties .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is obvious and should not raise any issues .Diplomatic Immunity does n't mean they get to violate our laws , it just means they do n't go to jail for violating our laws .If complaints start to pile up ( thanks to the ACLU I 'm sure ) then they will loose their immunity .Think about this in context .We just had a near - disaster of a plane exploding in Detroit and US airport screening is worthless to block this threat because the attacker boarded elsewhere .So , the response is to give INTERPOL agents here more power , and most likely the hope is that our INTERPOL guys elsewhere get the same powers so they can do their job there are we do n't have to worry about who 's being flown in here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
