{"text": "Any Number Can Play - 1949 . \"Any Number Can Play \" ( 1949 ) is a spot - the - character - actor festival .Shown recently on TCM , I came in late , after the opening credits , and knowing nothing about the film , I had a ball picking out character actors I knew or thought I knew .The leads , to be sure , are enough of a draw .Alexis Smith is his wife , who has grown lonelier through the years in his absence , and especially now that her son is almost grown .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is our post - War Gable , older and looking it , but still with that incredible magnetism .When he walks through the crowded gambling salon , he 's the only person you watch .Unfortunately Alexis Smith does n't get to stretch her acting muscles much in this film , except for one very lovely scene .Gable rumages among the junk in the cellar of their mansion looking for a set of old fishing flies for a long - postponed vacation his doctor says he should take or else .Alexis leads him off to a side room in the cellar she has fixed up for herself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is a small hideway , a looking almost like a camping cottage .There are a few pieces of mismatched old furnature , a phonograph , a baby 's wooden highchair , and an old double bed that had been theirs in the small apartment they had when they were first married .All the items are from the early years of their marriage , including the box of fishing flies Gable wants .He is astonished , and she explains in a low , almost whispered voice that she misses the days when they were together more , when he was just starting out in business , and when they shared all their thoughts and experiences .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He flops on the lumpy mattress and she joins him , still whispering between kisses , a very touching seduction scene ( We can only suppose she 's keeping one foot on the floor ) .She is more impressive in this scene than Gable , whose normal tone of speaking voice seems almost a shout compared to her softer tones , and he looks uncomfortable .He 's the rogue of younger days , chasing women in between wisecracks , and does not seem to like being seduced .However his later scene with Mary Astor , as an old flame who still pines for him , is more profound and shows Gable as lonely as his wife .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Mary Astor , of all people .Knowing nothing about this film , and missing the opening credits , Mary Astor pulling on the arm of a slot machine was only one happy surprise .The rest of the movie became an Easter egg hunt for familiar faces .Frank Morgan has a great role as an aggressive gambler , a rival and enemy to Gable , who intends to clean him out .Morgan is a far cry from his normal jovial roles .He 's menacing , snide , sarcastic , but ultimately respecting Gable for playing the game of life as hard as he does .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This review contains spoilers , click expand to view .The movie certainly does have some good things in it , and I really do recommend watching it , but I ca n't help but feel that some things are missing .First of all , for a Disney villain , Gothel is n't a very memorable villain ( she felt more like an annoying old woman ) .Also , none of the songs were even memorable like other animated Disney movie ( maybe kids who watched this movie today may argue with me years from now about this point ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Expand .Disney strays from its self - esteem centered story work while sticking to its sacrificial hero helping a brave damsel in distress , and it works very well .Outside of a big gripe I will discuss later , Disney still seems to have some sort of magic when it doesn\u00e2 .Pretty good movie .Usual Disney Fare .Happy ending , you know what 's going to happen .However made me laugh a lot .Did n't see it in theaters but its still pretty good on netflix .Watch it with your kids , or watch it with a couple guys and make fun of the plot holes , either way your going to have fun with this one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As technology has advanced , and the minds of the young children have changed , \" Tangled \" 's modern turn to a fairy tale somehow is able to work . \" Tangled \" suffers from its songs , which , although is composed by Alan Menken , the composer of classics such as \" Beauty and the Beast \" and \" The Little Mermaid \" , is not up to par with them .Its song may not be memorable , but the story is not at all bad .The story focuses from the fairy - tale character Rapunzel whose golden locks are beautifully animated .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Pascal and Maximus are my favorites , as they are the comedic sidekicks that do their purposes well .The ending is a typical Disney one , and in my opinion , is so old .I 'll give you a hint cured by love .Well , I guess that 's okay ...I was debating on a 7 to an 8 and due to the fact that it has romantic moments and an good plot , I would have to give it an 8 .If only they had half 's on Metacritic . ...Expand .I think that Tangled is not back to basics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't know . \" Bolt \" is good , \" The Princess and the Frog \" is regular but \" Tangled \" is better .Disney goes a new direction and it gets to innovate .Fairy tale with traditional basis but it 's modern at same time .Good film , Rapunzel is the new classic character in Disney .While the animation does n't present itself as anything special compared to that of the classic \" Disney masterpieces , \" Tangled still holds itself up strongly with cleverly written songs , likable characters , and of course a wonderful addition to the ever growing amount of Disney Princesses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With Pixar style / quality of visuals and design - Disney has done a marvelous job in creating this movie .This is absolutely the beginning of a new era for Disney and it looks like its gon na be a great one .Good work for Disney , showing the best version of Rapunzel , good argument that was a great wallpaper , classic characters super , and this also good to know that more Rapuzel be a princess Disney , Great Job !Tangles is an entertaining fairy tale sure to entertain any family .It has adventure , romance , and original plot ( thank you ! )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Expand .The story is well done , the script is mostly fresh and intelligent , and the jokes are funny .None of the songs are particularly memorable but at least they do not slow down the movie too much .The most enjoyable part of this Rapunzel story are the side characters .In almost all Disney movies , the main character has a character sidekick , same here .Rapunzel 's sidekick is a chameleon The story is well done , the script is mostly fresh and intelligent , and the jokes are funny .None of the songs are particularly memorable but at least they do not slow down the movie too much .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In almost all Disney movies , the main character has a character sidekick , same here .Rapunzel 's sidekick is a chameleon named Pascal who is ok but the funniest character in the movie is a horse named Maximus who has all human mannerisms , but is a horse .I laughed at every scene that horse was in .A close second are the ' ruffians ' who Rapunzel runs into .They probably have the funniest song in the movie , each are drawn with their respective overemphasized distinguishing characteristics , and they provide fresh material when the main story gets bogged down with the actual Rapunzel storyline .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Overall , an enjoyable movie . ...Expand .nice movie :) it does n't hurt to watch it ... i guess .i would n't call it good but i would n't call it bad either .it 's those ' okayish ' ones .If you have nothing to watch , watch this .( the guy is ugly though ) .After years seeing only modern adaptations of fairy - tales , it was good to see the traditional story coming to alive on screen .Of course , that makes the film quite predictable with a lot of cliches included .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
