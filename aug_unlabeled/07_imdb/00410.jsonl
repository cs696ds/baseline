{"text": "Margaret : David : .The City of Your Final Destination .Rated PG .THE CITY OF YOUR FINAL DESTINATION is the first film that James Ivory has directed since the death of his long - time business and life partner Ismael Merchant in 2005 .Merchant - Ivory , together with screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala , established a refined reputation for adapting literary works of Henry James , E. M Forster and Kazuo Ishiguro .This latest film is an adaptation of a 2002 Peter Cameron novel about graduate student Omar - OMAR METWALLY - whose grant depends on getting permission from the Uruguay based family of dead novelist Jules Gund to write a biography .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "( ( The City of Your Final Destination))[[5 ] ] I have hardly seen any Merchant - Ivory productions of the past so can not compare or comment this film to those .This film was quite a bore for most part and this is due to a dull uninteresting lead character .A snail would cover more ground than the story for the first 45 - 60 minutes also !But the story begins to gain some interest when a new romance looms and the brilliant Laura Linney adds some much needed acid to the screenplay !She is given the best lines and is the only character of interest by film 's end .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
