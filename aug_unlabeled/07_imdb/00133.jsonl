{"text": "As a witness , Carlos Ortiz will have plenty of warts .During the climactic scene in A Few Good Men , Jack Nicholson chides Tom Cruise for a meandering cross examination by saying of Cruise 's clients facing murder charges , \" Please tell me their lawyer has n't pinned their hopes to a phone bill .\" A similar comment could be made about prosecutors in Massachusetts , if their star witness in the murder trial against Aaron Hernandez will be Carlos Ortiz .Ortiz , as explained by Kevin Manahan of USA Today , has plenty of warts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( That could explain his apparent post - murder narcolepsy . )Ortiz also had tested positive for alcohol , cocaine , PCP , and THC .Ortiz , per the affidavit , thereafter avoided treatment by claiming he 'd lost his cell phone and telling his probation officer on June 18 , the day after Odin Lloyd was killed , that Ortiz \" did n't know where to go . \"So , basically , if Ortiz is put on the witness stand , he 's going to be ripped apart by Hernandez 's lawyers .The problem with that approach is that Hernandez chose to associate with Ortiz , apparently summoning Ortiz and Ernest Wallace from Connecticut on the day before the murder .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like prostitutes \" ca n't be raped \" I suppose .It 's the reason why regular people do n't testify .We all have warts .Until our legal system protects witnesses a little better , criminals ( with money to hire good attorney's)will continue to run free and people who have information on crimes will continue to remain quite .The only place Hernandez if going to \" walk \" to is the state penitentiary .There is already plenty of evidence to convict him and the police and prosecutors will undoubtedly find more between now and the trial .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is no way a jury will believe .This is why the DA can not use him as a star witness and instead must try him for murder as well .He came from Conneticut to help Hernandez kill Lloyd and that is exactly what he did .He was not asleep in the car .More likely he helped the other 2 men pull Lloyd out of the car , who by this time likely sensed his life was going to end and was pleading with them not to kill him .Then he helped cover it up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He then made up the best story he could so that he could explain being in the car , and being on camera with a gun , but distance himself from the murder as much as possible .If the DA pretends to believe his stupid story , and use him as a star witness , it will only weaken their case .Anyone who witnessed or was involved in a murder even peripherally and does n't come forwards is doing something far worse than \" snitching \" .I wonder how many of you idiots would by crying snitches get stitches if it was your brother , father , wife , sister etc who 'd been murdered ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hernandez could get off on the murder charge but I think they have him cold on the gun charges so either way he 's going to jail .Good one !You 've been funny and to the point without attacking unjustly from what I 've seen .So thanks and I appreciate it , and I am being sincere .I brought up this point about Ortiz yesterday .He 's not the most credible witness and it 's clear no one believed his \" sleeping \" story .The serial killers ' high priced lawyers are going to destroy Ortiz on the witness stand and create that \" doubt \" that the gullible jury will swallow hook , line , and sinker .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So now they got a trick ?Aaron is going to Jail for life .and he should .Aaron had 40 million dollars and he threw it away .why ? because he did nt like the people Lloyd was talking too .For 40 million dollars I do nt need no friends . being a person who loves criminal law as a hobby .watches trials and things of that nature .the case against hernandez is nowhere near strong - might be able 2 convict him on a gun charge ( that they havnt found ) but other than that i m not sure they have evidence for ANYTHING that can link him directly to a murder .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unreal how people will defend AH just because he is a Patriot .I do n't know about any other murderers who get support .De Nile ai n't just a river in Egypt .Then you have Hernandez cleaning his house and deleting surveillance tape , acting angry when police came to investigate , and then finally you get to the Ortiz who was there when shots were fired and who quotes another co - defendant saying that Hernandez pulled the trigger .Even if the State ca n't prove Hernandez pulled the trigger they can put him away for life under accomplice liability .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden could n't screw this up .However \" warty \" Ortiz is , Team Hernandez has to put forth a theory that is more plausible than Ortiz ' version of what happened .And that simply does n't exist .Aside from Ortiz ' credibility , or lack thereof , in order to establish reasonable doubt , Team Hernandez has to provide a reasonable explanation for each and every instance of odd / suspicious behavior Hernandez exhibited after the murder .Good one !You 've been funny and to the point without attacking unjustly from what I 've seen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would be willing to bet the story gets flipped at some point and it was Ortiz that shot him .He 's indigent , needs AH for money support etcetera so he is trying to gain AH 's favor by offing Mr.lloyd .Of course Aaron and Bo had nothing to do with Ortiz and his drug crazed actions all along fearing for their own safety .The only thing that this has in common with most older cases being brought up is that they involved football players .Everything about this is next level .Even OJ acted in a fit of rage , he did n't calculate plan And then do it execution style .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Same thing with Lewis .It was a brawl in front of a nightclub that erupted spontaneously and the victims were total dirt bags too .This is on a different level .Ah , but the elephant in the room is the fact that the double murder in Boston is looming while they rally the case against Aaron / Joran Van der Sloot and then 2007 drive - by in Fla .. he 's not as smart as Dexter but surely has the bloodlust .Hernandez deleting his surveillance footage and being uncooperative is literally useless in the courtroom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The shell casings in the car and the cell phone history are the most damning evidence , but we will have to wait and see if it is enough .Without the murder weapon or a reliable testimony against AH , it could still go either way .All of this other stuff is useless , and yet all of these commenters keep referring to it as if it were the smoking gun .All these \" warts \" will come out in the State 's case in chief .They are n't stupid enough to let this all come out in cross .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
