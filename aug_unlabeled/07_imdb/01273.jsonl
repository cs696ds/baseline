{"text": "Fun Idea , bad movie .The film starts out okay , however , what could have been a great movie turned out boring .The plot line was boring , the humor was n't there .Even more so , the portrayal of colonial turkeys as stereotype Indians , and misrepresentation of the pilgrims and colonial America was disappointing .The characters are very one dimensional , and the main character is just plain annoying .Warning Spoilers !I did n't like this movie .It was annoying .Our main character Reggie ( the ' smart one ' ) , tells all his turkey family that they are being fattened up TO BE KILLED .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then Thanksgiving comes and all of a sudden the turkeys become sane .Despite the fact that Reggie warned them , he is there sacrifice .( Maybe because he 's purple ?That 's kinda racist . )The president 's little girl finds Reggie and throws a fit for him to be the ' pardon turkey ' .( Maybe because he 's purple ?That 's kinda racist . )Anyway kids , when you have a tantrum , know that the turkey will always be your 's :) After a pointless montage of him watching TV and eating pizza we finally get to the plot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jake was told by the ' Great Turkey ' that he has a great destiny and will save turkeys from the dreaded holiday , Thanksgiving .They time travel all the way to the first Thanksgiving and meet Jenny ( Reggie 's love interest ) & her brother What's - it's - face ( forgot his name ) .They are dressed in Native American headdresses and face paint .( That 's kinda racist . )Well they are there we have to survive the characters of this movie that probably took 5 minutes for the writers to come up with .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then bam !Reggie and Jake go get fire crackers and explode the darn shack full of weapons that the humans keep to hunt the turkey , deer , and whatever other animals they ate back then .BUT they are stupid , and leave a trail of ash right into the turkey 's shelter .Reggie gets very angry at himself , and gives up , and goes home to his old house where he would eat pizza and watch TV .About half a dozen Reggies come to tell him that he himself is the ' Great Turkey ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He goes inside looking for Jenny , and finds her looking for a way to get to her siblings / turkey tribe .Jake saves the baby turkeys from being burnt , and they reach safety thanks to their leader , The Chief who dies saving them .Reggie visits the present , gets all the pizza he can , takes it to the past , and gives it to the humans to eat instead of turkey .They are safe and the movie ends with Reggie staying in the past with Jenny and her tribe .Do n't waste your time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I saw this in a movie theater with a friend of mine , and I thought it was going to be an average Disney movie : sometimes funny ; likable characters : a little boring ; and a happy ending .Well in this movie , it was rarely funny and I hated the main character , he was so annoying !Not to mention the ending kinda sucked , so to sum it up : Do n't watch this movie !Disappointing .well , I think they made a good attempt , and kinda failed .It 's not what I expected .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I thought \" Free Birds \" was going to be a good , special , movie .Instead , it was a good - ish movie that my 7 year old sister fell asleep in the middle of .But it was good enough too get a 3 star rating for me .Terrible , terrible movie .The trailers for this movie made it like it was going to be a good one .To put it simple , I hated Free Birds .I could honestly go on and on about how horrible this movie was , and , forgive me , I am .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It really looked like the directors had just given up midway through production .I have no idea how they got Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson to star in this movie .Blackmail maybe ?I ca n't continue .Too many bad memories .I recommend this movie if you 're looking for a way to burn 20 bucks .NOT REALLY GOOD .It has some humour , but it was boring .IT WAS KIND OF SAD WHEN THE CHIEF DIED.ALTHOUGHI LIKE WOODY HARRELSON AND OWEN WILSON.Some romance between Reggie and Jenny .THEY FLIRT ( or should i say awkardly ) and kiss offscreen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ok movie .When the turkey is eating the pizza , it says Chuck E Cheeses .In the first thanksgiving in 1621 , kids will learn about the holiday and what year it first celebrated .There is also a time machine named Steve where someone can take to the present , future and past .There is also places in the movie that I have been to before are Auntie Anne 's and Old Navy .Occasionally amusing with random parts dissapoints .free birds .it was good .Both a hit and a miss .Free Birds was entertaining , sorta .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Most of the jokes are bland and unwilling .The cast was great but they just did n't put much effort into this one .Now to say some good things- the story is fair .The movie actually goes by pretty quick ( it kept my attention on the screen . )So I 'd say , check it out !Offensive .I can not believe that NOBODY has said anything about just how judgmental this movie really is .Plus I ha gotten my hopes up too much about this movie First things first , we have the Native American stereotype / racism thing going on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But what bothers me to the point of even bothering to write a review here is the fact that they poke fun at the mentally ill .First you 'll see an older turkey talking \" alone \" , and Reggie comes up .He says \" what are you looking at , weirdo ? ! \"And continues his conversation .( I have n't seen this in a year so , I may be a bit off ) that could also be anyone who hears voices in general , really .But then the Great Turkey thing comes up and Reggie calls Jake crazy , I believe .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He says \" it 's a voice in your head , it 's not real ! \"Not to mention the fact that Jake has something to accomplish , which they made seen like a \" delusion \" .Nobody caught that , really ?And when that kid is blurting out personal things about people , and she says a woman ( ca n't remember ) \" eats her feelings \" Oh sure , kids , lets all laugh at the people who are challenged !Because schizophrenia and binge eating are laughing matters .Free Birds .I thought it was cute ...", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
