's highest rated shows .\" All of a sudden people were discovering us again , \" McCarthy says proudly .That feeling is especially enhanced when the shows go out on the road with their crew for location shoots , which they do several times a year .Corwin , for instance , will lead the team to Portland , Oregon , for four weeks of shooting , scheduled to air in May.So if shooting in the studio of 150 spectators feels a tad tame , large venues with 3,000 people infuse Jeopardy ! and Wheel of Fortune with a rock star energy that the directors find invigorating .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Sometimes that means having a celebrity host or guest .As McCarthy points out , a celebrity guest can enliven a game unexpectedly .When Regis Philbin appeared on Jeopardy ! , he did a shtick about not being able to ring his buzzer and comically walked away from the podium .\" All of a sudden we had a mini - comedy happening on stage , \" recalls McCarthy .\" It was spontaneous , and we had to go wide with the camera rather than a close - up .It was completely opposite from what we had been doing and we adjusted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In America 's urban centers and liberal enclaves , the idea of women being prosecuted for taking desperate measures to end their pregnancies might seem inconceivable , a never - again remnant of the era before Roe v.

{"text": "But , wait .... it is n't so simple , or is it ?It is estimated that up to half of all fertilized eggs die and are lost ( aborted ) spontaneously , usually before the woman knows she is pregnant .Among those women who know they are pregnant , the miscarriage rate is about 15 - 20 % .Most miscarriages are caused by chromosome problems that make it impossible for the baby to develop .Usually , these problems are unrelated to the mother or father 's genes .Other possible causes for miscarriage include : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
