{"text": "However , the closer they seem to get to the killer , the more it becomes apparent that he too is watching them , and playing his own twisted game with their lives and sanity .The idea of an unlikely pairing of policemen facing off against a mysterious killer is one of the most overused ideas in modern cinema , though to Schwentke 's credit , he does manage to avoid the worst of the ' cop buddy ' clich\u00e9 .As should be fairly obvious , the plot as a whole is overly familiar and predictable , and there are no surprises in store for any viewer who has seen \" Se7en \" or any of its legions of progeny .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although the whole ' tattoo collector ' premise is a new angle , everything else about the film , right through to the downbeat ending , is decidedly stale .This is also true of the visuals , which are predictably wet and gloomy , illuminated only by occasional flashes of neon .Schwentke 's problem is that he takes things a little too far , and piles on so much murk that the viewer is likely to suffer eye strain while trying to work out what is going on .Although this does make the proceedings reasonably atmospheric , and even quite creepy in places , when the final credits role , the overall impression is that of having spent nearly two hours in a dank , gloomy tunnel rather than having experienced any kind of thrill ride .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Similarly , whilst the plot fails to hold any surprises , it is inoffensive enough , and if the viewer is in the right mood , then it acts as a guilty pleasure or lazy homage rather than a blatant cheat .The film 's greatest strength , at least for some viewers , will be the fact that it is inventively sadistic , and contains a good amount of gore .Schwentke has a cruel , unflinching eye for human suffering , and there are a number of genuinely unpleasant scenes of autopsies and skin being removed .Such sequences give the film a huge boost , and serve well to keep the viewer interested during the many occasions where the pace drops to a crawl .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This movie tackles major issues and prejudices in a unique way , setting it apart from similar attempts , and the main characters are both strong , respectable and well - portrayed .Recommended ?This is definitely worth watching .The Wrestler ( 2008 ) : Brutal , emotional , mediocre .The story and growth of the main character and Mickey Rourke 's performance are the driving forces behind this film , for despite some depth , the overall story is dry and excessively explicit .Recommended ?Not bad , but not great either .Babel ( 2006 ) : Mysterious , emotional , profound .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
