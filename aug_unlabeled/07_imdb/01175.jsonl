{"text": "I must admit , the next instalment of my Sounds of Escapism gaming music blog series is a little self - indulgent , but please forgive me .I do not expect to have many people agree with me here when I put this soundtrack up there with the likes of Jeremy Soule et al . , but this track is important to me .It may not even be a good example of great rock music , and I doubt I would have even come across this band in my day - to - day life if they had not lent their music to this game .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This particular track did not feature one the game 's OST that came with the special edition , and only a slightly shorter version could be heard on the game 's excellent rolling demo .I did n't actually own a copy until it was released as part of the band 's ' Best of ' album on iTunes .( Which I highly recommend if you are a fan of this type of music , they are certainly no one - hit wonders ) .Primal was one of my favourite games on the PS2 , for reasons I shall not go into great detail here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Primal is the reason I still own a PS2 , I just ca n't bear to part with it and I sometimes play it through just so I can enjoy the story again .It 's like an old favourite movie I 'd happily view over and over again .For me it 's a classic , like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars .For all the games of the PS2 generation that have enjoyed a recent re - release on the PS3 , I ca n't think of a title that is crying out more to be HD'd to the nines .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You 'd think Sony would do it for the game 's 10th Anniversary , but nope , I have not heard even a rumour that it might happen .But if it did , I 'd happily buy it again in a heartbeat .Go ahead Sony , take my money !I would like to dedicate this post to the memory of Andreas Katsulas , who sadly died of cancer in 2006 .His portrayal as Scree is unforgettable , and who probably goes down as one of gaming 's greatest side - kicks of all time .The next track is one that I guarantee you will love , and one that unless you are a geek like me who has a music library full of game soundtracks , you will not have heard in a very long time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have just finished writing a piece for Explosive Alan Productions .They have a column on their website that encourages gamers to talk about the games they have a true emotional connection to called ' Heart Pieces ' .And so the piece I have written for them is concerning Tomb Raider .I 'm not even sure that they 'll like what I 've sent them .But here on IGN I am not limited to a word - count and I am much freer to voice my opinion ; so here it is in its full un - abridged , take - no - prisoners , epic glory ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am in love with Lara Croft .There I said it .I 'm a married heterosexual female with a fangirl crush on a female video game character .It 's a love that I 've had for many years , way longer than even my own marriage .I can safely say that if it was n't for Tomb Raider I would n't still be gaming well into my thirties .It was the game that re - kindled my love for video gaming ; nay it turned an occasional pastime into a near obsession .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When Lara found me I was directionless , lonely and stuck in a dead - end job , or even had no job .I was miserable .But since I met her , with a little hard work and determination ( and perhaps a bit of luck ) I got my butt out of the gutter , got myself a degree and I am now a professional archaeologist .It 's given me a reason to get up out of bed each morning .I even walked down the aisle to the Tomb Raider theme on my wedding day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And it 's not just because we share an interest in archaeology - although archaeologist Lara is not , since I tend to spend my time trying to piece together fragments of our past , not blasting it apart .I suppose I fell in love with Lara because she embodied all the qualities of the type of woman I wanted to be .Strong , determined , independent , rich and ( dare I say it ? ) attractive .Since I met her I have lived by the mantra of ' WWLD ? 'Well okay , she 'd probably solve most problems with some buckshot and that artefact we found a half level back , but the attitude is still the same .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Home was sometimes not a nice place to be so it was great to escape to an arcade for a bit of distraction .I suppose I lost interest in gaming when the FPS became popular , because it was then I discovered I had a problem called 3D Motion Sickness that prevented me from enjoying FPS games .It 's especially bad for me with games like Call of Duty where there is a lot of head - bobbing movement .And it 's a completely unconscious thing that I have no control over , it 's not like I can tell my brain to stop being so silly , this is n't real .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But move to the third person perspective and you introduce what is known as the ' fixation ' point and my faulty brain seems to be able to handle that .So you see Tomb Raider was n't just a game that I played and enjoyed , it was the start of a whole new era of gaming that I did not feel excluded from due to my condition .Not long after I played the first Tomb Raider game I played another PlayStation classic Legacy of Kain : Soul Reaver .And it was gorgeous .The opening FMV of that game was jaw - dropping and I when I first saw it I remember thinking ' Woah !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It did n't seem a huge leap to me since Crystal Dynamics were under the same publishing house ( namely Edios ) as Tomb Raider creators Core .Not that I was disappointed with Core at the time , it 's just that Soul Reaver was a very beautiful game .So imagine if you will my delight when I discovered my wish had come true !Core had not fared well after Angel of Darkness and I thought perhaps Lara had had her day .There could be many reasons why AoD failed , but for me it failed because in a bid to take things in a new direction and keep things feeling fresh , they strayed too far away from the things that made Tomb Raider , well Tomb Raider .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well first of all it has to be a Third Person game , at least the new game has n't broken that rule .Tomb Raider defined that genre , the Third Person Action Adventure .And anyway , I doubt Lara would have become so popular if all we ever saw were just her hands bobbing up and down .Also , all those graceful acrobatics would be lost in first person , limited to a platform or ledge rushing up to meet us in the face .Not cool ... .Third Person Action Adventure games are typically linear as opposed to an open world RPG .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like it or not , for me this is Tomb Raider .Before the current console generation games were a lot easier to define and you did n't have the blurring of genres that we are seeing today .People did n't expect every game to be everything all at once .But who says linear gameplay has to be bad ?Why is that frowned upon ?Why do we expect every game to be an open world sandbox ?Why ca n't we just enjoy the journey ?The answers to these questions seem to elude me because I 've always seen video games as just another form of storytelling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is what Tomb Raider did for me and why I feel a move to an open world RPG style game would be such a fundamental difference that it would no longer be Tomb Raider .I 'm not saying that it would n't be a great game , or that I would n't enjoy playing it , I 'm just saying it could be any title out there today without that genre defining identity that Tomb Raider previously enjoyed .And so instead of only having to compete with its own past success it will just end up being compared to all the other games out there that are like it , and eventually being considered to be a jack of all trades instead of a master of one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The right soundtrack can also make a game truly unforgettable .It 's something I never really appreciated it until the first Tomb Raider reboot .There is nothing like the feeling of a good Tomb Raider game and Legend had that feeling for me by the truck load .It sends chills down my spine from the moment the game loads .The manager of the Xbox development team forgot to include the intro video on the final build disc when sending it off for the final game testing with Microsoft 's Quality Assurance team .When the mistake was discovered , the QA department told Eidos they would need to resubmit the game for re - testing from scratch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Shame I ca n't find that video anywhere on the web , it 's spit - your - coffee - out funny .But I digress , because it 's here Tomb Raider : Legend\\&#Array;s theme where the magic truly begins .The first time I played it just that piece of music alone made me feel like after all the years of disappointing sequels , finally my favourite series was back , it was being made by my favourite studio no - less ( yippee ! ) , and most of all Lara was back !And how I had missed her !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To me it was astonishing .First of all it looked great , even better all HD'd up to nines on the Xbox360( remember this was summer 2006 , almost a whole year before the EU launch of the PS3 ) .It 's not the best looking game of its time but it was sumptuous , and Lara looked like she belonged there .Once the game had started the first thing that struck me was how well Lara moved , Lara 's movement had never felt so good !I soon discovered that there was a very good reason for this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To start with they had no idea how she was meant to look and move .They were so scared of getting it wrong that Eidos enlisted the help of Lara 's creator Toby Gard .He had left Core when he felt they were taking his creation in a direction he was n't happy with .It is always a bit disappointing when you discover that the creator or director of a game series you love has left the company .But then you have to ask yourself why did they leave ?Toby 's story is not unique , and usually the game that follows after the creator has left does n't live up to expectations , so I think it 's something to respect them for .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And I think it really shows , Legend , Anniversary and Underworld are everything great Tomb Raider games should be .And then outside of the main game there is Croft Manor .And there is something appealing about being able to play the part of an aristocrat and explore a sprawling mansion .It was a clever training level that evolved with every successive Tomb Raider game into a level in its own right complete with secrets to find .I absolutely love this element of Tomb Raider , it 's a tradition and despite the place being blown to smithereens in the last game I am sad to see that it is not returning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I could be wrong , perhaps it is somewhere in the new game , or will maybe it will arrive as dlc , who knows ?But if there is no Croft Manor at least somewhere , how can this be Tomb Raider ?But perhaps the most worrying aspect of this new Tomb Raider reboot is the multiplayer .Many games publishers seem to believe that they can keep people playing a game for longer and they can earn more cash if they include a multiplayer .This may be true , but for fans of Tomb Raider like myself , it 's in danger of becoming my least played element of the game .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not one part of Tomb Raider should feel like it 's on rails either , everybody loves a good set piece and other Third Person Action Adventures do these things ( usually with the dreaded QTEs ) very well indeed .It is something that even the latest Tomb Raider games succumbed to on the odd occasion , but in my opinion Tomb Raider 's best moments are when you feel that it was you that just did that , not the game 's director .It should n't feel like you were guided through a section by the hand and Lara really was never in any danger .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Tomb Raider in the past has been able to strike that perfect balance between being just difficult enough that it takes a little bit of effort to get through , without disrupting the flow of the game .And when you do get Lara safely to her destination , there is a great sense of achievement that does n't even require a little sound effect and an in - game reward to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside .No a great game just makes you want to push that ' start ' button again .I am worried about the new reboot , and nothing I have heard about the new game has put my mind at ease .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sure we may get a great game , but it may end up being a Tomb Raider in name alone , not in spirit .I know things should move on in order to keep things feeling fresh but at what cost ?How much can you afford to change before a game ends up not even resembling the franchise that made the name famous ?Surely Crystal Dynamics would have been better - off turning this into new IP and getting something new and original out there , lord knows the games market needs it , it 's crying out for it !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But perhaps I 'm being too judgemental ; I 'm big enough to admit it .I know I 'm just a selfish , dreadful fangirl , and one of the hardest fans to please .Given their history with two of my favourite series perhaps I should trust Crystal Dynamics to pull off the unthinkable and make a stonkingly good reboot that transports an old franchise to a place it 's never been before while still being essentially Tomb Raider .Perhaps I 'll adore it .After all this is a games studio that has only let me down once in the past ( when they left the Legacy of Kain series on a cliff - hanger after a game that did n't quite live up to the previous two ) perhaps I should have more faith .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
