{"text": "Legion ( 2010 ) .Angels vs. demons , with God and Satan somewhere hanging out in the back .Problem is , he gets thrown on Earth in the middle of the desert with a group of ragtags that literally have the worst luck in the world right now .However , the reason Michael has taken to Earth in order to save humanity from existence is because of the diner 's waitress , Charlie ( Adrianne Palicki ) , who also just so happens to be pregnant ; aka , the last hope this world has left .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Do n't know what you think , but that looks like a sign from God or something .But if you , like myself , watched that scene and absolutely laughed your ass off , then you 're in for a treat , because most of this film plays out exactly like that .Nope , it does n't matter how terrible this movie can get , because for one thing , it 's pretty fun .But still , you get my drift : Expect this movie to be utter garbage and somehow , you will have fun .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I get that this needed to happen , but whenever you have quality - actors like Charles S. Dutton , or Paul Bettany , or even Dennis Quaid delivering lines like , \" Show me your teeth ! \" , you just know that you 're in for a good , old fashioned , goofy - as - hell treat .That 's why when things slow up and get a bit serious , things are boring and they only get worse as time goes on .Sure , you could look at this as something as \" total and complete crap \" , but that 's sort of the point .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All this movie needed to do was give me some actors like Tyrese Gibson , Lucas Black , and even Kate Walsh enough moments where they got to be crazy and/or shoot something , and then I was good .And thankfully , I got to be of witness to that , more than times than one human being probably should be exposed to .However , I enjoyed it and I think that if you 're going to get a random ensemble such as this together , you need to allow them to do as much as possible , with at least something of a script .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maybe that 's exactly how it was on set , so if that is the case , then Bettany deserves an Oscar .But for his work here , I feel bad that somebody as talented and as reliable as him still has yet to be given that leading role that puts him on the same marquee as many other supporting players who went big time .Yet , he will always be remember for his bum .Poor Paul Bettany , man .Poor him .Consensus : Can Legion be placed in the \" so - bad - it's - good \" category ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I never gave this a chance !However , I heard that the television show that they have turned it into is off to a good start .It is called Dominion and had a solid first episode judging from the reviews that I have read !I was on a bit of an Angels vs Demons buzz after I 'd seen Gabriel ( with Andy Whitfield ) , so I when I found this one I did n't have very high expectations , but I was pleasantly surprised .I too would put it in the \" so - bad - it's - good \" category .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
