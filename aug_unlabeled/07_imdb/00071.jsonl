{"text": "I thought , She 's got a lot of chutzpah and she 's completely bonkers .Mae was one of those people I always felt had a distinctly masculine vibration about her .I have often ventured the opinion that she was a man in drag .[Laughs ] \" .The Raquel Welch quotes are found in the May 2008 issue of Time Out New York , as part of an interview conducted by Melissa Anderson .Also in the Myra Breckinridge cast : handsome newcomer Roger Herren , and pretty newcomer Farrah Fawcett , in addition to veterans John Carradine , Andy Devine , Kathleen Freeman , and Jim Backus , and , in bit part , Tom Selleck .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I recall reading a while back that former Fox star Loretta Young ( Man 's Castle / Three Blind Mice ) sued her old studio in order to have film clips featuring her removed from the Myra Breckinridge release print - which is peppered with old - movie bits .The reason for ( the very Catholic )Young 's reticence was that her particular clips were interspersed with scenes of , if I remember correctly , masturbation .Who was masturbating whom , I do n't know , but in any case , if I 'm not misremembering anything , Young won her suit and the clips were taken out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Another Michael Sarne directorial film credit is Joanna ( 1968 ) , a Swinging London tale starring Genevi\u00e8ve Wa\u00efte that was well - received in some quarters .Sarne 's directorial career , however , never recovered from the Myra Breckinridge debacle .As an actor , Sarne could be recently seen in David Cronenberg 's Eastern Promises and heard ( as the voice of Karla ) in Tomas Alfredson 's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy .Raquel Welch 's once - promising film career also stalled in the ' 70s .Apart from Richard Lester 's successful all - star ensemble The Three Musketeers and James Ivory 's underrated The Wild Party , Welch 's movies of that decade were minor fare .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Away from Hollywood , Welch had a major Broadway hit with Woman of the Year in the early ' 80s .Mae West , for her part , would make only one more movie after Myra Breckinridge .That was Ken Hughes ' Sextette ( 1978 ) , a critical and box office bomb that has become a camp classic of sorts .Mae West died in 1980 .Giler resumed his production duties with Ridley Scott 's Alien in 1979 .Among his other big - screen credits in that field are Alien : Resurrection , Alien vs. Predator and the big - budget sci - fier currently on screens all over the world , Prometheus .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Mae West WAS the QUEEN of Hollywood for decades and did whatever it took to guard her status and always with great success .It was a different era .I absolutely loved her and I also love Raquel Welch - who had to fight her way through decades of a different Hollywood makeup to show she was far more than a beautiful face and body .She is so talented and a very sharp woman and will be 70 soon ( looking like a very hot 40 without all the garbage ) .God bless her and I hope she gets the role of her life in her 70 's !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
