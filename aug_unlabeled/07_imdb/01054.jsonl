{"text": "This movie is incredibly stupid .I laughed a bit in the beginning / middle , but towards the end it just got horrible .The whole plot seems moronic to me .Two guys play poker , essentially one owes the other about $ 1,500 , but first they go to the airport to pick up his fiance who just flew in from China .She gets kidnapped at the gate , and taken to be sold .She then gets taken again by these Raven - from - Mortal - Kombat impersonatrs who value her green eyes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
