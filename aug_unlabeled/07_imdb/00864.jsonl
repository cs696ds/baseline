{"text": "Remember him ?Or was it Rick ?It was a rare occurrence and a great time and lasted for a good long while .Somehow we got a call to meet up with some others in one of the rooms down the hall .Someone had some Maui Wowie and wanted to start a party .So we paid our respects to our unknown host and headed on down that Yellow Brick Road to see what the Wizard had in Toto 's doggie bag .An hour later and we were off the Yellow Brick Road and somewhere over the rainbow .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So I being \" Mr Know It All \" , decide to lead the party to a great buffet across the street that everyone would enjoy and was more affordable than what Caesar had to offer .We were all damn hungry so I decided to take the \" shortcut \" .So four of us shortcut seekers ended up sitting on our ass in three feet of water fronting the Las Vegas Strip .But it was warm and we were hungry enough to just keep on trucken and managed to slosh our way across the Blvd and kind of wade into that big paddle wheel boat looking place that used to be directly across the street .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Eventually we got to the buffet and had a decent meal .Those were good days when this sport was pretty small and everyone somehow managed to get together to celebrate other peoples ' victories without a cover charge .And the \" big cheeses \" liked to see everyone enjoy themselves so they kept it going as best they could/ .Okay one that involves former strongman , UFC fighter and now politician Tony Halme .I think I told this one so sorry if a repeat .I will try to keep it short .A friend of ours had a t - shirt design compnay in LA .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I get there and he comes out to meet me with a black eye .I ask him what happened and he tells me .He apparently designed and made some golf shirts for a car dealership in Las Vegas for there annual Golf event .While he is telling me this I notice a hole in hs wall in the office .Apparently the car dealership still operates like in the old days and sent out a hit man to rough up my friend .He put his head through the wall and hit him a few times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anyway , my friend put together all these shirts ( about 3 or 4 dozen ) and sent them to the dealership .Well they said they were wrong and wanted them done over .Now mind you no payment has been made yet and the design was signed off on the order he showed me .But , it appeared they made a change when they say them and wanted them done over with the changes .Well my friend said no problem but that the ad to pay for those since they ordered them and approved them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The total bill was around a grand I think .Anyway , he want to pay me and Tony to go to Vegas and tell this guy never come back to see my friend .So , me and Tony drove to Vegas .Now we get there ( the place is called Falconi Honda ) and we are standing in the entrance looking around .Now Tony is very mean looking with a shaved head and an arrow shaved in it , tattoos and is about 6'4 \" 330 lbs with a very heavy Arnold type accent .I am small at 6'1 \" about 300 lbs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He points over to one of those cubicle offices spaces .We start heading over there .There is this guy behind the desk .Tony asks Are you Falconi ?( remeber in a heavy Arnold accent ) he says yes I can help you after I am done with these folks .Tony says you are done with them now .He then grabs the girl and guys and tells them to go outside and wait .The guy stand up from behind the desk and before he can say anything Tony shoves him back in his seat .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One guy comes over and asks if there is a problem .I say something like Not yet gett outta here .Well now Tony has his hands on this guy and he says who are you guys .Tony says none of your business all you need to knwo is if you come or send anyone else to LA to see Jerry we will come back to see you .All this time Tony is on the side of the desk with this guy with a handful of shirt .The guy is shitting .Anyway , Tony asked if he understood and he said yea .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then I say .Yea you are some small time mob fuck who has nothing better to do than beat up a guy for some shirts .Is the mob business that slow .Then Tony said remember what I say .Do n't come back .So on the way out I notice a hottie is working behind the frnt desk .I ask her for her phone number before Tony grabs me and says lets go .So I had to leave empty handed .And nothing else ever came of this incident .Anyway , that was a small part of my experience with the mob .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That is a funny story .Later .Some ca n't be repeated , but knowing Only , I 'm sure he 'll tell every one .Here 's just a casual observation I 've made over they past few years .I 'm an avid Blackjack player and know Basic Strategy as well as anyone .I do n't count cards , but I do know how to count to 21 quite well .I know that the odds will be against me almost every time , so I play for fun and have a good time winning or losing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But I have a feeling that many competitve bodybuilders have difficulty counting up to 21 as many may feel rushed and stand on 10 or 11 and sometimes even hit on 17 , 18 , and 19 instead of taking their time to add up the numbers .On many occasions , I 've grown impatient and jump in and offer some advice even when I 've had a few too many and have to resort to counting on my fingers myself in order to offer the right decision .One last remark on this subject .........Competitive bodybuilders are usually crammed in at Blackjack tables that offer $ 25 minimums and even when they 're losing chips , they appear to be having a hell of a great time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Okay here is another one of my quick stories .After a fight at the MGM we decided to play at Ballys .Now , when I play with Uncle it is usually at one of the Coast properties .I played at the Rio and Caesars but that 's it .Well like I should have known , they knew my uncle very well at this place too .Now Ballys is packed .He has to go do something so he tells me to go scout out a table and see which one is hot .So I go scoutin and I see a table that is very loud .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Well right away my uncle starts .He ALWAYS has to play on the end of table .Well the guy on the other end is rolling .Right off the bat he places $ 500 on the line .The guy rolls an 8 .He right away bets $ 5200 across .He almost always presses the numbers 3 times .He bets $ 100 on all the hard ways .And does his regular $ 25 acee/ duecee .He bets allot of off table bets too .Well the guys rolls a 7 on his first roll .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anyway , it was his turn to roll .Now , right after he lost that money and the guy rolled a 7 he looks at me and says something like , \" I thought you said this was a fucking hot table .Ijust shrugged my shoulders .ANyway it 's his turn to roll .To make this short he held the dice for about 10 minutes and probably made about $ 20,000 or so .Well now it 's my turn .I told him not to bet on me but he did .Well I 7 out to and now he is pissed even more .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
