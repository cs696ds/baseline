{"text": "Why would a \" dark side \" tinged person have a purple lightsaber ?Because red + blue make purple ?Why not green + red to make brown ?And yes , in Episode II and III we start to have Jedi who wear black and yet with no hint that they 're evil ( so we wo n't think Luke wore black and unwittingly wore Sith colors ) .Plus Lucas broke his own rule with Episode III by giving Grievious green and blue lightsabers , and Anakin a blue saber even after he 'd joined the Sith .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "True , but Lucas could always have found an excuse to give him a red one .For example , we know Palpatine had at least two lightsabers in his possession , so he could have given one to Anakin .It may be that the Jedi just naturally associated red with Sith ( we have no indication in the films that this is so however ) , and so to help hide the fact that Anakin had become a Sith he did n't bother during the Purge ... maybe .Plus Lucas broke his own rule with Episode III by giving Grievious green and blue lightsabers , and Anakin a blue saber even after he 'd joined the Sith .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
