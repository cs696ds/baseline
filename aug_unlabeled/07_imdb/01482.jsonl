{"text": "Fans of British comedy will delight in the diversely talented casts , featuring Joan Collins , Kenneth More , Bob Monkhouse , Kenneth Connor , Frankie Howerd , Margaret Rutherford , Petula Clark , David Tomlinson , Joan Sims , and Richard Wattis , among many others .The transfers are , frankly , subpar though the better films in the set tend to suffer less than the weaker ones do .This two - disc collection is region - free .Released in America as The Adventures of Sadie ( see above ) , Our Girl Friday is billed in the packaging as if it were VCI 's headliner , but in fact it 's the feeblest film in the bunch , with the least - pleasing transfer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Three others have likewise made it safely to shore : hard - drinking Irish stoker Pat Plunkett ( Kenneth More ) , cynical journalist Jimmy Carrol ( George Cole ) , and stuffy academic Professor Gibble ( Robertson \" Bunny \" Hare ) .( The film may have been partly inspired by Fox 's big film of Titanic , released earlier that same year ; More , of course , would star in the best film about the doomed ocean liner , A Night to Remember , a few years later . )Exactly what you 'd expect given the situation follows , albeit at a snail 's pace .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She 's snooty throughout and they 're no better while Pat , an insufferable stereotyped Irishman ( all that 's missing are muttonchops and a clay pipe ) , plays the men one off the other , like Toshiro Mifune with the warring gangsters in Yojimbo ( 1961 ) .None of the characters are remotely likeable , and the film is a total misfire , with even fewer laughs than the similarly - styled Atoll K ( 1951 ) , Laurel & Hardy 's disastrous final film , which at least had a chuckle or two .Borrowed from the J. Arthur Rank Organisation , Joan Collins was Hot Stuff in 1953 when this was made , and the following year was signed by 20th Century - Fox in America in an attempt to rival to MGM 's Elizabeth Taylor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Bikinis were in 1953 still quite scandalous ; the modern swimwear was introduced in France in 1946 but did n't catch on for quite some time in Britain and America ; when Our Girl Friday was released American women would n't have been caught dead in one .The film has an excellent cast , but no one is used well , especially the wonderful More .Also in the cast are Hermione Gingold , Hattie Jacques , and Felix Felton .Peter Sellers reportedly does the voice of at least one parrot , though his work is uncredited .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( Reportedly all the fog and shadows was to hide the meager budget , but the film 's cheapness never gets in the way of the fun . )The film was comedian Frankie Howerd 's official screen debut ; he plays Percy Lamb , an inept bus driver shuttling passengers from Heathrow to Blackbushe Airports when their flights are diverted due to thick fog .Meanwhile , authorities investigating the robbery of \u00a3 200,000 in gold bullion determine it 's been stashed in the boot of Percy 's bus , and that the thief or thieves are on board , masquerading as passengers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It has the uncluttered simplicity of Laurel and Hardy and the genre fusing of an Abbott & Costello , yet the humor is resolutely British , Howerd 's Percy being a prime example .Howerd 's specialty was seemingly off - the - cuff expressions of mock - outrage , often sardonic , risqu\u00e9 asides expressed in supposed innocence .Though a somewhat limited characterization , in that role no one was funnier .In The Runaway Bus Howerd gets to play off a great supporting cast ; his eye - rolling reactions to Margaret Rutherford 's typically peculiar behavior are quite hilarious , while she 's in peak form here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The rest of the cast is just fine , the usual assortment of actors one regularly finds in this sort of thing .Michael Gwynn , Marianne Stone , and Sam Kydd are among those in small but memorable roles .Cinematographer Stanley Pavey spent most of his career photographing similar films , though he did shoot Dead of Night ( 1945 ) early in his career .In any case , the film 's sustained noir look and Val Guest 's script are as impressive as the best performances .Reportedly Howerd requested that the film work as a straight mystery in case audiences did n't take to him or his character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Val Guest also had a hand in Dentist in the Chair , which he co - scripted ( after Matthew Finch 's novel ) , though busy genre director Don Chaffey was at the helm .It 's a meager premise on which to build an 84-minute comedy ( the version presented here is cut ; see below ) , but the cast is enjoyable , if a bit old to make believable dental students .Besides Barker , Connor comes off best as the clich\u00e9d uncultured Cockney crook .It 's a very broad characterization but Connor 's funny and likeable as are his resistant partners in crime : Monkhouse , Stevens , and the appealing Cummins .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "American viewers unfamiliar with the comic actor Richard Hearne will likely find The Time of His Life a real head - scratcher ; it 's so mild and slight as to be almost invisible .Hearne ( 1908 - 1979 ) was a star of early British television , famous for an apparently Tati - esque ( or maybe Bean - esque ) character he created named Mr. Pastry , a persona that had been dominating his career since originating the character in a 1936 stage show .Pastry was a bumbling old man with a trademark bowler hat and walrus mustache , and the comedy Hearne engaged in was primarily slapstick .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , though The Time of His Life was intended as a showcase for Hearne 's characterization , apparently it was heavily altered for the film , in which the movie Pastry becomes a wrongly - convicted prisoner who served years for an embezzlement he did n't commit .Whatever Hearne 's charms in other films and venues , in The Time of His Life he comes off as a rather undistinguished character player not particularly funny , just a pathetic milquetoast type .The picture has a slight edge over Our Girl Friday only because of its slight strangeness ; it 's almost a comedy about adult children being psychologically abusive to a kindly parent they 're ashamed of .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Very odd .The pair get drunk and switch clothes , and the next morning each is mistaken for the other , and rather than come clean allow the deception to continue well past the point of no return .Peggy Cummins is back , joined by gorgeous Eunice Gayson , best remembered today as James Bond 's first girlfriend , in both Dr. No ( 1962 ) and From Russia with Love .Back in 1957 however , Gayson was a real knockout ( as opposed to merely conventionally glamorous , as she was in the Bond films ) , a kind of British Faith Domergue .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , more than the others Carry on Admiral is compromised by a poor transfer .The film , released in America as The Ship was Loaded , was photographed in SpectraScope , a 2.35:1 anamorphic process akin to CinemaScope .The opening credits are 4:3 letterboxed , but after that the presentation is full - frame panned - and - scanned , with a slight squeeze added to the picture , but not enough of a squeeze to call it 16:9 enhancement .The resultant image is soft and awkwardly framed throughout .Video & Audio .The good news is that the best film of the bunch , The Runaway Bus does n't suffer too terribly from its less - than stellar transfer , but everything here is definitely sub - par .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's terrible ghosting , scratches , tepid color , and the film element sourced is even warped at one point , pulsating in and out of focus .Our Girl Friday includes a Spanish audio track .The Time of His Life and Dentist in the Chair should be 16:9 enhanced widescreen at 1.66:1 but instead are 4:3 full frame sourced from splice - filled prints .The cropping of Carry on Admiral is discussed above .Two of the films are also short : Dentist in the Chair has a listed running time of 84 minutes but here runs 75 ; Carry on Admiral is supposed to be 83 minutes but runs 78 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
