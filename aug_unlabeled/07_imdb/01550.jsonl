{"text": "Publisher Bob Guccione 's competing magazine Penthouse went far beyond Hefner 's fairly repressed notions of sexuality and relative good taste .Guccione had no use for literary pretensions and catered to readers who liked smutty humor ; its fantasy women were not only available , but wanton as well .Clearly deciding that mainstream interest in porn was a growing trend , Guccione launched Caligula , a multimillion dollar X - rated Roman costume epic .Using big name talent to transpose his slick magazine visuals to the big screen , Guccione hoped to make cinema history by breaking taboos along with box office records .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Bob Guccione account of the film 's making is a collection of controversies , some self - generated .Noted author and sage Gore Vidal maintained that he was hired to write a daring but literary expos\u00e9 on a Roman child - emperor who abused his powers .Original director Tinto Brass makes big claims for his artistic rights -- in Italy the director has legal rights over the fate of his work .Guccione appears on camera in a pulled - open shirt and several pounds of gold chains , doing his best to work up a major controversy over the rights of authors vs. directors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "An actor or two expressed disgust at being roped into performing in the film , but I do n't see any guns pointed at them in the BTS footage .Perhaps Guccione was holding their loved ones hostage ?As for the young English leads Malcolm McDowell and Helen Mirren , they probably judged that a film maudit or two in their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s might actually be a plus .Asked to provide an on - camera testimonial , the unflappable Mirren chooses irony , describing the movie as \" an irresistible mix of art and genitals \" .The driving impetus behind Caligula was , of course , money .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Gore Vidal 's name provided a veneer of respectability ; \" erotic filmmaker \" Tinto Brass could deliver the genitals .The director 's previous claim to fame was Salon Kitty , a successful cocktail of Nazis , sex and sadism .The \" official rumor \" on Caligula has it that , unbeknownst to the director or actors , Guccione imported his \" Penthouse Pets \" to surreptitiously film additional hard - X footage .But dailies suggest that plenty of sexual activity was going on even in the main shoot .As reported in the disc 's insert liner notes , multiple edits were undertaken in Italy , England and finally America , making who filmed what difficult to determine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The extended \" Imperial Edition \" is a lovingly transferred 157 minutes of bad writing and acting dominated by Danilo Donati 's extravagant , absurd sets .The acres of naked flesh are just an extension of the set design .Guccione permanently dispels the pre-70 's notion that attractive people ca n't be induced to disrobe or perform sex in front of a camera .A cast of at least 500 appears willing to do whatever 's asked of them in scenes arranged as free - form orgy - pageants .Faced with scene after scene crowded with naked bodies , Tinto Brass utilizes a sensible if artless directing strategy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For the orgy sequences several minutes ' worth of action is planned out and performed as a block , and then covered from a multiplicity of angles .This explains why so many 16 mm BTS shots are taken from the studio rafters , the one place where an extra cameraman could be certain not to spoil some camera 's line of sight .A scene in which McDowell 's Caligula watches his consort Caesonia ( Helen Mirren ) dance is splintered by at least four or five sidebar diversions .A reverse angle reveals the two nymphettes lying on either side of the emperor being happily molested .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The settings for orgies favor multi - level open - face constructions and artificial cyclorama backgrounds , suitable for high - key , warm lighting to favor the flesh on display .These sets seem patterned on the stylized work for Fellini 's Satyricon , organized to produce the flat look of an ancient frieze or tapestry , with \" action \" played out like panels in a comic strip .The sets in Caligula resemble giant toy play sets , to better see the action \" figures \" from multiple angles at once .Could Gore Vidal 's major influence have been Pasolini 's Salo ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Seeing O'Toole acting petulant in poxy makeup , this reviewer imagined a cutaway to the actor in a shot from What 's Up Pussycat ? fifteen years earlier , specifically the moment where O'Toole gives us a mournful look and says , \" As a man 's life goes down the drain , you are there . \"Caligula teaches us that power corrupts , and when the corruption is really dirty there 's a hell of a pornographic movie in it .Some detractors call it anti - erotic .But there 's no denying that the Barnum & Bailey Sex & Sleaze Show is clearly not something one sees every day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As the cut is the end result of various revisions through the intervening years , worrying about fidelity to an \" original release \" is a job for celluloid archeologists .Suffice it to say that the film is no longer known as Gore Vidal 's Caligula and that the names in the main title sequence have been creatively scrambled to redistribute writing , directing and editing credit .A second transfer is billed as an alternate pre - release version , \" never seen before \" .Nathaniel Thompson , producer for the disc extras , assembled this longer cut from unused original negative material , adding scenes and appending others where possible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Caligula 's tortured development included a bizarre disconnect between art director Danilo Donati and the demands of the script , hard - core reshoots directed by Guccione ( and Giancarlo Lui ) , and an international legal battle over the right to edit the film .Every stress fracture can be felt in the \" finished \" film ( now available in equally disjointed \" unrated \" and \" pre - release \" versions ) , an explicit fantasia seduced by its own astonishingly stylized take on pagan Rome , circa 37 AD-41 AD .In fulfillment of Guccione 's mandate for stars , Malcolm McDowell plays Caligula , the third Emperor of Rome ; Peter O'Toole plays his father , the Emperor Tiberius ; and Sir John Gielgud plays their wary advisor Nerva .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Incest is only the tip of Caligula 's naughty iceberg : Brass represents Rome 's depravity as spawning tortures both straightforward ( mostly justified paranoia ) and bizarre ( hellish deformations ) .Intense sex and violence emerge as havoc wreaked in pain and pleasure on the human body .Disembowelment and genital mutilation get featured scenes , and the scores of full - frontally nude extras of both sexes seem downright tame compared to the pornographic sequences of intercourse , oral sex and yet more creative activities .The film 's intent to bridge legit and XXX cinema is epitomized in the sequence intercutting a softcore sex scene with McDowell and Mirren with a hardcore lesbian sex scene .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The long - lens photography of Donati 's sprawling sets has a decidedly surrealistic effect , and a distancing one .So does Brass ' approach to the film 's opulent , operatic spectacle , which can be sumptuous in its crackpot way ( and occasionally accompanied by cuts from Aram Khachaturian and Sergei Prokofiev ) .Social commentary and character development are sidelined in favor of rambling set pieces , and only isolated lines express any thought or carry dramatic impact .\" They lust for power and pleasure , \" Tiberius says of his people , though since the Emperor 's face is ravaged by syphilis , it 's a case of the pot calling the kettle black .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The fantastic Blu - ray edition of Caligula includes everything you always wanted to know about the movie but were afraid to ask ( includng everything from the previous 3-disc DVD set ) .The feature is presented in the unrated theatrical cut ( 156 m ) and an \" alternate pre - release \" cut ( 153 m ) .Both look roughly the same , and though the image is literally rough , the deficiencies of the transfer seemingly owe to the source .It 's difficult to imagine the film looking any better than it does here without some form of restoration , but do n't expect spectacular results from Blu - ray on this particular title .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The jewel in the crown of Image 's \" Imperial Edition \" is the commentary with Malcolm McDowell and Nick Redman .The frank and funny McDowell has a terrific memory : he shares amazing anecdotes peppered with spot - on impressions of his director and co - stars .A second commentary features Helen Mirren in conversation with writers Alan Jones and James Chaffin ; Mirren is similarly laconic and good - natured in dishing about the infamous film .A third commentary is actually a 94-minute audio interview of on - set Penthouse writer Ernest Volkman , talking by phone with Image Entertainment 's Nathaniel Thompson .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "What makes Vampyres work as a horror film is that the lust on display is so overwhelming that it ca n't help but also be completely destructive .While it 's not exactly groundbreaking to point out the thin line between sex and violence , Vampyres almost does n't see a line at all .In this film , sex is violence .The men never seem to need much convincing to come inside for a glass of wine to thank them for their trouble , and what follows is an unforgettable evening of luxury and seduction .The very red wine flows freely , the women make for charming company , and their companions are likely to end up at least getting laid before getting killed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To dispose the bodies of their victims , they simply put return them to their cars and park them back out on the road in staged car crashes , albeit car crashes that have mysteriously drained the drivers of their blood .Over and over again , policemen cart away the bodies and tow the cars , apparently never stopping to wonder why this seems to happen daily in their otherwise sleepy little hamlet .Things only start to go sour when one particularly charismatic man intrigues Fran enough that she keeps him alive a little too long , leaving her and Miriam at risk of being discovered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The two seem to have a rapport , although it 's hard to tell whether Fran is merely practicing the art of seduction or whether she 's genuinely interested in this guy .When they inevitably make it to the bedroom for the first time , Ted proves a bumbling but aggressive lover , and perhaps it 's that aggressiveness that Fran responds to positively .At any rate , she refrains from killing him that first night , merely cutting a long gash into his arm .Throughout the film , she licks and nibbles at the blood oozing from the cut , eventually weakening Ted to the point at which he no longer has the physical power to even leave the house .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , whatever else happens in the film , Vampyres is always ready to veer suddenly into more sexy sex .( By the shower scene , though , even the most enthusiastic viewers might start to look at their watches . )Although it 's an unabashedly erotic film , Vampyres does pay homage to the conventions of horror in which it 's rooted , and eventually finds a uniquely horrifying voice of its own .Most of the action takes place in and around Oakley Court , the famous Victorian house that appears in several Hammer films ( including 1960 's The Brides of Dracula ) as well as The Rocky Horror Picture Show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Meanwhile , a typically na\u00efve young couple decide to camp on the grounds of the house for several days , the boyfriend laughing off the girlfriend 's discomfort and strange , ultimately prescient nightmares by reminding her that it 's clearly just an old abandoned house .Waiting for these two idiots to eventually get knocked off is all in good classic horror movie fun .The mythology of vampirism is a bit nontraditional here , and in some ways might also be influenced by gothic haunted - house stories .The opening scene , for instance , finds Fran and Miriam shot and killed mid - coitus by a mysterious gunman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Was this some kind of early hate crime , and is their metamorphosis into undead monsters a form of revenge on a world full of hostile men ?The movie does n't spend much time fleshing this out - there 's another sex scene to get to , after all ! -but the opening casts a provocative shadow over what follows .Other vampire rules are off - kilter here , too , most noticeably the lack of fangs .Rather than bite necks , Fran and Miriam tend to attack their victims with giant knives and suck blood from their wounds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The stereotypical vampire film portrays blood - sucking in a highly stylized , even polite way - the victim 's tightened intake of breath , the prick of the teeth , the small stream of blood down the neck , the intimacy of the whole action .Not so in Vampyres .Here , Fran and Miriam literally rush their victims - several scenes boast POV shots in which they run right at the camera into your living room .Their eyes sparkle with demonic energy as they stab their victim again and again with the knife , then fall onto the body to drink the blood from the wounds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What it looks like they 're doing is actually tearing their victims to pieces , less like vampires and more like crazed serial killers .There 's no denying the intense eroticism of these scenes and the none - too - subtly implied dangers of out - of - control female sexuality , but that aesthetic has been injected here with a bit of grindhouse flavor .Only the final killing more or less dispenses with the sexual element , and without that element , death comes much more clinically and humiliatingly to the victim than anything that came before .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This all seems to reference the nihilistic brutality that was becoming more pronounced in the horror films of the 1970s in exploitation classics like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the later I Spit on Your Grave .Rather than end on that bleak note , though , Vampyres instead gives us a bewildering and , frankly , stupid conclusion that further confuses the issue of the exact supernatural makeup of Fran and Miriam , even suggesting that the entire film might have been a dream .It 's a disappointing cop - out for a film that so flagrantly ups the ante for sex and violence , but for a film this bizarre , it 's almost the only ending that would work at all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
