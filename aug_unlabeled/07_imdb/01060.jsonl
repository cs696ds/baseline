{"text": "My favorite characters in this play are the witches - and the decision of the actors or directors to speak very , very slowly was probably intended to impart an ominous feel , but it felt more \" hooked - on - phonics \" .The very , very slow speech very nearly ruined the play .The role of Banquo was fulfilled very well by the actor .The other characters were adequate .In a few places the actors change the lines a bit ( a few words only ) , which was disappointing .Overall , the reading is OK , not great .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You can now follow your favorite reviewers on Audible .You can un - follow a listener at any time to stop receiving their updates .Directed by Joe Massot ( who would later make The Song Remains The Same ) in 1968 , Wonderwall is noteworthy for being the first movie that George Harrison did the music for .The storyline , such as it is , follows a strange fifty - something man named Professor Oscar Collins ( Jack MacGowran ) who lives all alone in his apartment .His life changes when a beautiful , and much younger , model named Penny Lane ( Jane Birkin ) moves into the apartment next door .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Here is a man who very obviously lacks focus , who writes down the things that he has to do each day and seems to have trouble remembering some of his co - workers ' names .Yet when Penny moves in next door , his focus is singular and precise .Harrison 's soundtrack work for the picture is heavy on sitar music so how much you get out of what is obviously the film 's main draw ( for most people ... some of us are more interested in this for the presence of Birkin ! ) will depend on your personal appreciation for that particular instrument but the compositions are interesting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "MacGowran brings an eclectic tone to his work in the picture and makes out of Collins an eccentric and socially awkward character that is , if nothing else , interesting to watch .Birkin 's work is very much the opposite of his .She has nothing to say , her character goes about her business and we see this ravishing beauty in mundane situations that then morph into Collins ' fantasies .Given that she does n't have a whole lot of dialogue it 's to her credit that she 's as mesmerizing to watch here as she is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie might be fairly plotless and decidedly weird simply for the sake of being weird , but it is not without its merits or its curiosity value .Note : This Blu - ray release of Wonderwall includes both the original theatrical cut of the movie and the director 's cut of the film .Going against the grain , the director 's cut is actually seventeen minutes shorter than the theatrical cut .As to which version is better ?It all comes down to personal preference , really .The theatrical cut is more unusual and at times more surreal while the pacing on the director 's cut is improved .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Massot 's director 's cut does include a Harrison song called ' In The First Place ' that did n't make its way into the theatrical cut .The Blu - ray .Video : .Wonderwall arrives on Blu - ray in an AVC encoded 1.66.1 1080p high definition transfer that generally looks really nice .Colors are reproduced very vibrantly here without ever looking artificially boosted while black levels stay pretty solid throughout .Some shots show heavier grain than others but there is n't much in the way of actual print damage to complain about .Detail looks quite impressive most of the time , though some shots look to have been done with some softness in mind , while skin tones appear lifelike and natural throughout .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you squint and look for it you might pick up on some minor crush in a few of the darker scenes but otherwise , this is a very good transfer .Sound : .The only audio option on the disc is an English language DTS - HD 5.1 Master Audio track , the original mix is not included .For the most part this is a front heavy mix that does n't have a whole lot of channel separation going on outside of some periodic activity in the surround that comes courtesy of the score .Dialogue is clean enough and easy to follow and the levels are properly balanced .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All in all the audio quality is fine .Extras : .The extras are pretty decent on this release , starting with a two minute piece called The Comic Art Of Jack MacGowran which is a brief look at the man who played Collins in the film .More substantial is the twelve minute Reflections On Love .It 's a short movie made by Joe Massot that eventually turned into the movie that would become Wonderwall .Beatles fans will appreciate this as it 's got some footage of them leaving the UK for their first American TV appearance in there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Wonderwall is both a product of its time and an obvious exercise in style over substance more interested in creating mood and atmosphere than telling a traditional narrative tale .Fans of The Beatles and George Harrison will likely find more to appreciate than others , but given that the beautiful Jane Birkin gets to play the female lead , well , the movie definitely has that going for it too .Ultimately it 's a trippy and bizarrely surreal film worth seeing for fans of oddball experimental sixties cinema .The Blu - ray release from Shout !Factory looks and sounds quite good and offers up a nice smattering of supplements as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I just saw the Kurzel / Fassbender Macbeth movie that came out in NYC today and all I can say is ... don't believe the rotten tomato - meter : THIS IS TOTAL GARBAGE !Any dialogue that builds character , complex or simple , or explores the relationship between them , or indeed even provides them with motivation has been cut .Scenes have been run together and juxtaposed to the point that there is no room for the characters and their stories to breathe .The arcs that should be there , and are in the original , have been flattened out , so that the whole thing is basically one note ... most definitely not the cure for boring Shakespeare !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wondered if it was worse for the actors being trapped in the movie or for me being trapped in the theater watching the movie !Because so much is cut , when important events happen , they are never earned , or even make sense .Instead , they just seem to be scenes that Kurzel et al .felt obliged to put in because it 's supposed to be Macbeth and these are the scenes that people may know .And then Banquo just hangs out at the table for the rest of the scene .It 's not played as ghostly or a hallucination , just like he 's another guest who is just sitting there stiff like everyone else .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But also , the scene where the Macbeth 's are reunited in the beginning and start to discuss the possibility of assassination is chopped and twisted to the point where it just sounds like two villains who have already wanted the king dead for a long time .If I could paraphrase the scene , \" The king is coming ... when is he going ? ... tomorrow ... let 's kill him tonight then ...Ok , sure .\" Oh , and let us not forget that instead of an army approaching behind trees or even boughs , we just have a raging forest fire with no one fighting but Macduff and Macbeth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He also inserts this young teen boy who seems to intrigue Macbeth in the opening battle scene and reappears throughout the movie , most horrendously carrying the dagger in the ' Is this a dagger ? ' scene .If he is supposed to remind Macbeth of his dead son , it is left completely vague and does n't work at all .Trying to figure what the hell he was doing there took me out of every scene in which he appeared .Another thing that made me laugh , because otherwise I would have screamed at the screen , is that they do n't even pay attention to their own edits .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just another bad decision .Ok , now I 'm just ranting , I could go on but you get the point .The one thing I can say that I did enjoy in this ' movie ' is the music and the cinematography .The score is this beautiful minimal score that has the feel of Scottish bagpipes without ever using them or directly referencing anything Scottish .And this film looks gorgeous .From the wide shots of blasted heaths to the close up shots , the DP knew what he was doing .When there is only music , I could enjoy it somewhat , though I would just say to myself-'this would make a great Bowie video ' , but then they start speaking and I am reminded what an utter failure this is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kurzel should make music videos and quit the movie biz if this is the kind of thing he is going to do - he achieved a mood , dark and brooding , but did not tell a story or even give us a character study .As for the screenwriters , they deserve to suffer the same fate as the Macduff family in this movie ( yet another bad decision made in this movie) ... hint : it involves fire , again .To sum up , I have n't been this angry at a Shakespeare adaptation since Gibson 's ' Hamlet .

{"text": "I am writing this so that you may share whatever parts you would like with your listeners .I would hate to think that someone who may not know the play will see this and think it in any way reflects Macbeth , that such a person would stop here and miss out on the richness and depth of the language and characters Shakespeare created .It 's not just a flawed version , it is a misrepresentation .Similarly , I also would like to warn those who know the play to avoid this version , or if you must see it , think of it as Macbeth the music video .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
