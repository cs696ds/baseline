{"text": "Under My Skin ( La Belle de Paris ) ( Negulesco ) ( as Dan Butler ) ; The Difficult Years ( Zampa - English - language version of Anni difficile ) ( as narrator ) ; The Breaking Point ( Curtiz ) ( as Harry Morgan ) .Before Marlon Brando , before James Dean , and before Paul Newman , Robert De Niro , and Al Pacino there was John Garfield , an actor of intensity and sensitivity who embodied the rebel / antihero character .In fact , he was the first actor to consistently play such roles on screen , beginning his career over a decade before Brando .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While no profound political thinker , he was a man of deep emotion and intense loyalty , and his progressive / left - wing contacts made him a target of the Hollywood witch - hunts of the McCarthy era .In his films Garfield represented the socially underprivileged , the common man who clashed with the system .He showed ambition and hard work ; he was sensual and strong and exhibited a certain vulnerability .He portrayed a good boy who got all the wrong breaks , but whose rebellious spirit enabled him to battle back against the inequities of his society .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "More significantly , in the early 1930s , the playwright Clifford Odets recommended him for membership in the newly formed Group Theater , the legendary and influential theater company / collective whose members included Elia Kazan , Lee Strasberg , and Harold Clurman .After losing the lead role in Odets 's Golden Boy -a part the writer penned with Garfield in mind - to Luther Adler , Garfield left the theater for Hollywood .He signed a seven - year Warner Brothers contract and his first role , a supporting turn in Michael Curtiz 's Four Daughters , made him a star .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Another significant aspect of this film was Garfield 's unique acting style , with his moody , soulful sexuality standing out among the more conventional actors of the period .Upon the success of Four Daughters , Warner Brothers chose to recast Garfield in inferior films that recycled the Mickey Borden character .And so the actor found himself playing moody poor boys , if not outright criminals , in such generically titled features as They Made Me a Criminal , Dust Be My Destiny , and Nobody Lives Forever .After choosing not to renew his studio contract , Garfield formed his own production company .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Between 1947 and 1950 Garfield did some of his finest screen acting in some of his most interesting films .He had a small but significant part in Gentleman 's Agreement , a film about anti - Semitism .In the highly regarded film noir Force of Evil , the lone film directed by Abraham Polonsky prior to being blacklisted , he played a crooked lawyer .In We Were Strangers , he was an American fighting on the side of Cuban revolutionaries .In The Breaking Point , based on Hemingway 's To Have and Have Not , he was a troubled , financially strapped fishing boat captain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In 1951 Garfield was subpoenaed by the U.S. Congressional Committee on Un - American Activities .He answered all questions , describing himself as a Democratic Party member and political liberal .He told the committee , \" I have always hated communism .It is a tyranny which threatens our country and the peace of the world .Of course , then I have never been a member of the Communist party , or a sympathizer with any of its doctrines .I will be pleased to cooperate with the committee .\"But he would not \" name any names , \" as his street boy 's sense of honor would not allow him to rat on his friends .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "An FBI investigation of Garfield was ordered , and the actor found himself blacklisted .In early 1952 , Garfield appeared on Broadway in a revival of Golden Boy .But he was destroyed by his committee ordeal , and subsequent expulsion from Hollywood .He died of a heart attack that spring , having not reached his 40th birthday .An actor undoubtedly ahead of his time , Garfield not only played antiheroes but thoroughly immersed himself in his characters .While not as famous as the actors who followed him , Garfield was the prototype of the celluloid antihero .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
