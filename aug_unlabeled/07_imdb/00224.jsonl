{"text": "Publishing tips , insights , and wisdom from a seasoned pro in the book business .October 07 , 2008 .The Art of Fireproofing .On this blog , I have regularly commented about art and faith -- more specificially , calling for people of faith to do a great job when creating art , since I think it 's too easy for believers to be lazy about their craft .Think about it -- if you can claim \" I 'm doing this for the glory of God , \" then maybe that trumps any discussion of the value of your work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I mention this because I 've been hearing from Christians that I need to go see the movie \" Fireproof \" -- a Christian film that has received fairly wide play in theaters .Several Christian writers encouraged me to go , since the film has a strong message and is directed at a good cause .I 'll admit I did n't do any preparation for the movie , but instead just showed up so I could take it in and see what the fuss is all about .It turns out it 's another one of those films that was written and produced by Christians who have convinced themselves that they 're at the top of their game because they have a strong \" message . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kirk Cameron ca n't act .Come on ... they cast Kirk as the tough captain of a Firehouse ?He 's a soft metrosexual type .What next -- he 's going to cast himself as an NBA center ?The guy is completely unbelievable in the shout / be - angry / get - in - the - men's - faces portions of the film .In addition , he always LOOKS like he 's acting .The fight scenes with his wife seem fake .The \" place your hands over your face so it will look like you 're emotionally struggling \" business simply looks like he could n't figure out what to do in the deeper portions of the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And the fact that Christians like him should n't blind them to that .( And , let 's face it , his acting in the \" Left Behind \" movies was downright horrible .Egad . )The rest of the cast is awful .The firemen working under Captain Kirk 's command are right out of high school acting class .The mom has all the emotional range of a piece of wood .The dad is the guy who used to pastor your church .The doctor has a nice smile , but only two looks -- coy and furtive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The one group of people in this film who can actually act are the nurses , who seem to be just extras filling roles .The script is amateurish .Okay , I realize the goal of this movie is commendable , and that commitment to marriage is a good thing , but reflect on the script for minute ...The firemen provide comic relief that has nothing to do with the story .The scenes with the next - door neighbor are cute , but get predictable .In fact , the entire film is predictable , since any of us could have foretold what was going to unfold with the story ( \" he 'll become a Christian and win her back \" ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The religion is so heavy - handed it 's like watching a tract .There 's no subtlety to the story -- it 's a couple fights , she flirts with an affair , then he finds religion and all is well .Name one other bit of conflict in the movie .The whole thing comes across as a 70 's TV show , with simple sets and a straightforward story that gets resolved in 90 minutes .From a story perspective , it has all the texture of a genre romance novel , only without the strong sense of place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( In fact , I was 15 minutes into this when I turned to my wife and said , \" I ca n't believe we spent $ 13 for a film that we 'll be able to rent for 99 cents in a couple weeks . \" )There were some good parts .The music and cinematography were very professional .The car caught on the railroad tracks and the child inside the burning house actually created some tension -- but let 's face it , neither of those stories had anything to do with the major plotline of the film , nor did either help move the film along .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While Kirk ca n't act , he cries well , and that was affecting .The last 30 minutes were much better than the first 45 .The message overcomes the art .Here 's something True Believers sometimes miss : When you 've got a good message ( \" marriage is good \" ) , the goodness of that message does n't validate the art .The fact that a couple are fighting and make decisions to turn around their relationship is a fine basis for a movie , but this one does n't explore that in any deeper way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( I point that out because the \" Left Behind \" movies were awful -- the last one was such a dog it shed hair on my DVD player . )I think \" a lack of badness \" does n't translate into \" genuine goodness .\" The fact is , I found the spiritual message to be heavy - handed and dull , relying on Christianese so that this really becomes a film Christians can go to and feel good about themselves , rather than a film that might actually persuade someone outside the faith .Now let me tell you what 's going to happen : I 'm about to be swamped with messages from True Believers , exclaiming how the film moved them , and saved their marriage , and their best friends went and it saved their marriage as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But anecdotal stories do n't create truth .( I can introduce you to people who said their lives changed when they joined a cult , or danced with the Hare Krishna , or when they became atheists , so one person 's testimony does n't necessarily validate a principle . )As I said , there 's some actual emotion generated at the end of the film .But this movie lacks substance and subtlety .It lacks texture and finesse .It lacks decent acting and writing .It does n't suck you in or transport you to another place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So please do n't write to tell me how Billy - Bob 's life was spared when he entered the theater , and that he gave up drinking and got baptized and re - committed his life to Christ before entering the priesthood .If you must respond , just tell me what worked or did n't work about the film .Seriously , I have n't seen the movie because my suspicions were along those lines .The previews did not make the story look compelling .I 'm sorry my suspicions are confirmed , but I think your message is a valuable one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But movies are too expensive to see bad ones .I have n't seen the movie yet ( I use the word yet loosely ) , but I appreciate your comment about anecdotal writing .When people learn I 'm a writer , they often magically have a story for me .Which is nothing but a sermon illustration .We hate it when other belief systems are message driven ( we call it agenda driven ) but forget to fight the same motive in our art .Sure , Chip , call me a sap , but hey I LIKE seeing movies that move me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To be entertained , right ?Well , if it moves me and makes me laugh and cry , I think it is entertaining .I saw the first film these two brothers did and it was sappy , poorly written and done on a shoe - string budget .Guess what ?I cried .And not because it broke my heart to see a badly written movie .But because I loved seeing the message of Christ on a film .Yes , even a bad film .The second one they did , the football movie , \" Facing the Giants , \" once again moved me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But I think the true \" art \" here was in the producing aspect of this film .The church filmmakers were able to use the experience from \" Facing The Giants \" to capitalize on a market .There is a reason niche films do well at the box office and this was no exception to the rule .They played their audience well , and their audience ... and really no one else ... paid to see it .They proved to me yet again that there is money in the Christian market .So , we can probably expect to see more Narnia from Disney ...", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Every great christian packaged product is marketed well .Take the books , Left Behind which translated into those awful movies .Well , its like the lunch box , or action figure of the book .Something else to buy .The message of those books did n't matter too much .I would argue it was about capitalizing on the franchise .I do n't think that worked out to well .It goes to show you that works well for Harry Potter may not be such a great idea for novice filmmakers with about a dollar for a budget ... or I really hope they had only a dollar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anyway , it was a horrible loss .What Facing The Giants did was that it found a way , outside of the \" basement .\" The only thing it did , was it took many churches outside of their big or little buildings and it made them go spend money at the theater .Helping AMC 's and REGALS everywhere .And now all of us Christian artists are just embarrassed .I will however include Facing The Giants in future investment packets for films because what it did was prove that Christians will buy their own vomit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They can save their marriage ... yet again .That s worth the 13 bucks , and its probably worth the other 13 bucks they will spend on the book the filmmakers created for this film .COME ON !Its a 2 hour commercial for a book .As a film , its crap in everyway , totally propaganda , and unimportant .The change you experienced while watching this should have been realizing that you just experienced a 2 hour mind job and that you needed to re - think the Christian sub - culture and \" industry \" from top to bottom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would just like to reiterate one of my favorite rants : If you 're doing something for the glory of God , it has to be BETTER than anything the world has to offer .( In the OT God would only accept the spotless animals , not the lame ones ! )Not only does the message not excuse sloppy craftsmanship , but the craftsmanship has to be exceptional if the message is going to have a chance of getting through to anyone who does n't already believe it .The story itself has to be the point , has to be told well and honestly , and the message evolves out of that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What happens when the world has an agenda wrapped in a compelling story ? \" Cider House Rules .\" That movie , that book was masterful in creating a story that moved you ... all the way to questioning a staunch pro - life position !Study how the world does it \" right \" .Psalm 33:3 says , \" Sing unto him a new song ; play skillfully with a loud noise .\" The keyword here is skillfully .This verse seems to tell us that God wants us to work toward improving our art .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , I would like to see better scripts and better acting in Christian films .I think God might like to see that too .Thank you for every word of this rant .I am so tired of shoddy , substandard Christian \" art \" .I love a good message as much as the next person in the pew but it 's so embarrassing when it is delivered so poorly .I am waiting for Christian writers and movie - makers especially to realize that novels and movies make poor vehicles for sermons .I am starved for good Christian stories .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have n't seen it , but I think I did hear about it in the same way that I \" heard \" about Facing the Giants .And that movie sucked .Badly .I do n't think I even finished watching it .I was bored after 10 minutes mostly because the acting was just that bad like you said .That said , I do think they 're learning - and improving .For that , I 'll give them credit .If they keep on making better movies and working on their craft , and I 'll give them that opportunity , then we 'll see where this can go .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If I stop seeing that , then I think the Christian movie industry will likely suffer a major setback .It is too much to ask to have a decent plot and some acceptable acting ?Even B movies are better !I do n't think there 's such a thing as a Christian film .There 's only good films and bad films .A few films with Christian characters have succeeded artistically , but not many .Most of those were made in the 50 's , when Hollywood had higher ethics .Just out of curiosity , what was your take on THE HIDING PLACE ( long ago Corrie Ten Boom story ) ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These are the only two movies that come readily to mind as having a professional quality ( by industry standards)without really thinking hard .One is very old and the other more recent ... which tells me that the best art -- whether movies or books -- is HARD TO DO .It always seems to take way more talent , lots more money , more work , more people , and more breaks than are ever available .All of which has to be done in the middle of a battlefield .As a group , I sometimes think we Christians seem to believe we should n't have to put up with all that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We are to work with all our heart , as for the Lord , to bring him glory .However , I would like to speak to the other side - how God can work through our weaknesses as well .The widow who had only two mites gave everything she had and God found more pleasure in her offering than in that of those who had more .The man with two talents pleased his master as much as the man with five because he took the risk to use then .I do n't personally know the writers or producers of these movies , but I know that their level of expertise in filmaking is much lower than the industry standard .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We would never accomplish anything for the sake of Christ if we did that .What they are accomplishing , even with the bad acting and heavy - handed religious writing , is showing Hollywood that people are willing to pay for entertainment with a higher level of moral integrity .If more films are made with uplifting messages ( whether overtly Christian or not ) because of the success of these films , that is a victory to be celebrated .I pray that Christians will continue to grow in excellence in all fields of art .In my own writing I am constantly learning and improving my craft , but I pray that God can use my earlier , weaker , manuscripts for his glory as well as the later , stronger ones .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Alison 's Dan here .I had to say something .I have not seen the film .I have also heard plenty of good things about it .But to be honest , if it was my job to take a whack at writing a review of the films without having seen it , that is exactly what I would have guessed .The Christian film industry reminds me a lot of the Christian book and especially music industry up through the end of the 20th century .Of course , there is still a lot of room for improvement , but I ca n't help but think of Christian music in the 80 's where there was so much heart and so little talent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I have to wonder ... ' is this the best we 've got ? ? 'I rented \" Facing the Giants \" because I was told by many church friends I HAD to see it .I turned it off within ten minutes .We have fallen so far behind the world in our standards for the arts ( lots to do with money , I 'm sure ... ) - and this is why I turned off the first \" Left Behind \" movie and have ignored \" Fireproof . \"( Also , are n't there any other Christian actors out there besides Kirk Cameron ? )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It was terrible , from minute one .The story line , using the term loosely , made no sense .Well - known actors came on and looked like kids putting together a neighborhood program for laughs -- who did n't know how to tell a joke .Well , you get the idea .I guess the only thought I came away with is that conservatives have had so little chance to work together on a good message , that they will need lots more practice to get up to speed .Maybe it 's the same with Christians .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Darryl could chair - he 's independent and has a lot to say about all local parties and issues , both good and bad .I just realised I should note that I have had stays in QEH .Gall Bladder removal , oesophogitits , alcohol / Class A related problems and . heart woes .Always had excellent treatment .Top marks to the staff .After I finally had a breakdown the mental heath ' treatment ' I undertook was a disgrace .Oxleas desperately needs turning round .I escaped ( they called it a voluntary discharge which I suppose is strictly correct ! ! ) and was madder than when I went .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wonder how former comrades in the Shrewsbury Ward are ?I know two have killed themselves .( Mental health in Lewisham , and QEH is due to be taken by Lewisham Hospital 's trust , is run by the South London and Maudsley trust , which is just a hint as to how confusing NHS arrangements have been made by successive governments . )Brilliant John , I think a public debate is an excellent idea , thanks for suggesting it .I am sure that many of the ' usual suspects ' on this blog ( i.e. local people interested in the issues ) will be happy to get involved and help make it happen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All areas have a real terms increase this year compared to 2012 - 13 .The Government 's formula seems to combine assessment of need with the amount previously spent by the NHS , thus protecting former big spenders .The 2014 - 15 allocation seems to give less weight to this element .Whether this a fair way of doing it is debatable but it 's hardly a political motivated attack on Greenwich which is getting 15 % more money over two years .I have no idea how the funding formula is calculated , however the obvious thing it does show is that we 're getting more per head ( \u00a3 71 ) this year than our nearest Conservative neighbours in Bromley ( \u00a3 40 ) and Bexley ( \u00a3 29 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm not sure that using the outlier of Kensington & Chelsea is such a good comparison .I ca n't see any political bias in the figures for neighbouring areas .If anything , it shows the opposite .Amanda and Stewart , I assume a PFI contract will only become invalid for the state if the other party becomes demonstrably unable to carry out its side of the contract .I believe this was the case with the tube contract cancelled by the Mayor .It is interesting that people assume the bankers are responsible for this as opposed to the muppet who signed the contract for the NHS .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Richard - cancelling was probably too harsh a word , however any other institution which failed under such massive debts and contracts would be able to get out of them as part of an insolvency process .As Darryl says , it has been done before .Yes , I consider the banks and bankers having such huge profit margins on these deals as culpable as those who signed them .There is also the recent termination of a power contract PFI with London Underground .The figures in the article demonstrate the amount of money being wasted from the public purse ( and made by private companies ) on these deals and the savings that can be made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
