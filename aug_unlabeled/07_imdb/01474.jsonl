{"text": "I like how you list like four movies that I 'm genuinely excited for as being unworthy of your 8 dollars but then mention how you 're looking forward to the crapfest that is Harry Potter .I 'd be upset at your statements against Batman and Pixar except clearly you simply have awful taste .Wow , interesting list .Also , pretty wrong .I liked the comparison between Alvin and the Chipmunks then and now , but you made a big oopsie with saying that Rachel Weisz will be in the next Mummy movie .She wo n't be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I actually hope Hellboy : The Golden Army does fairly well 'cause I 'm a huge fan of the first movie , but I rarely get my hopes up nowadays .Too many bad and disappointing movies have ruined it for me .And the moment I heard they were doing a Get Smart movie I wanted to strangle the filmmakers .I mean , sure , Steve Carell is probably a good choice to play Maxwell Smart , but it still is n't right !Don Adams never got the respect he so justly deserved for his quite hilarious role as Maxwell Smart and now , with his death , the filmmakers rush out a tacky - looking comedy that is sure to be just as \" good \" as the new Pink Panther movie was .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Steve Martin was great but I am sick of Beyonce .I have seen all the movies she 's been in and she plays the exact same role in every movie !Goldmember : A singer / spy , Fighting Temptations : A singer / stripper , Pink Panther : An International Pop Singer , and hey , you know what she was in Dreamgirls ?A singer !I wonder what she 'll be next , I sure hope there 's more singing !All that aside , I think that Disney is gon na do a decent job with the updating of the Chipmunks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My faith in Disney has been reinstated after seeing \" Enchanted \" so I am gon na hope for the best and check out this movie .I did n't know they were making a Hellboy sequel .This is on my must see list as well !The casting was ridiculoulsly perfect for the first movie so I hope that most of the originals return for it !I 'm looking forward to the new Hellboy , Hulk , and Batman .I 'm not a big fan of Batman , but I love his villians and sidekicks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm also hoping we get a She - Hulk spin off that involves lots of supernatural law , fourth wall breaking , and maybe a guest appearence from Howard the Duck .( I 'm not exactly endearing myself to you guys either , am I ? )I also like Pixar , so I have faith in Wall - E , though I think it might be a rip off of Short Circut .Pixar has yet let me down so go team .Hellboy was awesome and a sequel looks cool .The Mummy are silly and fun B - movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You do realize that the FF was a comic book before it was even a show right and was nothing more than cashing in on the whole recent comic book craze everyone seems to be happening even though no one is buying the books .You 're just trying to hate them and say oh look I 'm so funny I 'm hating on movies that are n't even coming out yet .Get Smart is not like Inspector Gadget .He is more of the anti - James Bond or what Johnny English should have been .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "So sorry if I just hate movies , because I feel all movies are crappy since seeing those .TT.TTThank you .There are alot of crappy movies out there but you ca n't always be expecting a film on the level of quality as say Casablanca .Garfield wanted to fun and humorous and it was n't so it failed .We only remember the good films of the year and rarely do we note the bad ones like Bratz .Now when the films comes out and the manage to mess things up like the human parts in Transformers taking over most of the film or the convoluted mess of Pirate of Caribbeans 3 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Alot will some will be okay and other will fail and be the Eragon , Garfield , and etc ..It 's funny how you guy talk about how much of a disappointment the Garfield movie was .Have you guys read the strip ?Why would anyone expect Garfield to be funny , ever ?Now Calvin and Hobbes ....I might pay money to be disappointed after seeing that movie .... .Also , what 's to hate about Pixar ?Just about everything they 're done has been immaculate and charming .I 'd take a Pixar movie over anything that Disney has done any day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just about everything they 're done has been immaculate and charming .I 'd take a Pixar movie over anything that Disney has done any day .Pixar has had their share of lesser quality movies , as well .I never really liked a Bug 's Life .Toy Story 2 felt like a direct to video movie ( not surprising since it was originally written as one ) and Finding Nemo felt a little cliche and was n't nearly as entertaining as Toy Story or the Brad Bird films .I 'll admit that lately they 've appealed to me , but for me , they have their misses along with their hits .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
