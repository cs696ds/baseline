{"text": "Carmi Cioni said ... .The French Connection did not over - explain things .Whether through dialogue or the inclusion of shot - by - shot filming , many contemporary movies seem to concentrate their efforts on making sure that the viewer understands exactly what is happening .The French Connection made me work for it .I was even rather confused at times .The balance between moments of calm and scenes with rapid movement combined with the film 's overall rawness and changing camera angles kept me interested throughout .I appreciate this movie more and more each time I see it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The amount of story that is conveyed by how the camera is used is exceptional .In scenes where we have cops following bad guys , the camera may pass into a space where the viewer can be seen by the bad guy .When this happens the viewer knows that they and the cop that they 're watching have been made , and a different cop is going to have to start tailing .The simplicity of what 's being shown really allows us as viewers to get involved in what 's happening .Aside from it being at this point a terrific period piece ( the clothing !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "We are never shown something we do not need to see in order to understand the story .Instead we are given all of the pieces of the narrative clearly and efficiently , without spending a moment to become frustrated or distracted by unused time .In this light , The French Connection is akin to a news reel with its clear - cut focus on the characters ' actions , and its striking implementation of hard - edged realism into storytelling .In light of the narrative assignment we are working on , I tried to pay close attention to the way objects and people were placed in the rectangle of the screen and the way these compositions helped tell the story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "French Connection is such a success due to its incredible consideration for the viewer .The aspect of the film I appreciate most is the level of control it has over how much information the audience gathers at any given point in time - when to include the viewer in \" inside information \" and when to fully immerse us into the given scene .There is one moment in particular that illustrates this point of viewership quite clearly .When Doyle chases Alain into the subway , the audience only follows Doyle through the chase - unaware that Alain knows he 's being followed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Throughout this sequence , we as the audience assume Alain is innocently getting on and off the train , having to throw away trash etc .It is only with his final wave to Doyle through the closed doors that we understand the entirety of the scene .What really interested me about The French Connection is the entire composition of the shots that are concise , clear , yet visually compelling as if the director were designing a set of single shots instead of merely shooting scenes .Through out the movie , the angles of the camera were very straightforward , not employing rather dramatic or strange angle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Additionally , The French Connection \" shows \" its plot with the sequence of the images instead of telling it through heavy dialogues and narrative .The French Connection kept itself interesting by keeping the action simple and close to the viewer .It does n't make heavy use of extreme camera angles and instead sets up scenes how someone might see it if they were there ; the viewer is more immersed and does n't treat it totally as fiction since they have some form of investment in the action .The dialogue and action also contribute to this immersion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is n't so true to life that it becomes boring and drawn out , but it also is n't so fantastic that we dismiss it as something we could never be a part of .I really agree with what Carmi said about the movie refraining from over - explaining the storyline and consequent courses of action .By withholding information from the viewer , the director allows us to experience the unfolding of every scene along with the characters .Someone already mentioned this scene in a previous comment , but the scene in the subway where Charnier and Popeye play a game of cat - and - mouse on the platform was my absolute favorite .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The indeterminate pace of the film gives it a sense of realism .As in real life , events reveal themselves to us , we are n't told the entire scene before it happens .Consequentially , we need to remain at the edge of our seat in order to follow the action at all .As crotchety and old lady - ish as this sounds , I do n't usually like action or cop movies , because they 're really hard to follow .I ca n't tell the male characters apart and I lose track of fast - paced fight scenes with lots of frantic shifts in camera angle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like Miki said , the characters each had features that made them distinct , like Doyle 's bowler hat , our French baddie 's cane and beard , and the chemist 's really great tiny spectacles .The plot seemed more straightforward than most movies - there were no off the wall twists and the funny parts still served the story .Each part followed logically from the previous .The film did n't seem like it was trying to be clever , as Doug might put it .One thing I noticed the movie did well was translating pretty non - visual things into visible action .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The problem the shot solves is what you make your character do to show that he 's freezing .He could complain out loud , but there 's nobody around , and besides , that seems like cheating .I guess he could have shivered and rubbed his hands together .Although I ca n't remember exactly what happened , I remember thinking the sequence was really specific and original - I think he had a tiny cup of coffee , and spilled it .Can anyone remember what else happened in that scene ?Can I be perfectly honest ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
