{"text": "some tend to be well armed , but the OP is correct - it 's almost always handguns .SWAT sounds like a good idea on paper , but in reality , they serve little useful purpose . rubbish .SWAT definitely serves a purpose and when used properly imo are a net benefit to criminals ( make it less likely that deadly force will be used due to their superior firepower , numbers , and tactics ) , cops , and everybody else .however when overused AS THEY ARE , they are a net negative .the last time i was on an incident involving SWAT , one of their snipers managed to shoot a guy who had a rooftop position and was armed with a rifle , taking potshots . just because SWAT is over / misused does not render the concept of , or proper deployment of SWAT to be a good thing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It fails to resonate on the visceral level that Carpenter 's film achieved with panache to spare .John Carpenter originally used Howard Hawkes 's classic 1959 western \" Rio Bravo \" as a stepping - off point to create his new breed of urban suspense thriller .What Carpenter did n't do was attempt to remake \" Rio Bravo \" by moving it up 30 years .The problem with Hollywood 's affinity for remaking films is that , as with \" The Manchurian Candidate , \" there is n't enough narrative room to go in any direction without bumping into the predecessor 's old furniture .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That inspiration can come from any direction of narrative substance , but it has to contain a certain degree of internal enlightenment to be satisfying .Abel Ferrara 's \" King Of New York \" is a great example of a genre movie that squeezes an audience by their guts .The director sees so deeply inside the milieu he 's representing onscreen that every detail adds momentum to the story .Punches hit their intended targets .The filmmakers here attempt to coast on the success of \" Training Day . \"The film paired Ethan Hawke with Denzel Washington in a glorious Los Angeles translation of Abel Ferrara 's shining achievement \" Bad Lieutenant \" ( 1992 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
