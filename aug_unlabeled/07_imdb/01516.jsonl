{"text": "A Market Solution to the Asian Bride Shortage .In many Asian countries there is a growing shortage of women .Years of favoring boys and disposing of girls are catching up with them .In South Korea , a market has sprung up in the past few years to find foreign brides for South Korean bachelors ( my thanks to regular reader D - rew for this New York Times story ) .At first the marriage brokers went to ethnic Korean communities in China .Now , though , the brokers are arranging quick marriages further afield .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "South Korea is more prosperous than Vietnam , at least temporarily , and the \" Korean Wave \" of pop culture has made South Korea seem a good place to live .Until recently this marriage market was unregulated .After a series of scandals involving lies and abuse by brokers and husbands , the Korea government has begun to set some rules , and the etiquette of the market has weeded out some of the bad actors .This market evolves very quickly - Vietnam is getting richer , and may dry up as a source of brides a few years hence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was the cumulative effect of many individual actions that created the women shortage in the first place , creating a market that entrepreneurial brokers can fill .To be sure , some rural governments in Korea are sponsoring marriage tours to Vietnam , but they did not make the arrangements in the first place .I can also see a few unintended positive consequences that might come from this international marriage market .Many Asian nations have exaggerated ideas of their own \" racial purity , \" which they make central to their national identity .South Korea is no exception to this self image .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Over time , mixing populations that way would undermine the idea that racial purity is essential to national identity - or even that it is ever was very prevalent .A second possible silver lining of Vietnamese women living and prospering in South Korea is that their frequent communications home might spur the Vietnamese people to press for democracy to go along with their increasing capitalist prosperity .The Asian women shortage is due to the worst kind of sexist discrimination , devaluing of girls , and even deliberate killing .I find it encouraging to think , therefore , that there might be an unexpected silver lining or two to this dark cloud .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I see references to Seoul .Any thoughts on how this is or might unfold regarding the rural towns and areas ?Rural farmers constitute about a quarter , and rural poor less than a tenth , of the overall population .I gather that the rural areas are even harder hit by the bride shortage that the cities .I would guess that the bachelors are richer in the cities , and have better prospects among the rural Korean women .The rural provinces seem to be the only Korean government agencies promoting Vietnamese bride searches .I 'll do my best not to show my contempt and disgust for the manner in which I see this problem being discussed all around the web , but I 'm not making any promises .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I find this position utterly repugnant and I condemn all of you in the strongest terms .I hope we have n't forgotten that already .And thus it will always be I suppose , until it begins happening in your backyard , the problems of the least powerful and most downtrodden receive little notice , especially from those who advocate letting the market forces decide their morality .All we have to do is look at Saudi Arabia to recognize our own complicity in this ongoing problem .Perhaps then we will say to the Chinese that it is not acceptable to have hundreds of thousands of sex based abortions being carried out clandestinely all across the country every year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "From a professional perspective I suppose there 's no reason to see this shameful genocide of the female sex as anything more than an anomaly which can be overcome by market based solutions .Perhaps these learned professionals should take the time to look a little closer at history before they come to such conclusions and began advocating such tragically flawed simplistic solutions like finding more girls somewhere else .Personally I expect more from people who 've received so many years of education .In such a society you will wind up with millions upon millions of unhappy people , leading to the slow deterioration and breakdown of that society , and perhaps that 's what they need in order to wake up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps it will be good for China when these young men turn their rage upon a nation which has left them in such a situation .Are you comfortable classifying the women you know as commodities , reproductive vessels to be auctioned off to the highest bidders , somehow I suspect not , at least not while the women in your family are around .I 'm glad my grandma Brown is n't alive to see the tragic results of allowing generations of sexism and murder go unassailed and finally catered to by those who should know better , because her words would be far less diplomatic than mine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have written several times on this subject , and as I have said before , they will reap the whirlwind .Unlike other kinds of genocide , though , the Asian girl shortage is not the result of deliberate government policy ( though the Chinese case comes close ) , but of millions of individual decisions .This means that the weapons that we have at our disposal against this great wrong are very limited .Complaint and shame are two .And pointing out how their anti - female policies are destroying other things they value about their own culture -- in this case , \" racial purity \" and authoritarian goverment -- may have some effect in getting them to stop doing it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Before 1980 , couples would just continue to have children until they had a male child , now they need to get rid of the girls before they can try again for a boy .It was a tragic mistake on the part of the Chinese government , and now they 're beginning to reap the fruits of their folly .International Adoption is a small help for places like China .( But a huge help for individual children .And a MASSIVE blessing to the adoptive families . )My own children were born in Guatemala , a country many magnitudes smaller than China .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
