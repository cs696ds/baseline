{"text": "Today , we talk to Happy Endings ' David Caspe and Jonathan Groff .Beginning its third season on October 23 , the show moves from a cushy Wednesday - night spot behind Modern Family to face off against a competitive Tuesday - night field that includes the similarly themed New Girl and NBC 's Matthew Perry vehicle , Go On .How important was it to leave some threads hanging that could then be picked up in a third season ?David Caspe : We 've never really known how many episodes we 're ever going to have .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Second season , you get a 13-episode order , you do n't know that you 're going to get nine more , so you do n't really do arcs because you do n't know when to finish them .We knew we wanted to do that , so we knew that it was important to have stuff left over at the end of last year , to start with that stuff .For instance , Brad is out of work as we start the season , and Dave and Alex build on that hand - holding moment at the end of the finale .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That is the most we can say .Jonathan Groff : Honestly , it 's nice to have some threads to run to when you 're trying to figure out the stories , as opposed to just doing free - standing things all the time .We had n't really left much at the end of the first season except that maybe Alex was sort of thinking about whether she made the right decision in breaking up with Dave and screwing that all up and longing for him a little bit .So it felt good from a writer 's perspective to have a little bit more stuff to lean into .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "DC : We felt like what we wrote would work as a season finale , but also had it been , unfortunately , a series finale .Dave and Alex held hands , so they 're back together a little bit , Penny meets a guy that she likes , and although Brad lost his job , him and Jane seem stronger than ever .We felt like all that seemed somewhat like a conclusion , but we also thought , if we 're lucky enough to get another season , all of that stuff actually is the beginning of a lot of other stories .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Because any great finale is really a beginning , is n't it , Erik ?AVC : As Semisonic once sang , \" Every new beginning comes from some other beginning 's end . \" DC : Yes .I wish I would have just thought of that .JG : Also , in fairness to ABC , they 've been so supportive .We did not turn into a giant hit last season , but I think they were generally happy with what we did and they were sending positive messages to us .We would never take anything for granted , and we 're so superstitious , but we also felt like , \" There 's a chance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We 've done a good job .We 've settled into a decent groove .They like our cast a lot .\" We had a feeling there was a good shot we would come back , so we wanted to leave some stuff on the table .AVC : After leaving that big cliffhanger with Dave and Alex holding hands - which reboots the relationship whose end was the series ' inciting incident - have you paid any attention to fan reactions ?Have you heard any crazy theories about what 's going to happen when the third season starts up ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some people love that we 're doing a relationship triangle .Some people hate it and just want the jokes .Obviously , we love jokes , so even while we 're handling any relationship stuff , our goal is to never have it be too soapy or heavy - handed , and try to play it as real as we can while still leaving room for jokes .DC : Here 's my perspective on that : The Dave and Penny thing is interesting to set up as a problem for Penny , and we could run there at some point .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's just a fact .If we rushed Dave and Penny it would never feel right .Plus , Penny and Alex are really good friends , and while it 's interesting and complicated to have that be a problem , it also could get weird in a way that 's not fun to watch , I think , if we rushed it .I think that things have to run their course before we can explore that .Not to say that it 's not something that Penny has to grapple with .This year it will be interesting when Alex catches wind of the fact that Penny has these little feelings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It felt like the honest thing to do was to have Alex and Dave play out all the fun stuff .By the way , there 's no secret : They 're together at the beginning of the season .And we 're having a lot of fun with it in exploring how they 're together and how in some ways they 're perfect for each other and in some ways it 's a mess , and the problems that they had before are still there .I think that we honestly needed to do that .AVC : And the potential of Dave and Alex reuniting has existed since episode one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "JG : So we 're going to explore that a little bit and see where that leads us .DC : And actually , comedically , it 's been a huge benefit for us to be able to find the characters of Dave and Alex separately before we put them back together .Obviously , when you start , all you have is the pilot so you know the characters a little bit , but only in the extent of how much real estate one out of six characters in an ensemble can really , truly get out of a 21-minute show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now it 's interesting to put those two characters together .AVC : The second season was so much about fine - tuning these characters .What stories can you write for them now that you could n't last fall ?DC : In general , just finding all of the characters individually has helped us generate stories .Like I said , you know so little about the characters when you 've only done a few episodes .It sounds really writerly and cheesy , but they sort of are what they do .JG : It 's hard to say what different stories we can tell now that we could n't tell before .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I think she 's having a blast doing this stuff , just for example .Zach Knighton , we 've made his character a little weirder : He 's a guy with really strong convictions about some dumb things .One thing we do like to do is look for new combinations .We realized we had n't done a Penny and Brad story - Casey [ Wilson ] and Damon [ Wayans Jr. ] together - since the middle of season one .So we thought , \" Let 's get those two together where they have to cover up something that they did and they get into trouble and that will be fun to watch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not an origin story , but at least a glimpse into how they met .And that 's how Brad came into the group and met everyone else - through Max .Because in our show bible , Dave , Penny , Alex , and Jane have known each other since childhood and Max and Brad are the relative latecomers .AVC : Now that Max is the one that 's ostensibly employed and Brad is n't , how does that shift the dynamic between those characters ?JG : Max is going to teach Brad how to live on no dollars a day in Chicago in an episode early on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Literally \" MaxWorld .\"TM .Registered trademark .AVC : The second season 's \" The Kerkovich Way \" displayed an ability to balance a complicated story with the show 's regular volume of jokes - it 's a twisty - turny plot with a lot of deceit between characters , yet it still manages to be hilarious .Is there any chance we 'll see more episodes like that in this season ?DC : Well , we definitely delve more into the Serbian past of Alex and Jane , and you meet their parents in the sixth episode of the season .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "JG : That 's the type of episode that 's tricky to write for comedies , because in a way it 's a mystery .The expression in a TV writers ' room is \" hiding the ball\"-we were hiding the ball on what was happening in that episode in terms of Alex \" Kerkovich way\"-ing Dave off , with Jane schooling her on how to do that .It 's an interesting thing , because comedy relies often times on audiences knowing what 's going on and seeing how people react to what they see ahead of the characters or knowing how a character is going to react .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Yeah , I love that stuff .I worked for two years at How I Met Your Mother , and Carter [ Bays ] and Craig [ Thomas ] and that whole staff were really great at taking care of their show 's history and their relationships .And I 've been really big on that .If we say something , we have to honor it , or if we go against it we have to have a reason for why .All shows do that , but I like the rich histories of those characters on that show , where Ted and Marshall and Lily went to college together , and that gives them a sort of depth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So we flash back to kids stuff still .AVC : So when a new piece of backstory is unlocked in the writers ' room , how do you keep track of it ?Is there a board that you 're writing these ideas down ?Does it get added to the show bible ?DC : We have a show bible .[ Beat .]That I 've never read .But we compile all the things like this , all the facts like this , and keep track of it .We also have some writers that are a little smarter than the rest of us who are able to catalog all that shit in their minds and we always gravitate toward them when there 's a question and they 're able to keep us on track .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
