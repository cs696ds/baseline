{"text": "You 'd want to give it anonymously , of course .Sure there are warnings throughout the movie DO NOT DO THIS AT HOME .You and I both know that a teenage boy is going to ignore those and try them anyway .That 's where the anonymity comes in handy , Nobody can sue you .Highly recommended for people with annoying teenage boys as neighbors and for any teenage boy you just do n't like very much .There was a problem loading comments right now .Please try again later .I liked \" Jackass \" and I liked this new one even better .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They know what is funny far better than the PC crowd .Terrorists , funny .Naked grandmas , funny .People hurting themselves , funny .For years we have been adding things to our \" Not Funny \" list and thus eliminating them from our movies .That means that our multiplexes are filling up with toothless , light - hearted films masquerading as comedies .In an ad for this film a crowded theater filled with people engaging in uproarious laughter is showed .Then the ad asks when the last time was that you had an experience like that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So the way I see it the Jackass gang is reminding us what it 's like to laugh .Or put another way , they 're bringing funny back .That is not to say that all of their stunts are golden .Some , such as the medicine ball dodge ball , seem uninspired .Others were too much for me to handle .I could 've lived without the leech on the eyeball , and the fish hook , and especially the horse milk .But without trying everything they may never have come across more hilarious ones such as the puppet show and the bungee jump .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The one where the bad grandpa gets in a fight with a \" hippie \" over his parenting technique was divine .And I ask you , who is the real jackass in that stunt , Knoxville or the nosy pedestrian who is being Punk'd ?I also think Knoxville should get some credit for holding this film together .His flair for theatrics has gotten better since the original , probably due to his movie star experiences .And that cackling laughter of his works the same way as a laugh track on a sitcom .I mean if the guy with his arm in the bear trap is having the time of his life then why are n't you ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It should have been grittier so as not to nullify the pain these people were in .If all stupid movies were as much fun as this one I would never complain about the dumbing down of Hollywood .I ca n't remember the last time 95 minutes went by so quickly .I do wonder if parents still think video games are quite as harmful as they used to .Back in the day playing outside meant tossing the football around with the neighbors .Today it means riding a shopping cart into a brick wall .I would never have the nerves of steel , or desire , to swim with sharks , but I had a blast watching these guys do it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There was a problem loading comments right now .Please try again later .Saying this movie was really funny is an understatement to how funny this movie really is .This movie will have u laugh , cringe and make you throw up in a good way all at the same time .Now like people who saw the movie said there are definately scenes that you may look away from because of how disgusting they are .So I will tell you some of the funniest non nude stunts in the movie .There are a lot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "How he walks right after he flew off is hilarious .Another stunt is one that was pulled as a prank on the Jackass crew .There was this sign on the wall of them being here .What they do n't know is there is a punching bag right behind it .There was also the Gauntlet where people try to avoid sandbags and they all get hurt .There was also the rocket shopping cart and the jet propelled bike where Matt Hoffman nails a sick move .and the funniest was the bungee jump .Where Preston Lacy was anchoring Wee man for the bungee jump and well lets say he gave way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

Coyote .Can that be surpassed ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't think anyone is willing to follow in those footsteps .Great stuff in this movie ....I nearly wet myself with laughter watching the John Waters / Make WeeMan Disappear trick .Other good material consisted of the Pontius / Knoxville / angry tree boa Puppet Show , bungee jumping with Preston and WeeMan , the Musical Number , fun with cattle , and do n't forget the bonus material !A lot of footage that did n't make it into the film itself , but .... educational to say the least .Anything where John Waters is present is going to be ... different , let us say .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The stunt went on too long , and in light of the world we live in today , not all that funny .Guys , putting shaved body hair on someone 's face and calling it a fake beard is hilarious .... getting into a cab going to an airport and making veiled references is just plain stupid and not very sensitive .Another skit(s ) that made me think along the lines of ' did n't we just do this about 10 minutes ago ? ' were the ones involving Old People with Exposed Body Parts .They got redundant and in my opinion distracted somewhat from the rest of the movie with their frequency .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There was a problem loading comments right now .Please try again later .The main pleasure in the Jackass series is along the lines of the Three Stooges - except the action is real , and there 's no plot .In reality , each individual stunt here has its own sort of plot , or rather setup , and no sooner does this one end that another begins .In other words , Jackass 2 has non - stop variety , and the stunts themselves may leave some viewers slack - jawed ( after they 're done laughing ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And rockets .Most films like this have an audience warning asking viewers not try these stunts ; it 's hard to imagine anyone wanting to do what we see here .The action is so beyond what anybody would expect that Jackass 2 turns out to be incredibly entertaining in its wildly cartoonish way .In my screening , everyone found themselves laughing , and hard , sometimes in spite of themselves .There was a problem loading comments right now .Please try again later .I 'm not even remotely a fan of Jackass but I had watched the first movie , and when I was going to see number two I kept thinking there was no way these guys could out do themselves with this one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This movie had me laughing so much I had to take asprins because I had gotten a headache .There are to many parts in this movie that had me rolling all over the floor ( especially the switcharoo in the bed , the small toilet , bad grandpa ) .I 'm even compelled to say this movie could even be the best sequel to date since Godfather Part 2 .There was a problem loading comments right now .Please try again later .Sinced this movie is pretty much the same thing as the first only more extreme I 'm using the same review for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The name of this film is so appropriate that I could not stop laughing again .It 's a one trick pony but , it is extremely funny and disgusting at the same time !The pranks are more extreme this time and they do some truely vile things in this one but ..... it 's still brainless fun .I found this DVD for under $ 5.00 and it was worth every penny with all the extras included .I give it 3 1/2 stars for making money out of being a total Jackass !There was a problem loading comments right now .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I did n't even know that this movie was coming out until a month before it did , so I was pleasantly surprised .The previews did n't look good , but fortunately , that was because they saved the best for the movie !It 's great that with the Jackass alumni doing their own thing ( Johnny 's movie career , Viva La Bam , Wildboyz , Homewrecker ) that they were able to reunite for this movie .They prefaced the release of this film with the release of the TV series on dvd .I only hope there is more Jackass to come , it really is a cultural symbol of this decade , like it or not , and a lot of the comedy in it is modeled after The Three Stooges in my opinion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
