{"text": "When Carrie tells Big it is hard to keep \" sparkle \" in their relationship after a while , she is speaking for the highly lucrative franchise as well .Once we left everyone living happily ever after once in the television series and then again in the feature film , how many eggs are we really willing to unscramble to crank it all up again ?The first movie ends with a wedding ; the second begins with one .In the television series , Carrie and Charlotte ( Kristin Davis ) each had the fashion - forward divette 's most indispensable accessory , a gay man to serve as adviser , confidante and acolyte and to provide an endless supply of \" you go girl \" support and guidance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But there is a brief if awkward nod to global sisterhood and at least the Mideastern characters are played by Mideastern performers .The real fantasy here is not the endless spending power of the ladies or the objectification of the men ; it is the way they eat and drink and loll around but still maintain their highly disciplined figures and radiant complexions .The trip gives them many opportunities to change clothes ( they put the \" lug \" into \" luggage \" ) .And it is here where the story veers into Lucy and Ethel territory and the puns get truly painful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I get that .But are we really supposed to believe that she walks around her home in 4 inch heels and haute couture , even when there 's nothing going on ?That seems like an excuse to show off the wardrobe budget and SJP 's fabulous figure .I confess that 's a nitpick .I think Samantha has been rendered into a one dimensional cartoon of a character : the walking sex machine .Let 's not forget , this is the same Samantha who is a breast cancer survivor and top flight business person .There 's no need to make the story solely about those characteristics , but the character is approaching parody .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Then I remembered the previews , and read a few reviews on \" rottentomatoes \" and decided to go with my initial impulse and avoid it .I was a fan of the series in reruns on the CW , and enjoyed the first movie , but I felt at the end of the first SATC that the series was played out .My feeling was , \" Carrie can never break up with Big again , and neither of them can die in an accident or get a deadly disease .\" Other than avoiding those pitfalls , I was n't sure that there was a rational for a new SATC movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also , Stanford Blatch is a quiet , sweet and unassuming person and would never marry the obnoxious , loud and retrograde Anthony Marantino .Opposites may attract but this is ridiculous .Just because there are two recurring gay characters in SATC does n't mean they have to marry each other .They should have hooked Stanford up with his sweetheart from the series .I think a lot of people made the same calculations you did , Alicia !And I agree that Stanford and Anthony are not a believable couple .I remember when Charlotte and Carrie fixed them up and how outraged they were that anyone would think they would get along !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Alicia .Hi , Nell .I agree completely that Carrie seemed utterly self - involved ( bonding with \" the help \" does n't help ) but the major damage was to the character of Samantha .The idea that a PR professional would visit a foreign culture ( Middle Eastern or not ) and exercise less self - control as a 2-year - old child in public was just unbelievable .Not only did Samantha 's character lose all credibility , but she seemed to have only one thing on her mind , and she seemed otherwise utterly vapid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" On the plus side , I actually found myself touched by the wedding scene .The actors playing Anthony Marantino and Stanford Blatch convinced me that they were in love , and the best awkward ( and provocative ) moment in the movie was the reaction of all the married couples when Anthony said that Stanford would let him cheat .The portrait of Abu Dhabi sketched in the extended vacation vignette did n't seem inaccurate , just not very deep .I wish Michael Patrick King had concentrated on the New York setting and a more serious exploration of the issues raised early in the film , instead of trying to do too little ( or was it too much ? ) in Abu Dhabi .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Agreed on all counts .Samantha always teetered on the brink of being a cartoonish figure except when she had to cope with cancer or show her loyalty to her friends .In this one , she was over the top , and that is the fault of the writers , not the actress .Her weird obsession with the Suzanne Somers quackery felt very un - Samantha to me .It would have been much more interesting to see her take on aging with the same gusto she shows in the rest of her life .Alicia .Exactly , Nell .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It would have been wonderful to see her cope with lowered sexual desire by exploring , \" If I am not a sexual being , who am I ? \" or some question of that type , instead of acting like a lunatic .She was always a blunt spoken woman , and I agree that she probably would n't be into the Suzanne Somers thing .Alicia .I like Big 's taste in movies ! \" Talk of the Town , \" and \" It Happened One Night \" are two of my all - time faves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
