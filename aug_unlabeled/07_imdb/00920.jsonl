{"text": "Blog .Carlos Mencia is a weak minded joke thief .Still do , after all these years .I love a good joke , and I love a different point of view that makes me laugh .That 's why I got into stand up in the first place , because I 'm a fan of the art form .To this day , after 17 years in the business , I still get excited when a really good stand up goes on stage .It inspires me .Whenever I see Chris Rock , or Dave Chappelle , or Dave Attell , or Doug Stanhope , or Jim Norton , or Nick DiPaolo , or any other great stand up comedian go on stage , I get happy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even more now than ever before , because I really understand what goes into the craft of making good material .The place you need to take your mind to think of something no one else has thought of before , or at least a thought that no one else has been able to put into a form that makes people laugh .It 's an amazing skill , and it 's an incredibly under - appreciated art form .I love when someone is really good at it , and I really , really fucking hate when someone is faking it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is nothing more frustrating to me than seeing someone pretending that they came up with some genius shit that someone else worked really hard to form .I 've heard the ignorant arguments from non - stand ups like \" Every comic steals . \"Which is TOTAL bullshit .Great comics do n't steal .They may be influenced by others , especially early in their careers , but the truly great ones pride themselves in being able to craft original thoughts for their audience .There is nothing more satisfying than taking an idea that you have , fleshing it out , finding the funny parts , perfecting the flow of the words , and then presenting it to an audience and watching them howl with laughter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A lot of comics , me included , got into comedy because we were fans of great comics , and we used to recite other comics lines to our friends .With me , it was always Richard Pryor and Sam Kinison .They were the ones that really made me laugh , and I would recite their lines , verbatim to my friends .I loved the feeling of telling a really well crafted joke to someone that had n't heard it before , and watching them crack up .It was what made me think that I could and wanted to get onstage in the first place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a beautiful feeling .When you 're starting out and your doing typical , clumsy material , you dream of the days when you 're going to come up with some brilliant shit that 's going to impress your peers .Some people , never get there , though .The urge to kill is just too strong , and their character is just too weak .They see someone else talking about a subject , and they 'll rewrite it and try to pretend it 's theirs , or they 'll just do it word for word , and hope no ones notices .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They just become thieves .Their time onstage , whether they 're killing or not , is just hollow fakery .One of the real problems , is that very few comedians stand up for what 's right .They might talk about it privately , but very few step up and take a stand .I have before , especially on the subject of Dennis Leary stealing from one of my favorite comedians , the late , great Bill Hicks .It 's commonly known amongst stand ups that Dennis stole a big chunk of Bills act , but amongst the general population it 's actually a surprise to a lot of people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Pretty much because no one that anyone would listen to on the subject stood up and said something about it publicly .No one defended the integrity of this great art form .They just let a pretender and a hack steal ideas from a great mind .He pretty much got away with it too .He went on to have success in films , and unfortunately , Bill Hicks died of cancer before most people knew who he was or what he had to say .It really killed me , because I started out a Dennis Leary fan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was really impressed .For a few months , he was actually my favorite comedian .His jokes on Jim Fix dying while jogging , and how ironic that was , and about how John Lennon was dead , but Barry Manilow continued to pump out albums made me howl .Then , I saw Hicks , and I really got confused .He was doing the same material , almost word for word that Leary was doing .I did n't get it .Something was wrong .I was only doing stand up for a few months at the time , so I asked some of the local pros , and they all had the same answer : \" Leary is a thief .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "How could this be ?How could a guy stealing ideas be allowed to perform in these clubs ?The club owners just did n't seem to care .They turned a blind eye , and profited off their hired performer pilfering material from others .It was a horrible feeling , and it set a terrible precedent .If he could get away with it , what would stop people from stealing my shit someday ?It turns out nothing and no one would stop them unless I stood up and said something myself .The latest , and most disgusting joke thief off all is a guy named \" Carlos Mencia .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He sells himself as being mexican , but the reality is his real name is Ned Holness , and he 's actually half German and half Honduran .The mexican hook is something he did to ingratiate himself with the local Mexican population of LA where he started .Now , normally I would n't dedicate so much time to talk about a piece of shit like \" ned \" on my website , but this stupid motherfucker talked shit about me on the radio , so it 's open season for hacks .Here 's what happened , and how I reported it on my messageboard , where it all started : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I thought I would share it with you guys because you 're the cause of it with the barrage of hate you sent to his website .He talks about how you guys were saying he sounds a lot like me , and how I said \" the force was weak with him \" which I did , and that was being NICE .What I should have said is that he 's a fucking weak minded delusional joke thief .What 's really interesting , is that I said what I said about him HERE .Since this is a private forum that the public ca n't read unless they sign up , that means he signed up , and he 's a member here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No .Of course not .He sits back like a little lurker sponge sucking up ideas for new \" jokes \" and listening to people talk shit about him , but not having the fucking balls to stand up for himself .What 's really funny , is that he refers to himself in this audio clip as \" The punisher . \" saying that 's his nickname .Listen up , you fat delusional hack , you ca n't give YOURSELF a fucking nick name , you no friends having douche bag .I 'm THE TERMINATOR ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only thing you punish is the attention span of anyone in your fucking audience with an IQ above 60 .I 'm gon na be real clear , stupid ; that NEVER fucking happened .the only time any comic , including me watches you , is to see if your stealing material .Which you DO .ALL THE FUCKING TIME .See , that 's why people SAY you steal .Because it 's a fucking fact .No one is running around saying Chris Rock is a thief , or Dave Chappelle is a thief , or even me for that matter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What ... they 're all jealous ?They 're jealous of you and not Chris fucking Rock ?Oh yeah , I forgot ... he 's not \" The Punisher ! !\" I 've seen you steal over and over again .I 've seen you Steal from Paul Mooney , I 've seen you steal from Dave Chappelle , I 've seen you steal from old Richard Pryor albums , I 've seen you steal from Jeff fucking Foxworthy .Your mind is weak .Keep talking shit , fat boy .I 'll keep exposing you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , what 's funny about that , is that my trusty camera man actually filmed \" Carlos \" watching ME onstage from various parts of the room , and then filmed him sucking onstage after him , and me talking about how terrible he was .He even edited it together with the audio from the radio station in AZ .Select Forum Area ...Forum Home -------------------- DVD Talk DVD Reviews DVD Hardware HD Talk International DVD -------------------- DVD Bargains DVD Exchange Hot Deals Store Forum --------------------Book Talk Movie Talk Music Talk TV Talk Video Game Talk --------------------", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Other side effects of guts include offending various groups of people , doing things your own way and risking your neck in the process .Legendary stand - up comedians like Richard Pryor , Lenny Bruce and Bill Hicks had guts ( Hicks was even confronted at gunpoint once for his opinions)---and while it 's too early to put him on the same level , Carlos Mencia certainly has guts too .Born in Honduras and raised in the projects of East Los Angeles , Mencia 's particular brand of no - holds - barred comedy --- like the name of the DVD implies --- is Not for the Easily Offended .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Heck , you might as well get acquainted now .Not for the Easily Offended was my first exposure to Mencia 's stand - up routine , but I actually was n't all that impressed during the first few minutes .He starts out with a few easy targets ( Michael Jackson , Roy Horn of Siegfried and Roy ) , often times letting his fondness for vulgarity overshadow the jokes ... but a funny thing happened a few short minutes later .After really involving the crowd in a few bits , Mencia was completely on fire during the remainder of the 66-minute show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He had the crowd eating out of his hand for the bulk of the performance , letting them know right up front that they 'd probably all be offended at some time or another --- so they might as well laugh about it .Truthfully , that 's how Mencia 's brand of humor works best : once you remove the pesky barrier that 's been built from a constant focus on political correctness , you 'll have a great time .It 's not like I 'm a reliable gauge of comedy --- even though it 's my favorite genre --- but I rarely laugh out loud at jokes , even if they 're funny ( I 'll usually just snicker , or crack a smile ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He blatantly points out what he feels is wrong with our country , yet he 's obviously still in love with it ( tough love , I guess ) .You might be offended at the profanity , the subject matter , or even his strange brand of patriotism ... but , trust me , it 's all in good fun .He does n't see problems with just one race , creed , or religion --- he sees problems will all of 'em .If you 're willing to let your guard down for a few minutes , you should have no problem laughing when it 's your turn under the microscope .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This 66-minute performance ( not 100 minutes as the packaging claims , as that includes the bonus material ) looks and sounds almost as good as a comedy routine needs to , but this release 's strength is definitely the main feature itself .It 's a solid hour of terrific comedy and one of the better breakout performances I 've seen in some time , so fans of stand - up should take note .Quality Control Department Video & Audio Quality : There 's no special effects or sweeping camera angles ; just one guy , a microphone , and a stage ( and some funny - looking folks in the front row ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Still , there 's a bit of room for improvement here : the image often looks a bit on the soft side , and a few mild interlacing errors were spotted ( especially noticeable due to Mencia 's violent gestures ) .The audio presentation also falls in the same category , as this 2.0 Stereo mix is basic but serviceable .The comedian and the crowd are separated well , though Mencia 's strong range of volume --- combined with his profanity - laced tirades --- may have you reaching for the volume button on occasion .No subtitles have been provided here , though a portion of the bonus material that 's a little hard to understand is presented with burned - in English captions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Seen above , the animated menu designs are straightforward and easy to navigate .The 66-minute main feature has been presented with no chapter stops --- though there 's really no reason to skip around here , it would 've been handy to go right to select segments ( especially after watching it a few times ) .Just for the record , no layer change was detected during playback .The packaging is also very straightforward , as this single - disc release is housed in a standard white keepcase with no insert .Bonus Features : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Basically , we 're given a fly - on - the - wall look at the day 's events leading up to one of Carlos ' live shows ( January 14th at the Spreckles Theater in San Diego ) .The day starts bright and early at 6:27 am , as Carlos and company depart for a stop on their San Diego radio tour ; among other things , he exhibits his comedic skills even with a block on profanity .From there , we 're off to the golf course ; after a short music montage , Carlos shows he 's a better comedian than a putter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Try the veal , he 'll be here all week .Mind of Mencia is a complete waste of time .The show is not the least bit funny or entertaining .Everyone has to admit that there are thousands of comedians out there more deserving of a show than Carlos Mencia .I saw probably around 5 episodes and in my opinion , that 's 5 too many .Mencia just tells clich\u00e9d and unfunny jokes .We all know that Mind of Mencia came to air when Dave Chappelle suddenly left .Why did Comedy Central choose a man who has been accused of plagiarism by several comedians ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Who knows ?But what I do know is that Mind of Mencia is unfunny .His jokes are old and clich\u00e9d .He promotes himself to be edgy and controversial but his jokes are really like fecal matter in a bowl with whipped cream on top .It may sound and look good , but it 's really just crap .Mencia sometimes adds his ever - so - annoying \" dee - dee - dee \" catchphrase to his jokes .I think the only purpose of dee - dee - dee is to try to make an unfunny joke seem funny but people who have a taste in comedy know that it does n't work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He then goes by saying something like , \" You guys are retarded ! \"and then he explains his joke .If you 're a good comedian , you should n't have to explain your jokes .If you were any good , you 'd tell your joke , people laugh and you move on .I can simply say that Comedy Central must 've been desperate for a show and that there are thousands of other comedians more deserving of a show than Mencia .Only the intellectually - impaired will find his show funny and there must be a lot of intellectually - impaired people out there because Mind of Mencia is Comedy Central 's 2nd top - rated show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
