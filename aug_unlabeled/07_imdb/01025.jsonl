{"text": "From what I 've gathered , you check in here every so many days because you 've had a hard time catching the film and its ' advertisements ' .I really would like you to see it , as it 's a good film in my opinion , and anyone should have a shot to see whatever films of Harold they can .If they ever release it or Welcome Danger in the US , I will be one of the first to purchase them !Alice .PS- If you were questioning what on earth my email is , it 's a wacky little song preformed by the Astaire siblings during the ' 20s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "anyway , the website looks great and i have alot more knowledge on Harold and his films . harold is amazing i really enjoy his films , a great film that really catches my eye is \" hot water \" so many funny scenes but i enjoy all of harolds films .Also anyone know where to get \" welcome danger \" on DVD or anywhere else ? if it means what i think in my opinion he should be first .Hi Alex , your comment about \" Hot Water \" being a favourite film of yours , just caught my eye today ( in April ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have to disagree with Harold . \"Hot Water \" was very amusing .It was really a disjointed film though , with three separate parts , each of which could have stood alone .I think the first two were classic parts , and the third was very well - done .We had the Harold buying stuff and going on the bus with the turkey scene , and then the in - laws for the ride on the wrecked car scene , and finally the ' spooky ' end scene with other manifestations .While \" Hot Water \" is not my overall favourite , I think it deserves acknowledgement , and hardly the ignoring that Harold himself showed towards this film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was worried that might happen .It can just be hard to keep track of your requested video if you do n't go on YouTube often .I missed it the second time it was up too ; I thought it might be a good idea to see it twice since you never know when you might see it again .HL 's movies are very enjoyable , I was actually able to show a good amount of them to family and friends , and they 've laughed just as much as I have .Also , I forgot to mention my reactions to some of his sound features .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I know you said that the latter was n't a favorite for you , I quite liked it .Harold portrayed his character very well , and even though he and his leading lady did n't have much chemistry as a couple , I found it very believable in the way their romance was carried out .I found The Cat's - Paw extremely fascinating ... it was so much different from his other films , especially the way the plotline worked .Harold was clearly able to show just how confused his character was with living in the United States after being in China .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All - together , a great film .Yes I am still looking for Professor Beware on Youtube .It has not resurfaced after its second showing !Nice to hear your impressions , and that you have almost finished that excellent Harold Lloyd Comedy Collection .As you say HL 's movies are very enjoyable .I would add excellent for many of them !But I remain very skeptical of Cats Paw .May be wrong , but I think most folks would tally with my opinion of this film rather than yours and Annette 's .I re - watched both Cats Paw recently - and my favourite Harold ' talkie ' Movie Crazy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Movie Crazy was so much better .The entire gags ( Harold losing his shoe in the rain , while encountering his future love interest ) , and later the fight scene with his love interests boyfriend ( very reminiscent of the action in the silent Kids Brother towards the end ) .How can anyone compare with anything in Cats Paw !You know my critique of the latter movie .I stand by it .I still think it is watchable , but does not deserve the accolades you and Annette are giving it .Great you have managed to show the films to family and friends .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I will be watching it right away , and maybe give my first - time impressions .I am so sorry to hear about Glorias passing .This is all the more poignant as I have lately been watching some commentaries and biographies on Harold , and was thinking ( also reading ) about Harolds home life at Green - acres ( and of course including ) his daughter Gloria .I also heard some commentary by her .In fact I was just thinking how fortunate that she was still with us today ..... alas that is no longer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "And another scene looks very familiar to the one in Now or Never on top of the train ... .Hope this will help , .Alice .By the way , Maddie , I completely agree with you .I just do n't understand how people can just write Harold off as being less brilliant than he obviously is ...I think he 's better than Keaton and Chaplin !One look at popularity polls in the twenties tells you that .I think the main reason why so many are not aware of how great he truly is is because of the availibility of his films verses Chaplin 's or Keaton 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't know what I 'd do if I did n't have it already !Hey Guys !So , for my first post here , I really wanted to ask a question I 've been seeing on other forums .Some people do n't think Harold should be ranked alongside Chaplin and Keaton , and it completely baffled me !I believe their justification was that Harold had up to 12 gag men , and Chaplin virtually did n't ( but his gag men were referred to as \" assistants \" , right ? ) , and Keaton may have , but not as many .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In my mind , gag men are people who throw out ideas and get ideas thrown at them .And I completely disagree when Hal Roach commented \" Harold Lloyd was not a comedian , but he was the finest actor to play a comedian that I ever saw \" .I could n't believe I 'd heard it .Harold has some of the most amazing work of the silent era , and I hate to see people that do n't think he was a comic , but just an actor .He did n't have to perform any scene as flawless and gracefully as he did in any film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He was a genius .He IS a genius .But for my question : What do you think ?Is Harold not worthy of being the \" 3rd Genius \" or being alongside Chaplin or Keaton in terms of comedic talent ?Harold Lloyd not only deserves to be alongside Chaplin or Keaton in terms of comedic talent , but in my opinion surpasses both of them .Take what you think is the best film or films of all three , and I guarantee Harold comes up trumps all the time .But you will not convince many of the so - called experts or those writing articles on silent screen comedians or some folks on forums , who still tend to bypass our Harold !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Keep in mind that , despite keeping of appearances ( of a willing separation on both sides ) , Hal Roach must have been very unhappy when Harold decided to quit making films with him back in the early 1920 's .Despite their friendship , I think he carried a sort of grudge against Harold for this reason .It must have also galled him that he was not talented in that sphere ( of acting comedy ) himself !As for ' gag men ' , the final say and direction was only Harold Lloyds .We are all inspired by others ideas at times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm sure Harold himself came up with stellar ideas .Alice , keep up the conversation about Harold with others .Its the best to introduce the man on the clock !By the way I have always wanted to view that later talkie Professor Beware .If you know of anyone or any way for me to get hold of that film , let me know !Just saw The Milky Way again today .Found it very amusing .Yes , I 'm very glad that they enjoyed his films too .They have actually decided to give me the right to show them a movie marathon of Harold 's films from the set when my birthday comes because of how excited I 've been about it lately .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This could be more affordable than getting the Harold Lloyd Box set .Though I highly recommend that one .It has so many films and commentaries on it !In his silent films , I really like Jobyna Ralston , but Mildred Davis was also nice .Neither will frighten you :) .On the otherhand they both complemented Harold very nicely .In Movie Crazy , the leading lady was Constance Cummings , and as I said she had great chemistry with Harold onscreen .So did Jobyna in particular .Harold was not too happy with The Sin of Harold Diddlebock .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I only have one reservation , I could not agree with Annette at all in the chapter headed \" Harold Lloyd releases The Cat 's Paw \" .This chapter discusses his sound film \" The Cats Paw \" , which Annette reckons was his finest sound movie .I could not disagree more .In that film ( which put story - line over gags for the first time ) , the character of Harold was not as engaging as in some other movies - including sound ones .His constant recourse to wise sayings was in character , but a thing too much on occasion ( mostly his high - flown way of speaking got on my nerves a bit ! )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Mostly the film did not flow as smoothly - as did another Harold Sound feature-\"Movie Crazy \" .That one-\"Movie Crazy \" , I opine was his best sound film .Excellent character , full of laughs and amusing situations , great chemistry with the leading lady - and excellent dialogue , which was not stinted at all , and flowed smoothly .Sorry for going on here - but this was the only chapter with which I was not in sync in Annettes excellent book .She also has published \" The Harold Lloyd Encyclopedia \" , which remains one of the best ' reference ' who s who on Harold Lloyd .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
