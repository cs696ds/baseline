{"text": "19 Responses to Episode 0074 .Not the first whodunit on The CBS Radio Mystery Theater , but the first whodunit where the perpetrator was caught by logic , rather than by a panicked confession .Excellent episode , very gripping .Murder mystery , no supernatural elements .War buddies conspire to kill the fellow former POW who ratted out their escape attempt from a Korean POW camp .They want to avenge the death of one of their own 20 years after the war 's end .Bit confusing at times .Not Roberts ' best performance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "ONLY THE DEAD REMEMBER .Very hard , very harsh , very good .Drama with surprises and characters that count .Drama-10 This was one of the first CBSRMT 's I had the pleasure to listen to .I have listened to it perhaps 5 - 6 times over the last couple of yr .The story is more than a mystery , which is a minor point and really only presented as such in the end .The issue of Revenge vs. Justice is really compelling here .It is interesting to consider that if Eddie accomplished his objective he would have murdered an innocent man .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The central drama and strain is hard on all of them .Even the ultimately disgusting lawyer ( an oxymoron ? )Tom is revealed to remember ... and the weight of his guilt kills him .Is this Justice resolved ?The title is interesting because everyone but the dead remember ! ......... a minor point .I hope the esteemed members ( lawyers included ) enjoyed the show .I have invited a friend to join this site and the discussion panel .His name is Phil ( user name unknown ) .If you should see his post please make him feel welcome .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He is the most knowledgeable and devoted fan of radio drama I know .But , this quality pales when considering what a great guy he is .... generous and pleasant .He has a good brain too .So , if you are here Phil .......Welcome ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !Howdy folks , First of all , thanks for the warm welcome Dave .I am flattered .I get most of my knowledge of OTR from listening , listening , listening !That and the fact that I spend WAY too much money building up my OTR book library ( 36 books and counting ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Since we are supposed to be honest in our evaluations of the episode , I will try to be from the start .When the show first started and it was revealed that this was a \" war incident \" episode , I thought to myself \" oh , man , not another one .\" I think the \" secret among war buddies \" stories have been overdone to the point of being just plain boring , especially since Vietnam .That was my general thoughts on the episode for the first two acts .The third act , however , was when it all came together and the mystery unravelled .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That , I think , is what makes a good story good .It holds your interest until you reach the point where you just have to know what happens next .I knew something was up with the lawyer ( Tom ) and that he was more central to the story than just the so - called \" voice of reason \" .I did n't think of it until Dave mentioned it in his review about how Eddie would have murdered an innocent man had he accomplished what he set out to .Obsession can be dangerous and blinding , as seen in the character of Eddie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One I will \" remember \" ( and no , I 'm not dead ) : ?I dunno .The show itself was well put together , but the story for me just never picked up .It left me quite flat .The pace was lulling ... enough so that it took me four \" listens \" to really hear it ( I kept falling asleep ) .Perhaps had I been in that kind of situation , I might be able to understand better , but the whole concept of someone holding a grudge for twenty years ( or whatever it was ) , was a stretch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But , I suppose it is possible , especially under these conditions .What was a let down for me , though , was when the episode got to the part where Liz became involved .She seemed to come out of nowhere and had no real purpose to the tale .When Bill asked \" How did you know I was supposed to go with Eddie ? \" her reply was , \" Because , Bill , I have faith in you ! \"She remained involved only enough to give information that Bill could have found out anyway , making the \" waitress can I have a newspaper \" scene near to silly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "THEN Tom appears , again out of nowhere , but at least he 's part of the story .When Liz calls to warn Bill , again , the story goes silly - Bill just ignores her .Hunh ?It just did n't make any sense .Why even bother putting Liz in the story at all ?The character , in my opinion , did n't offer enough of a misdirection to be a good device .Finally , when Tom slipped up and mentioned the waitress , I just rolled my eyes .I 'm sorry , but that was just too easy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Enough to make me realize that something else was going on .The ending left me with a slight yawn .In the end , I felt bad for Myers , a character we barely got to know .Bill turned out to be slightly annoying in the end , and Tom became ridiculous .\" I wanted us to get caught ! \" or \" I was trying to save our lives ! \" If a man could hold a secret like that for twenty years , it seems odd that he 'd go so puddly in the final hour .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Overall , I gave the show a 2.9 .Production was very good , acting was good , but the story left me feeling like I just watched a Matlock episode .As always , thanks and very best wishes !It is interesting to consider that if Eddie accomplished his objective he would have murdered an innocent man .A little deeper still and one might say he killed himself , as his misspent obsession resulted in his own death .[/quote :b9879ace1c ] I love how you worded this UNT , very good !But , I revert to my feeling that the episode , for me , was a stretch on the far side .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" I mean , it was TWENTY years we 're talking about ... that 's a mighty long time to obsess over something , especially something so serious .Mind you , Eddie may not have been a reasonable person , so there is certainly room for interpretation , right ?Anyhow , nice post UNT !And PHIL - welcome !I look forward to hearing more from your perspective as well ! !There are episodes of Scooby Doo with more intricate plot twists and revelations .........OK , I really enjoyed reading your review , and am glad somebody has humorously slammed an episode with such deleightful style , but the above quote is beyond belief .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This tale was Shakespearian ' compared to Scooby Doo .What I want to know is how did Eddie survive 20 years looking for this guy ?I mean travel is expensive , and piano players do n't top the list of best paid professions .Good point , I usually think of little things like that ( my wife hates it ) , but on this one I did n't .The obsession obviously played a huge role in his life .I believe it was Bill who said to Eddie , \" We always figured you 'd hit it big writing songs for Broadway \" ( something to that effect ) , so I would safely assume he worked not only as a piano player but also a songwriter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Add any compensation from his musical career to any money he received from his military service .Also , let 's suspend disbelief and imagine he even had a trust fund .Or perhaps he had a relative that passed away and left him a handsome estate .Personally , I like to imagine that Eddie pressed the Chinaman Button and in a strange twist of fate , he received a large sum of money from a wealthy cousin in South Africa who suddenly \" passed away .\" But that 's just me of course .If a show says \" Rip me ! \" ... then rip it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "........Also , if possible , try to post a comment before reading other 's reviews .This is a goal , not a directive and something we all have strayed form here and there .The forum does ask for it ... and I think for good reason . ...Anyhow , good to see you and am looking forward to future reviews from you .The story never gripped me ; just a so - so episode .3 stars .However , by all means , listen to the first 7 minutes of it for the news -- Patty Hurst , Vietnam , Kansas City School Board , etc .. Great news from 1974 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I understand she was there to point things out and help the plot along , but it was sometimes stilted in doing so .Even though this is the second time I 've heard the episode I did n't quite remember that Myers was n't the guy , even though as others have stated it seemed like something was building up to where he was n't .I would n't rate it as high as a 4 , because compared to the rest of the body of work of The CBSRMT it just is n't that great .I think a 3 would be much more accurate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
