{"text": "Awards .Synopses & Reviews .From a writer whose mastery encompasses fiction , criticism , and the fertile realm between the two , comes a new book that confirms his reputation for the unexpected .In Zona , Geoff Dyer attempts to unlock the mysteries of a film that has haunted him ever since he first saw it thirty years ago : Andrei Tarkovsky 's Stalker , widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time .( \" Every single frame , \" declared Cate Blanchett , \" is burned into my retina . \" )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Few books about film feel like watching a film , but this one does .We sit with Dyer as he writes about Stalker ; he captures its mystery and burnish , he pries it open and gets its glum majesty .As a result of this book , I know the film better , and care about Tarkovsky even more .\" Mark Cousins , author of The Story of Film .\" There is no contemporary writer I admire more than Dyer , and in no book of his does he address his animating idea - The Only Way Not to Waste Time Is to Waste It - more overtly , urgently , empathetically and eloquently .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "David Shields , author of Reality Hunger .While he dedicates ample energy to how the movie 's deliberate pacing runs contrary to modern cinema , its troubled production and the nuts and bolts of its deceptively simple parts , Dyer 's rich , restless mind draws the reader in with specific , personal details . \"Los Angeles Times .\" Dyer 's evocation of Stalker is vivid ; his reading is acute and sometimes brilliant ....Dyer is giving a performance , and it 's another Russian genius who presides over his book , namely Vladimir Nabokov ....", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
