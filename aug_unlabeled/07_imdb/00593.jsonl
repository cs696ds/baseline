{"text": "Nowadays , a lot of westerners like kung fu .In the beginning , westerners did n't know what kung fu really is , and went to universities , or other places like shaolin temple , to learn kung fu .Cartwheels , flying kicks , actually that 's the same as gymnastics .Real kung fu is \" among the people \" .Slowly , westerners started to realise this , and are now looking among the people , rather than learning \" flowery fists and embroidered kicks \" , in the old days it was called \" chou gong fu \" \" jun bashi \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So after Deng Xiao Ping made the \" open door policy \" China realised the treasure of traditional culture and is trying to revive it .Tanglang quan has been included in the list of \" intangeible cultural heritage \" .Nowadays due to higher living standards and especially the \" one child policy \" , Chinese people are afraid of \" eating bitter \" .This means to endure hardship .This is especially the case in the cities .If you look in the big kung fu schools , the kids are all from poor rural areas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It 's so high that if you fly there from a lower locale , you run a very real risk of altitude sickness as soon as you get out of the airplane - not , perhaps , the best way to start a relaxing holiday .This is why many people choose instead to fly to a nearby city near the coast , where the mountains dip their toes into the cool surf of the Pacific Ocean .There you can catch a train up the mountain , gradually acclimatising to the altitude as you ascend .Well , I say gradually , but the path from coast to crest is nothing of the sort scaling , as it does , the sheer face of the mountain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This takes time .The flight from city to city takes 50 minutes , the drive five hours , and the train a stately four days to reach its destination .But to dismiss such a journey based on time alone would be to miss out on some astonishing views as the lush , equatorial rainforest that bursts from the coast gradually dissolves into green rolling hills , which in turn give way to purple , jagged mountain tops .And what a train !We are not talking about some creaking metal worm in whose innards you perch uncomfortably on plastic seats , sipping bad coffee from a polystyrene cup and nibbling a dried , curled egg sandwich .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The sound is deadened by the rich , deep carpets and the thick bound curtains whilst tea is served from the finest silverware and china .One no doubt will breeze through as he gently takes satisfied sips of air whilst the other will stare at you confused , pre - occupied perhaps with the one single dominating thought of his continued survival .I wo n't spoil the surprise by telling you which is which .A man I know , let 's call him Ted , recently made such a trip , which as you can probably guess is why I 'm able to wax so lyrically about this little - known attraction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "He began to help , padding with a hankie as Ted tried to deal with the hot coffee on his shirt and trousers , the fear his camera could be ruined , and this man industriously patting at his clothing .It was at this point that another man arrived on the scene , equally concerned , and began helping Ted off with his rucksack as the coffee was seeping into the pockets , and running down Ted 's back .Off came the rucksack , which the man then appeared to drop on the ground by mistake .Another man appeared , picked up the rucksack , and in the blink of an eye all three dissolved into the crowd .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Speaking about it afterwards , he told me his strongest memory was just how good the four people who did it were .There was no noise , no violence , no force - just a well rehearsed set of actions that left him on the ground without his rucksack .By the time I was off my knees , they had gone .I still have no idea where they went .The hotel doorman saw nothing .There were people in the street but nobody reacted .Everything was normal and quiet , apart from the fact that I was standing on the pavement , without my rucksack and with no idea where it was and these people had gone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Honestly .You see belts are n't just good for holding up trousers ; they 're also a fantastic way of finding out where your centre of gravity is and this , my friends , is the road to the nirvana of combat .Accessing your maximum power is all about identifying and using your centre of gravity .Taking away someone 's strength is all about destabilising their centre of gravity .Throwing someone is all about destabilising their centre of gravity .Tripping someone over is all about destabilising their centre of gravity .Neutralising an attack is all about destabilising the centre of gravity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Sadly most of us only have two , so we use our centre of balance as the third anchor point - moving it in relation to our feet to maintain balance and transfer energy into a target , rather than our own wasted movement .Think about those cool little desk toys from the 80 's , with four suspended metal balls knocking into each other .It 'll help .Throwing is a simple matter of finding your opponents centre of gravity and using your own as leverage to move it .If you 're big , and they 're small , you can move someone without leverage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "No sniggering at the back - your third leg is actually the shifting point of balance created by your centre of gravity to stop you falling over , and ladies have it too .We all stand on two feet ; when we move , we basically start falling over towards our ' third leg ' , or at least where it would be if we had one , and then stick a foot in the way .By placing a foot where our third leg should have been , we get it under our centre of gravity again to stop falling over and repeat ( except those hippety - hoppety teenagers - God only knows how they do it ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
