{"text": "Atheists On Religion , Science , And Morality ( The Point ) .Can we prove there is no God ?Does it make sense to equate religion with science ?Do theists have a monopology on morality or is secular morality superior ?Was Richard Dawkins right to bring up the religious beliefs of Republican Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney ?None of them seems to have read \u00a8The Moral Landscape\u00a8 by Sam Harris .They claim that we need to do groundwork on ethics , but Harris has done a solid job on that .It seems banal - but if we can just agree that hunger , sickness , pain and fear are \u00a8bad\u00a8 , while prosperity , health and safety are \u00a8good\u00a8 , then we are well on our way of building a morality from scratch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
