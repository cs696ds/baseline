{"text": "In preparation for the film , De Niro put on 30 pounds between the end of his Broadway run in Cuba and His Teddy Bear and his days of filming scheduled at the end of the 70-day production schedule .He analyzed old Movietone newsreels in order to get Capone 's voice , movements and mannerisms .On an interesting note , the famous scene in the church between Ness and Malone as originally written , took place on a street , but Connery suggested it take place in a church - the only place left in the city where they could speak freely .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The train station shoot - out cost $ 200,000 to light because extra light was needed to shoot the sequence in slow motion .It took six days to shoot the scene , which cost an additional $ 100,000 .Not surprisingly , staging this sequence like the one in Battleship Potemkin was De Palma 's idea .The budget escalated from $ 17 million to $ 24 million thanks to the cost of production designer Patrizia von Brandenstein transforming an entire block of LaSalle Street in Chicago into the 1930s complete with 125 costumed extras and 60 period cars .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a rouser .The architectural remnants of the era ( including solid traces of Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright ) have been refurbished to provide a swaggering showcase for the legend .\" Time magazine 's Richard Schickel wrote , \" Such riches abound in this film , but it is as parable , not parody , that it grips us .The Untouchables all begin as archetypes of American goodness .And they do triumph over evil ; they send Capone to prison .But the cost is death or loss of innocence , for it is only by adapting crime 's methods that they can defeat it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Our only interest really is in whether the filmmaker can sustain the feat .It 's the kind of stunt that turns filmmaking into a kind of sideshow .It 's stunning but in the way that great jugglers or magicians can sometimes be stunning .But it 's not art , and , at least in the case of The Untouchables , it 's only marginally entertaining . \" The production design for The Untouchables is fantastic , especially the opulence of Capone 's headquarters with Morricone 's score resembling a 1930s riff on the music from De Palma 's Scarface .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All of the right elements came together at just the right time and place and resulted in an incredibly entertaining motion picture .The Untouchables shows what a master filmmaker like De Palma can do with a director - for - hire paycheck movie .He may not be making a personal statement with this film but he still gives it his all in terms of style and virtuoso camerawork .This film certainly set a high standard for period gangster films , casting a long shadow over future endeavors like Michael Mann 's Public Enemies ( 2009 ) and the HBO T.V. series Boardwalk Empire .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
