{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .Back when I was a small child in the mid 70 's , Horror movies expectedly frightened me .Big time .Even movie trailers on the TV would have me running into another room .But by the time I reached ten or eleven something happened , my Dad got us cable .There I was barraged by uncut Horror classics running 24 hours a day , on several channels , and I could n't escape .Nor did I want to .One of the first then - modern day Horror films I saw there was 1980 's Do n't Go In The House .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now after one completely botched earlier DVD release , Horror King Wannabe 's Shriek Show has released the film in a special edition that may have you asking was it worth it in the first place ?Starring Dan Grimaldi , who eventually would go to play key - character Patsy Parisi in The Sopranos throughout it 's entire run , this film is about Donald Kohler , a young man tortured throughout his life by his smothering & abusive mother .During a key moment in his youth , his mother punishes him for having \" impure thoughts \" by holding his arms above a burning flame .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "1 Comment 13 of 13 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Forgotten bit of early 80s horror nastiness overcomes its more graphic and mysogynistic elements thanks to a loopy performance by Dan Grimaldi ( The Sopranos ) and a wonderfully cheesy disco soundtrack .Watch as Grimaldi celebrates his evil mother 's passing by playing his disco records REALLY loud .Truly a product of its time , Do n't Go In the House ranks alongside William Lustig 's Maniac in the sleazy slasher department .A guilty pleasure to be sure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Why did it take this long for me to finally appreciate a Horror flick like this ! ?I already know that answer .I remember buying a copy of this on an old ex - rental vhs some years back when I was a teenager .At the time , I did n't have much patience for it and quickly fast forwarded through most of it because I thought it was boring not see non - stop carnage .Boy , was I clueless or what about this kind of Horror .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , after several years later and having seen many Horror flicks , I ran across the Shriek Show edition ( nice edition by the way ) , of ' Do n't Go in the House ' and thinking , \" I have to buy this !I actually need to give this flick a chance now that I 've enjoyed a lot of Horrors reaching from extreme to tame to serious to silliness . \"After watching ' Do n't Go in the House ' , I was shocked at how creepy and sleazy this film is ; I LOVE IT ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A mean and evil mother tortures her son during his childhood years .Now he 's grown up , his mother , whom he still lives with , has just died and now the son , being somewhat disturbed , really goes of the deep end !Starts hearing those pesky , evil , little voices in his head that tell him to seek revenge on his mother by killing other women .The way he fixes up one of the rooms in his house for his mother 's punishment , is sick and disturbing !How he murders these women is truly brutal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Besides the one nasty , long scene that people like to point out , I found a couple more jaw dropping scenes !I compare Joseph Ellison 's ' Do n't Go in the House ' , a lot to William Lustig 's ' Maniac ' .I find it interesting that both films were put out in same year , 1980 .It 's the same situation with ' The Burning ' and ' Madman ' .Those two came out in the same year .Read more ' .Comment 7 of 7 people found this helpful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes No Sending feedback ... . already a good case against this flick as it falls within the rash of knock - off \" do n't answer / look / open \" movies which hit the scene in the late ' 70 's - but this movie actually holds its own with some considerable sickness and a generally depraved attitude .The lead character does n't smile once through the whole flick and hardly winces as he torches poor girls in his custom - made incinerator .Not much gore unfortunately other than some burnt bodies but this film is so humorless it makes up for the lack of grue in its mean - spiritedness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A couple good jumps here and there - all in all a quality flick .Probably would have given it 4 stars but the DVD has absolutely nothing in the way of extras : full - screen , 2 ( ! ) chapters , and that s it .Comment 8 of 9 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I vaguely remember hearing about this film during it 's theatrical run in the 80 's when I was kid .I remember how critics trashed the film as being a particularly nasty example of the increasingly misogynistic direction horror films were going during that time period .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The scenes of women getting stripped and torched up into flames , the whole abusive mother theme AND the scene in the disco where the protagonist 's would be dance partner gets it upside the head with glass candle holder ca n't be argued as anything but misogynistic .However , I also picked up on the underlying homoeroticism ( for this I bump my rating up a star ) that runs throughout the film involving the protagonist and his co - worker .I mean , what else could one think about the co - workers odd phone calls in the middle of night and his persistance in \" hanging out \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
