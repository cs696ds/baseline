{"text": "I Spit on Your Grave 2 : Katie is trying to make it in the cutthroat world of modeling .When she innocently accepts an offer to have new photos taken for her portfolio , the experience quickly turns into an unthinkable nightmare of rape , torture , and kidnapping .The original and remake were very good films .This one was n't bad at all .Better than I expected .This is a very brutal and gory movie .The scenes are graphic ... so prepare yourself .Overall , really good revenge movie !I am a huge fan of \" woman getting revenge on her tormentors \" movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was n't sure that a sequel to the remake was going to work since I feared that it was going to just be a rehash of the same old same old .I was mistaken .I actually prefer this film to the remake and even the original film .This is a brutal and relentless film that will make you wish it was over .Not because you want to end the suffering in a bad way but because it 's so nerve wracking that you 'll want it to end so you can take a few deep breathes and remind yourself that .... it 's only a movie !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's just sick that things like this actually happen and the only real justice anyone gets is maybe a prison sentence .I say she got some pretty good justice here .WOW , Way better than i thought it would be considering how good the first one was .Was left speechless through most of it but the ending took the biscuit .Not for the squimish lol .A definite must see ! !it was a great sequel , was surprised , like it was same story but different location and little twist on it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Acting , script and cinematography makes you feel for the poor victim but does not in my opinion give the viewers insight in to the psychology of the situation .If you are going to recreate a brutal situation such as this , at least let us see deeper in to the psyche .Has Hollywood lost that ability ?WOW ! ! !Good movie .Have not seen the first yet , but this one was good .Some scenes are hard to watch ... and there is one scene that guys will absolutely not like , but this is well worth the time to watch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All of the screaming , yelling , crying , sobbing and wimpering was getting very annoying after a while .The acting was pretty good and there was no surprises as far as the script was concerned .The directing was adequate and the editing and storyline was reasonable .This was a nice follow up to the first remake installment and hopefully they can invent a part 3 .Which will be less vocal .Lol .... the lead actress was excellent if you can get past all of the vocalizations .Thumbs up and in my ears .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was a descent movie up till her retarded escape .After that it was just about the gore .Do n't get me wrong , I love gory movies .but the second half of the movie was kinda lame .Good gore , ok acting , but the revenge part was badly written .I did n't expect much and that 's what I got .It is what it is .A sequel to the 2010 remake .You watch a girl get so horribly tortured and brutalized for an hour , so you 're then glad to see her enact her revenge , however horrible , and be happy about it , because you just watched them brutalize the girl.very entertaining in my opinion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
