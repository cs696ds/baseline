{"text": "That gap has been reduced to as little as three to four months for many films , especially for studios seeking to market summer blockbusters as Christmas gifts .I 've summarized Epstein 's argument in some detail not only because I find it rather persuasive , but also because I think it points to a significant change in our habits of film spectatorship , a question that ought to be fairly important for film scholars and theorists .Because the home entertainment divisions have established themselves as the power centers in the studios , this may eventually dictate what films receive the greenlight , and it will certainly limit the opportunity for smaller films to slowly build an audience theatrically .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "40/100 [C- ] .Insidious : Chapter 2 is directed by James Wan .It was one of my most anticipated horror films of 2013 .Wan impressed me so much with The Conjuring , it was memorable , thrilling and well written .Unfortunately , Insidious : Chapter 2 is exactly the opposite , the script is filled with annoying and unfunny jokes , the direction is lazy , the production is cheap and some situations are extremely surrealistic .The opening scene and the first act are quite enjoyable , but there 's a horrible lack of suspense and the scares are not so effective .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A horror film without suspense is utter crap .The first act contains two or probably three extremely creepy moments , but seriously , the rest of the film is a stupid comedy , and it 's so rare compared to Wan 's previous work .Also , it has an intentionally funny script , the dialog was so cheesy and overcooked .Chapter two is a failed amateurish experiment by Wan and screenwriter Leigh Whannell , it 's a joke .It is definitely one of the worst films I 've seen at the theater so far .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I really do n't recommend it , maybe two or three moments are worth watching on YouTube or HBO , do n't waste your money in this .I 'm a huge fan of the first Insidious , it was amazing , even though I had some issues with its final act , it was a solid horror flick with a well handled suspense .On the other hand , chapter two lacks of scares and is short on suspense .Well , at least , the performances are still fine , Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne are awesome as always and the young actors are excellent too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Moving on , it has a good camera work , Wan gives us some creepy shots , and at times it looks like a James Wan film !But that 's not enough .I 'm really concerned about this movie , chapter two is a strange flick , I 'm not even sure of what it is , maybe an awful mix of genres , such as : comedy and psychological horror .Whatever , it sucks .As I said above , yeah , the plot of the film is quite original , but it does n't offer enough scares nor entertainment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't even recommend it for fans of the first Insidious starving for horror , because chapter two is literally a comedy film , a very bad one .The trailer is amazing and scary , but unfortunately all the scenes in the trailer are the best parts in the movie and that 's it .In conclusion , chapter two is well acted but it delivers more laughs than scares .[C- ] ...Expand .Insidious : Chapter 2 illustrates that , regardless of his past success in the horror movie field , James Wan is not infallible when it comes to the genre .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It is now weighed down by a second half that 's equal parts incoherent , tedious , and repetitive .The primary purpose of Insidious : Chapter 2 is to get the filmmakers out of the corner they wrote themselves into when crafting the end of Insidious .Josh 's wife , Renai ( Rose Byrne ) , quickly figures out something is n't right but it 's left up to his mom , Lorraine ( Barbara Hershey ) , to pick through the bones of the past and determine what 's happening .The goal of Insidious : Chapter 2 is to free Josh from the \" Further .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not only does Insidious : Chapter 2 lack tension ( due in large part to its uneven , meandering pace ) but even the scares are generic and obligatory .Wan , who has in the past shown the capability to develop and sustain high levels of suspense , falls back on the repeated use of \" boo ! \" moments with things jumping in front of the camera and Joseph Bishara 's score striking loud , discordant notes .There are lengthy segments when Insidious : Chapter 2 seems unduly influenced by the supernatural aspects of the defunct David Lynch / Mark Frost TV series , Twin Peaks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's a freaky other dimension that exists between life and death where spirits can become trapped .That place is ruled by demons and inhabited by strange creatures .The only things missing are dwarfs , cherry pie , and damn fine cups of coffee .Wan has indicated Insidious : Chapter 2 might be his last horror film .Regardless of whether or not he returns to this series , it 's clear the studio wants it to continue .The cliffhanger at the end of Insidious was designed to tweak the audience ; it did n't demand a follow - up and , in fact , the need to resolve it is one of the major failings of Chapter 2 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , there 's another cliffhanger but , on this occasion , it 's clearly a hook for a Chapter 3 .Considering the bad taste left over from installment # 2 , I have no interest in revisiting this franchise again in the near future .Horror is supposed to be scary and suspenseful ( or at least creepy ) , not confusing and sleep - inducing .The most dispiriting thing is that we know Wan understands this ; in this case , he just does n't execute it . ...Expand .Much more over the place than the first one , this sequel does n't have a lot to offer than the exact same things as the first one , cheap jumpscares and clich\u00e9s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My only issue with \" Chapter 2 \" is the almost grandiose persona that seems to shadow the nature of this family 's tale .At times the context and explanatory content seems a bit forced and over - exaggerated even for a fictional film setting .Even in fantasy and fiction the story needs to carry a bit of believability and realism .You need to think that this could actually happen to someone My only issue with \" Chapter 2 \" is the almost grandiose persona that seems to shadow the nature of this family 's tale .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Over all \" Insidious Chapter 2 \" works at carrying this nightmare to the next stage and works in creating a sort of mythos for this supernatural concept .It will scare enough for some fun moments , but it does n't go far enough to allow for replays of the movie that are just as thrilling as watching it for the first time .So really \" Insidious Chapter 2 \" is one of those 50/50 films where it is cool if you like it and it is worth owning if ghost stories do it for you but if you choose to skip it then that is just fine too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
