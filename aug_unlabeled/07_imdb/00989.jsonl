{"text": "Danny DeVito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in 1987 .DeVito plays an odd mamma 's boy named Owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still lives with .The mother is played by Anne Ramsey , who passed away shortly after this was released , and she is quite a caricature .She is loud , ugly , rude , and overbearing .Though Owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself , he wants desperately to have his mother offed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The resulting action is often quite funny , and even poignant .It 's certainly never dull and often full of surprises .The acting is exceptional , even if Ramsey was a bit over the top .Crystal is as good as he can be , and DeVito has always been undervalued as a performer .The film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works , often painfully so .The film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes , and the off - beat tone is truly refreshing .I have often been critical of the late 1980s as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy film - making .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
