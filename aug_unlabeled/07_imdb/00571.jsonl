{"text": "The story is presented from the point - of - view of fortysomething Ginny Cook Smith ( Jessica Lange ) , who burdens the film with a voiceover narrative that is occasionally useful , but more often tedious .She 's the oldest of the three daughters of farmer Larry Cook ( Jason Robards ) , the \" most respected man in the county . \"Along with her husband , Ty ( Keith Carradine ) , she still lives on her father 's 1000 acre farm .Her sister May ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) resides there as well , along with her husband , Peter ( Kevin Anderson ) , and their two teenage daughters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite the distance between her and the Cook farm , Caroline is closer to her father than either Ginny or May.Things begin happening when the son of a neighbor , Jess Clark ( Colin Firth ) , returns home after a thirteen - year absence .On the day of Jess ' welcome back party , Larry announces his intention to turn over control of his farm to his three daughters .When Caroline wonders aloud whether this is a good thing , Larry cuts her out of his plans .The entire 1000 acres is then divided between Ginny & Ty and May & Peter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And , as his rage escalates , deeply - buried secrets begin to ooze into the open .As in David Lynch 's vision of America , A Thousand Acres shows that green fields and crisply - painted houses can hide a festering horror .A Thousand Acres has a choppy feel , almost certainly the result of the book - to - screen transition , and the pre - epilogue ending happens with surprising suddenness .Subplots get short changed and characters seemingly disappear without warning .Arguably , the complexity of the storyline may be too ambitious for 100-plus minute running time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In lesser hands , this could have turned into little more than another big - screen soap opera .However , by generating an effective rapport between the audience and the main characters , Moorhouse gives us some meat to chew on .She also manages to develop a number of multi - dimensional characters by showing the good and bad in everyone .Some will doubtless complain that the film engages in routine man - bashing , but anyone who looks carefully will see that the women are nearly as flawed as their male counterparts .Three of the four leads give powerful performances .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As our narrator , she provides the anchor in a turbulent dramatic sea .Michelle Pfeiffer shows an edge that we 're unaccustomed to .This is n't a lightweight glamour role , and she is up to the challenge of pulling it off .Jason Robards manages to bring out both sides of Larry -- the evil , lecherous creep and the fumbling , lost old man .Only Jennifer Jason Leigh is less - than - impressive , and that 's more a function of the lack of exposure and development accorded to her character than a knock on her performance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A Thousand Acres covers a lot of ground , and raises numerous questions about the demons that some families keep buried .The land means many things in this film : a source of pride , a means of economic survival , a financial windfall , and , most importantly , a tool for revenge .This is the kind of movie that you experience more with your emotions than with your intellect .It 's not a dumb film , but its undisputed strength lies in the way it tears at the heart .Moorhouse 's manipulation is skillful , and that makes it easier to forgive the occasional missteps . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's more of a character drama about Birdee ( Sandra Bullock ) moving back home and the main story line being a romance with Harry Connick Jr. .Birdee , and the film , are very down - to - earth .Although she lived in Chicago , she 's much more suited to the small - town life that she grew up in in Texas .They do n't go for much of the obvious comedy of big - city girl versus small - town country girl .And that 's a good thing .The young daughter can get annoying , and the romantic comedy angle is transparent from the beginning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I ca n't help but wonder if we were all watching the same film .The opinions are so different .I guess people either like it a lot , or hate it .Me - I loved it !It 's worth watching just to see the scene between Berdie and Romana in the bathroom when Berdie comes home drunk and tells just how her husband leaving her makes her feel .Perhaps those who did n't like and could n't relate to this movie never had an experience like that .Good for them .But , trust me , those of us who have had this experience understand exactly how Berdie felt - she expressed our feelings for us - perhaps better than we could have .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And Harry Connick as Justin - well - one review said we 'd all probably like to have our own Justin .I totally agree !I particularly like Berdie 's speech to her husband after the funeral when she told him that she had already gotten the best part of him , their daughter , and that what 's left over did n't look so good .This film helps us to understand the deeper feelings of people in various situations .And does a good job of it .Great movie !Written by Steven Rogers , \" Hope Floats \" is a standard romance that tries so very hard to be a drama , but it just is n't .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Director Forest Whitaker would have been better served presenting this movie more like a Julia Roberts ( \" Pretty Woman \" or \" The Runaway Bride \" ) or a Meg Ryan ( \" Sleepless in Seattle \" or \" You 've Got Mail \" ) flick .Also starred Harry Connick Junior , Gena Rowlands , Mae Whitman and Michael Pare .Look for Sandra in \" While You Were Sleeping \" for a much more enjoyable film .Saturday , June 10 , 2000 - DVD .This is not quite \" my type of movie \" but I am a Sandra Bullock fan so I watch everything of hers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was simply disgusted by the TV show scenes .What filth the TV programme was - bringing someone on under completely false pretences .Birdie believes she 's on the show for a nice time - a makeover .And then demand that makeover she was told she was getting or threaten to sue the TV co. for false pretenses ?I think they 'd then have either had to agree to her demand - or hurriedly hustle all three protagonists off the stage if Birdie kicked up enough of a fuss .But I suppose she 'd find that when she agreed to appear on the programme she signed some legal doc and did n't read some fine print that told her she could n't complain no matter what the outcome .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , for this story to work , she has to have her confidence smashed and be unable to think what to do when faced with her smirking husband and his vicious bit on the side .It 's a feature of some Sandra Bullock movies that I have to say I do n't often like though sometimes it works well .In this it 's debatable .Do we want the movie to show how Birdee recovers her confidence eventually ?Or do we want to see her putting up a spirited defence and shaming the gutless berk she married ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Why was n't this passed on to her ?Yes , of course she 'd be distraught and after an initial outburst become very depressed .And yes , she may well be so shocked at the time she would n't know what to say , as is the case in this story , and it 's not easy to be so feisty as I suggest she could have been .But I do seriously wonder at the legal situation raised here .It 's clear Daddy did n't really care much at all for his kiddie - all he does is phone a few times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Tough if it 's a long journey .But perhaps one should be grateful he did n't try to visit in case he also tried to snatch the child .Did he pay alimony ?Well , Birdie gets a mediocre job and that 's quite amusing even if disappointing she ca n't get anything better in this back of beyond type town - however , she shows that anything can become better if you make something of it yourself .In the end Birdee wins out and things improve for the daughter who after continually standing up for her vile father and thereby hurting her loving and caring mother deeply , finally discovers in the most hurful way what a file b ...... her father is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
