{"text": "The closer you are to someone , the easier it is to hurt them .People who grow up in our society learn quickly to hide their real weakness es , the things that would break them if found and exploited by a malicious person .When you first meet somebody , all you know about them is what they broadcast to the world .Things that they either consciously display , are unable to hide , or do n't know that they 're showing .In school , before the defenses have fully set in and the callouses have been built up , these obvious properties can still be taken advantage of , and cause deep pain in the hands of the cruel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You need a lot more than \" faggot \" or \" fatass \" to wound a mature person .Instead , it takes knowing who they are , and which of their past failures hurt the most .It takes finding the one part of their psyche that they ca n't bear to have fun made of .It takes being able to see the world through their eyes , and know their thoughts in your mind .In short , it takes becoming close to them .What 's more , people stop expecting pain when it 's been absent for a long time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So when it happens , when somebody says words that crush you alive , part of your response is surprise that it could even happen at all .The fact that it happened at the hand of somebody close -- who is the only person who could have done it anyway -- makes the surprise even more vivid .The urge to destroy something beautiful ( which we all get sometimes , do n't we ? ) is so much more powerful and dangerous in adults than in kids , for this reason .Because the destroyer is somebody you know and trust ( and love ? ) , and the words are crafted so precisely to burn your soul , the damage can be profound .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't know if this is strictly true .The problem is that as you get closer to someone ( and learn what would really hurt them ) , you also tend to care for them more .This caring has the effect that by the time you know enough to truly devastate someone , you ca n't imagine doing it .One story I read expressed it this way : Everyone has three knots ( character flaw s / weaknesses ) .To cast a hex on someone you need to know two of there knots , so your spell can have power over them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
