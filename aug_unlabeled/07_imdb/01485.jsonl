{"text": "I could nt believe all the great shots they had in it .The actors all did a pretty good job .I feel like the bad guys did a fantastic job , especially Sean Harris and Melissa George !The pacing was great .Kept up with the hectic and thrilling chases very well .The over all feel and vibe of the film was just ... perfect .There was a few parts where I wanted to reach into the computer and slap some of the characters !I mean it dosent take a genius to figure out what s going on !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Run ! ' moments .Do nt miss out on this gem .A 9/10 .Wow , just wow !I ca n't believe that the IMDB rating is not higher .This was brilliant in my opinion .Kept my attention the whole time and for me that is not easy , haha !That scum at the end deserved more than he got ! !I LOVE this director 's other films , but this one only started off good imo .At the beginning it 's gripping n reels you in , with terrific scenery n awesome shots of the mountains n hiking but then it kinda fizzles out into boring rifle shooting for me ( where i dosed off ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
