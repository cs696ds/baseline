{"text": "Two years later Laurie is an emotional mess , and wild - man Myers is hallucinating discussions with his dead mother , who urges him to kill again .I had minor hopes for Halloween II .Probably more important is the fact that Zombies first sequel , Devil 's Rejects , was a vast improvement over its prequel ( House of 1000 Corpses ) .There was a chance that the writer / director just needed a whole film to get the bad stuff out of himself , and that given the chance he could do something special within the confines of his little universe .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This part of the film is arguable the best it gets , thanks to some well executed scares , some colourful nightmare imagery , and some convincing gore .From here the stalk and slash elements become the tacked - on occasional joy between long dialogue and hallucination scenes .This is certainly a very violent movie , and the realistic frequency of the violence is certainly what I 'd call disturbing .More to the point they tend to stop the plot in its tracks and in some cases are unintentionally , riotously funny .The more arty stuff is certainly pretty , sort of recalling grim and gritty arthouse horrors like E. Elias Merhige Begotten , but it never fits in the mix , and is certainly heavy handed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Halloween II is burdened with too many flashing lights , intercut shots , and sudden bursts of abstract sound , something it had appeared the director had gotten out of his system between House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil 's Rejects .As per usual , it 's the director 's writing that really gets in the way .Effectively Zombie has turned Michael Myers into a mix of Jason Voorhees and Norman Bates .It was wasteful enough to give the Shape a meaningful back story ( though at least he was trying something new with the character ) , but turning him into a ' real world ' version of another slasher icon is downright perfunctory .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Zombie 's comedy dialogue continues to be his real Achilles heel , and his attempts at ' girl talk ' make Diablo Cody 's heroines sound conventional and normal in comparison .His first year Freud stuff is pretty ugly too , which actually made me feel most sorry for Scout Taylor - Compton , whose casting was one of the first film 's shining beacons of inspiration .This time 's her version of Laurie Strode is left a clich\u00e9d late ' 90s ' riot grrl ' , and an obnoxious screaming wreck .I was chomping at the bit for her untimely death after the first reel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Halloween II is surely a Rob Zombie film , and thusly it is surely grainy as all get out .The grain is fine and speckled , but there it is , all over the place .You really are n't going to miss it .The grain actually appears to have been possibly added in post , based in its consistency and extreme nature .Even in high definition viewers are going to have to squint to tell what 's going on .I 'm guessing that the standard definition release is a case of blurry white shapes over utter blackness , but here on Blu - ray we get sharp white shapes over utter blackness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The de - saturation makes for an almost monochromatic experience throughout a lot of the film , but there are plenty of excessively colourful moments , mostly pertaining to the nightmarish final act .The grain is still excessive , but the overall colour quality is pretty sharp , and pure ( outside those purposeful black dots ) .There are a few super - stylized moments throughout the film , mostly representing Myers ' fractured mind , and these are crisply black and white , or solidly highlighted with colour pops in some cases .Audio .Halloween II comes fitted with a full - bodied DTS - HD Master Audio 5.1 track .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The uncompressed nature of the track is likely most valuable for the really high volume levels , which feature no distortion .A lot of the non ambient sound is centred on the track along with the dialogue , including all the incidental noises , and the more grotesque sounds of Michael 's murders .The punchy bass added to each knife stab is a good touch .It 's hard to differentiate between what is soundtrack music , and ambient , spooky effects , but we surly find both dancing about the stereo and surround channels listlessly and for punctuation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm very disappointed at the total lack of the original John Carpenter score during the film proper ( it eventually plays over the credits ) , but the musical elements certainly make the 5.1 enhancement worth the effort .Extras .I was expecting a little more out of this disc in terms of extras considering the Halloween release .The first thing that comes up during writer / director Rob Zombies solo commentary track is the stupid white horse motif , which apparently he came up with while they were filming .Somehow this makes me feel better about the whole thing because it did n't require much thought , even if it proves that Zombie was n't putting much effort into the project .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The overarching themes of the track are monetary hardship and giving up on plot elements .Only fifteen minutes into the film Zombie already mentions a dozen changes , some for purposes of lost footage , but often just for the hell of it .I imagine editing was hell .The track works well to point out the differences between this director 's cut and the original cut for those of us that missed the film in theatres .There 's no making of documentary this time around ( perhaps they 're saving it for a special edition ? ) , but there is a pile of twenty - three deleted / extended / alternate scenes ( 25:15 , HD ) which takes up some room , and gives fans a clearer vision of what exactly Zombie intended with his script ( or something ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And the film is plenty long in this director 's cut form already .Overall .Halloween II is a pretty miserable , and oppressively long film , but it 's better than Rob Zombie 's first crack at the series , if only for the more visceral elements .Ironically enough , despite his need to create a subversive slasher film , Zombie 's best work comes out of the film 's most conventional slasher moments .Hopefully this marks the end of the director 's time in the Halloween sandbox , and he uses his tonal abilities for something more original next time around .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The sound is certainly impressive , and the extras , though not particularly time consuming , should be enough to please the fans .We rolled into Amesbury about four o'clock in my beat up old VW Camper .It 's red and white and patchy , with new tan - coloured fibre glass filling in the wheel arch where the rust has finally eaten way at what remained of the original structure .A proper hippie vehicle .Less a vehicle , more a lesson in hand - painted , engineered autobiography .By the time you read this Christmas will be well and truly finished .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
