{"text": "This is the main board on The Outhouse , where Outhousers talk about everything .No topics are off limits , and it does n't have to be about comics .All the topics from the other boards also show up in The Asylum , so you never have to leave1 .Turn back time twenty years tonight as Syfy celebrates their expansion of the television landscape with producers and stars talking about the series and mini - series that have made the network the sci - fi staple that it is today .The network 's imaginative evolution is lovingly explored covering not just its past but also its trans - media , multi - platform vision of the future .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sanctuary , Being Human , Lost Girl and Alphas are also touched upon along with the network 's rich legacy of original reality and competition series as well as upcoming series Continuum ( starring Rachel Nichols ) and the amazingly ambitious Defiance .The informative anniversary special also includes fun retrospectives of Syfy 's Saturday night creature features and the network 's boundary - pushing role in spearheading the paranormal reality genre .Join the two - hour celebration commemorating two decades of groundbreaking TV history tonight @9/8c ( with an encore airing immediately afterwards at 11/10c ) only on Syfy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Imagine Greater !Ten years ago I would watch much more of it during the week and even on Friday nights .They ran great marathons of shows like Buck Rogers , Earth 2 , Star Trek and many others during weekdays .Friday nights had great optioned shows like Farscape , Good & Evil and The Invisible Man .When they underwent their management change like 3 - 4 years ago it seems they 've totally gone inhouse and now just crank out crappy D - list junk .A few of their shows are decent ( with the exception being Battlestar Galactica which was the best show on TV for awhile ) , but , overall are n't the same quality we saw when they were optioning shows from different production companies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "A year or two before the name change the original owners sold it to NBC .Then they stopped showing old reruns , and started showing movies that did n't really qualify as sci - fi .The reality shows poured in , Stargate and it 's many spin offs ended .Stuff with Cylons , blah , blah , three headed shark versus piranacroc .When the hell is the Booster Gold series getting mentioned by TPTB ?At least give us a pilot episode .Ten years ago I would watch much more of it during the week and even on Friday nights .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I 'd be interested to hear your thoughts on the ( state of the ) network after watching the special .Good & Evil and The Invisible Man get nods , btw .It 's interesting how the this special kind of mirrors my feelings on the channel .I could 've quit watching this after the first hour because everything that was interesting to me was covered .The second hour made up mostly of their reality TV which I guess Faceoff and the set designing show are are only worthwhile .The only two shows I was really interested seeing discussed were Being Human and Haven .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Probably the biggest question I have that was n't addressed was syndication of old material .Why is n't Farscape being repeated on the network , why do n't we ever see Andromeda or other shows that were cancelled by other networks that Sci - Fi picked up ?Unless certain licensing agreements with outside production companies are dramatically more expensive with the crap I 'm seeing syndicated now on weekdays I do n't understand why I do n't get more repeats .Invisible Man , Andromeda , Farscape and most of the really worthwhile mini - series are almost non - existent in syndication and I find that completely mystifying .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
