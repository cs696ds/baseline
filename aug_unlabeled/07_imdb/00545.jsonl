{"text": "JT was not even close to funny in Bad Teacher so I was surprised with his ability to pull off these lines in the way that he did .In regards to pacing , the film is pretty predictable but you ca n't get everything you want in one film .That being said , there were a number of parts of the plot that I was n't expecting at all so this was a very welcome change .Also , the secondary characters like one of Dylan 's work colleagues and Jamie 's mum are great additions to the cast as well as some minor cameos from others .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Something that I do n't normally care about in films is the soundtrack but this one has a fantastic set of songs .Music actually plays quite an important role in the film as a whole as Dylan and Jamie talk about its use in romantic films .From this , we get some classier songs that you would probably expect to be in a film of this nature like Hey , Soul Sister and New York , New York .On top of these great songs though are some more urban sounds like Jump by Kris Kross which used to be a massive favourite of mine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As you can probably tell , I loved this film so much .I have n't laughed so much during a film at the cinema in such a long time and I was n't expecting to at all .Highly recommended from me !Comments .I loved it !The other night I went to my local Cineworld to see a movie I had been wanting to see as soon as I heard about it .The movie in question was ' Friends With Benefits ' , an American Romantic Comedy movie starring Justin Timerlake and Mila Kunis .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

'Watch Friends with Benefits to find out .Aww !I loved this movie !It 's such a cute movie .I loved everything about it ; the plot , the script , the acting and the jokes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I could n't pick a favourite as just when one would make me laugh the other would make me laugh .They really complimented eachother as characters .I thought that the acting in this movie was exceptional especially from the two main actors .I was really impressed with Justin Timberlake in this movie .It 's funny , because whilst I have always liked his music , I have never liked him , although after seeing him in the film Bad Teacher and now this , he has really proven himself and I think that he is a fantastic actor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie is quite rude and does have quite a bit of bad language and so I was suprised that the movie was rated as a 12 - I would have put it as a 15 myself .It is very rude with lots of you - know - what , so if it 's not your thing then this movie is n't for you .The movie is very funny , whether it is a funny scene , a funny line or a funny conversation .There was lots in this movie which made me laugh .I was actually suprised at how great of a comedy actor Justin Timberlake is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I knew straight away what the ending would be , but it was the little bits in between that I did n't predict and that is what made the movie so interesting .The movie runs for 109 minutes ( just under 2 hours ) .Usually I get quite restless watching a movie this long , although I did n't want this movie to end - I loved it !Thanks for reading !September 2011 xdonzx / xd - o - n - z - x .Comments .after all just another chick flick .I 'm not a fan of chick flicks but I decided to give this movie a chance because I needed a breezy clich\u00e9 - ridden movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "And it works , until they both realize that it does n't .And that no matter how much you try not having them , or at least not showing them , you need those things called emotions .The first half of the movie , where everything between Jamie and Dylan is still physical and mainly friendly is surprisingly good and Kunis and Timberlake did a good job portraying two wacky friends having a good time .Patricia Clarkson is also good as a cool hippie Mom .The most pleasant surprise is Woody Harrelson as Tommy , Dylan 's sports writer gay friend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie suddenly slips into an almost drama when , during a visit to his family , Dylan and Jamie realize they want more then body contact .As his sister Annie , Jenna Elfman plays a matchmaker and Richard Jenkins as a sick father plays the role of the obvious evidence why Dylan is so emotionally elusive .The almost drama part of the movie is a dissapointing because it challenges the attempt of the movie trying not to be \" just another romantic comedy \" .Seems like having a romantic comedy without a bit of overacted drama is almost impossible , like having friendly emotions free sex .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
