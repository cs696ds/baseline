{"text": "The BBC refused to show the film because it was \" too disturbing . \" Watkins went on to the influential but now little - seen mainstream film Privilege , about a rock star whose popularity turns him into a religious figure .But Punishment Park is , to say the least , a radical leap forward .The War Game remained banned in England for a long time and was eventually shown on American public television .But after being yanked from theaters after only a few days , Punishment Park has been screened only at a few film festivals and film studies classes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now it is on DVD .Synopsis : 1970 .With growing activist resistance to the Vietnam War , President Nixon activates provisions in the 1950 McCarran act and sets up detention centers for undesirables deemed a threat to national security .In California 's Mojave Desert , groups of dissidents are summarily convicted and given the choice of long prison terms or a 3-day ordeal in Punishment Park .While the tribunal starts to process a second group of belligerent , sullen detainees , the first group is sent on their 53-mile marathon across a desert where daytime temperatures soar over 100 degrees .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even before they begin , most of the detainees - draft evaders , political activists , protesters and a couple who attended a poetry reading - believe that the police will simply murder them under one pretext or another .Punishment Park is an angry scream of a movie that makes the ' reasonable ' stance of most modern activist films seem like soft soap .An old Cold War law basically legitimizes the formation of political concentration camps , and Watkins ' bitter film simply imagines what a political death camp , California - style , might be like .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We see the young policemen and National Guardsmen being over - prepared for the use of deadly force against people they are told are the scum of the earth and the enemies of their country .Already paranoid , the harrassed prisoners are given a two - hour head start for their goal , but are not told what the police will do to apprehend them beyond a vague statement that forceful resistance will be met with force .Watkins retains his preferred pseudo - docu format by having the camera represent the filmed record of a foreign television crew .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The handheld camera was more of a novelty in 1971 and surely added to the \" reality \" of the events in the desert chase .Things go wrong almost immediately .Several of the more cynical and rebellious dissenters refuse to play the game , hang back and murder the first pursuing officer , taking his pistol and rifle .Outraged , the police immediately decide that all of their prey have violated the game rules and that deadly force will be used .We never find out if this is an atypical ' run ' or if other groups of detainees are treated more fairly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are some brutal scenes , but strangely enough , the strongest violence is back in the trial tent where the next group is being ' arraigned ' without benefit of trial by jury .Watkins apparently first thought of doing a movie about the trial of the Chicago Seven , and the same kind of confrontational rhetoric is used here .The judges accuse and condemn each defendant of basically being what they are , unhappy malcontents .Those defendants that are genuine dissenters openly defy the tribunal with obscenities and counterthreats , and are beaten and gagged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A bitter female tribunal panelist is all too eager to see them all sent to \" the Park .The way it is mentioned , Punishment Park begins to seem like a Guantanamo Disneyland , a Gulag Magic Mountain .The judgments all seem pre - ordained .On their refreshment break , the judges voice their pride in saving the country from these destructive elements .They insist that their own children are \" under control , \" and have nothing in common with the radicals .Is Punishment Park credible ?That 's a tough call .Nixon could have invoked the power of the McCarren act , but would probably have been checked by congress and the Supreme Court , and perhaps even by the military .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Watkins pushes his metaphor just far enough to raise hackles and expose raw nerves .His film is not a fair look at anything - it 's meant to agitate .Watkins claims that his cast of non - professionals included some people ( not all ) playing that fully supported the rhetoric of their characters , judges , detainees and police as well .Much of the the \" script \" was unwritten and improvised .One police commander seems all too authentic when he proudly demonstrates the lethal utility of pistols and shotguns and voices his eagerness to deal out justice to the enemies of his country .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Those advocating its suppression would probably liken its effect to the act of yelling \" Fire ! \" in a crowded theater , and call it an irresponsible film likely to incite trouble .Watkins would doubtlessly argue that yelling \" Fire ! \" is the only responsible thing to do , if the theater is on fire and nobody listens to reason .Project X 's DVD of Punishment Park is at this point available only in Canada , through the Canadian Amazon .A company representative says it will soon be able to be ordered from diabolikDVD.com .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The government has barred many foreign pictures as propaganda but supposedly has no right to ban a domestic film - unless the Patriot Act now trumps the First Amendment .In the case of Punishment Park , the producers ran up against a stone wall in 1971 when trying to book the show into established theater chains .The assumption is that corporate chains would n't touch the subject matter with a ten - foot pole , but there 's no actual proof of a no - show conspiracy .The image quality is excellent , bright and colorful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The sound is also clear , making the removable English subs a necessity only for the hearing impaired .The extras on the disc range from a scholarly commentary to text essays and the original , unorthodox 1971 Press Kit .Filmmaker Watkins is present on camera for a half - hour ' introduction ' that is the star extra attraction .He uses prepared papers , as if he were a radical filmmaker reading a blunt statement written for his own arraignment at Punishment Park .He 's convinced that civil liberties are far more threatened now than they were in 1970 , and he impresses as a very serious , idealistic man .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Punishment Park is an artistic attempt to throw down a gauntlet , but it must be stressed that even now , 34 years later , not very many people have seen it .I suppose that conservatives would fear and loathe the film as pro - revolutionary propaganda , although only a couple of the detainees express sentiments of that kind .Most are just insolent , or silent pacifists looking for a way to personally get clear of the % $ # % war .I can also see anybody with a connection to the police or the military being bitterly offended by this portrayal of law enforcement officers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Many other demonstrations seem to have been encouraged by the Occupy movement .There seems to be a lot of people disillusioned with rundown current state of affairs - in economy , in government , in politics .Almost all protests in this classic year of restlessness seem to focus on the economic recession and the growing tremendous disparity between the few rich and powerful and the rest - in economic as well as in political clout and domination .A principal gripe is about the grave injustices / iniquities brought on by the lopsided large - scale / global and local corporate muscle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The Occupy movement seems to be a valid , non - violent way of getting people to exchange ideas about the current state of affairs .It encourages people to talk about the present economy , about politics , and about possibilities for change if such is required .Such interchange of thoughts and ideas may be on the realm of views at present , but hopefully , some more tangible action may result eventually .If we view the movement from this perspective , it seems to be gaining some solid ground .One other interesting facet of the Occupy movement is the absence of leaders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "People on the internet help to spread the word , even if they are not physically present in the quiet demonstrations .There is no vital hierarchy of leaders and almost anybody who shares the same sentiments is allowed into the so - called \" tent .\" One other effect of social media is that people from other countries tend to sympathize with people of other nations and their situation in a show of unity and team spirit .Issues affecting people of one nation become real to people overseas as well .Detractors of the protest movement say that these protests \" encroach on other people 's rights .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even the complaints of violence by council members were countered by the general observation that there was no violence at all until the police descended on the group and drew force on them .Many individuals fail to see the violence in disobeying a call to leave the premises ; this is what is referred to as civil disobedience , a phenomenon accepted by and large as part of history .As to the comments that the protesters have had their week - long chance to air their views , sympathizers comment that the right to assemble and to speak freely has no set schedules .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "THIS IS EXACTLY RIGHT ! ! !They may be more edified and enlightened by this action compared with the endless and dreary debates that go on and on in the parliament - taking more than the week given to the protesters .According to its members , the Occupy movement allows people to give vent to their feelings .It gives them a venue for expressing their discontent .It allows them the option of sharing their thoughts with other people , and the possibility of coming across solutions which might work .All they ask for is the freedom to their voice , and a little space to converge in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
