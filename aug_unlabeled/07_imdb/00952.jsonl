{"text": "Top critical review .I bought this spur - of the - moment , but on reflection I wish I had n't .This may be a cult film for some people but it did n't really deliver properly , for my liking .I enjoy the nostalgia of 80 's films and Sci - Fi , and thought this might be good .Sadly , it did n't live up to expectations , despite an imaginative and ambitious script .Lifeforce tries to take on too much , as a piece of British Sci - Fi action / drama .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only redeeming feature is the relatively unknown actress Mathilda May , who plays a naked space vampire ( yes , the plot is on that kind of level ) .What the film obviously lacks in a coherent script , she almost makes up for with an amazing figure ( esp .her breasts ) .That may keep us guys watching , for a while .But at 151 minutes , this film seemed just a bit too long , for something that was muddled from the start .Premise : astronauts discover dormant alien vampires in a spaceship , hidden in Haley 's Comet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is done when Mathilda May drains the lifeforce out of various unsuspecting men , during a few soft - porn moments .The vampires reach earth and infect / control / kill and zombie - fy everyone .In the end lead astronaut ( Nicholas Ball ) manages to withstand May 's seductive powers ( sort of ) and helps destroy her ship in a desperate save - the - earth - from - complete - destruction type scenario .There are some good moments ( a burning City of London , dessicated human husks - poor souls who 've had the life force drained from them ) who scream and stagger and blow to bits , after May has had her way with them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But overall the film is n't as good as the likes of David Cronnenberg 's 80 's classic ' Scanners ' or as watchable as Stephen King 's ' Cats Eye ' .Both of those DVD 's are worth getting instead of this one .Danny Boyle was not the first person to realise that zombies can run like the clappers .That honour belongs to Lifeforce , which is , of course , the greatest naked space vampire zombies from Halley 's Comet running amok in London end - of - the - world movie ever made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There was a problem loading the comments at the moment .Please try again later . \" Lifeforce \" boasts a rousing , thunderous score by Henry Mancini , it boasts some hilariously straight - faced acting , some very proficient visual effects and a generous helping of most agreeable soft porn .You could do much , much worse than check out this movie .Is it a bad movie ?Maybe , maybe not .Depends on your poison .But it is unquestionably an enjoyable movie .That is where the glorious destruction of London comes in , later on in the proceedings and very well handled for a film that endures a reputation for being amongst the worst ever made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The fact that they play this trash so seriously is one of the fun aspects .Oh , come on - it 's trash .But it is glorious trash .It is proud trash .Trash is sometimes good , and here you have an example . \" Lifeforce \" , the celluloid Big Mac - of no nutritional value whatsoever , but very , VERY enjoyable .Tuck in .There was a problem loading the comments at the moment .Please try again later .Lifeforce has always divided it 's audience since it 's release .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That said , the film certainly has its followers and if you are one of them this new blu ray will delight you .If you are not - well - however good the transfer , this rather dated tale of \" sexy \" \" vampires \" on the loose in London wo n't appeal !So what I 'm reviewing is the quality of the blu ray on offer , here is my take on the technical spec . of the new disc .Arrow offers a fine AVC encoded 1080p transfer in an expansive 2.35:1 . format in which Hooper oversaw both the restoration and transfer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is no evidence of digital messing around either so that clear , but unobtrusive , grain remains .Any softness - and there is some - I 'm sure comes from the source material .There is a lossless DTS - HD Master Audio 5.1 and a 2.0 track .The 5.1 track provides some stunning immersive effects and does full justice to both the dialogue and Henry Mancini 's ( very untypical ) score .Undoubtedly both spectacular and sexually explicit , this horror romp - vaguely reminiscent of Nigel Kneal meets Paul Raymond - wo n't please everyone , but few can disagree over the excellent quality of these two new transfers and the extensive and impressive extras on offer too !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Please try again later .Gentleman , disregard that last remark , this is a B Movie situation .Sorry I just had to say that , it 's a B+ or A- movie in my eyes .This movie has it all , science fiction , horror , space vampires , zombies and an alien woman who has not quite grasped the need to wear clothes .Based on Colin Wilson 's \" The Space Vampires \" , a massive alien ship is found hidden inside the tail of Halley 's comet , the surviving humanoid inhabitants are brought back to Earth and mayhem ensues .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sure there are lots of cliches like that and plenty of macho behaviour here but on the whole it works for me .I especially love the creature 's transformation at the end .This movie has had more than its fair share of bad reviews but there are many people who appreciate it .Thanks for the re - issue as my VHS version was showing its age .Presented in widescreen so you miss none of the action , the only negative point in my view is the lack of any extras .Possibly the only place you will hear the words \" Mission Control Great Britain \" uttered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Please try again later .Lifeforce ' is terrible .Almost .Actually , it 's quite good fun .And terrible .Work that one out for yourself .It 's one of those films that tries to be really great , as if it has aspirations that it 's going to be the next ' Godfather ' film , only to end up being more akin to ' Flash Gordon . 'It kind of reminds me of ' Species ' - a film about a beautiful naked alien woman running amok through a city and generally killing helpless ( and horny ) males .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like I say , Lifeforce thinks it 's dark and mysterious and going to be the next ' Alien ' movie , yet it never quite manages it .The dialogue is cheesy , the special effects not that special and its main selling point is the fact that the lead actress spends her time in a state of full undress .But it tries .And , in some way , that kind of makes up for its failings .You ca n't help but feel kindly towards the film because it really does its best to live up to what it wants to be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Once they board it , they unleash a trio of hungry alien vampires upon England .Now it 's up to the only surviving American space pilot from the mission and an SAS colonel to hunt her down and stop her sleeping her way through the nation 's men .It 's the kind of film where you have to ( a ) know what you 're getting and ( b ) be in the mood for .If you 're expecting an epic sci - fi drama which is truly terrifying and/or you 're hoping for action aplenty , then you 're probably better off watch one or other of Alien or Species .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Heck , even if you took away the hot naked alien chick , I would still love Lifeforce .What 's not to like ?How can you not have a good time watching this movie ?The film opens with an ESA spaceship called the HMS Churchill arriving for a scientific rendezvous with Halley 's Comet , but the mission changes when a huge artificial structure is detected within the coma of the interstellar attraction .Exploring the mysterious craft , the space explorers find a huge number of desiccated , bat - like aliens - and three perfectly preserved humanoid specimens , one of which is the gloriously naked Mathilda May.", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The ESA has to ask NASA to explore the seemingly derelict ship , but all they find are the three undisturbed alien bodies amidst a scene of burned - out destruction .The mystery of these alien creatures increases exponentially when the hot , naked alien chick suddenly wakes up , turns a security guard into a stunt double for the Crypt Keeper with one hell of a kiss , and escapes .She may be gone , but she 's certainly not forgotten , as scientists , SAS agent Caine ( Peter Firth ) and a government minister ( Aubrey Morris ) observe her victim wake up on the autopsy table and suck the life force out of a doctor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A few answers become available when an escape pod comes to earth carrying the only survivor from the Churchill , Carlsen ( Steve Railsback ) .Railsback tends to overact quite a bit in a scream - happy kind of way , but he does have a mysterious connection to the hot naked space vampire ( who , regrettably , not only dons clothes but completely different bodies as she seeks to escape detection ) .Things really heat up from this point on , especially when the not - so - derelict alien spacecraft leaves Halley 's Comet and starts heading toward Earth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you like screaming , you 'll enjoy the efforts of Steve Railsback and Patrick Stewart in this department , but I think most viewers ( especially male viewers ) will agree with me that Mathilda May pretty much makes the movie .And I for one think the special effects are pretty impressive with the one exception ( maybe all of the special effects guys were sick that day and Tobe Hooper did that one himself ) .Hats off to Tobe Hooper for this cinematic effort , as it is the kind of film you can enjoy over and over again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Now , it 's perfectly within the realms of possibility to take on that much and succeed ; but when it 's approached in so po - faced a manner as it is here , the results can easily slip towards - well - the laughable .It 's such a shame in a way , because so much of it works .The film looks great even by modern standards ; the FX are by and large very impressive .But the writing and acting ... it 's putting it mildly to say it leaves a lot to be desired .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the hands of a more cerebral director - Cronenberg or Verhoven maybe - it might have worked .Sadly , this film is as good an indication as any as to why Hooper 's career nosedived the way it did .On the plus side - Mathilda May.Also - Mathilda May.And , in addition - MATHILDA MAY .Good God Almighty , she is so gorgeous , so built , and so wonderfully naked , it beggars belief .Not only that , but she actually embodies her character perfectly , something her male counterparts ( clothed and otherwise ) totally fail to do .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If anything saves ' Lifeforce ' from being a total loss ( for hetero males and gay women , at least ) , it 's her presence .Is that enough ?You be the judge .As FX - driven semi - erotic sci - fi horror melodramas go , there are worse - the ' Species ' sequels , for instance - but this is the ' Cleopatra ' of the genre .It 's absurd , it 's over the top , it takes itself far too seriously - yet there 's something oddly captivating about it , something hard to define ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Please try again later .As a Sci - fi fan born in the early 90s I know the charms of Silent Running , the influential magnitude of Mertroplis and I even know how Soylent Green is made .These are great science fiction films that even if you were n't born when they were released all sci - fi fans know of them because they are cult classics and will always have an active fanbase .So how come so many people including myself have never heard of Lifeforce .Perhaps it 's the crappy title ( though it 's an improvement over the original source called Space Vampires ) which sounds like a Yoga instruction video but this film is a classic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
