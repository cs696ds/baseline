{"text": "In a welcome change of pace , Sandra Bullock ( \" Miss Congeniality \" ) stars not in a lightweight romantic comedy , but in a smart , tight , twisted mystery thriller that takes some of its cues from the historic Leopold & Loeb murder case .Barbet Schroeder , director of psychologically astute films such as \" Reversal of Fortune , \" \" Single White Female \" and \" Maitresse , \" brings incisive , cerebral substance to \" Murder by Numbers .\" It 's set in an upscale Southern California community , where two bored , disaffected students ( Ryan Gosling , Michael Pitt ) decide to kill someone just to commit the perfect crime and get away with it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She 's well paired with Ben Chaplin , who 's cast as her straitlaced , less experienced new partner .The cops ' forensic chess game with the dastardly kids is exhilarating , and an awkward Hitchcock homage as endgame ca n't sully what goes before .But they 're channeling it . \"Murder by Numbers \" crosses Leopold / Loeb with a police procedural and adds an interesting touch : Instead of toying with the audience , it toys with the characters .We have information they desperately desire , and we watch them dueling in misdirection .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ben Chaplin is Sam Kennedy , her by - the - book partner , the kind of cop who gets an A for every step of his investigation but ends up with the wrong conclusion .Paired against them are Richard Haywood and Justin Pendleton ( Ryan Gosling , from \" The Believer , \" and Michael Pitt , from \" Hedwig and the Angry Inch \" ) .These are two brainy high school kids , fascinated as Leopold and Loeb were by the possibility of proving their superiority by committing the perfect murder .Their plan : Pick a victim completely at random , so that there is no link between corpse and killers , and leave behind no clues .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Cassie and Sam are assigned to a creepy case ; the body of a middle - aged female has been found in a wooded area , and close analysis of clues ( hair , strands from a rug ) seems to lead back to a suspect .Sam is happy to follow the clues to their logical conclusion .Cassie is n't so sure , and a chance meeting with one of the young sociopaths leads to a suspicion : \" Something 's not right with that kid .\" We learn a lot about police work in \" Murder by Numbers , \" and there 's a kind of fascination in seeing the jigsaw puzzle fall into place , especially since the audience holds some ( but not all ) of the key pieces .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Richard and Justin are smart -- Justin smarter in an intellectual way , Richard better at manipulating others .The movie wisely reserves details of who did what in the killing , and why .These are affluent kids with absent parents , who are their own worst enemies because their arrogance leads them to play games with the cops to show how smart they are .They 'd be better off posing as vacant - headed slackers .It is Cassie 's intuition that the boys are inviting her attention , are turned on by the nearness of capture .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A janitor is the obvious suspect ?Arrest the janitor .The movie has been directed by the versatile Barbet Schroeder , who alternates between powerful personal films ( \" Our Lady of the Assassins \" ) and skillful thrillers ( \" Single White Female \") .When the two strands cross you get one - of - a - kind films like \" Reversal of Fortune \" and \" Barfly .\" Bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability , creating a character you 'd like to like , and could like , if she were n't so sad , strange and turned in upon herself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Plus , she sang the Oscar Mayer Weiner song and kissed Sylvester Stallone in Demolition Man , a one - two punch that precious few might have managed .Murder By Numbers .Cast : Sandra Bullock , Ben Chaplin , Ryan Gosling , Michael Pitt , Chris Penn , Agnes Bruckner .( Warner Bros. )US theatrical : 19 Apr 2002 2002 .But still , after stealing the show in Speed , being lumped in with Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts , well , it must get frustrating if you feel like you have something else going on ( and you know she does ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( That said , no one can say what dementia possessed everyone involved with Speed 2 . )And even if you overlook the awful Gun Shy ( 2000 ) , it 's worth mentioning that she executive produced it and the decently melodramatic Hope Floats ( 1998 ) and produced Miss Congeniality ( 2000 ) , one of her biggest successes .( Bullock is also currently executive producing tv 's George Lopez Show , which only underlines that she has more on her mind than lifelong Sweetheart Stardom . )Murder by Numbers ( which again , and no coincidence , Bullock also executive produced ) revisits and refits the combinatory strategy , but times two .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Still , the movie goes predictably overboard to underline their pathology .Their similarities , no surprise , are matched by their differences , and so , tensions arise .Justin is the behind the scenes brain , always researching ( and even reads books , which he burns , sensationally , to destroy \" evidence \" ) .Richard is the out - front \" star , \" seducing , cajoling , performing because he loves to do it and always wins .In their lair , a house up on \" the bluff \" miles from nowhere , they frame and revere a digital composite portrait of themselves as one person .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's the chanting and the embracing though , that secure their place as Leopold and Loeb Lite , with a few additional edges to make them look \" contemporary , \" more Columbineish than Bates Motelish .For one thing , they know they can be profiled and tracked by forensic evidence , and would never do something so sloppy as leave a pair of glasses at the body - dump site .They go one more step , beyond leaving no evidence : they leave \" counter - evidence\"-a carpet fiber , a baboon hair - in order to thwart the lab team .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just so : Justin and Richard 's \" contemporary \" lies primarily with their understanding of technology and process , more or less common knowledge for anyone who watches tv or surfs the web .They 're like the rest of us , unprofiled .Clearly , Justin knew to do his research because he 'd seen a few episodes of C.S.I. or something like it .And their primary gimmick would be great tv : when committing the murder , they wrap themselves up in plastic , like Ethan Hawke in Gattaca , to keep from dropping incriminating skin cells and hairs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the peculiar universe laid out in Murder By Numbers , such refraction - of time and motive , fear and desire - makes a certain sense .The kids have no parents to speak of ( Justin 's mom appears to be propped up in the living room at one point ) , Cassie orders up lab tests on ill - gotten garbage without even a nod to , say , protocol or legality .It 's probably best not to look too closely at just how all this works .Cassie keeps calling him \" Vice , \" because that 's the department from which he 's just transferred , and after a while , the name just seems to fit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's not that she 's mean or selfish , no way .She 's not even a knock - your - socks - off performer .It 's that she 's more compelling to watch than most all her costars .I mean , she even gave Benjamin Bratt a run for his money .Cassie 's more vibrant relationships by far involve Justin and Richard , which naturally makes her a megathreat the boys must destroy at all costs .But the film is n't about solving the case ; it 's about solving Cassie .So , while snarky Richard pushes her personal buttons ( she 's got a dark secret that starts getting telegraphed early , in echoey sound flashbacks and deeply shadowed visual ones ) , Justin beguiles her with his vulnerability .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
