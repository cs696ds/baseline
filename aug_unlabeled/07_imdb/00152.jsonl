{"text": "What Joss Whedon 's Dollhouse can teach novelists about hooking readers .As is wo nt to happen when the two of us hang out together , the conversation turned to pop culture .Specifically , the new Joss Whedon project Dollhouse , starring Buffy the Vampire Slayer alumnae Eliza Dushku .Now , if you follow pop culture in any way , it 's no secret that Dollhouse has been a project fraught with problems .Several versions of the pilot were shot , screened and subsequently scrapped after test audiences came away confused or - worse - bored .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And viewers said \" Meh . \"And viewers said \" It 's boring . \"And viewers said \" This is gon na tank . \"Whedon assured viewers and critics that the show would really get going about seven episodes in , and that they just needed to stick with it .Sure enough , this past Friday , the seventh episode aired and it was a doozy , everything a Joss Whedon fan could hope for .The show 's premise finally seemed to come together .And this was precisely Andre 's problem with the show : that it took seven hours for the pacing of the show to start working .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Because the fact is most viewers are n't going to stick around long enough to make it to that seventh hour .Who has that kind of time to invest ?So most of the potential audience for Dollhouse probably tuned out about four episodes ago .Ideally , a new television series need to hit the ground running in the pilot episode , or the ratings will drop each week to the point that the network has no choice but to yank it mid - season .A couple of great pilot episodes that worked ?The pilot for ER , which ended with Julianna Margolies ' character attempting suicide .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The average teleplay is about 60 pages long for a one - hour episode .So the writer has 60 pages , more or less , to grab the viewer and make them want to continue the journey for the rest of the television season .And guess what ?As a novelist , you get about the same number of pages to grab agents and editors before we put your manuscript down and move onto the next one .Your writing may be gorgeous but if you ca n't grab us as readers , we simply do n't have the time to be spending 120 , 150 , 200 , 250 pages with your story in the hopes that it 'll get better somewhere down the line .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "We can not , however lofty our ambitions , get away from the fact that this is a commercial business ( and that is not a bad word ) .The main problem I have with Dollhouse ( other than the execrable third episode ) is that I do n't care about the main character at all .The only thing that has kept me watching - aside from the fact that my husband turns it on - is the minor characters , all of whom seem to be better actors than the lead .Much like novels , if the person I 'm supposed to be rooting for is n't worth my time , I 'm not going to get invested in her / his story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But that 's not the case with Dollhouse .Echo is the most boring , pointless character to shove down our throats for more than one episode .She 's a different person every episode , so you ca n't connect with her .The characters I cared about more were ones who hardly showed up on screen ( the cop primarily ) .So , what you end up with are four episodes ( for me ) of \" interesting concept , but about sick and tired of Echo and the repetitive crap \" running through your head .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "To those governing the decision from ABC to end the iconic soap operas ' All My Children ' and ' One Life to Live ' , please seriously consider what I have to say before you follow through on this heartless and cold resolution .ABC has been Blessed to be at the top of network viewership for an unbelievable amount of years .I will agree , you have some good shows on ABC , but remember , the number one watched show in the universe is about to leave .Yes , I am referring to ' THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
