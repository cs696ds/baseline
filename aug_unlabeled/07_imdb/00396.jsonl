{"text": "WHEN AN Arthur Miller drama is playing , not just the actors have their marks chalked out for them .Everybody in the audience knows just where to stand , too .Death of a Salesman enjoys its status as a classic because it addresses discontents no playwright of the era had dared to mention .But is it a good play ?Can it be , when we all come out of it so certain of ourselves , so reassured that we would n't have fired Willie Loman ?The film Focus , based on an early novel by Miller , may look like inferior , justly forgotten work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's still room for ambiguity even in plays about morally unambiguous situations -- in real life , it 's damned rare to be in a completely unambiguous situation .Unfortunately , there 's nothing but cut - and - dried morality in Focus , which seems meant to be screened in a high school class on tolerance .After Sept. 11 , we 're all supposed to be sitting in that high school class ; expect this film to be heralded by the nation 's critics as a much - needed lesson against prejudice .Focus is badly dramatized , and it 's old material from a writer just starting out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You ca n't just throw away the peel ! \" William H. Macy plays Larry , a man with an orderly , happy life and a good job during the middle of World War II .He lives in a clean , decent suburban New York City neighborhood .When he gets a new pair of glasses , he instantly loses his job .The glasses keep him from making a front - office impression , or so his boss says .The real problem , we learn , is that the glasses make Larry look Jewish .These spectacles also arouse the suspicions of his viciously anti - Semitic neighbor Fred ( played by the artist formerly known as Meat Loaf , and now billed as Meat Loaf Aday -- meat loaf a day is enough for any man ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Larry ca n't find a new job , except , finally , with a Jewish employer .At his new office , he remeets Gertrude Hart ( Laura Dern ) , a girl he once refused to employ , ironically because he thought she looked Jewish .A romance awakens the further anger of the neighbors who suspect Gertrude of being a Jew .Finklestein ( David Paymer ) , the corner newsstand operator , is attacked .Paranoia increases .The pressures on Larry are represented fancifully in fantasy sequence of the gears of a merry - go - round clashing and grinding .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The novel Focus was published in 1945 , but it 's obviously set much earlier .Was first - time director Neil Slavin aware of the difference between the decades ?It was very easy to get work during the war , since so many men had been drafted .And why would Larry have had to go long hard miles to find a Jewish employer in Manhattan ?( Focus might have been more logical if it were set in Indiana instead of New York City . )Moreover , Coughlin had ended his career as a Jew - baiter by the middle of 1940 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Focus might have had resonance if , as in Kafka , there 'd been no name or no reason for why the oppressed couple were suddenly shunned .The ending of the film confuses this point : we 're not completely sure that Larry and Gertrude were actually passing for Christian .I 'm a gentile .I realize no gentile has an idea how insidious anti - Semitism is .Still , in this drama , it 's as if Gertrude and Lawrence were dropped in from Mars , as if they had never heard that Jews were shunned , hated or restricted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
