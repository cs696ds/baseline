{"text": "Great actor .Meredith is the poo !That 's all there is to it .I 've since noticed her on other shows , a small stint on Friends , a minor role in Daredevil ... but god damn Meredith is the key .She 's beautiful , talented , and Grey 's would n't actually be GREY 'S without her .She may not be the easiest character to define , she 's dark and twisty , she 's died , she 's gone through more stuff than anyone actually show on a show .But it 's her cute little side smile , the raspy voice she uses , and the way she voiceovers the beginnings of every show that makes me want to believe everything she 's saying .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She 's brilliant , she 's talented and she 's gorgeous .....She 's the Grey in Grey 's Anatomy !I 'm such a huge fan of Ellen Pompeo .I first saw her on Grey 's Anatomy and have been a huge fan ever since .Grey 's is my all time favorite show and Meredith is my all time favorite character !She gets such difficult storylines and always manages to give brilliant performances .She is the Grey in Grey 's Anatomy ! !She is also so pretty , she looks so sweet and i seriously love her hair ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I still ca n't get over her performance in \" Some Kind Of Miracle \" .That was definitely not an easy thing to do and she was absolutely amazing ! !She has that ability to really connect with audiences ; when she cries it makes the audience want to cry , when she laughs it makes the audience laugh .Overall , she is a brilliant , talented and gorgeous actress and I love her in Grey 's Anatomy !Ellen Pompeo 's brillaincy ... .Although it took her most recent role as Dr. Grey , to really propel her as a household name , her sheer intelligence and ability to committ to any role has magnetically drawn fans from all over the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not flat , barbie doll - replicas but characters with deep emotional history 's that she pulls off so well .The way she acts leaves no doubt for viewers to understand the complexities of each role .She committs so fully , so perfectly that the fictional becomes more real than some of the people in your own life .( Although fans should proabably be aware , she ISN'T ACTUALLY A DOCTOR , so she will not be able to diagnose your symptoms ... perhaps see your local GP ) .Of course always to the credit of the amazing writers out there , but her scenes make you shiver in fear , laugh out loud and cry like a baby .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Her raw talent is something not easily attributed to some of the well known stars of Today .Some people may be critical of her , but there is something in the manner of her talents that you ca n't associate to others .For me , that exists in the realness she gives to her charcters , like you can go to a mail room and see her sorting mail , or pop into your local hospital and find her working there .It 's the unrehearsed feeling you get when watching her , her character is unpolished like everyone in this world , yet her actual acting is flawless .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
