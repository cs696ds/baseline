{"text": "Both comments and pings are currently closed .5 Responses to \" SciFi Classics 50-movie Pack , Disc 4 \" .I dunno ...I consider \" Santa Claus Conquers the Martians \" to be well - deserving of its Z - grade movie rep - it 's hilariously bad in the model of \" Attack of the Killer Tomatoes \" and that ilk .And according to IMDb , the movie was Pia 's first movie role , at the age of 10 .Maybe I was n't clear enough : SCCtM is , indeed , a really bad movie - I just was n't clear that it was intended to be as bad as it is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And yes , I 've watched both Attack and Revenge of the KTs ... and enjoyed them for what they were .Once .Disc 5 is , ta - da , four Hercules movies , with four different Hercules .Not sci - fi by any plausible reckoning , but 2/3 of the way in to the first one , actually made with some rudimentary Italian cinematic craft .I 'm glad someone likes the reviews ; I ca n't resist doing them .By the way , on our last cruise , the ship 's library had three or four of the 50-movie megapacks for loan , along with 300 - 400 other DVDs ( and 3000 - 4000 books ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now , I 'm the kind of person who takes \" They don\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 t get much stranger than this \" as an unequivocal recommendation .( Does anyone else have David Letterman 's voice running through your head now ? : \" Pia ... Zadora . \") Sounds like the Rocky Jones serial may have been an influence for the Brewster Rockit : Space Guy comic strip .The strip even has a kid named Winky .Ah , \" Santa Claus Conquers the Martians \" !That brings back a happy MST3 K memory of Santa 's space station ( ? ) workshop with a voiceover of \" Increasingly paranoid , Santa 's obsession with security made life difficult for his friends \" as a weird radar dish spins around .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
