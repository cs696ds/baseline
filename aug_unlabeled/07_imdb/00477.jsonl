{"text": "Found this movie on DVD .A great movie ans it should be available .One of many reasons I joined the Marines .This movie is a hidden / forgotten classic .For awhile if not still it was shown to all DI classes at Parris Island and San Diego .It also put the Marine Corps in a better light after the \" Ribbon Creek \" incidnet .It should be required viewing for all young men .If watched carefully it shows many important things about growing and reaching goals and the \" Leadership \" provided by the Drill Instructor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I Was There .I joined the Marines in 1966 .I was in the wooden barracks of the 2nd Battalion .The D.I. shows Paris Island and the instructors as they really are ; tough perfectionists who succeed in bringing out the best in Marine recruits .Jack Web captures this experience .When my platoon graduated our D.

{"text": "LT , USMC in a 10 year period , primarily because of my DIs .Thank you .Nostalgia for former Marines .A truly realistic look at \" boot camp \" at Parris Island .Motivational , informative and timely .When you can incorporate humor in boot camp but have serious motive ( sand flea ) you have accomplished many things that today movies lack .Think about making a point or plot in todays movies without the special effects and gore .As a former Marine , I personally think withholding this movie from the public is a marketing mistake !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A great inspirational movie .I saw it , and 11 years later started a 21 + year career in the Air Force .The scene where they have to locate the sand flea for burial and the recruits try to pull a fast one on the DI is excellent .He asks them whether it was male or female , they choose and obviously it 's the wrong choice , and have to keep on digging and searching for the right sand flea .I still remember that scene today .Hollywood Marine .OK , so I didn\"t go to P.I.", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But we would still identify with the Movie the D.I. with Jack Webb , the experience and with Jack Webb as the DI .I went through Boot Camp in 1959 and we expected our DI be be like Jack Webb .Was there ( P.I. ) in'57 .Jack Webb , made that movie so real it was perfect in all aspects , the interior barracks secnes were exact , a bit of history really as the WWII wooden barracks that were featured in the movie are now all gone .What you seen was what happaned , much more profanity was used at Parris Island in those days , but I guess it never would have gotten pass the censors in ' 57 otherwise accurate , only thing missing was the smell of the swamp .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
