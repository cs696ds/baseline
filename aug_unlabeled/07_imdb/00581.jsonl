{"text": "Author : Mark Hagger Publisher : IB Tauris Reviewed by : Marc Morris Price ( RRP ) : \u00a3 20 .Of all England 's medieval monarchs , William the Conqueror is the most unfairly maligned .Here was a duke of Normandy who mounted a successful seaborne invasion of the much larger and more powerful kingdom of England , who triumphed in one of the most desperate battles ever fought , and who held on to his prize doggedly despite repeated attempts to unseat him .Even contemporary Englishmen , whatever their other complaints , conceded that he had brought peace and security to the country .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Stir in the hoary old misapprehension that history is always written by the victors and you can discredit anything positive that contemporaries ever said about William .Judge him by the moral standards of our time rather than his own and you can convict him on any number of counts : brutality , war crimes , genocide .Every couple of years a little book appears on either William or the Norman Conquest and does just that .Mark Hagger 's new biography of the Conqueror , thankfully , does not .The author is a genuine expert in the field , and has no truck with those who try to condemn his subject out of context .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "More daringly , Hagger applies the same argument to William 's devastation of northern England during the winter of 1069 - 70 , the so - called Harrying of the North , arguing that \" his methods were entirely in keeping with the way that war was waged in his time \" .If Hagger perhaps goes too far here - the methods may have been unexceptional , but the death - toll was surely not - in general , his judgements are sensible and sound .Although one could quibble here and there on a particular point , his interpretation of events is convincing and his arguments academically up - to - the - minute .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Large sections are given over to discussions of the diplomatic , for example , or what William might have worn ; but there is no mention of his pioneering chivalry , or his opposition to slavery , or his crucial visit to England in 1051 .There are asides on the ordeals and curses employed by the medieval church , but no introduction to the history of Normandy or northern France to help place the Conqueror in context .The king 's relationship with his family is summarised in less than a page ; Harold Hardrada is mentioned only in brackets .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Once The Simpsons , a cartoon , had become the ultimate in contemporary comedy , many live action shows started to seem more like cartoons , defying the conventional sit - com 's limitations on space , time , and scenography .Meanwhile , South Park , Family Guy , and Comedy Central 's stable of programs continued to push the edgy envelope .Alternatively , there are anti - sit - coms that defy the laughs - per - minute formula in the other direction , preferring to be smart and observant rather than depend on jokes and gags .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All of these anti - sit - coms have in common with many TV dramas that they tell arcing stories that stretch across episodes and seasons , and this trend has suffused the formally traditional sit - coms too , the shows like Friends .All of these arc sit - coms shift some of the emphasis away from the comic situation and onto to the character 's ongoing romantic entanglements , and in doing so also shift the narrative emphasis to some degree against traditional , episodic sit - com storytelling .Weeds is another good example of a show in this mold .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My Boys 's P.J. is a baseball reporter , so her metaphors come from sports and are all subsets of \" life is a ballgame \" : having a new boyfriend is like signing a free agent slugger ; some players upset the clubhouse chemistry ; etc .Like many other anti - sit - coms , My Boys is a single - camera show with a voice - over but no laugh track .But its freshness is its restraint .Scenes play out over a minute or two as in shows from twenty years ago rather than the dozen seconds we often get on many anti - sit - coms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My Boys is also visually refreshing .Most unusual for a comedy , My Boys avoids the bright , high - key lighting that has been standard for decades , even in vanguard shows like Arrested Development .On My Boys , we often see shadows on one side of a character 's face ( as on P.J. 's , above ) , showing more contour and volume .Interiors are lit more like the domestic spaces on hour - long shows like Gilmore Girls than those on a typical half - hour show .This has an effect of realism and sophistication , and it effectively distinguishes My Boys from all the other sit - coms on television .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This might seem like a minor shift , but it is a notable departure in sit - com style .30 Rock likewise uses the cinematic single - camera approach with no laugh track , but it eschews voice - over narration .It 's a dysfunctional - workplace comedy with Fay 's Liz Lemon as the only normal person surrounded by \" characters . \"Like The Office , the comedy is often the product of absurd or deadpan moments as opposed to setup - punchline jokes .This is Simpsons - style humor , what writers sometimes call a 2 % joke : one that they expect most people to miss .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But it is short on cartoonish visual jokes , wacky musical stings , and ironic observations delivered in voice - over .It 's not that Scrubs and Arrested Development and Sex and the City went too far in exploding the sit - com form , just that by offering new , more restrained variations on the single - camera / no - laugh - track style , 30 Rock and My Boys now seem fresh -- at least for now .As a comedy about a self - possessed single woman in a big city who works in television and has to deal with an arrogant male boss , 30 Rock is in the tradition of The Mary Tyler Moore Show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The show - within - a - show on 30 Rock is semi - ironically called \" The Girlie Show \" but Liz Lemon is the antithesis of a girlie - girl , a point underscored in the episode in which her boss , Jack , mistakes her for a lesbian .My Boys and 30 Rock both have strong female leads , both of them women negotiating their way through a man 's world .Although these shows ' gender politics , which I find to be generally progressive , is not really the topic of this discussion , it 's worth noting that in both of these programs , a woman is the figure for our identification .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's refreshing to have women 's voices in half - hour comedies , and it 's a testament to the talents of Tina Fey and Betsy Thomas that their shows are succeeding in an industry dominated by men .2 comments : .Excellent meditation on the sitcom , mzn !I have been wondering lately about why I do n't like sitcoms anymore ...I have n't been able to bring myself to watch 30 Rock or Studio 60 .But I do think that there are a number of great funny shows of the past few years : of course , \" Chappelle 's Show , \" \" Reno 911 , \" \" Ali G. \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For me , sitcoms are fundamentally a working class form , deriving from the broad ethnic comedy traditions of immigrant entertainers .As such they are best as class - critical projects : comedies of manners that send up the idiocy of the bourgeois family and the capitalist workplace .It seems to me that Popular Fronters like Ernst Lubitsch , Preston Sturges , and Billy Wilder are really the patron saints of the sitcom . \"Seinfeld \" for all its \" about - nothing\"-ness was relentless in its fealty to this principle .To me , \" Friends \" was only ever convincingly funny when it drew comedic material from the most old - fashined sources : Joey 's Italian - American , Ross and Rachel 's Jewish heritage , and Phoebe 's dumb - blonde routine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
