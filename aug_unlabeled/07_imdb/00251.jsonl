{"text": "Elmer J. Fudd / Egghead is a cartoon character and one of the most famous Looney Tunes characters , and the de facto archenemy of Bugs Bunny .He has one of the more disputed origins in the Warner Bros. cartoon pantheon ( second only to Bugs himself ) .[ 1 ] His aim is to hunt Bugs , but he usually ends up seriously injuring himself and other antagonizing characters .He speaks in an unusual way , replacing his Rs and Ls with Ws , so \" Watch the road , Rabbit , \" is replaced with \" Watch the woad , wabbit ! \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In the 1939 cartoon Dangerous Dan McFoo , a new voice actor , Arthur Q. Bryan , was hired to provide the voice of the hero dog - character and it was in this cartoon that the popular \" milk - sop \" voice of Elmer Fudd was created .Elmer Fudd has since been the chief antagonistic force in the majority of the Bugs Bunny cartoons , initiating one of the most famous rivalries in the history of American cinema .The Bugs Bunny prototype drives Elmer insane .Later that year , he appeared in Friz Freleng 's Confederate Honey ( where he 's called Ned Cutler ) and The Hardship of Miles Standish where his voice and Egghead - like appearance were still the same .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the interim , the two starred in A Wild Hare .Bugs appears with a carrot , New York accent , and \" What 's Up , Doc ? \" catchphrase all in place for the first time , although the voice and physique are as yet somewhat off .Elmer has a better voice , a trimmer figure ( designed by Robert Givens , which would be reused soon later in Jones ' Good Night Elmer , this time without a red nose ) and his familiar hunting clothes .He is much more recognizable as the Elmer Fudd of later cartoons than Bugs is here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The rascally rabbit has the poor Fudd so perplexed that there is little wonder as to why Elmer would become a hunter and in some cases actually proclaim , \" I hate wittle gway wabbits ! \"after pumping buckshot down a rabbit hole .In Rabbit Fire , he declares himself vegetarian , hunting for sport only .[ 4 ] .Elmer was usually cast as a hapless big - game hunter , armed with a double - barreled shotgun ( albeit one which could be fired much more than twice without being reloaded ) and creeping through the woods \" hunting wabbits \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In Dog Gone People , he had an ordinary office job working for demanding boss \" Mister Cwabtwee \" .In another cartoon ( Mutt in a Rut ) he appeared to work in an office and had a dog he called \" Wover Boy \" , whom he took hunting , though Bugs did not appear .Several episodes featured Elmer differently .One ( What 's Up , Doc ? , 1950 ) has Bugs Bunny relating his life story to a biographer , and recalling a time which was a downturn for the movie business .Elmer and Bugs do a one - joke act cross - country , with Bugs dressed like a pinhead , and when he does not know the answer to a joke , Elmer gives it and hits him with a pie in the face .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The bunny asks nervously : \" Eh , what 's up doc ? \" , which results in a huge round of applause from the audience .Bugs tells Elmer they may be on to something , and Elmer , with the vaudevillian 's instinct of sticking with a gag that catches on , nods that they should re - use it .According to this account , the common Elmer - as - hunter episodes are entirely staged .One episode where Bugs \" lost \" in the hunting was Hare Brush ( 1955 ) .Here , Elmer has been committed to an insane asylum because he believes he is a rabbit ( though it is also revealed that he is a millionaire and owns a mansion and a yacht ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Bugs acts surprisingly ( for him ) na\u00efve , assuming Elmer just wanted to go outside for a while .Their hunt is cut short when Bugs is arrested by a government agent as Elmer Fudd is wanted for tax evasion .Elmer Fudd has occasionally appeared in other costumes , notably as Cupid .He tries to convince Bugs about love , but Bugs is reluctant , thinking to himself \" Do n't you look like some guy who 's always after me ? \" and pictures the Elmer in hunter 's clothes .The Cupid Elmer plots to get even with Bugs , using his love arrows to make Bugs fall in love with an artificial rabbit at a dog track .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The result is comic mayhem ; a steady game of one - upmanship that ultimately leads to matrimony .For a short time in the 1941 - 1942 season , Elmer 's appearance was modified again , for five cartoons : Wabbit Twouble ; The Wacky Wabbit ; The Wabbit Who Came to Supper ; Any Bonds Today ? ; and Fresh Hare .He became a heavy - set , beer - bellied character , patterned after Arthur Q. Bryan 's real - life appearance , and still chasing Bugs ( or vice versa ) .However , audiences did not accept a fat Fudd , so ultimately the slimmer version returned for good .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Comedian Robin Williams often refers to the impediment as \" Fudd syndrome \" whenever he accidentally slips up and replaces an ' l ' or ' r ' with a ' w ' sound in a word .Part of the joke is that Elmer is presumably incapable of pronouncing his own first name correctly .Occasionally Elmer would properly pronounce an r or l sound , depending on whether or not it was vital for the audience to understand what the word was .( For example , in 1944 's The Old Grey Hare , he clearly pronounces the r in the word \" picture \" . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There is no documented reason for Bryan 's absence , leaving some fans to speculate that he refused to cross the picket lines .Although in more recent years other voice actors have alternated as Elmer 's voice , Bryan 's characterization remains the definitive one .He was never credited onscreen , because Blanc had a clause in his contract that required him to receive a screen credit and , perhaps inadvertently , denied the same to other voice performers .Blanc would take on the role regularly in the 1970s and 1980s , supplying Elmer 's voice for new footage in compilation feature films and similar TV specials , as well as some all - new specials .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
