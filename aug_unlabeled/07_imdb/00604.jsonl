{"text": "This review 's title is from an infamous barroom soliloquy heard on that album .Peter Boyle as Joe is decidely not the jolly monster of YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN , and he 's far more acidic than Ray Romano 's dad on TV 's EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND .Joe Curran is a blue collared New Yorker who 's angry over the state of the world .When he gets a few beers under his belt Joe spouts hatred of blacks , hippies , social workers and even his own progeny ( \" I got a kid ... ahhh , screw ' i m !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Compton , a well - to - do businessman , has just done the unthinkable : he 's murdered his daughter 's junkie boyfriend after the guy caused Melissa ( Susan Sarandon , in her first movie ) to O.D. .Bill throws down a few stiff drinks and listens to Joe 's ranting diatribe .When Joe says that he 'd like to kill a hippie Bill slurs out , \" I just did . \"Thus , an unlikely friendship is forged , based on Joe 's desire to \" off \" a creep and Bill 's having done so .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They visit a macrobiotic restaurant , party with some kids and participate in an orgy .Ultimately , the story ends in an unforeseen tragedy for one of them .John Avildsen 's movie illustrates the dark , violent side of the Generation Gap .With an ongoing war in Southeast Asia and student protests that just a month before \" Joe \" was released culminated in the Kent State massacre , this film 's shocking conclusion seems almost predestined .Wow .What an awesome , unholy mess of a film this is .By the end of the film we 've seen loads more nudity and a fairly extreme massacre sequence , plenty more drug usage , angry and resentful middle - aged white guys and stupid good - for - nothing hippies , with lots of racial expletives thrown in for good measure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So the film opens with Frank and girlfriend Melissa ( Sarandon ) in their rundown apartment in Manhattan .Frank is a drug dealer and makes mockery of Melissa 's priveleged upbringing .They fight and Frank goes out to make some money for some big project he 's got - Melissa runs after him , after taking too much speed , apparently , and ends up passing out in a drugstore .Taken to a hospital , she 's cared for by her parents , advertising exec Bill Compton ( Dennis Patrick ) and Joan ( Audrey Caire ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They have a little interaction in which Joe talks about wanting to kill one of these worthless kids and Bill blurts out that he 's done it - but then quickly backpedals .The next day though , Joe finds out that a dealer was killed near the bar , and puts two and two together .He 's heard Bill 's name and finds his number , calls his office and a strange \" friendship \" gets started .JOE ( the movie ) goes in some interesting directions ; it would be logical to assume that Joe ( the character ) intends to blackmail Bill , but he assures Bill that he 's not interested in that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What Joe is in fact interested in is the bond that he shares with the wealthy and educated Bill - despite their class differences , Bill is every bit as conservative and hateful of the direction society is going in as Joe is .Or so Joe thinks - and so Bill is willing to pretend to be .They visit a hangout of Joe 's - then a hangout of Bill 's , where Bill talks about how stupid the people he works with are ; Bill and Joan come to Joe 's for dinner , and Joe shows Bill his extensive gun collection .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I guess it works if one thinks of it in allegorical terms - but the film on the whole is too deliberately and brutally realistic for that option to seem intended .Norman Wexler 's screenplay got an Oscar nomination ; I 'm not sure that was deserved though Peter Boyle definitely deserved some recognition here .Bobby Scott 's music is pretty nice , and director / cinematographer John G. Avildsen 's visuals of the various sides of wealthy and seedy Manhattan , and working - class Brooklyn are understated but very compelling .All in all this is a must - see for anyone interested in where America was at in ' 69 I think .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
