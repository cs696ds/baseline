{"text": "\"She expects upcoming issues to include features on Victor Fleming 's career , holiday movies , documentaries on DVD , and foreign films on DVD .Product Description .Product Description .John Steinbeck 's classic novel brought to the silver screen .Nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award in 1939 , \" Of Mice and Men \" features a moving Oscar - nominated score from legendary composer Aaron Copland .Amazon.ca .Truly one of the unsung triumphs of 1939 , this heartfelt adaptation of John Steinbeck 's morality tale of two itinerant migrant workers seems just as fresh and powerful decades after its release .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They both would be lost without each other in a rather mixed - up world .Sensitively directed by Lewis Milestone ( All Quiet on the Western Front ) , the film features the first pre - credit sequence in American film history .There 's also a nice score by Aaron Copland .--Bill Desowitz .Top Customer Reviews .Of Mice and Men unfortunately gets lost among other great films of 1939 such as Gone With the Wind , Stagecoach , Wuthering Heights and The Wizard of Oz .However this poignant portrayal of the Depression era West stands tall in its moral values and simplicity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The sharp minded leader George played superbly by Burgess Meredith has been looking after the dim witted beast of burden Lennie for years .He has crafted a scenario where they will accumulate enough money to buy a place of their own .He promises Lennie , who has a patholgic affinity for stroking soft things , that he will be able to tend the soft furry rabbits .Lennie makes George repeat their plans time and time again never tiring of the story .They find work on a barley farm but soon the uncontrollable Lennie gets into trouble and their plans get altered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Burgess Meredith once again proves that he is one of the greatest character actors to ever have appeared on the American screen .2 of 2 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .The America of the 1930s was a hodgepodge of geography , but the terrain that most movie audiences could relate to was either Tara from GONE WITH THE WIND or the bitter dust bowls of the parched west .Director Lewis Milestone perfectly caught this sense of dry dust mingled with human walls of self - constructed isolation in the filmed version of John Steinbeck 's OF MICE AND MEN .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Since America was not yet involved in Europe 's troubles , it was natural for Hollywood to focus on internal matters that reflected the dust that seemed to settle everywhere .Lenny Small ( Lon Chaney , Jr ) and George Milton ( Burgess Meredith ) symbolized the alienation between man and an uncaring society .Bindlestiffs like them existed only as punching bags for anyone with a grudge to settle .The only solution for forced isolation was to painfully build an enduring relation with someone who cared .As Lenny tells George incessantly about how ' I got you and you got me , ' the viewers could see that maybe he was right .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To George , land is physical ; it will provide security against the uncertainties of a dust bowl existence .To Lenny , land is internal ; it is more of a time than a place .It represents a time to pet rabbits and feel the closeness engendered by the proximity of those rabbits to George .Both are fleeing from the rape charges shouted out by a woman in the previous town against the hulking , dim - witted Lenny .All Lenny wanted was to pet a pretty thing .Both escape to find work on a ranch , but the loneliness that plagued them as a pair on the road they learn afflicts others too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "OF MICE AND MEN might have been written for the stage : it naturally falls into scene divisions , with a lot of its drama presented in dialogue .As the painfully pathetic Lennie , Lon Chaney , Jr. had the role of his career ( his WOLFMAN is decidedly a close second ) .Milestone soft - peddled Lennie to a considerable degree , and toned down a lot of Steinbeck 's violence , to say nothing of his profanity .The unique Burgess Merideth is fine as George while the underrated Betty Field does commendable work as the flirtatious Mae .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The greatest year ever for the movies was undoubtedly 1939 .Of Mice and Men was a member of the class of ' 39 and was also one of the ten films to be nominated for best picture that year .Competing against Gone With the Wind it had little chance of winning , but merely to be nominated that year was an achievement .Of Mice and Men is one of the great films and one of the best adaptations of a novel .Only The Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden can compete with it as an adaptation of Steinbeck .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It really shows the hardships of being a poor farmhand in depression era America and includes many details which give the setting authenticity .Burgess Meredith is wonderful as George while Lon Chaney Junior is a revelation as Lennie .Chaney is probably best known for his horror roles as The Wolf Man , but these roles do n't really show his acting ability .Only in his brief role in High Noon does he show the acting ability that is so clearly evident from his performance in Of Mice and Men .George and Lennie 's friendship and interdependence forms the heart of the film , but the film is also about loneliness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
