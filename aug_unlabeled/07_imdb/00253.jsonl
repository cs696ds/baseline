{"text": "And realizing that there will likely always be wars against bullies of all ages , I wanted to write a school - based coming of age story that also asks questions about war , about young and old bullies without giving the answers .Ultimately , this is a story about friendship , and the importance of facing and communicating your fears .Thank you for tuning in .I hope you 'll pick up a copy of SPANKY :A Soldier 's Son , for yourself or the 7 - 12 year old in your life .Or perhaps let me help you donate a copy to a military child .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've watched his career ascend like a missile .That success , his multi - cultural roots , plethora of talents , warm heart and slightly rebellious spirit bring an interesting angle to writing .Sue : You 've published four books , one a graphic novel , another in verse , and you 've been the recipient of literally dozens of awards including Coretta Scott King honors , ALA Notables , YALSA Top Ten and the IRA Lee Bennett Hopkins Promising Poet Award .You 're a magnet for MG and YA readers , particularly boys , and your selection of subject matter has touched on rather gutsy subject matter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Greg : It all starts with the gut .The gut never lies as far as I 'm concerned .We only get in trouble when we listen to our brain trying to justify another way out .So I 've learned to follow my gut on stories .Your gut is like having your own personal version of The Force .Follow your gut , Luke .If I have one so - called \" talent \" , I think it 's the ability to recognize a great story when I see it .And that 's all gut reaction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If I listened to my head , I would have been scared off to pursue any of the subjects I wrote about .A middle grade story about a gangbanger who kills a teenage girl and gets assassinated by two other teenagers for becoming a liability ?Yeah , right .But Yummy : the Last Days of a Southside Shorty ended up being my most popular and critically - acclaimed book .On every project I did and am doing , something unusual happened .I stumbled across a real life story so unknown and compelling that it had to be a book .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Black urban cowboys in Philly ?Whoa .Ex - cons saving young lives through chess ?Heavy .The disorganized crime world of surfing drug mules ?Outrageous .But here 's the thing- nobody else was writing about these things .So it felt like it fell on me to bring these worlds to life because other people needed to hear about these amazing stories too .Sue : So why use fiction then to delve into these real worlds ?Greg : Fiction is just the way it comes out .I collect so many different and compelling stories within a world that I need to find a vehicle that will allow me to pick and choose from all those different moments to get at a deeper truth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just like DJs sample music and remix it into something original , I sample life and remix it into a new story .Sue : So how do you decide to take that leap of faith on a new story ?Greg : Fortunately , the story decides for me .It feels like I have no choice - a story finds me , literally stops me in my tracks and wo n't let go until I write about it - even if I am committed to something else .That is the only way out .But I can always tell if it 's the right choice : the writing comes easy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sue : What has been your riskiest decision ?Greg : To buy back a novel that had already sold to a major publisher because the sale went against my own gut reaction .It was a mistake and the toughest thing I had to do was to break free from that untenable situation ( though it took a long time to realize it ) .There 's no one to blame , it just happens sometimes that things were n't meant to be even if you really wanted it to work .But sticking it out longer would have ended my writing - I think I would have quit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sue : Have you ever chucked a story because your gut told you to move in a different direction ?Greg : Yes , the novel I just finished came in the middle of a two year struggle on another book .The real incidents in the new story I came across were so powerful , my gut said I had to do it , even though technically , I was obliged to do the other .But it all works out in the end .Had I ignored the calling , I would have been twice as frustrated and had nothing to show for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Other times , you chuck the idea you had for the execution of a book .All my stories started off as the wrong thing in the beginning and became something else in the end : free - verse became a novel , a picture book became a graphic novel , a short story became a free - verse novella .So I 've had to chuck the initial idea I was trying to force on the story in order to accept the story as it wanted to be told .I 've come to learn that stories are like children : you might want them to become a doctor , but there 's no stopping them if they want to start a punk band instead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Greg : I told my agent that at least he will never get bored with me .Seems every project I do breaks some rule , but he has always backed me .Especially when things get tough .A good agent in like having your own therapist to keep you going and a henchman to do your dirty work when it comes to that .Sue : Would you give us a peek at your next projects ?Greg : Finished a free - verse picture book biography on the childhood of Johnny Cash , a book that took 10 years to happen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And with a few bold changes , it came to life again .That 's coming from Candlewick next year .Then I just finished the novel I referred to above which is going out to market as we speak .I am also finishing the writing on a new graphic novel called Grand Theft Horse about my cousin , a 60 year old Texas widow who stole a thoroughbred horse on Christmas Eve to save it from being raced to death .She became an outlaw - a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre , who learned the law at the library at night in order to beat a high powered LA attorney bent on ruining her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You 've been writing for years , developing ideas , learning the craft .You 've written a lot , perhaps several - perhaps more than several - novels .You 've drafted and redrafted .Worked with a writer 's group or a critique partner .You 've expanded your craft techniques by attending classes and conferences .You may have even completed an MFA .You may have sold books or have an agent shopping your work .But you still need time with other experienced writers to share and learn .You could use an intensive workshop geared directly to your level .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Owners Bethany Hegedus and Vivek Bakshi have restored and renovated a fabulous space that 's perfect for writers who need to converse , share and study all aspects of the writing craft .They 've got three workshops lined up for the year specifically geared toward the advanced writer .I was lucky to attend the year 's first workshop , Worlds Without End : Deconstructing Classic Children 's Book Characters led by new agent Alexandra Penfold .Alexandra gave two lectures and led the intensive workshop along with Bethany .The conversations were high level .The writing of fellow participants showed experience and practice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Alexandra 's lectures on characters were charming and funny , and I learned things to apply to my own writing right away .The space is not much like a barn .It 's clean and classy , filled with light and books and comfortable chairs .There 's always tea and coffee on , and the lunches served were wonderful and healthy .The screened in porch was spacious and looked out on a lovely tree - filled space .Vivek and Bethany have worked hard to make a place for writers to converse , learn , and engage in literature .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
