{"text": "After all these years , and growing up with Windows 3.1 , I have seen an entire evolution of computers and software .Touch screens and large resolutions were a pipe dream just 15 years ago .Now it 's the norm .Going from a Packard Bell ( yes , before HP ) that could n't run 3D Ultra Mini ... .A deeper shade of soul .Contrary to popular opinion , hindsight is n't always 20/20 .We look back on our past mistakes constantly , but we do n't always see the proverbial light and sheepishly admit that we were wrong .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sometimes it 's a little more like 20/80 , maybe with a slight astigmatism .When you review a video game , it 's pretty much impossible to take into account its long - term play value without consulting either a crystal ball or a wacko psychic , neither of which fits into our budget .Will a great game stand the test of time and get better with age , or will a better game come out and steal its crown ?It 's a tough question that no sane reviewer on the planet would dare to answer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We gave both Soul Blade and Soul Calibur an A- as opposed to a solid A. Then days turned into weeks , weeks turned into months and months turned into years , and somehow both games were nearly unrivaled .Did we undergrade these masterpieces ?We spent hours arguing over our grading policy , eventually realizing that , at the time , they were graded correctly .It was n't our fault no better fighters came out .We could sleep at night again .So when Soul Calibur II hit the GR doormat , we stared at it with a palpable sense of dread .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Would we defy our competitors and not simply shower it with unmitigated praise ?And who would be the guy to take it in the balls for the team ?The answers turned out to be : Yes .Yes .Me .For the record , Soul Calibur II for the PS2 , Gamecube and Xbox is a fantastic game , just about the best fighting game available ( with VF 4 Evolution running neck and neck ) .Its outstanding delivery is only equaled by its fun , engaging gameplay ; but we said as much about the two previous games .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The game follows very closely in the footsteps of its forbears .Once again , a gang of warriors are on a quest for the evil Soul Edge sword , which was defeated by the powerful Soul Calibur sword , and once again most of the plot makes little to no sense .But that ai n't why you 're here .You 're here for the gameplay , and Soul Calibur II serves it up in spades .You have high and low attacks , one kick and a guard , but combinations and directional pad moves lead to countless moves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The most significant additions to this year 's version are the new characters .Most of the fighters from Soul Calibur make a return in some form or another , so Mitsurugi maniacs ( like yours truly ) will find it a comfortable fit from the outset .The fencer Raphael is an intriguing new character , complete with lighting fast strikes and a smooth , flowing style .Talim is another Taki - type , a two - bladed speed demon .Yunsung is essentially an upgraded version of the missing Hwang , Tekken alum Yoshimitsu gets the SC treatment , and Cassandra plays like Sophitia 's little sister .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Plus there 's Necrid , Todd McFarlane 's offering , who has some cool moves but does n't really fit in stylistically with the others .Speaking of which , the biggest difference between the three home versions of Soul Calibur II is that each comes with an additional character unique to that console .The Gamecube is arguably the winner here thanks to the inclusion of Zelda 's geeky elf , Link , who comes equipped with all the bombs and arrows you 'd want .Xbox owners get another McFarlane creation in Spawn , who 's a pretty solid character and even has limited flying abilities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So who 's the best ?I would n't offer an objective answer to that with a ten - foot pole , but I personally lean towards Link since at least he 's a classic video game character and there 's a certain joy in finally getting to kick some major ass with him .And major ass you will most certainly kick in any of Soul Calibur II 's various modes .They 're all pretty much mainstays : Arcade , Time Attack , Survival , Team Battle , Vs . , Vs .Team Battle , and Practice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The main single - player mode is Weapon Master , which hearkens back to the Edge Master mode of Soul Blade .Here you fight your way across a giant map under a variety of circumstances .One mission might require you to smack an enemy only while he 's airborne ; another might feature enemies who heal or a ground littered with mines \" if you fall down , you die .You can switch characters at any time , so if you ca n't seem to beat one mission with creepy Voldo , you can give it a go with the nimble Taki .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The gold is used to buy new costumes , art and weapons , which then become available in other play modes .The weapons are supposed to imbue different attack , defense or range bonuses , but it 's mainly just window dressing .Gaining experience points increases your level , which does n't really mean anything aside from opening up the hard - to - reach hidden characters .While Weapon Master mode is a step up ( or rather , back ) from Soul Calibur 's Edge Master Mode , it can get repetitive and at times really difficult .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But when you grow weary , just call a buddy and whack away at the multiplayer .The computer AI is no slouch ( though not as good as what you 'll find in VF 4 : Evo ) , but the real life of any fighter is found with friends , and Soul Calibur II does n't disappoint .A case of beer and some 8-character VS .Team Battle makes for an excellent geek night .Soul Calibur 's graphics were a huge improvement over Soul Blade 's ( due in many ways to the power of the Dreamcast ) , and while Soul Calibur II is n't such a large a step , it still looks amazing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Watching some of the characters in their Exhibition Theater performances is like watching real life katas , particularly the demos for Raphael , Yunsung and Kilik .Each console system is rock solid in performance , though the Xbox features slightly smoother lines and a slightly steadier framerate .The PS2 is probably the worst of the lot , but it still looks terrific .You are n't going to be disappointed any way you go .However , this does n't extend to character endings , which , like Soul Calibur , is still cheesy text set against static pictures .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Why the change ?The sound , at least , remains great with a big , sweeping soundtrack and terrific sound effects .You can choose Japanese or English voiceovers , and I heartily recommend the original Japanese unless you 're in a B - movie mood .So for all intents and purposes , Soul Calibur II is a great game .It 's got all the goods you 'd expect , from solid gameplay to smooth presentation .But where the game comes up short is giving you things you do n't expect , and considering that the series is in many ways unchanged since it first hit the PSX back in 1997 , that 's a shame .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The arenas look okay , but after the multi - tiered levels in DOA or even just the neat snow effect in VF 4 , they feel a little stifled and dated .In the Weapon Master mode , you occasionally have to battle through \" dungeons . 'I was all excited at first , thinking this would be some weird new form of Tekken 's Force mode or maybe even a bit like the underrated Bushido Blade , but no such luck .Rather , they 're just a bunch of matches strung together against a smaller version of the big world map .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Upon turning it on for the very first time , I promptly beat Arcade mode in 7 minutes using my trusty Mitsurugui .In fact , some of the character demos and move lists are nearly identical to Soul Calibur ' s. Even two of the three unlockable bonus characters are just new skins on old move sets ; Berserker is astonishingly reminiscent of Soul Blade 's Rock , while Assassin is mostly Hwang in ninja gear .That 's how little things have changed .Depending upon how you think about it , that can be either a good thing or a not - so - good thing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
