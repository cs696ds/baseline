{"text": "Tag Archives : Discovering Daphne .Thanks to Simon lending me his library copy of Do n't Look Now and Other Stories on Monday ( after I was able to hunt out my own last weekend ) , I am able to conclude Discovering Daphne !This copy might have travelled some 200 miles from its home in Manchester , but within the pages of this short story collection I travelled much further , from Venice to Israel , Crete to Ireland .Penguin Modern Classics , 2006 paperback edition ( first published as a collection in 1971 ) , 272 pages - loan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I decided on a whim to read all the stories in a muddled - up order instead of one after the other , which I usually do .I feel it was rather apt to finish Discovering Daphne with the spooky Do n't Look Now on Halloween !Daphne du Maurier is a mistress of atmosphere and as she does in Rebecca where she takes the reader through the gardens of Manderley , she conjures the labyrinthine streets of Venice , romantic by day , haunting and oppressive by night .A couple are on holiday in this beautiful city , there trying to forget the loss of their little girl and mend their relationship , but the story takes a turn for the unusual when they bump into two strange old ladies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is a brilliant , chilling tale .Not After Midnight is about a schoolmaster who takes a holiday in Crete .Looking forward to enjoying painting the Mediterranean seascape , he finds that his peace and quiet is shattered by an over - loud American man , named Stoll who is staying at the same hotel with his long - suffering wife .As the story develops , the schoolmaster has a disconcerting feeling that something is not right on his idyllic island .When I first picked up this collection of stories and read Not After Midnight perhaps I was just not in the right mood because I found it a bit dull , but for some reason the second time around it really unsettled me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is a strange little tale and perhaps would lose something for a reader with no understanding of Greek myth but I really enjoyed it .In A Border Line Case a young aspiring actress , goes on a journey to Ireland to find an old friend of her recently deceased father .While on the Emerald Isle she is practically kidnapped by the locals and spends an unusual night with her father 's old comrade .I do n't want to give anything away but suffice to say this is one of the more shocking tales in the series !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I enjoyed the descriptions of Jerusalem in The Way of the Cross but was n't really gripped by the storyline .All the characters were horrible apart from poor hormonal Mrs Foster and pathetic Miss Dean .This does n't normally put me off but I think that perhaps there were just too many different personalities in a short story for me to really be invested in what was happening with them .The Breakthrough was a curious experimental piece - a mix of the spiritual and scientific ( something that du Maurier also plays with in The House on the Strand . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is also interesting to read because it was written much later than her better known novels , so feels quite modern .If you like a good scary story then it 's worth buying for Do n't Look Now and some of the others in the collection are just as dark if not more so .My advice is to make you 've got a nice cup of tea to take away the chills after reading this one .The Guardian also chose Do n't Look Now as a reading choice for October - you might enjoy heading over to read the comments and commentary here , or read this excellent review by Simon , my lovely Discovering Daphne co - host .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've been pretty busy lately and left my reading of the fifth Discovering Daphne choice rather late , but I 'm rather glad now that I did as my tardiness resulted in me sitting down to read it in a couple of long reading sessions .When my mind is bothered by the to and fro of everyday life there is something really wonderful about holing myself up with a book , and what better novel to consume within thirty - six hours , than the utterly mesmerising Rebecca ?I get a little anxious about re - reading much - loved books in case I find them lacking the second time around , but I need n't have worried .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For those that do n't know the plot of this famous book , I 'll try to summarise without giving too much away .Rebecca is written from the point of view of a young un - named woman who while acting as a companion to a rather tactless and sycophantic American woman - Mrs Van Hopper - is introduced to Maximilian de Winter .Our protagonist who is hampered by a crushing sort of shyness and self - consciousness about her youth which she believes makes her terribly unsophisticated and unattractive , however Maxim de Winter is drawn to her in part because of her sweet and innocent nature .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Rebecca is a beautiful and disturbing novel about jealousy , hatred and obsession .The narrator , in her innocence should almost be irritating , yet because as a reader I was let into every little moment of her experience , I understood her fears and her little fluttering moments of joy - I sympathised with her as a friend might do .One moment she is full of anticipation and the next minute her spirit is crushed .She adores Maxim and in seeking to understand his feelings for his dead wife her mind runs away with her into dark tunnels , not helped by the disconcerting and ever - present personality of Mrs Danvers who adds to the seeds of doubt in her mind .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps I thought , she is just looking for the new Mrs de Winter to step up and take charge , but after the fancy - dress ball I had to concede that she was simply cruel and twisted .Antique print of Menabilly , Cornwall - the inspiration for Manderley ( from antique - prints - maps . com ) .Perspective ...I do wonder , how Rebecca would be as a novel if it was told from the point of view of the other characters .How would Mrs Danvers tell the story ?How would Rebecca herself describe her life and relationship with Maxim before her death .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Apart from a fabulous and twisted plotline one of the things that I find so special in Rebecca it is the atmosphere that du Maurier creates .The way that she personifies Manderley , making it into a living and breathing thing .It is part of the narrator 's nightmares and her dreams .I revelled in the descriptions of the gardens and the beautiful images that du Maurier creates , yet , almost every sentence holds a counter - point , an edge of darkness : .The unusual blood red colour of the rhododendrons , associated so closely with Rebecca suggest passion , but also something uncomfortable and unnatural .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Reading these sinister and voluptuous descriptions I was completely drawn into the world of Manderley with our narrator and shared her simultaneous sense of attraction and fear of the place .I could go on forever about this novel .It is just so beautiful and absorbing , and also utterly unsettling because du Maurier fixes on the dark human fears and emotions that concern us all .As our narrator treads the thin line between perception and reality , so do we as readers question what is reasonable , who is right , and are reminded how slight the divide between happiness and ruin can be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of all her novels , I think this is the one that really gets under my skin and even though Jamaica Inn will always be my first love , I have to admit that I think Rebecca is du Maurier 's masterpiece .I 'll also be putting up my thoughts on the spooky Do n't Look Now and Other Stories tomorrow ( belatedly , but rather aptly on Halloween do n't you think ? )I contentedly spent the week thinking that I would dig out my copy of Do n't Look Now and Other Stories from the attic and tuck up with it over the weekend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fortunately Savidge Reads is coming to my rescue and will be lending me his copy when I see him tomorrow so that I can belatedly post about it .You can read his excellent overview of the collection here , and if you fancy reading my original post you can find it here .\" Curiouser and curiouser \" , said Alice famously , after descending the rabbit hole to Wonderland and drinking a mysterious draught from a flask .Unlike Alice , whose body becomes etiolated , in The House on the Strand it is our protagonist 's mind that is altered when he drinks a drug concocted by his professor - friend Magnus Lane , and ' curious ' would be my take on this unusual novel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He agrees to play guinea - pig in an experiment , testing a drug which appears to have the effect of transporting him back in time to the 14th century .Although Dick 's mind is transported his body remains in the present and as a result he traipses around the countryside oblivious to the existing surroundings until he inadvertently bumps into an obstruction .On each trip , he finds himself witnessing the lives of the people he finds there , in particular a woman named Lady Isolda Carminowe and a steward named Roger who he finds he is compelled to follow .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Vita becomes increasingly worried by Dick 's strange behaviour as he is drawn further into his medieval world .I found The House on the Strand frustratingly slow - going for the first half of the book and I did n't find myself wanting to pick it up much in the first few chapters .Firstly I was a bit unsure about the pseudo - scientific explanations that Marcus gives for why the drug takes Dick back in time ( although in hindsight , this may have been deliberate on the part of du Maurier ) .Secondly , I could n't get to grips with the medieval characters for some reason - compared to the people in the modern day they just did n't seem as real or as interesting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I did say on the phone to Savidge Reads today that I found it sad that Dick seemed to be missing out on enjoying the present because of his obsession with the characters from the past and that maybe du Maurier was making a point about this .Since reading Picardie 's Daphne , and a range of du Maurier 's writing I 've started to see more recurring themes in her novels .At times I felt that Dick 's escapism was akin to du Maurier 's own sense of affinity with other worlds , but I also thought that at times she projected a part of herself onto Vita , the wife left bemused by her distracted husband .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What a mixed - up character .So , hopefully you can tell by now that I became more and more intrigued by The House on the Strand as it developed .I ca n't say that I ever really got into the parts of the book that were set in the 1300s , but I really did enjoy the contemporary parts of the novel .It probably helped that I really curled up with the book properly today and became absorbed in it .It also helped that around page two - hundred , du Maurier starts to work her dark magic and embellishes the story with some nasty little twists and turns .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was delighted by Mary Anne .I was surprised , because although I always expect wonderful writing from Daphne du Maurier , I anticipated a tough read because it looked from the cover like a dense historical novel .What I discovered instead was a book , packed with with witty lines , and a richly described period setting which creates the backdrop for the story of a fascinating protagonist based on du Maurier 's own great - great - grandmother .She catches the eye of the Duke of York , who is beguiled by her beauty and wit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was completely absorbed by Mary Anne .Du Maurier writes her protagonist into life with such passion and skill , making it clear why she makes every decision and how these choices shape her journey through society .Despite being a single - minded social - climber , as a reader I forgave her her every mis - step and could n't but help admire her tenacity .Of course she also loves her luxuries , and it is this that actually keeps her always only a thin line away from destitution , but also drives her forward and furnishes her with the front she needs to keep moving up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Mrs Clarke The York Magnet - Image from The National Portrait Gallery website . \" Audacity first \" at times leads to disaster for those who have helped her along the way - for example the suicide of her first husband 's brother , who after some bad advice from Mary Anne , loses all of his money on the stockmarket .Mary Anne is not an angel by stretch of the imagination , but she is a warm and entertaining human being .Du Maurier lets the reader decide for themselves by simply showing Mary Anne in all her complexity as the story plays out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Courtesy of Madame Pickwick Art Blog .My favourite thing about this book is the humour that runs through it and the fact that Mary Anne never takes herself too seriously .I loved the little touches such as her seal on letters being Cupid riding on an ass , which must have come from real life .I loved being a party to her inner thoughts and observations of people , \" The creature stared at her .The expression was stolid , dumb worship .Could she be slightly mental ?Were the eyes a trifle vacant ? \" In fact there are so many passages that I would like to quote from this book that I would probably breach copyright if I put them all in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Daphne du Maurier evidently found the story of her great - great - grandmother fascinating , and although according to the introduction in my copy , she did n't feel as if she had done her justice I ca n't disagree more .It makes me wonder actually why on earth this has n't been picked up for a film or television series as it is really quite brilliant .As you can probably tell by now , I fall into the latter category and I love the fact that it is so different from her other novels and shows again , how versatile an author she could be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Or have I tempted you with my glowing review :) ?A trip to Hitchin , Herfordshire today ended up in a little Daphne discovery !The lovely friend I was visiting took me to this rather lovely bookshop : .Eric T.Moore Books is a wonderful treasure trove of a bookshop with a wide selection of used and antique books at very reasonable prices .It has plenty of nooks and corners to discover but books are well ordered ( really jumbled shops are a bit of a bugbear of mine ) .I went straight to ' D ' of course and found this little selection ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the end I restrained myself and picked up a copy of Rebecca as my Virago edition is buried in the attic somewhere until I have some shelf space !What do you think ?I ca n't decide if it 's terrible or so bad , it 's good ( has n't Savidge Reads done a post on naff du Maurier 's covers today ... ? ) , but for 50p I could n't really complain .On Wednesday I posted about the wonderful Daphne by Justine Picardie .If you 've read my review , you 'll know that I was completely absorbed by it , so can you imagine my delight when Savidge Reads bagged us an author interview with the lady in question ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What gave you that feeling , and did you yourself relate to the character of the young PHD student ?Yet at the same time , it seems to me that Du Maurier also identified with Rebecca - the woman who is at the heart of the novel , and whose name supersedes that of the narrator .When I wrote ' Daphne ' , I was intrigued by Du Maurier 's references to having discovered Tommy 's love letters , written during his former engagement , before his relationship with Daphne began .And like my narrator , and Du Maurier , I 'm compelled by the idea of hauntings , and their different manifestations - whether as literary ghosts , or otherwise ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What is it do you think about Daphne du Maurier 's writing that is so compelling ?For me , it 's her darkness ; her unflinching ability to look into our deepest fears and anxieties , as well as our passions .She 's a master ( or mistress ) of the gothic , yet reinvents the genre into something entirely her own .You chose to portray Daphne du Maurier in the later years of her life , although through her memories we do get a sense of her as a young woman .What made you choose to write about her at this particular point in her life ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Daphne starts out with the belief that Branwell Bronte has been mis - understood and hopes to find a hidden literary gem to reignite interest in him and prove that he was talented like his sisters .The character of Symington also identifies with Branwell .Do you think that Daphne felt somehow let down by Branwell , as she was by Symington ?I think she did feel let down by Branwell - as she was by her husband at the time , and by Symington .It was as if in rehabilitating Branwell , she had hoped to restore her sense of her husband as heroic , and therefore rescue their marriage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I find it interesting that although Daphne du Maurier was so inspired by the Bronte Sisters , she was so determined to resurrect Branwell .Despite the fact that she writes female characters that women can really relate to , your depiction of her seems to have had herself more of a closeness or understanding with men .Do you think this is a fair comment , and if so why do you think this is ?I think she has an intensely close connection with all her characters - men and women .One of her many talents as a writer is that her male characters ( including the narrator of My Cousin Rachel ) are as compelling as the women .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I also remember reading that the real life Christopher Robin was resentful of being the subject of the Winnie the Pooh stories .Why do you think these fictional characters had such a hold on the real life muses and do you think there is a difference if the likeness is self - imposed ( i.e. in the case of Rebecca ) ?Hmm , very interesting question , though I 'm not sure of the answer .Certainly , Daphne 's cousins , the Lost Boys , appear to have been haunted by their fictional counterparts in Peter Pan , and the long shadow cast by J.M Barrie 's writing ( though they were also traumatised by the death of their parents ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
