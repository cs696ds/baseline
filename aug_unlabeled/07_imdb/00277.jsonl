{"text": "In a movie like Jason X , the world of the victims is kind of jokey and plastic , but Jason is a sincere creation .The silliness of the victims ' environment translates well into a view that their lives are spiritually bankrupt and that Jason is justified in offing them .In A Nightmare on Elm Street : The Dream Master , Freddy Krueger spears and eats a screaming teen who 's trapped in the form of a pizza topping .In this instance , it 's Krueger who is ironically detached , and this attitude helps to accentuate his omnipotence , as well as the idea that he has defined the way the world will operate until these guys change it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not getting the basics of the genre right , Dark misapplies the humour .It should come organically from within the film , with the killer laughing at the victims or the victims laughing at themselves .In See No Evil , the humour comes from without , as Dark calls attention away from the characters and onto himself with cutesy visual gags .During the opening credits , there 's a high - angle shot of the protagonist ( Steven Vidler ) waking up in his bedroom .The ceiling fan is running in the foreground and its blades overlap the credits with every swoop .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
