{"text": "In honor of the return of our national pastime , here is my lineup of favorite baseball players from movies .A few rules before we begin : .Only fictional ballplayers on this list , so no Shoeless Joe ( there 's one exception , but I bet you did n't know he was a real guy either ) .You 've got to have speed at the top of your lineup , and Hayes has that .He lead the league in stolen bases , so you know that when he gets on the base paths , he 's a threat .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As his manager said , \" You may run like Mays , but you hit like s - t . \"He 's also got a bit of an ego , but hey , so did Rickey Henderson , and he 's in the Hall of Fame .With that much speed at the top of my lineup , I 'll take the little headaches and occasional dinky pop - ups that come with this guy .Batting second and playing third base , from \" The Sandlot \" , \" Benny The Jet \" Rodriguez !Your number two hitter has to be a guy with a speed who gets on base a lot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For crying out loud , he even steals home in the twilight of his major league career .Rodriguez is an asset in the field as well , as his sandlot buddies allowed him to play every position , so we can plug him in pretty much anywhere .Most importantly , the kid has great knowledge of the game , is maybe the friendliest guy on the team , and plays with a great motto : \" Man , this is baseball .You 've got to stop thinking .Just have fun .\" The guy in the three hole is our masher , our Babe Ruth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "OK , yes , he 's old .He 's missed the prime of his career .He 's been shot and almost killed !But he 's also got the most raw talent on the team .And you know the guy is clutch .When the season is on the line , who else do you want up there other than the guy who , even though bleeding , can still destroy a light stanchion with a home run ?You need your big home run hitter in the four hole .Crash Davis holds the minor league record for home runs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He 's also got leadership skills and an ability to bring out the best in young players . \"Nuke \" LaLoosh would have made this team if the rules were different , and as much of a positive influence as Annie Savoy was , it was Crash 's advice that got him to the majors , and would have gotten him on this team .He 's also a catcher , so he can relieve my next hitter when she needs a break .Batting fifth and catching , from \" A League of Their Own \" , Dottie Hinson !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I could have picked several of the ladies from this movie , or Amanda Wurlitzer from \" Bad News Bears \" , but Dottie is my girl , because she might be the best all around player on this team .She can flat out rake , which would be impressive at any position , but she 's a catcher , and a damn fine one at that too .She 's a natural team leader who also has a flair for the dramatic .It 's a rare combination when you have a player that is at the top of their game , but can also has leadership and showmanship .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the sixth spot , I could have gone with a little more power in Jack Elliott from \" Mr. Baseball \" , but instead , I 'm going with a veteran who still has a little bit of pop in his bat .Collins is the rare ballplayer who sticks with one team for a career , so you know the guy is going to be loyal .He 's also really cool under pressure .The guy is a lefty , and he almost hits a home run off of Randy Johnson in his prime during a one game playoff .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Batting seventh and playing second base , from \" Summer Catch \" , Mickey Dominguez !Second base is a tough position to fill on this team .While I 'd rather go with Marla Hooch , I 've got to follow my rules , so I go with the guy played by ...Fes ?I could make fun of Mickey Dominguez , but as anyone who knows baseball knows , the Cape Cod League , in which Mickey plays , is only for the cream of the college baseball crop .Just getting chosen to play is an honor , so Mickey 's got to be pretty damn good to just get in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Batting eighth , your short stop , from \" The Bad News Bears \" , Tanner Boyle !We 're at the eighth spot now , which is usually reserved for a guy who 's better with the glove than the bat , so I 'm willing to give up some offense .I guess I 'm also willing to give up a little defense .Heck , in this case , I guess I 'm willing to give up any ball playing ability whatsoever .But this is Tanner Boyle we 're talking about , 4 foot something of foul mouthed fire covered in long blond hair .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And batting ninth , playing left field , from \" Field of Dreams \" , Archibald \" Moonlight \" Graham !This guy actually existed .He did only played one game and had no at bats , and he did become a doctor in Chisholm , Minnesota .He gets the opportunity to hit against major leaguers , and hits a sacrifice fly to score a run .Moonlight rounds out a varied team that would have a chance to win a championship , if they actually existed .This is a Gravatar - enabled weblog .To get your own globally - recognized - avatar , please register at Gravatar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
