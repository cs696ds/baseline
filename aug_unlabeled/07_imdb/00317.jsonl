{"text": "Keep you on the edge of your seat throughout .Simply a really well - made good old fashioned haunted house ride with genuinely terrifying moments , great acting , great cinematography and a consistent and cohesive story .No cheap jumpsacres , only earned ones with tension and suspense and no CGI .Just a really good horror film .When it 's not trying to shove religion down your throat , the conjuring is actually a decent horror movie with a vibe that flicks back and forth between drama and horror , unfortunately , it does n't always work and the conjuring is slightly messy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This scene keeps the suspense and the scariness .There are two stories in the movie ; the first one is about Lorraine and Ed Warren , they are two paranormal investigators , both have a little daughter and they live in a nice house .Then , there 's the other story about a likable family who has experienced some paranormal events in their new home .It does n't matter how cliche it sounds , this is a terrific horror film .After the first 30 minutes or so , there are the first scares , all of them are very effective , unexpected and well executed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In addition , it is very similar in tone to ' The Woman in Black ' , both have a well handled suspense and an atmospheric setting .The performances were great , even the young cast was awesome .The most believable character in the film was Christine ( performed by Joey King ) , this girl was excellent .Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga were good as always , Vera 's character \" Lorraine \" was a bit surreal but her stunning performance made me believe in all of what she said .Also , Lili Taylor did an excellent job with her role throughout the film , she was amazing , especially in the chilling final act .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In spite of being a low budget film , it did n't use too much CGI , maybe just in a couple scenes , but everything looks great anyway .Its final act has some flaws , the exorcism scene has its ups and downs .However , I still liked it , this whole sequence is truly violent , a bit bloody and creepy .The acting was awesome here , Lili Taylor is such a great actress and she really looked like a possessed woman .I just ca n't believe that Wan directed this flick , most of his previous movies are quite average ; but this one , it 's a total blast .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

Expand .The Conjuring represents a member of an increasingly endangered species : the R - rated horror movie that relies more on suspense and scares than blood and gore .If I was to use a single word to describe The Conjuring , it would be \" intense .\" The pervasive aura of creepiness more than compensates for the low body count and inventive use of sharp instrumentation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By the time Carolyn brings in the Warrens to help , the situation has become serious with the inmates running the asylum .Wan is a master of manipulation and uses every trick available to him to ratchet up the level of tension .At times , he moves the camera in innovative ways ( there 's a nice little point - of - view shot that occurs when one of the girls looks under her bed ) , preferring long takes over short cuts .He often plays with the audience , establishing expected angles without the payoff only to have the \" money shot \" occur shortly thereafter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Joseph Bishara 's discordant score adds to the effect without becoming intrusive or overwhelming .CGI and practical effects are used but not overused - another indication that Wan knows what he 's doing .The Conjuring offers the right mix of jump - scare \" boo ! \" moments and mounting tension that creates an intense two hours .The ending is a little weak but it 's by no means a disappointment and it wraps up the story effectively - something increasingly unfamiliar to horror films ( which like to have \" hooks \" at the end to facilitate a sequel ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
