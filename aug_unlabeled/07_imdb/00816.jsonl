{"text": "Discuss anything and everything related to the Transformers Live Action Films franchise , which are directed by Michael Bay .Join us to discuss the movies and stuff up to date with news for the 2017 release of Transformers 5 .Check out our Live Action Film section here .Ok I saw that part 5 of the Don Murphy interview , and the question was raised about the company doing the bot designs and special effects ... .So I thought this would be a good ....HEALTHY ...Discussion .( NO Bay Bashing , Please)about who would have been better at doing the spfx ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On that note , I think that judging from past movies I have seen , Weta does a good job of tight CGI . and modelling .On the other hand ILM does have the whole Star Wars Experience licked . and that s pretty amazing .My only reason I 'm pushed more twards WETA doing this movie better is because ILM did Star Wars , and most of those guys who are there have that mindset with designing aspects .and it shows in these movie bots and their looks .The bug - like faces , the bodies , and mass part shifing during transformations ... ummmm tooo much Genosha .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Still i like ILM .But I 've become more fond of Weta 's style over the years .I just think they are more open minded in their design processes .they bring in outside experts in the field or genre they are working on for technical and artistic advice . see Lord of the Rings production DVD Extras .Last edited by skywarp-2 on Fri Feb 02 , 2007 7:06 pm , edited 1 time in total .\" You Waste More energy with your mouth . \"Updated ! - that means \" F - you ! \" skywarp-2 wrote : My only reason I 'm pushed more twards WETA doing this movie better is because ILM did Star Wars , and most of those guys who are there have that mindset with designing aspects .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The bug - like faces ... ummmm tooo much Genosha .and General Grevious ... .that they are \" alien \" .So those same artists from ILM , went and drafted images of what they thought was alien , pulling ideas from all the transformers cartoons , toys and what have you that they liked .or could play around with and create a new look for a character .cool new look ! ! !( I 'm being sarcastic ) .So micheal Bay , Steven and Hasbro .all looked at the designs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "then said make it in CGI so I can see what it would be like on the big screen . and Bam ! !we have what we have today .\" You Waste More energy with your mouth . \"Updated ! - that means \" F - you ! \"After how horrible King Kong looked I will never ever pick Weta over ILM .ILM has this uncanny ability to make CG actually blend with real actors .Yoda in Episode III for example .I honestly forgot he was n't actually there when he would be talking to Obi - Wan while hunkered over his cane .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "as far as i know , there are separate studios for concept design and another one for CGI .I d vote for ILM because it has more \" realism \" .Weta most of the time have this special atmosphere in the scenes ( sumthin like filterd , afternoon orange atmosphere or a bit foggy in ) in order to blend .While ILM sorta like blends with the ussual movie camera thing .Sorry ca nt elaborate since i am no film techie .Its like comparing jurrasic park dinosaurs to kingkong 's dino scenes .Both of which are cool but i would prefer ILM since i like the realtime experience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lets not focus on starwars when it comes to ILM .this is just me . btw , aside from good in blending with actors , ILM is also good in blending with realtime surroundings .But we / I have yet to see a WETA work done on a real surrounding ...LOTR and kong 's used simulated ones .Zuko wrote : After how horrible King Kong looked I will never ever pick Weta over ILM .ILM has this uncanny ability to make CG actually blend with real actors .Yoda in Episode III for example .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Golem on the other hand I could never connect with because he never really seemed to \" fit \" for lack of a better word .weta really are n't that great .I 'm torn over King Kong .The creatures in that film were great but some of the effects were so blatantly obvious blue - screen I ca n't help but wonder if that was the intent .As if , perhaps , it was meant as an homage to the original but with cgi in place of stop - motion .If that was the case I ca n't really see faulting them for it any more than I could ILM for Sky Captain having the same ' obviousness ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I think it ultimately depends upon the budget , time constraints , and the director 's ability to film scenes that can successfully incorporate cgi / puppetry / etc .While I ca n't honestly say I enjoyed either of those movies I was referring to the quality of the special effects , not the film as a whole .Take the opening sequence in Vel Helsing with Hyde , for example .It just looked off .It was n't Sci - fi Channel Special or the Nasonex bee bad , but it was far from their best work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If I were talking about the films as a whole I 'd have to admit that I still have n't managed to sit through the entirety of Peter Jackson 's King Kong .It just seems to drag on forever and Jack Black feels so horribly miscast I get the urge to throat - punch him every time he comes on - screen .I loved the CG in King Kong .WETA is awesome in that department .Too bad the only really good movie they 've worked on that I know of is the Lord of the Rings trilogy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Star Wars was always awesome , until an organic alien was on screen .The cook at the diner in episode 2 looked particularly bad , but the droid factory and the ships were so bad ass .Yeah , you can tell Gollum is CG , but so what ?He was so good .I 'm tired off people nitpicking CG .Like models and puppets did n't have little subtleties either .Matte lines and jerky movement were a staple of all those Harrihousen monsters , and they were awesome .Nitpicking of special effects is fair game and it fuels progress .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't mean Gollum , he seemed believable enough , but certain things like the bit in Return of the King where Legolas is climbing about and doing flips on the elephant creatures , that was bad .The Harryhausen stop - motion scenes are still widely respected because at the time they were the pinnacle of the technique 's capabilities .They were innovative .But progress has been made in the field to the extent that if it were used in an effects - heavy big - budget film today and were all jerky , people would complain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Overall , if we 're talking about the entire package , I 'd pick WETA .Why ?Because their people really work to get inside the things they 're designing and making .ILM have a tendency to spin out very similar - looking stuff over and again , presumably because they wrote the book on vehicle and robot FX and seem to rest on their laurels somewhat unless they have a project which really tests them .In pure FX terms , ILM obviously have far more experience with non - organic objects / creatures , while WETA built their reputation on scenery and creature effects .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Given the opportunity , I would trust WETA to push their capabilities and improve their effects work in order to tackle a huge sci - fi project , more than I would trust ILM to do the same .First time we saw Golum everybody said Weta had won the race .Right now , with Jones from Pirates , I think ILM has the adventage .Honestly Pirates is the best GFX piece ever .I am talking of both first and second one .It is completlly well finished and it is impossible to \" catch \" a failure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "all that matters is budget .ILM is a ery large company with a range of teams of differing ability .while revenge of hte sith was being made , there was also ( scorpion king / the mummy returns , ca nt remember which ) being made at the same time . star wars had a huge budget therefore got the top class team , wheras the mummy film did nt , so got the SHIZZLESNIT team , there s no comparison in the standard of effects between the two , totally different leagues .all that matters is budget .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
