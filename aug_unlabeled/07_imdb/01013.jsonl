{"text": "Overall , this movie was slightly offensive to me .The drama , action , and biblical elements are a great combination .Without the curse words , and just not caring about the violence , this was a good movie .My Ratings : Moral rating : Better than Average / Moviemaking quality : 5 -Luke , age 14 ( USA ) .Positive -I thought this movie was barely offensive .the few f - words could 've been replaced , but that 's life and they truly do show the aspects of the villains that use them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "it has a great christian message and the violence in the film is needed to explain into the movie .Its a must see for drama movie lovers who are also christians .Its in my top 5 favorites .Its a little dark , but I found any thing wrong in the movie was necessary to enhance the film .It was Great ! ! !My Ratings : Moral rating : Good / Moviemaking quality : 3\u00bd -Matt J , age 15 ( USA ) .Well , put yourself in his shoes , would you prefer to eat meat of that of a domestic animal or that of a human ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now , in reality , that is not murder in God 's eyes .Notice that he does not kill or even hurt the women near the trolley cart .She did not bother him , even though she was part of that sinful gang , she did nothing wrong to Eli or pose a threat to him , therefore he did not harm her .Now , when he come across a woman getting brutally raped , he tells himself that it is not his concern , \" stay on the path .\" A lot of people found the bar fight too violent and gruesome .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "God Bless ... .My Ratings : Moral rating : Good / Moviemaking quality : 5 -David , age 14 ( South Africa ) .Negative -I got up and left after the second scene where several people were cut up and limbs and heads were cut - off .It is sickening that viewers laugh at such scenes .-Gary , age 49 ( USA ) .Negative -After reading the positive comments from this site , my boyfriend and I decided to go see the Book of Eli , a movie others claimed \" strengthened their faith . \" Much to the contrary , we left after about a half hour .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To begin , the foul language was awful , with several f - words .The violence was extremely grotesque , with footage of limbs and heads being sliced off and blood squirting everywhere .To compare , it was far worse than other films like \" Gladiator \" or \" Saving Private Ryan . \"Finally , while the sexual conduct of the main character may be positive , he does absolutely nothing to stop a gang from raping and killing a woman .While this is not shown , the nude upper half of her dead body is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I could not recommend this movie to anyone .It was neither appropriate nor entertaining .-Jessica , age 18 ( Canada ) .Neutral -\"Do unto others as you would have them to do unto you \" is the message of the Bible ?Are you kidding me ?Not the Bible that matters ?How else would you know God other than the book HE gave us to know him by .The message of the Bible is we are all sinners and will go to hell , eternally in torment and separated from God if we do n't follow Jesus Christ .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The entire Bible is about Jesus Christ .This movie is technically heresy .What is heresy you ask ?A denial or deviation of true doctrine .This movie is all about that .And putting the Bible on equal footing with books of other , false , religions ?What is that saying ?All religions are equal ?All religions lead to the same God ?All religions lead to the same place ?Come on ...This is another example of Hollywood dictating what Christianity is about and warping the message that Jesus brings .Twisting the message and leading people astray , onto the wide path rather than the narrow path .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Or if they did they would want you to know ...They do n't on either front .If you are wanting a post - apocalyptic , action , movie then you will enjoy this .If you are wanting a movie that will change peoples lives with the true message of Christianity , you will be sorely disappointed .Even so called Christian movies have a hard time doing that , and typically do a poor job .Do n't be fooled by the message of this movie .It is not Christian .If you want Christ , go find a church that teaches the Bible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You will not find Christ in the movies .As an action movie it is fine , as anything Christian it is utter drivel .This movie is part of the war on Christianity .And is is on the enemies side .-Robert , age 44 ( USA ) .Positive -My family was watching this movie , and I came in about a quarter of the way through and watched it till the end .I 'd say it was a decent , moderately enjoyable movie .There was some language and sexualized dancing .I think this movie is appropriate for fifteen - year - olds and up , as it 's too much for kids younger than that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , it did have a good message about pursuing something you love with people who love you .It discussed how success , money , and prestige , are n't the most important things .I found the final group performance very touching and inspiring .That said , this movie certainly was n't the best of its kind .It focused on too many characters , and thus they lacked depth and development .The scenes seemed heavily edited and cut down too much .Overall , this was a good movie to older teens , as it raises some thought - provoking questions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "-Beth , age 20 ( Canada ) .Negative -Like many people who commented on the negative side , I was under the impression by fellow Christians that this was a great movie .My husband and I turned it off .After using God 's name in vain in a way that I consider the worst , I could take no more of the movie .Of course , after considering how much we already saw , we felt we should have left after the use of the female body part in a profane way .To think that Christians could relate to this movie in a positive way is beyond me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just because a Hollywood movie has a Bible in it does not make it a Christian movie or a movie that is relevant to a Christian .I would really like this comment to be a shout out to fellow Christians .What are you thinking ?We represent JESUS CHRIST .Our bodies are His temple .Our eyes are the windows to our souls .If we let darkness in , we will be filled with darkness .If light , we will be filled with light .Hollywood has a really tight hold on the spirit of Christians .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just a thought .I have lent this suggestion to other Christians , but many times I am criticized and looked on as a young prude .Oh well , in the end we will see .Honestly , I think that having a conscience and listening to the convictions God gives us is a GOOD thing .The Book of Eli is not a movie about Christ , Christians , or the power of the Word of God .It is an exploitation of religion and the brutality of man .It is perverse and offers no spiritual food for the Christian .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
