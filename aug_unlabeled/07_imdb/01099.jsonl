{"text": "Waiting for the Great Martian Movie .We watch all the movies about Mars so you do n't have to .Let 's get this up front : The best Mars movie is Paul Verhoeven 's Total Recall .The 1990 sci - fi thriller stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former counterrevolutionary who 's had his memory erased and is trying to figure out who he is and who his enemies are on a Mars wracked by revolution .Like all of Verhoeven 's movies , it is compulsively watchable and has creative if often gratuitous violence and sleaze - and also Verhoeven 's obligatory femme fatale , in this case played by Sharon Stone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Schwarzenegger : \" If I 'm not me , who the hell am I ? \" Stone : \" Beats me .I just work here .\" Sure , the movie 's good .But is it really the best movie ever made about Mars ?Consider the competition .And when doing so , be sensible and define a movie about Mars as one in which at least part of the plot takes place on Mars .Dozens of movies meet that criterion , but dozens more with the word Mars in their title do not .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yep , a century of Mars movies and you have barely enough for a one - day film fest ( see the accompanying tables of \" Favorite Mars Movies \" at the end of this article ) .It 's puzzling .Mars has fascinated Earthlings for millennia , ever since sages saw the pink dot in the night sky and wondered why it wandered .The ancient Greeks , seeing red and thinking blood , named it after their god of war , Ares ; later the Romans just substituted the name of theirs : Mars .The body of literature about Mars is rich [ see \" Kim Stanley Robinson 's 10 Favorite Mars Novels \" ] , and a reasonable portion of it is intellectually stimulating .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In postrevolutionary Russia , for example , a visit to Mars depicted in the film Aelita : Queen of Mars ( 1924 ) became an occasion to demonize capitalism and glorify bolshevism .In the United States , where the vast majority of these movies have been made , Mars changed with the times .In the 1930s , it was an alternative to the American West in cheesy serials featuring sets more exotic than cowpoke towns , and villains more exotic than unshaven men in black hats .An exception is Just Imagine , one of the oddest films of cinema 's adolescence , the brief transition between silent films and talkies , precode and postcode .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The plot is wispy : A young man needs to impress government officials to marry the woman he loves .So he goes to Mars with his best friend and , it turns out , a stowaway who seems to have wandered into the movie from a vaudeville show .Upon arriving , the three immediately encounter Martians , who seem to differ hardly at all from Earthlings .The female Martians , in big hair and shiny two - piece bathing suits , seem to be what on Earth 25 years later will be called Vegas showgirls .The acting is terrible and the dialogue is unbearable at times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Mars then basically disappears from cinema for about two decades , reappearing in the golden age of sci - fi motion pictures , the 1950s .Unfortunately , none of the Mars movies of the 1950s fit into either category .Flight To Mars ( 1951 ) was shot in five days using borrowed costumes , sets , and even sounds .\" Cameron Mitchell , who stars in it , barely remembers it , \" says Gerry Williams , who maintains The Mars Movie Guide and organizes the Mars Society San Diego chapter 's monthly Mars movie nights .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But beneath their padded tunics , these Martians harbor Earth - invasion plans , because their world is dying .Much of the plot and dialogue is so ridiculous that the film is surprisingly enjoyable today as an unintentional parody of ' 50s sci - fi pictures .The movie has precisely one clever touch : The Martian heroine is named Alita , an apparent homage to the Russian movie 's Queen Aelita .Invaders From Mars ( 1953 ) , a compelling piece of Cold War paranoia rendered cleverly in primary colors , does n't really have anything to do with Mars .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ditto Red Planet Mars ( 1952 ) , a story about rival Cold War radio engineers , one of whom makes contact with a Martian civilization .It starts promisingly but degenerates abruptly into inanity when viewers are asked to accept that God has chosen Mars from among the universe 's many celestial bodies to be His base from which to proselytize by radio .In the early 1960s , the surging U.S. space program rejuvenated interest in Mars and helped spawn two striking yet meandering exercises , each based on a well - known fable .Crusoe , in particular , is still very fondly regarded by cinephiles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The unintentionally funny 1967 throwback , Mars Needs Women , is about a dying race that needs nubile Earthlings with whom to breed .In 1976 , the U.S. Viking landers do their thing , and interest in Mars resurges hugely .But not a single decent Mars movie comes out of it .In fact , Viking 's sharp images of beautiful , barren Martian plains probably did more harm than good , Sobchack says .After Viking , the fake Mars images of cinema lost much of their power to captivate .Or even to be taken seriously .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So ? ' \" To sum up : no agreeable environment ; no plausible indigenous antagonists . \"So now what ? \" asks Sobchack .\" If you go there with your script , what do you do ?There seem to be two choices : some sort of a chase , or you have your crew killing each other off for various reasons .\" In the 1970s , writers and directors of serious science - fiction films were n't much inclined to do either .They were too busy grappling with earthly social issues in high - concept movies like Soylent Green , Logan 's Run , Silent Running , and A Clockwork Orange .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nobody goes to Mars .In fact , that 's the point .Eventually , six more Mars movies come along : Total Recall in 1990 , Escape From Mars in 1999 , Red Planet and Mission to Mars in 2000 , John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars in 2001 , and Stranded in 2002 .In this , the most recent cycle of movies , the pseudoscientific backdrop is terraforming , the theory that humankind could change , radically and globally , the environment of a planet in a short period of time .It should n't seem too implausible if , say , you liked Al Gore 's movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But terraforming is an integral part of the plot , albeit a contrived one , in Total Recall , Red Planet , and Stranded .Whether the whole terraforming thing has any more cinematic life in it is now moot .Today , seven years since the last significant Mars movie , there are a couple more of them in the works .John Carter of Mars , a version of Edgar Rice Burroughs 's 1917 novel A Princess of Mars , is scheduled for release by Walt Disney Pictures in 2012 .It is to be directed by Andrew Stanton Jr. ( Finding Nemo , Wall - E ) , so it will probably be entertaining , at least .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Disney is also reported to be working on an animated movie for children based on the Berke Breathed book Mars Needs Moms .It 's difficult to imagine it being compelling for adults .Sobchack would love to see a great Mars picture , but she is n't , uh , holding her breath .\" We live in a science - fictional culture , and it 's hard to come up with something truly strange or novel , \" she says .In the science - fiction movies of the 1950s , she adds , \" there was a fascination with the science itself that gives them a kind of gravitas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The other obstacle is the general decline of movie sci - fi and its replacement by fantasy and comic - book movies .Still , there are reasons to hope that a great Mars movie will get made some day .Start with this one : If NASA is serious about going to Mars , it 's hard to imagine it happening without the kind of mass public enthusiasm that movies are good at nurturing and even better at exploiting .Then , too , there 's that rich and untapped body of Mars literature .Time Slip , in particular , intrigues sci - fi scholars .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "From the same general period as Robinson 's books ( the 1990s ) came many other worthy novels , including ones by Greg Bear , Ben Bova , Paul J.
