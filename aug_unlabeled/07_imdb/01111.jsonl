{"text": "I ca n't even estimate how many of these he signed .Yen survived the implosion of the Hong Kong film industry during the mid - to - late 1990s .A reliable action performer since the late 1980s , Yen has since become one of the world 's biggest action stars , the HK heir to Jackie Chan and Jet Li .It began with Kill Zone ( SPL : Sha Po Lang ) , but it was Ip Man that really made Yen a bona fide leading man .When he entered the conference room at the Kitano Hotel on Saturday morning , the assembled writers and I stood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's always interesting to meet people whose careers you 've admired for many years ( I still have my Tai Seng VHS copy of Iron Monkey somewhere ) , and Yen struck me with his class and charm the entire time he was in town .Before the interview started , he smiled and said , cutting through the small talk , \" Do n't ask me about New York .\" Acting is n't a form of putting a mask on .When you 're done with a role , how do you usually get out of it ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Actually , that 's a very good question .I actually have a lot of discussion [ about this ] with my colleagues in Hong Kong , like Anthony Wong-- I do n't know if you know his work .I focused a lot on crafting my acting in the last six years , and I go around trying to find different perspectives from everyone , including somebody like Anthony , well - regarded actors in Hong Kong .They tell me sometimes when you 're acting-- You know , there are a lot of bits to acting , right ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Like , I 'll give you an example .When I did Painted Skin , I was prepping .I had all these films lined up .When I was doing Painted Skin , I was ready to go on to do Ip Man .Playing Ip Man was a tremendous amount of pressure on me , as you probably guess , right ?So I was prepping in the middle of my film .So I remember there were a couple incidents where I was on the set of Painted Skin and I was getting into my wing chun practice in my Painted Skin outfit , right ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Let 's see how to break it down .Sorry to put you in-- .No , no , it 's okay .I think that 's a good question .I would say in China , there 's two forms of martial arts : the new form and the old form .The old form is traditional martial arts , you know , when you see the Shaolin temple and all that .The new form is the form that , during the Cultural Revolution , they kind of unified martial arts styles into more of a gymnastic form where people can compete with each other in a common scoring system .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Each province represents each team .Jet Li was from Beijing , so he represented Beijing .You know , Shanghai represents Shanghai .The whole of China is made up of maybe over 30 teams and they compete on an annual basis .They try to promote that martial arts style , but it 's gymnastic .The goal is to bring that into the Olympics eventually .I do n't know if that can ever happen , but that 's always been the aim and the goal .When I was a teenager , their team-- it was what , 1980 ...", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And my mother teaches martial arts in Boston and they visited the school .We had these conversations , and a couple coaches from the Beijing team saw--I gave a little performance for them , basically .They thought I was really talented and wanted me to go back to Beijing and train , just out of courtesy .Back then , no one would allow it even though I was Chinese , but not Chinese -Chinese .But somehow , we broke the red tape , and my parents sent me back to China , and I was training there on and off for a year and a half .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "yeah .So what I did when we shot Wu Xia , I said , \" What am I going to do ?I can not do MMA , it would n't look like , so what should I do ? \" Let me go back to the basics because , number one , again , stay true to the character .I believe that character would be doing something of that genre , traditional , kung - fu , Shaw Brothers .At the same time , the audiences have n't seen that for a while .It 's been a while , you know , I wanted to bring that , but with a couple of tricks here and there , maybe a little bit of-- one or two shots of CGI , like dissecting the body .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I would do non - action for just the sake of having the opportunity .I mean , not many action actors are being offered to play in non - action movies .But just like watching you in Bodyguards and Assassins and Wu Xia ... .Right .The parts I remember are your scenes , you know , with your kids , not the fighting .One of the biggest parts in Bodyguards and Assassins is you breaking everybody 's heart trying to do the right thing .Well , maybe what I did in the last six years was working .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You know , I would try , but at the end of the day , I do n't forget the business model of making a movie .At the end of the day , you 're talking about reaching out to as many people in the audience as possible .People come to see a Donnie Yen film , they want to see action .You know , I understand that , I accept it , I respect it .So , if I 'm being offered to play a non - action movie , yes , I 'd take the opportunity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Wilson Yip , our director , is exploring that possibility .What is the most difficult role that you 've ever tackled ?I 'd break it down to two .One , obviously , is the Monkey King because , one , the nature [ of the role].It 's tough to put on that monkey make - up and outfit .You 're talking about four hours a day to put the make - up on , another hour of taking the make - up off .I remember the first day of putting the make - up on , I said to myself , \" How am I going to sit through the next three months ? \" Just sitting there , you know , you have to be a really patient person .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
