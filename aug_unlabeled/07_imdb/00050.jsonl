{"text": "Our Idiot Brother Movie Review .Ensemble casts full of very recognizable faces does not always make a fully successful movie .In the case of OUR IDIOT BROTHER I would say that it actually helps the film 's cause-but when it comes down to it the film is delightfully charming yet not as laugh out loud funny as I wanted it to be .A lot of time is spent developing each character and the dynamic of their relationship but resolving the issues that were built in a throw away manner .Paul Rudd stars as the unassuming and extremely laid back , Ned .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Zoey Deschanel is cute with an indie comedic sensibility- Elizabeth Banks is a great comedic actress but also has great dramatic chops and T.J. Miller has a great hippie redneck beard .What it succeeds most as is a character piece that happens to have some comedy in the mix more than a comedy with great actors .The actors are great , but their characters are fleshed out nicely and they interact with each other even better .As a comedy OUR IDIOT BROTHER has a lot of decent chuckles but no real satisfying belly laughs .The drama in the film is toned down even more so as it only really rears its head toward the end and is gone before you know it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are a lot of very good performances , but in the process of setting up all the different character arcs it feels like there are plotlines that end too abruptly and never get satisfying closure .The biggest ends up being the conflict involving Steve Coogan 's character .I kept waiting for a much bigger payoff or comeuppance for such a detestable character but sadly it never really happens .The film takes on the attitude of Paul Rudd 's character- it just wants to enjoy what 's there without making waves or starting unnecessary conflicts .That in and of itself is not a defining flaw that makes the film frustrating but does in some ways keep it from making a distinct impression .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
