{"text": "Maggie Cheung Finds Success in \" Lu Zhen Legend \" .In an interview , Maggie commented that Lou Qing Qiang 's evilness is very three dimensional , and that it was very satisfying to act the character .Maggie also revealed that she was inspired to accept this role because she was told that Lou Qing Qiang is a thoroughly bad person , a marked departure from Maggie 's previous roles .When asked how she rated her performance , Maggie humbly said that it depends on the response of viewers and she will consider taking on such interesting villain roles in the future .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps these few years there were just too many dramas on palace conflict ; viewers find it boring and lose their interest .This time , the script and dialogue are still very good , perhaps viewers ' expectations are too high . \"After acting in mainland Chinese productions , Maggie said that she has been very happy . \"Mainland China 's period dramas are much better than Hong Kong 's ; this time the director for this drama was from Hong Kong and I got along very well with the crew members here .\" Maggie 's wish is to try many different roles in the future .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I think her acting is quite solid and she does deliver a good performance in the roles she plays , in the past and present .Really loved her character in War and Beauty playing the palace maid !However , I 'm not really a big fan of her personality / behaviour sometimes though .Perhaps tweeked through the translation in other interviews or whatever , but I find that her rather blunt and straight responses&personality sometimes comes off as boastful , and slightly rude imo .But hey , at least she gets to the point and does n't put on a fake act . @Clementine , I agree with you about Maggie 's personality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She 's actually defending Beauty at War ( unlike the other actors who are stepping out to criticize TVB) ...although you see some of her strong personality is retained when she says Mainland 's period drama is better than Hong Kong .I do n't think she has a diva attitude as people say she is .In fact , I think she has a strong personality , has high expectations when it comes to acting , is a perfectionist and is straightforward .Perhaps , this is why she is often mistaken for being a diva .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She even had an argument with the main actor ( I forgot his name ) because of this ' race ' thing .Maybe because she studied in the UK , that is why she always voices her opinions and speaks whatever in her mind .She actually reminds me of Jessica Hsuan .At least she is not fake like most Hong Kong artists are .And I also can see her starting to be less aggressive after going to China since the competition is higher there .By the way , I though she was filming for HKTV ? @qwerty The reason Asian Men probably do n't prefer them is because both of them are physically unattractive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They may have been a catch in the past ( though old pics do n't seem to support that , from my perspective ) but they really are past their prime .Certain images of Jessica make her look masculine and Maggie at times looks like an old sea hag .Even when done up .Just to clarify , I was n't referring her personality as being diva - ish and having diva attitudes .I agree , she does have a very strong personality , being very straightforward and blunt .But her strong personality / tough attitude is definitely something to applaud and encourage in women imo .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Chinese drama is becoming better and better in terms of cast selections , costumes , venue , etc .HK needs to keep at par otherwise they will lose their viewers very soon .HK is already losing their viewers slowly , take a look at tbb 's series ratings for this year ... the average rating is 25 points or below nowadays , above 25 is considered very good in contrast to previous years , 30 points was the average rating .@Clementine : Good ... that means HK audiences are finally ' waking up ' and realizing that TVB is n't really worth their time anymore .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of course , if TVB ignores the ' call ' and continues to churn out bad quality productions , then that 's too bad for them ... .Not sure about the quality standards part , but since HK artists ' may not be as highly known back in the Mainland .Even if they were once leads in HK , and maybe relatively known in the Mainland , to cast them straight off as leads in mainland production would be quite difficult for audiences to accept straight away and may struggle with drawing in interest+viewership .Also , since Mainland afterall is not HK artists ' ' motherland'/ mother - company , to cast HK artists ' over Mainland actors in leads may come across as offensive to Mainland actors ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sheren and maggie takes supporting roles , because , well , they are older , or at least look older .Cold , but undeniable truth .Personally , I think Jessica can even look a bit more aged than Maggie in some photos .Anyway , even if Maggie looked a little younger , I just do n't feel she has quite the same appeal / popularity as the three you mentioned above .Out of the five fadans , I always felt that Maggie was the least liked ... .Really ?I always thought maggie had a mature look even before her illness , with her long face , and sharp features .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And we know the criticism tavia gets for looking old , they do have similar features .As for jessica , she often post photos sans makeup , and she looks relatively younger , and sometimes , even girlish in those photos .Oops .I meant recent photos of Jessica at promo events ( and even in Curse of the Royal Harem ) where she was caked in layers of make - up .And probably because they gave her such unflattering hair as well ...But yeah , I do get what you mean when you say Maggie looks a little more mature ( she actually used to remind me of Lau Suet Wah ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maybe it is make up or quality of costume or HD - I do admit , even at their dustiest , they look rather more authentic than TVB 's .Like both need ironing but somehow for mainland CCTV production you feel that that 's how it should be .The Legend of Lu Zhen was such a good drama !So sad it 's over !I 'm not usually a fan of Maggie Cheung and have thought that her acting was getting worse with her last few TVB dramas but she impressed me so much in The Legend of Lu Zhen ! WAIT !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yu Zheng again !And plot sounds a bit like Jewel In The Palace except again turned upside down .Anyway gon na be on TV so I will watch .I watched it .It was not good .Maggie 's acting was OK but the character was not that great .She was evil but not the evil that would make your blood chill , chuck stuff at the TV or even feel sorry for .There was no development in character .She was evil and that was it .The series was strangely slow at times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
