{"text": "He plays it broad , but it 's always believable and he 's got that sleaze / charm routine down pat .Forget Indiana Jones , I 'd ask Spielberg what it was like to direct Jack Cassidy !Robert Culp .Death Lends a Hand The Most Crucial Game Double Exposure .What I like about Culp 's performances is that they actually seem like a real - life arrogant S.O.B. Not played over - the - top , but he 's like someone you 'd meet and then despise .His Bart Keppel barely tolerates Lt .Columbo , but only deals with him because the man is the law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Patrick McGoohan .By Dawn 's Early Light Identity Crisis .By Dawn 's Early Light is a preview of McGoohan 's Escape From Alcatraz warden .Both men are righteous and totally blind in their belief system , with no room for negotiation .Yes , they believe their own tired cliches , like Haynes says to McGoohan in \" Early Light .\" My favorite McGoohan is Identity Crisis , when The Master brings a charm and \" Be seeing you \" to the proceedings .He even gets to play spy with his \" Steinmetz \" persona .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These three performers are hands down the very best in terms of rapport with Columbo , deviousness , charm , and all - around screen charisma --- IMO .And they all bring their unique strengths to their roles and make every Columbo they 're in the most memorable for me .One of my favorite episodes of the show was called \" Any Old Port in a Storm \" .It featured a wonderfully understated performance by Donald Pleasence as a not so typical murderer you actually care for .It was a real departure from the usual \" I hope Columbo nails him to the wall \" storylines .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Columbo had great guest star villains .As you surely know , after the ' 70 's , McGoohan also directed some episodes in starred in ; always a pleasure .and great actors playing \" villain of the week \" .Good choices , but I do n't recall the Culp episodes ; I should read the synopses on IMDB .I was hoping for a complete set once all the seasons had been released , but have never read anything about one ; now , I 'm wondering whether they will do it on Blu - Ray , so I 'm still waiting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Finch 's reaction to Columbo 's \" You call that a lining ? \" joke alone makes this a classic ep .McGoohan and Culp are definitely my favorites .I agree that Jack Cassidy was a great guest star as well ; his smarminess is really fun to watch .Worthy of honorable mention : .This thread reminds me of what was so disappointing about the 80s and 90s episodes -- the guest villains were rarely of the same caliber as those on the original run of the show .And even when you did have a Shatner or McGoohan , it just was n't quite the same .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some of the greatest actors in the world , getting their moment to do some of their best work .The element of contrast was so important , too .Look at how different Cassidy , Culp , McGoohan , and the other ideal guest stars were from Falk .They also all had wonderful voices and unique line readings .I think it was Richard Levinson who said that when the show is 90 minutes of people talking , the talk had better be interesting .It always was .Some of the greatest actors in the world , getting their moment to do some of their best work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I do n't think so .Anyway , I find that I enjoy the show as much as my grandparents did , and with the same enthusiasm in seeing a Golden Age star in it but even moreso whenever the three Titans of Columbo are in it .I think they had no trouble getting top people for the show because there was a prestige factor , but also because the open mystery eliminated the objection most top actors have to doing mysteries .( No one has an interesting motivation except the killer , and he only gets one good scene at the end . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also , the murderers got a $ 20,000 salary , which was about five times the rate of other dramatic series of the era .On the matter of 70s vs. 90s Columbo , I think it 's not just the fact that good guest killers were harder to come by .The stories are just not as well - written .But frequently , the 90s Columbos lack the smarts to give us that complex unraveling , and what usually happens is ( 1 ) a longer backstory leading up to the killing .And another problem with these 90s Columbos is that many of them have storylines that belong more to the dark , smoky world of film noir and that is not a genre Columbo belongs in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I agree with all of the earlier criticisms of the later Columbos , and had one additional thought recently : the scenes are much shorter .It makes a tremendous difference to the rhythm of the story and the relationship with the killer .Compare the scenes between Falk and McGoohan in Identity Crisis and then between Falk and McGoohan in Agenda for Murder .Apart from everything else , the Identity Crisis scenes go on for several minutes .One scene lasts almost fifteen !In Agenda for Murder , the scenes are short and choppy and there is much less of a relationship between Columbo and the killer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
