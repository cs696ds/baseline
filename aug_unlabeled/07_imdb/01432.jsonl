{"text": "Reader Request I received an e - mail last week from a reader named Jackson asking me a troubling question .He and his friend , I was quickly informed , both love Far From Heaven AND Brokeback Mountain ( ohhh how I love my readers ) and they want me to decide which is better .Solve that toss - up dilemma !They were each Gold Medalists in their respective years in my personal awards ( 2002 & 2005 ) .Normally I 'm very averse to matchups between separate years .It 's hard enough to make qualitative choices in one given year betwen 100 or so films ( and yes , I am a bit behind in my screenings this year --shut up ) let alone comparing entries from previous years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I love too many .Still , I took this reader challenge and watched this Focus Feature double .They share a same basic tragedy : multiple miseries springing from the denial of love .They share other obvious traits , too .Both received triple Oscar nominations for their brilliant performances --huh , what 's that ?Heaven only received one ?Stupid Academy !And then there 's the little matter of gay .Heaven and Brokeback have memorable twin sequences wherein a wife goes nearly catatonic at the surprise sight of her \" all man \" husband macking on , well , another man .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They ( that is characters in both films ) refer to it as \" this thing . \"Heaven , though , adds a rather brilliant touch in that the men are n't the only closet cases .This , the fear of love and society 's ignorant backlash , is not just a gay concern .I knew all of this already dear readers .But I was still surprised by the experience of watching them back to back .They make for fascinating twins .Fraternal , mind you , despite all of their identicals .Consider : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Heaven takes place in 1957 - 1958 or thereabouts .Brokeback begins just six years later but the similarities end there .These are entirely different worlds .The first is a spin on cinematic renderings of the era , the second using realism .Both have tremendous production values but Heaven 's intrigue me more .Just how does this hyperstylized world so obviously speak directly to the ' now ' whilst also paying tribute and critiquing the ' then ' ?It 's an impressive balancing act .Heavy Drinking .Within the first six minutes of both films the gays are drinking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Further inebriated episodes follow for both Frank Whitaker ( Dennis Quaid ) in Heaven and Jack and Ennis in Brokeback .But in this bender matchup I 'll take Brokeback since Frank 's drinking tends to lead to public humiliations while Jack and Ennis 's lead to roughhousing and , um , roughsex .If you include the girls in the mix , though , Heaven closes the bar .Heath acts the hell out of a hangover , but who can compete with that daquiri soaked girltalk scene ?The Great Wide Open .Heaven features stunningly designed yet highly claustrophic interiors with saturated colors and foreboding shadows .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But notice how true love always takes place outdoors .Jack and Ennis are only happy in nature .Cathy and Raymond discover their love there , too .True love , you see , is completely natural .No matter what Mona Lauder thinks of it !In this pairing I am camping with the Brokeback boys .For obvious reasons .Marry Me A Little .Heaven has just the one confusing marriage and painful divorce .Brokeback ups the ante with two doomed brides and grooms .I 'm closer to Heaven here , which has a wittier take on its central marriage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On You .Both films have a heartbreaking telephone call just prior to their conclusion .Heaven 's features a weary Cathy scheduling her divorce paperwork with Frank and carries a sharp sting .But this contest goes to Brokeback which is more like a gutpunch .It 's one of those very complex scenes in which two characters ( Anne Hathaway 's and Heath Ledgers ) total strangers say all sorts of things and hear all sorts of things without anything much ever being said .Awesome .Clothes .A most endearing twin trait of these two grand movies is that they both place an enormous amount of emotional baggage onto an item(s ) of clothing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After three viewings , Brokeback packs a bigger emotional wallop .It has always been , obviously , the more accessible .But Heaven , after five viewings , still holds me completely in a cineastic - fantastic trance .I never ever want to fast forward .It does n't make me choke up as much ( at least not anymore on the fifth or sixth viewing ) but I find its complex mix of tones to be so hugely ambitious and mostly successful that it ekes out the overall victory .Plus it has Patty Clarkson so ... points for that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So is this contest even fair ?It 's practically a duet .It 's like asking me if I prefer air or water .The film fanatic in me needs both movies to survive .Which do you prefer , readers ?And can you guess how depressed I was after I watched them back to back ?This is a very interesting debate !On my own personal film awards , neither film won best picture , but Brokeback did finish # 2 ( behind King Kong ) and 2002 was a crowded year in which Far From Heaven finished # 9 ( Talk To Her won ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The direction , cinematography and screenplay were all phenomonal .Heath Ledger deserved the Oscar for his performance , and Brokeback overall is a perfect film up until the end where it boarders slightly along the lines of melodrama .Still , Julianne Moore gives the best performance in either film .Far from Heaven .It fires on all cylinders , whereas Brokeback puts all its oomph into one .My heart leaps just thinking about it .Brokeback has its merits , for sure , but what does it leave us with ?A funeral for two men -- one dead , the other better off dead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Brokeback Mountain , which remind me the same mid - west loneliness and desperation that we see in a lot of 60 's movies , from The Misfits to Hud , and some modern ones , like Paris Texas or The Bridges of Madison County .They 're all about the Western agony .Brokeback is less a love story than an portrait of a terrible landscape .Far From Heaven is a good revision of a classic director , but ir does n't tear me apart .My vote is for Brokeback , but it 's a tough choice b / c I LOVED Far from Heaven too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They let you watch the movies for free , pretty cool .Lots of good GLBT movies on there too .Far from heaven is a five star movie for me , whereas Brokeback gets four stars .Julianne , cinematography , music and all the art department , for me there is not even a question which one is better of these two .Only Jake gets credit from me for his acting in BM and of course cinematography was quite top notch also .Ok the ending was n't bad either .But still , FFH wins on all these spots plus more ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Brokeback does pack a significant emotional wallop , and I think Ang Lee deserves as much credit as Proulx and the actors in making the film as good as it is , but Todd Haynes is really on another plane of cinematic existence .And not to knock Prieto or Santaolalla , whose work I enjoy very much ( both here and in other films ) , but Lachman and Bernstein contribute real work for the ages in FFH .Seriously - great piece , Nate .I know it 's hardly a shock to say I 'd pick Brokeback , but you do give Heaven a great case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not that doing so is a requisite for a great film , and Heaven is a great film , but personally the ( grand , gorgeous ) artifice gets in the way of me loving it in quite the same way I love Brokeback .This was a great idea .Both movies are marvelous and I love them .I have to give the nod to Brokeback because the emotional impact was like a punch in the gut .I thought Julianne Moore was luminous and amazing , and Patricia Clarkson chilled me to the bone when she found out the truth about the gardner .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dennis Haysbert on the train was maybe the hottest guy ever in movies .My problem with it is I never bought Dennis Quaid as gay .He was playing tortured , surely , but not gay .I would like to have seen some subtle hints but all we got was the very obvious .In contrast , I thought Heath 's extremely tortured soul and Jake 's longing and his fey moments made their performances ring true .BBM has more emotional pull .FFH is technically thrilling .It 's kind of like apples and oranges .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I may watch it once more one of these days , but not anytime soon .FFH I 've watched once and would be interested in watching again .My initial reaction prefers BBM , but , over the long - term , my tendency is towards FFH .First of all , I just want to give a shout out to Focus Features .GOD BLESS THEM !Far From Heaven and Brokeback Mountain are masterful works of cinema .Besides each containing career defining performances for their respective leads , offering lush , visual wonder and providing an aerobic workout on the tear ducts , both films seem to share the theme of regret most strongly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , lets try to narrow it down with the old award category tactic : .EDITING : Neither film can really be lauded here .BM was trying to reflect repression in the editing , I get that , but I 'm going w/ the graceful pacing of FFH .SCREENPLAY : BM ( A flawless , introspective work of perfection ) .Julianne Moore- FFH ( This was like choosing between your children ) .DIRECTING : BM- Ang Lee .( Consider the performances he extracted from the actors if nothing else .Hayes 's used a visionary attack on the hypocrites of the era while also delivering pure piece of cinema , but Lee used minimalism to astonishing effect , extracted career defining performances and delivered a film which resounds with ardent emotion and elegiac beauty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Featuring a revolutionary Moore and fine ensemble cast , FFH offers Cinephiles a unique and fascinating moving going experience .BM : A phenomenally moving , emotionally draining , love story between two men in the 1960s .Featuring a career best from Lee and Ledger , this beautiful , landmark classic also happens to be one of the most haunting films one could experience .Remember art is subjective and its hard to say one film 's merits exceeds the other .With these two films its almost impossible to choose .But the \" list maker \" in me is strong .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN .would get my vote .If your willing to climb Brokeback and really appreciate each subtle decision behind the filmmaking its merits are astonishing .It 's a film of rare quality ; one that can be appreciated as a masterful piece of cinema and one that genuinely takes a piece out of you .FANTASTIC POST !- I 'm not surprised Nathaniel went w/ Far From Heaven .If there s one thing I 've noticed , the man does n't like to be obvious and does seem to have a pattern .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He tends to appreciate more stylish , innovative films over more overtly dark , unsetting and emotionally somber films .Just look at his Top 10 lists : Bleak , performances driven and emotionally draining dramas usually do n't make it past # 6 on his Top 10 lists .( Ex .The Silence of the Lambs , Leaving Las Vegas , Sweet Hereafter , Gods & Monsters , Boys Do n't Cry , The Hours , In the Bedroom ) Plus innovate , stylish films usually topped his list during those previously mentioned films respective years .That 's fine by me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I got ta say BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN .It 's close , but Brokeback 's sting is something few films ever achieve .Far From Heaven was superior in its technical aspects- stylish and no doubt moving .But Brokeback , well not to the same degree , was technically impressive as well .Both films featured magnificent acting- although Dennis Quaid and Hathaway did n't really do it for me .I kinda of see a Million Dollar Baby - The Aviator thing going on .Now both Far From Heaven and Brokeback Mountain are in another galaxy compared to MDB and The Aviator but to further my point about emotion and techs I 'd go as far to say of the two ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "you learn new things regularly about yourself .cinemafervor . interesting ... i imagine most people have patterns of some sort but it 's always interesting to see who notices yours and to notice your own all the more when others point it out .I do see this in my taste obviously .I think it has to do with wanting the filmmaker to fire on all cylinders --use EVERYTHING for your story telling . as opposed to just having a good story angle .although i would n't say that requiem disproves the theory ;) being stylish innovative AND depressing / somber .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I personally would go with the introverted grandeur of Brokeback , but I can not find fault with those who prefer the pristine Far From Heaven .Ca n't wait for a potential sequal to this matchup ( Eternal Sunshine takes on Return of the King , perhaps ? )Far from Heaven easily takes the cake on this one .I love every second of it .That said , I also awarded BBM Best Picture of 2005 so there 's no shortage of love ther either .Actually , this is the first time I 've realized it - Focus has had a stranglehold on my # 1 movie for the last several years : . 2002 - Far from Heaven 2003 - Lost in Translation 2004 - Eternal Sunshine 2005 - Brokeback Mountain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Coincidence ?Most definitely not .I 'm with the people who said they loved Heaven but did n't get as much out of it emotionally .It moved me , yes , but not as much as Brokeback which felt like it was made for ME ( and nobody else y' all ) .Brokeback Mountain is a highly overrated , dull - as - dishwater adultery drama that coasted on the \" novelty \" of addressing homosexuality .I think of it as the gay Gentlemen 's Agreement , which was praised at the time for addressing anti - Semitism but today comes off as simplistic and heavy - handed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At least , I hope that mainstream films with gay themes will become familiar enough to cause such a reaction .Far from Heaven , on the other hand , is a masterpiece .Every aspect of the film is brilliant , especially Julianne Moore 's performance , which will certainly rank among the greatest in film history .In addition , FFH allowed the gay character to have a happy ending of sorts , whereas BM reinforced the traditional Hollywood morality that dictated that gay characters must die or be otherwise punished .I enjoy eye candy as much as the next person , and I enjoyed Far From Heaven quite a bit , but I need a film to enter me , make me experience what is happening on the screen from the inside out , not the outside in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
