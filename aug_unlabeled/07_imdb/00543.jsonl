{"text": "I SELL THE DEAD is structured around imprisoned grave - robber Arthur ( Daniel Monaghan ) , telling the story of his long association with fellow grave - robber Willie Grimes ( Larry Fessenden ) to the attentive Father Duffy ( Ron Perlman ) .The result is less a feature - film narrative than a vaudeville - style series of comedy routines , with Arthur and Willie nervously encountering a series of supernatural complications during their illegal late - night activities .Although the individual episodes are fairly amusing , the loose story structure never works up any narrative steam , leaving I SELL THE DEAD to coast along from one set - piece to the next .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The humor is fairly broad , but I SELL THE DEAD is not really a genre spoof .The familiar cliches are served up without contempt or camp , the laughter arising from the characters ' reactions to the vampires and zombies that cross their path .Monaghan and Fessenden make an enjoyable comedy team , their working - class protagonists grumbling and struggling to get by whatever weirdness they dig up .Although the obvious comparison is to Burke and Hare , the characters actually come off more like a pair of bit players in a Hammer horror classic , who somehow managed to wander into starring roles in their own film ( a la ROSENKRANTZ AND GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's nice to see Angus Scrimm ( PHANTASM 's Tall Man ) back on screen , and Perlman is always a welcome presence .Atmospheric photography , enhanced by judicious digital work , captures a convincing flavor of old - school British horror ( even though filming took place in America ) .The monster makeup and effects are deliver the requisite zombie attacks and severed heads with gruesome glee - and with tongue planted firmly in cheek .Definitely worth a rental , especially for fans seeking a good - natured tribute to old - fashioned horror .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
