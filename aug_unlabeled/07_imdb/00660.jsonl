{"text": "Synopsis .World War II bombings are something that few willingly bring up in conversations .War , in general , is a topic that is most definitely tragic , but also somewhat larger than life , as is the fact that it is not something that can be explained in an essay or news article .You 've got to see it to believe it .Seita and his four - year - old sister Setsuko are collateral damage of World War II bombings in Japan .Their home , their mother , their bright future .All taken away from them in a swift enemy raid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , hope can only get you so far , as it turns out that war forces even good people to make hard decisions .How long will hope keep Seita and Setsuko moving forward ?Is the light of a firefly bright enough to guide them to happiness once again ?Hotaru no Haka is a heartbreaking film that allows us to experience the harsh realities of a post - war environment through the delicate eyes of two young siblings .Few movies I 've seen can bring me to the brink of tears , and only a handful of those can actually haunt me days after seeing them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Very few films have EVER made me feel as bad as this one did .Try to think of the saddest movie you 've ever seen , Schindler 's List ( Widescreen Edition ) , Saving Private Ryan ( Widescreen Two - Disc Special Edition ) , anything , and this movie blows it out of the water .This film has the power to devastate you , to move you , to bring you to the brink of tears and then push you over into a chaotic world .This is Grave of the Fireflies .Set during the last days of WWII , while the US Air Force was fire bombing Japanese cities , Grave of the Fireflies is a movie about a young boy named Sata and his little four year old sister Setsico .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With his father far away serving in the Japanese navy , Sata is the only one who can care for his sister .The love shared between these two siblings is something that will forever leave an impression on me .As an older brother myself I could very easily put myself into Sata 's situation .His need to give his sister the very best he can while not being able to provide for her is a very real feeling .There are no heroes in this film , and there are no villains .Sata and Setsico are no heroes ; the only heroic things they do throughout the movie are love and take care of one another .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At the same time neither side of the war , American or Japanese , is portrayed in a negative light .This is not a war movie and does n't exist to condemn one side or the other .This is a movie about two orphan children trying to survive while the society they grew up in crumbles to dust around them .Many critics of this movie complain about how annoying little Setsico is .Yes , I can admit , sometimes Setsico can be annoying , but really , what little girl is n't ?She 's a child , and children ca n't understand everything that 's going on around them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As an older brother I find it absurd when people complain about how annoying little brothers / sisters can act in movies without even realizing that siblings are annoying in real life .Sata is no different .if you read this review , please leave a comment . read more .( I have a feeling most people reading this will hit the \" Not Helpful \" button as soon as they see my overall score , but for the few who actually care to read the review , there are several interesting points to consider ) .( Partial re - write of a review posted about 5.5 years ago on another site .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A well - renowned Studio Ghibli classic about 14 year - old Seita and his little sister struggling to survive after their home is destroyed by carpet bombing , their mother killed , and their father is away fighting with the Navy .Except they do n't really struggle .Not at first , anyways .They have a loving aunt who is more than willing to give them a place to stay , help cook for , and take care of them .Far from being grateful and thankful for this lucky turn of events , though , Seita is angry and resentful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , because occasionally she makes insensitive comments about how Seita plays all day with his sister and eats her food , instead of going to school or working .And you know what ?She 's absolutely correct !A 14 year old in the 1940 's was considered a mature adult , especially during in Japan , doubly so during wartime , and more than capable of working for a living .This was n't considered either tragic or unusual ; it was simply the way life was back then for the countries at total war .However , Seita , despite supposedly caring for his sister , ca n't take this horrible verbal insult to his pride .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thus , Seita is a completely callous , idiotic monster , responsible not only for his own death , but the death of his sister as well .That 's my first problem with \" Grave of the Fireflies \" .That the main character is responsible for the entire tragedy that ensues .Another weakness of the movie is how completely contrived and fake the emotions were .You 're telling me that when Seita sees his dead mother , her skin burned off her very flesh , he does n't cry ?He 's so tough , that he tries to entertain his younger sister by doing tricks on a metal high bar ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Especially considering how childish and immature Seita acts throughout the rest of the movie .Him and his sister laughingly frolicking so soon afterwards also struck me as pure movie bullshit .The aunt 's own temperament is equally contrived .You 're telling me that she shows no emotion upon hearing that her own sister has died ?She 's clearly no monster , and treats her nephews quite well , so why the utter lack of emotion ?And why her bizarrely antagonistic attitude towards Setsuko , the younger sister ?She 's four year old .Seita is the one at fault here , not her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yet , the anime has an even greater flaw ; it fails to make a statement .There is no point to the story .Seita and Setsuko suffer tragedy during World War 2 .They play and laugh a lot .Seita ignores the responsibilities of an adult .Eventually , they starve .What 's the punchline ?What 's the meaning ?There have been thousands of films before this and hundreds of films afterwards about the cruelty of war .What makes this one special ?What 's the director 's message about life and the human condition ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hell , I did n't even feel any particular pity for the two fictional characters .The director even failed to do that .On the bright side , the animation of \" Grave of the Fireflies \" is , for its time , absolutely breathtaking , as is its attention to the most minute details of a scene must have taken tremendous dedication and effort on the part of the artists .The music , while a simple orchestral score , is nevertheless touching , adding just the right emotion to several important scenes .It 's not overpowering , but rather a soft background noise that makes one think of nostalgia and regret .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lastly , I should note that the movie is semi - autobiographical .Director and writer Takahata experienced a version of these events with his own little sister .Only in reality , he stole food from her .She died , and he survived .Now [ i]that[/i ] would have been an ugly , authentic story worth telling .read more .Novel , Anime : Grave of the Fireflies was originally a semi - autobiographical novel by Akiyuki Nosaka , written as an apology to his younger sister .The novel was written and won the Naoki Prize in 1967 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film was released on April 16th , 1988 in Japanese theatres , and came Stateside courtesy of Central Park Media in 2002 ( oddly enough , this movie was n't picked up by Disney when they licensed the Ghibli movies ) .Story : Grave of the Fireflies is about a dead brother and sister .In case you have n't figured it out yet , this movie is depressing .It approaches and matches Saikano - esque levels of depression , but luckily , it does n't go beyond it .Honestly , you will want to keep anything you can hurt yourself with out of reach when you 're watching this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is the first anime I 've cried at in a very long time , let alone a movie .If you do n't cry when Setsuko finally dies , you are a heartless bastard and then some .Why ?Because it 's so heartbreaking to watch as these children stick with each other through all they go through .It 's hard to watch Seiza trying to keep the fact that their mother is dead from Setsuko .It 's hard to watch Seiza do everything he can to keep Setsuko alive as she slowly starves to death .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also , there is a lot of symbolism in this movie .At points , the symbolism will be so blunt that you will feel like you are being hit over the head with a hammer .But you wo n't mind it all that much .Art :Yeah , it 's fairly obvious that the animation for this is a bit dated .But when you look at anime that were released about the same time ( Macross , Galaxy Express 999 ) , it looks pretty damn good , for its time .Music : I did n't really notice the music for this much .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , average .All - around excellent performances .Length : Perfect .Any longer and I would 've killed myself , any shorter , and it just would n't have had the impact that it did .Overall : An absolutely heartbreaking film , with perfect seiyuu , and pretty good animation , for the time .Another one of my top picks .Go watch it .NOW .Just be sure you keep anything you can hurt yourself with out of your immediate grasp .I 'm surprised there are n't many reviews of Hotaru no Haka ( Grave of the Fireflies ) that question all the praise its received .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you look at Grave of the Fireflies on a critical level , it 's undeniable that you 'll find deep themes and issues about morality ; however , the way that the themes and messages are presented lack genuine feelings of pity or sorrow .The emotions I felt most were , surprisingly enough , irritation and frustration .The story is basically about two siblings attempting to live and survive in a war - stricken Japan during the Second World War .The imagery and the way the story is set up is beautiful , but there was so much wasted potential in the way that the plot progressed that it became underwhelming .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the historical aspect , Grave of the Fireflies gives superb reiteration of the struggles that Japan 's citizens faced in World War II ( fire bombing , lack of food , and destruction of homes ) , and does deserve praise there .In many cases the movie transitions and alternates between deeply depressing to blissful from the perspective an ignorant brother and sister attempting to enjoy leisure activities during war time .I expect that the direction this was supposed to be headed in was showing that despite the cruelties of war , a young man and his sister could still find ways to enjoy life and each other 's ' company .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Character - wise , Grave of the Fireflies suffers immensely .Throughout their ' struggle ' to survive , if you can even call it that , Seita is given a lot of responsibility to shoulder in taking care of his sister , Setsuko .While it is without a doubt an arduous task to raise a child while being a teenager , Seita is depicted as a complete incompetent in his attempts to do so .He literally has one job : take care of his sister .Why could n't he do this when he had many prospects at his disposal ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He finds a place to live after their hometown is destroyed , keeps himself and his sister fed , and is conscious in being delicate with his younger sister 's more fragile psychological well - being .The way he took care of his sister and contemplated thoughts before speaking showed his capability of becoming a refined , mature figure .However , we later see what a useless older brother and guardian he turns out to be .While he 's staying with his Aunt , who is nice enough to let them stay despite shortages of food / supplies , he literally does nothing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He lazes about and utilizes only what supplies and money that was left as an inheritance from his family .He even has the audacity to infer that his aunt is a mean and annoying person when he was simply an ungrateful child .While there are several instances where he degrades himself in attempts to get food in the second half of the movie , resorting to theft , or begging , he is unable to throw away his pride , ultimately leading to both siblings ' demise .It would have been a better movie if Seita was framed as the monster he was , but instead he 's portrayed as a sympathetic martyr figure , which is just stupid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While I can see why they people would think so , her character was ultimately shaped by being spoiled by her family and older brother .I ca n't quite say that she was annoying since she was actually characterized very realistically .Children , if not raised correctly , often act spoiled , entitled , and greedy .Hell , some children who were raised correctly still act that way .The art / animation were , as usual , fantastic as expected of Studio Ghibli .There 's really nothing negative that I can say about it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think the sound portion of the movie , as a whole , was good .There was n't anything that particularly caught my attention , but there was nothing that did n't match the atmosphere of the movie .I would be a liar if I said I enjoyed Grave of the Fireflies .It 's such a pointless , depressing , and frustrating watch that I would personally recommend not watching it .In a historical context , it 's informative and somewhat mind - opening , but extremely lackluster in terms of enjoyability as a movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is likely that they will be less politically charged as Grave of the Fireflies as well . read more .There is this strange sense of realism and probability in these series that you might like if you liked either series .Also a sense of mature responsibility for ones ' siblings .Not to mention the need for growing up quickly and taking charge of what is going on .Both anime have a \" Grave of the Fireflies effect \" that use several ploys to tug at your heart and give a sad feeling .Both are a must watch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Both series have a great psychological drama impact , very well developed .Also , another important thing to mention is that they both share a great sibling relationship as main factor of the story along all the plot .Conclusion , if u've seen one of those , you ca n't miss the other one !It 's the realism that makes these two so similar .Both GOTF and TM8.0 deal with panic and crisis situations .The first centers in the WWII , and Tokyo Magnitude in an eventual earthquake that strikes Japan .Also , the drama , sadness , and death are very important parts to it , and both will bring tears to your eyes , although , being Grave Of The Fireflies a movie from 1988 , you need to enjoy old anime to like this one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "A line from Apocalypse Now sums up Barefoot Gen , in particular : \" The horror , the horror ... \" .Essentially the same film .Barefoot Gen has always , rather unfairly , existed in the shadow of Ghibli 's own ' war through the eyes of innocent children ' masterpiece .Both films are based on the true accounts of child survivors of the bombing of Japan during World War 2 .And in both films children are suddenly thrust into the world of adults : having to find it within themselves to protect their loved ones as their world falls apart around them and chaos ensues .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Gen is far more horrifying than Fireflies , simply because Gen deals with the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima , where as Fireflies deals with the fire - bombing of Kobe .The atomic bomb sequence where skin is shown melting off people 's faces is one of few instances where anime disturbs more than any live - action war movie could ever hope to .In both films the main focus is on the aftermath as the child leads try to survive ; the bombing setting up the rest of the narrative .And in Gen the aftermath is also more unsettling due to radiation sickness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They both give depictions of what it was like after WWII in Japan .Grave of the Fireflies gives the opinion more after the war was nearing it 's end while Barefoot Gen gives perspective of both during and after the war .Not only are both films a must watch - they also share a lot in common .Both lead characters are forced to ' be a man ' at times of tragedy ( despite their age ) and both must come to terms with the losses that occur - as such they are both extremely powerful anti - war movies based on real events the authors went through .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's hard to imagine you 'd like one of these titles and not the other --- they are each a unique and interesting story yet both composed of very similar content and themes .Watch both back - to - back for guaranteed sadness .Both movies make an attempt to depict war through children 's eyes in a realistic manner set during World War II .Hadashi no Gen deals with the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Hotaru no Haka with the bombing of Kobe .In both movies the child leads are forced to cope with the catastrophic aftermath of these events .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But what amplifies the horror tenfold is when children are forced to confront human nature that even adults can not cope with , as they struggle to survive in the midst of war .And this is a subject anime depicts more disturbingly than live - action ever could .Grave of the Fireflies ' is a period piece set during World War 2 , when Japan was being bombed and innocent civilian lives and families were destroyed .An older brother and his dependent younger sister are left with only uncaring relatives as food becomes scarce and starvation becomes a reality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What makes it especially unnerving is that the movie is based on a true story , wrote as a sort of attempt at atonement .You might assume ' Now and Then , Here and There ' would be easier to watch , given that its first episode has its two leads transported from our modern world to another one .Many viewers either wrote the series off or were lured into a false sense of security based on how it began .But what follows goes to darker depths than most fiction ever dares .In its alternate post - apocalyptic world where water is almost non - existent , child soldiers are brainwashed and raised into killers by a deranged Hitler - esque madman ... basically , anime 's take on real world Africa .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wo n't spoil but what happens to Sara is more disturbing than 99 % of fiction .It could only be done in anime . read more .Loss and the betrayal of human decency are key themes in both of these productions .Persecution and inhumanity are portrayed in harsh and realistic ways .Both succeed in pulling the viewer into the middle of the conflict , with a keen sense of empathy for the characters .\" What would I do if faced with this cruelty ?Would my actions really be much different ?\" Both have the same bleakness that never completely destroys the enjoyment factor but it does n't allow viewers to drop their guard either .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
