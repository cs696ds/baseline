{"text": "I was particularly touched by the scene during a raucous town event when Hayden first puts his hand on Selina 's shoulder - when a frisson of unspoken recognition passes between the two characters .Almost as touching as the scenes between Wyman and Hayden were those depicting the relationship between Richard Beymer and Wyman .Despite his circumstances , Roelf has such a thirst for knowledge that he has read the dictionary on his own .Finding that the boy longs to learn the piano , Selina mentors him in his few spare moments , allowing him to practice on the battered upright piano in her schoolroom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The world that this film depicted may seem long ago and far away I was reminded of the simple facts of my own potato farming paternal grandparents ' lives , less than a hundred years ago .Perhaps the Mid - Western roots of the Indiana - born Robert Wise played a role in the attention to detail that the director brought to the earlier part of the film .While some scenes were clearly filmed on a sound stage , the actors brought a keen sense of palpable reality to each of their scenes , lifting any cliched aspects of the tale to a higher plane than expected .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Normally , pluckiness and resourceful characters can be quite appealing , but at this point , the film veered off from credibility , becoming more formulaic as each character seemed to take a turn extolling the nobility of Selina .This entire portion of the movie seems at odds with the earlier sequences , and the performances of the characters lacks dimension and impact .I also thought that the mother 's idea of how to live might have been questioned a bit more pointedly as well , but the movie seemed to paint the characters in broader terms as it went on , losing some of the issues between mother and son unexplored .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
