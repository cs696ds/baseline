{"text": "Bringing the traditional and the experimental ( always overlapping terms ) into closer proximity was one aim of the new Companion .Different kinds of poetry offer different ways of seeing and hearing the world .One of the pleasures , I hope , of browsing such a volume is to move between poets not normally found together in other accounts .Take , for example , three poems by three post - war British poets evoking the same place : Cornwall .The best - known poet of the county is Charles Causley ( 1917 - 2003 ) , who lived in the town of Launceston all his life , and whose Collected Poems span the second half of the 20th century .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We see the lit house against the stormy land as though it were a ship at sea .The sound of Causley 's lines contributes to the creation of the scene , too : the association of the ballad rhythm with the sea - shanty , the rhyme of the human \" door \" and the wild \" moor \" , the panoramic assonance of \" all Cornwall \" .Causley 's experimental contemporary , Bob Cobbing ( 1920 - 2002 ) , pursued an inversely verbal art .For Cobbing , the sound and shape of words were themselves a poetic subject .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Born in Scotland , Graham spent much of his life in south - west Cornwall , where he was friends with the painters living around St Ives .Socialising for Graham was also a source of poetry .Listening to pub - talk , he noted down \" the phrases of drinking and affection \" .In his poem The Thermal Stair , Graham elegizes the artist Peter Lanyon , who was killed in a hang - gliding accident .The opening lines summon up the Atlantic coast that Lanyon painted : \" I called today , Peter , and you were away .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" It is characteristic of Graham to address another person directly in his work .Here , he alludes to places they both knew : the Botallack , Levant , and Ding Dong tin mines , which overlook the ocean .The specificity of the names , spoken without explanation and broken over two lines , suggests the unwillingness of grief to believe that this familiar world is no longer shared .At the end of the poem , Ding Dong returns onomatopoeically , like a funeral bell .It is as if the landscape itself had started to mourn its painter , echoing the poet who intones the dead man 's name in lament : \" Lanyon , why is it you 're earlier away ? / Remember me wherever you listen from .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Born within a couple of years of each other , Causley , Cobbing , and Graham are three original British poets from the second half of the 20th century .I do n't know of any anthology that brings them together .But it interests me that a particular corner of England should be the shared occasion of such different poems .Causley 's Cornwall is a folk rhyme of man and nature , Cobbing 's the lyrical echo of a working culture , and Graham 's an elegiac landscape of private speech .Modern poetry recognises that places themselves are made of words : points on a map between inhabitants that can be traced by a poem .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
