{"text": "Top positive review .4.0 out of 5 stars WARNING !This is NOT , I Repeat , This is NOT a Comedy !By Jonny Lee on May 26 , 2011 .Do you ever hear things through the grapevine that make you want to NOT like a movie ? \"The Dilemma \" was one of those flicks for me .I heard so much bad stuff about it , that where I would typically want to watch it just to see how wrong everybody was , I actually did n't want to see it at all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , I reluctantly picked it up .First off , this was improperly billed as a comedy .WRONG !It 's not even a dark comedy .I laughed all of three times , and only once out loud .It 's all about soul searching and trying to decide how to do what is right in an almost impossibly awkward situation .It 's about questioning whether or not to follow your heart or your head .It 's about seeing honesty for what it truly is .It 's about relationships and the ability to maintain fidelity within one where the entire physical part of it has been removed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now I can see why everyone bashed \" The Dilemma \" from here to Kingdom Come .It was billed as a comedy , and the movie viewers came out of the theater confused as to why they barely laughed , let alone why they hardly cracked a smile .The human psyche is a computer that is programmable .If you program that computer to think that it is going to see an comedy and nothing is funny , the computer goes haywire .Somewhere inside it 's intricate information pathways is the repetitive phrase , \" That does not compute !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I am not a professional movie reviewer , but I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you are planning to be bored .There was a problem loading comments right now .Please try again later .This is over 2 hours long and there are very few laughs if any in this film .The pace is slow and the overall message quite depressing .This is the movie equivalent of a 2 hour budget airline flight .If you want to be uncomfortable and frustrated for 2 hours then this is the film for you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Please try again later .I 'm glad I read the reviews before watching this drama because from the cover of the DVD which state this film is \" Hilarious \" ?I would have been disappointed .The film has a very depressing premise and tries to make some fun out a very touchy situation .James and Vaughn are excellent and both show they 're up to playing more than a couple of goofballs .The problem here is we 're so used to seeing them play goofballs that we keep waiting for them to do something ...... well , goofy !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Except a couple of scenes , the two female characters have little to do .Only Queen Latifah knows what she is doing , even though her character has virtually no place here .The biggest problem with \" The Dilemma \" is , well , Ronny 's \" dilemma \" is not a big dilemma enough after all to make a comedy or a psychodrama .Once you decide on telling ( or not telling ) your best friend the truth , there is not much you can do .Ronny , it seems , thinks otherwise , which is fine , but instead of taking a simple course , he keeps making incredibly stupid decisions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There was a problem loading comments right now .Please try again later .I love Kevin James .I mean , I think the man is hilarious .I also really like Vince Vaughn .Someone does need to warn him that his constant regurgitation of the same comedic character is growing old and that he needs to learn to add a few more layers , but overall his ' funny douchebag ' routine is working out well for him .He makes me laugh .When I saw the trailer for ' The Dilemma ' all those months ago , it looked really promising .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The subject , while in all respective notes NOT funny , could lend itself to astute comedic situations if built upon in the right way .I was excited .The reviews were scathing , and even some word from Ammy friends made me hesitate .I was n't going to rush out to this one ( which is n't a new thing since I rarely make it to the movies to begin with ) .I finally did get around to seeing this this past weekend , and I must say that I was really , really disappointed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The first problem with ' The Dilemma ' is that it skews to the serious and tries too hard to insert the funny instead of allowing it to be a natural progression of character .The situations orchestrated for comedic effect feel forced and out of place because Howard and company are creating an awkwardly thematic production .The first part of the film was such a confusing ride .It felt like it was a drama , not a comedy at all , and the romantic tangles of Vaughn and Connelly felt almost ' 90210 ' with really good lighting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think that the thematic issues would have been more forgivable had the actual dilemma felt more legitimate .I 'm sorry , but if you catch your BEST FRIEND 'S wife cheating on him , you tell him immediately .You do n't wait , you do n't take his preposterous screaming at you ( that scene was just dumb ) as an excuse to walk away .You grab him by the ears and drag him to a room if you have to and then you hold him close and tell him .There is no dilemma .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And then you have the fact that James 's character was n't entirely innocent and so it makes you wonder why all the fuss at all ( I mean , he 's basically doing THE SAME THING ) .The performances are all uniformly fine .Sadly , Connelly is in a different movie because she is strictly dramatic and offers no comedic insight whatsoever .In a way , she gives the best performance of the bunch ( Ryder is also very good ) because she is always in ' tone ' , but she is also the least interesting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I just wish that this movie knew what it wanted to be .It is n't even enough to make it work .The fight scene is epic and made me come close to wetting myself in laughter , but most parts of this film made me feel indifferent .With THE DILEMMA ( 2011 ) , director Ron Howard as usual has small roles for brother Clint and dad Rance , but the film belongs to Vince Vaughn , Winona Ryder and Kevin James .It 's currently rated 5.3 at IMDb , but that figure is way , way too low .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The story climaxes with a therapist intervention scene , but not initially for the reason you 'd expect .The ending is most satisfactory .THE DILEMMA deserves a second look , for it 's a quality film thanks to a fine cast and one of our most talented directors .Also with Jennifer Connelly , Channing Tatum ( as \" Zip \" ) , Queen Latifah and Chelcie Ross ( remember him as the Bardahl - ball pitcher in MAJOR LEAGUE ? )There was a problem loading comments right now .Please try again later .The story line is depressing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
