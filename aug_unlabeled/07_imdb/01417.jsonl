{"text": "Spaghetti Western .Spaghetti Western , also known as Italian Western or Macaroni Western ( primarily in Japan ) , [ 1 ] is a broad subgenre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone 's film - making style and international box - office success .The term was used by American critics and other countries because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians .According to veteran Spaghetti Western actor Aldo Sambrell , the phrase ' Spaghetti Western ' was coined by Spanish journalist Alfonso S\u00e1nchez .[ 2 ] The denomination for these films in Italy is western all'italiana ( Italian - Style Western ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The term Eurowesterns may be used to also include Western movies that were produced in Europe but not called Spaghetti Westerns , like the West German Winnetou films or Ostern Westerns .The majority of the films were international co - productions between Italy and Spain , and sometimes France , Germany , Yugoslavia , or the United States .These movies were originally released in Italian , but as most of the films featured multilingual casts and sound was post - synched , most \" western all'italiana \" do not have an official dominant language .Sergio Leone 's A Fistful of Dollars established the Spaghetti Western as a novel kind of Western .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He betrays and plays the gangs against one another in order to make money .Then he uses his cunning and exceptional weapons skill to assist a family threatened by both gangs .His treachery is exposed and he is severely beaten , but in the end he defeats the remaining gang .Italian Cinema often borrowed from other films without regard for infringement and Leone famously borrowed the plot for Fistful , receiving a letter from Japanese director Akira Kurosawa congratulating him on making \" ... a very fine film .But it is my film \" .Leone had wisely imitated one of the most highly respected directors in the world by remaking his film Yojimbo as Fistful and consequently surrendered Asian rights to Kurosawa , plus 15 percent of the international box office .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Leone 's films and other \" core \" Spaghetti Westerns are often described as having eschewed , criticised or even \" demythologized \" [ 8 ] many of the conventions of traditional US Westerns .This was partly intentional and partly the context of a different cultural background .[ 9 ] .Use of pathos received a big boost with Sergio Corbucci 's influential Django .However , in the following years use of cunning and irony became more prominent .This was seen in Leone 's next two Westerns , with their emphasis on unstable partnerships .In the last phase of the Spaghetti Western , with the Trinity films , the Leone legacy had been transformed almost beyond recognition , as terror and deadly violence gave way to harmless brawling and low comedy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the 1960s , critics recognized that the American genres were rapidly changing .The genre most identifiably American , the Western , seemed to be evolving into a new rougher beast .For many critics , Sergio Leone 's films were part of the problem .Leone 's Dollars Trilogy ( 1964 - 1966 ) was not the beginning of the \" Spaghetti Western \" cycle in Italy , but for Americans Leone 's films represented the true beginning of the Italian invasion of their privileged cultural form .Sir Christopher Frayling , in his noted book on the Italian Western , describes American critical reception of the Spaghetti Western cycle as , to \" a large extent , confined to a sterile debate about the ' cultural roots ' of the American / Hollywood Western .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Pauline Kael , she notes , was willing to acknowledge this critical ennui and thus appreciate how a film such as Akira Kurosawa 's Yojimbo ( 1961 ) \" could exploit the conventions of the Western genre , while debunking its morality . \" Frayling and other film scholars such as Bondanella argue that this revisionism was the key to Leone 's success and , to some degree , to that of the Spaghetti Western genre as a whole .[ 12 ] .European Westerns are as old as filmmaking itself .The Lumi\u00e8re brothers made their first public screening of films in 1895 and already in 1896 Gabriel Veyre shot Repas d'Indien ( \" Indian Banquet \" ) for them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "[ 13 ] .In Italy , the American West as a dramatic setting for spectacles goes back at least as far as Giacomo Puccini 's 1910 opera La fanciulla del West ; it is sometimes considered to be the first Spaghetti Western .[14 ] [ 15 ] The first Italian Western movie was La Vampira Indiana ( 1913 ) - a combination of Western and vampire film .It was directed by Vincenzo Leone , father of Sergio Leone , and starred his mother Bice Walerian in the title role as Indian princess fatale .[16 ] The Italians also made Wild Bill Hickok films , while the German twenties saw back - woods Westerns featuring Bela Lugosi as Uncas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "17 ] During and after the Second World War there were scattered European uses of Western settings , mostly for comedy or even musical comedy .The first American - British western filmed in Spain was The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw ( 1958 ) , directed by Raoul Walsh .It was followed in 1961 by Savage Guns , this time a British - Spanish western , again filmed in Spain .This marked the beginning of Spain as a suitable film shooting location for any kind of European western .Since there is no real consensus about where to draw the exact line between Spaghetti Westerns and other Eurowesterns ( or other Westerns in general ) one can not say which one of the films mentioned so far really was the first Spaghetti Western .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Furthermore , by far the most commercially successful of this lot was Sergio Leone 's A Fistful of Dollars whose innovations in cinematic style , music , acting , and story decided the future for the genre .The Spaghetti Western was born , flourished and faded in a highly commercial production environment .The Italian \" low \" popular film production was basically low - budget and low - profit , and the easiest way to success was imitating a proven success .[19 ] When the typically low - budget production A Fistful of Dollars turned into a remarkable box office success , the industry eagerly lapped up its innovations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For love interest , rancher 's daughters , schoolmarms and barroom maidens were overshadowed by young Latin women ( sometimes mothers ) desired by dangerous men , where actresses like Nicoletta Machiavelli or Rosalba Neri carried on Marianne Koch 's role of Marisol in the Leone film .In the beginning some films mixed some of these new devices ( more or less uneasily ) with the borrowed US Western devices typical for most of the 1963 - 64 Spaghetti Westerns .In the same director 's Johnny Oro ( 1966 ) a traditional Western sheriff and a half - breed bounty killer are forced into an uneasy alliance when Mexican bandits and Indians ( ! ) together assault the town .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the end he turns out to also be an avenger .In the following years there was a deluge of Spaghetti Westerns with a pair of heroes with ( most often ) conflicting motives .The theme of age in For a Few Dollars More , where the younger bounty killer eventually bests his more experienced colleague , is taken up in Day of Anger and Death Rides a Horse .In both cases Lee Van Cleef carries on as the older hero versus Giuliano Gemma and John Phillip Law , respectively .Sergio Corbucci 's The Mercenary and Compa\u00f1eros also belong here , as does Tepepa by Giulio Petroni - among others .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They are often interpreted as a leftist critique of the typical Hollywood handling of Mexican revolutions , and of imperialism in general .[21 ] .Sergio Corbucci 's Django , while highly controversial at the time of its release due to its level of violence , set new standards for Spaghetti Western film making .Beside the first three Spaghetti Westerns by Leone , a most influential film was Sergio Corbucci 's Django starring Franco Nero .Indicative of this film 's influence on the Spaghetti Western style , Django is the hero 's name in a plenitude of subsequent westerns .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In 1968 , the wave of Spaghetti Westerns reached its crest , comprising one - third of the Italian film production , only to collapse to one - tenth in 1969 .However , the considerable box office success of Enzo Barboni 's They Call Me Trinity and the pyramidal one of its follow - up Trinity Is Still My Name gave Italian filmmakers a new model to emulate .The main characters were played by Terence Hill and Bud Spencer , who had already cooperated as hero pair in the \" old style \" Spaghetti Westerns God Forgives ...", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Barboni films are burlesque comedies that replace gunplay and blood with set piece brawls .They feature the quick but lazy Trinity ( Hill ) and his big , strong and irritable brother Bambino ( Spencer ) .The stories make fun of U.S. Western - style diligent farmers and Spaghetti Western - style bounty hunters .There was a wave of Trinity - inspired films with quick and strong heroes , the former kind often called Trinity or perhaps coming from \" a place called Trinity \" , and with no ( or few ) killings .Because the two model stories contained religious pacifists to account for the absence of gunplay , all the successors contained religious groups or at least priests ( sometimes as one of the heroes ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "[ citation needed ] .Special interest audiences might also nurture a cult of the \" Worst \" , as exemplified in the interest for a director like Ed Wood .His Spaghetti Western equivalent would be the Western \u0153uvre of Demofilo Fidani .The Stranger ( 1995 film ) is essentially , the Woman with No Name , with a motorcycle instead of a horse .[ 25 ] .The few Spaghetti Westerns containing historical characters like Buffalo Bill , Wyatt Earp , Billy the Kid etc . mainly appear before A Fistful of Dollars had put its mark on the genre .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When they appear they are more often portrayed as victims of discrimination than as dangerous foes .A celebrity from another sphere of culture is Italian author / film director Pier Paolo Pasolini , who plays a revolutionary man of the church in Requiescant .This film concerns oppression of poor Mexicans by rich Anglos and ends on a call for arms but it does not fit easily as a Zapata Western .The same can be said for The Price of Power , a political allegory where an American president is assassinated in Dallas by a conspiracy of Southern racists who frame an innocent Afro - American .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Though the Spaghetti Westerns from A Fistful of Dollars and on featured more violence and killings than earlier American Western films , they generally shared the parental genre 's restrictive attitude toward explicit sexuality .However , in response to the growing commercial success of various shades of sex films , there was a greater exposure of naked skin in some Spaghetti Westerns , among others Dead Men Ride and Heads or Tails .In the former and ( partly ) the latter , the sex scenes feature coercion and violence against women .The American animated film Rango incorporates elements of Spaghetti Westerns , including a character modeled after The Man With No Name .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Australian band The Tango Saloon combines elements of Tango music with influences from Spaghetti Western scores .The psychobilly band Ghoultown also derives influence from Spaghetti Westerns .The music video for the song \" Knights of Cydonia \" by the English rock band Muse was influenced by Spaghetti Westerns .The band Big Audio Dynamite used music samples from Spaghetti Westerns when mixing their song \" Medicine Show \" .Within the song you can hear samples from Spaghetti Western movies such as , A Fistful of Dollars , The Good , The Bad and The Ugly , and Duck You Sucker .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
