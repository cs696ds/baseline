{"text": "Worst film you 've ever seen .Ghosts on Mars .I like to rent science fiction video films .My girlfriend thinks I 'm a total geek but I ca n't help it .Usually they are quite decent , sometimes even good , but last night I think hit an all time low .I should have known when the intro music was hard rock guitar .About 90 minutes later I realized that I had had my life time doze of marsian colonists turned into satanist worshipers wildly swinging home made axes , mysterious gas clouds carrying the ancient real marsians and taking over the humans by entering through the ear ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact , the only consolation was seeing Pam Grier in a new outfit ;) .LoTR- I have to agree- it was a travesty .What a waste !And the next two are going to be just as bad-I 'll still go and see them though- what a sucker !DrCool : I have never found anyone else who shares my sentiments but I thought Gladiator was terrible .Add me to your list .In my mind it was almost as unwatchable as The Matrix .But then I find myself in a very small minority of people who thing The Matrix is one of the most stupid movies ever made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Who wrote that script ?Bill Gates ?Ok Dante !Illd hand it to you for those Willis films and the glover non action films .There are some good ones there .The Player was excellent .As far as your best films that also won academy awards , I see your point .Some good ones do slip through all the political correct voting system that generally results in mediocre middle - of - the - road stuff .I also notice that these are generally older films , before the whole voting system became so much of a hollywood insider popularity contest .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Disclaimer : All people should ignore my preferences .I have nt had time to watch movies for about 10 years , and those i see are usually on an airplane ... .Thanks for reminding about that wonderful Plan 9 movie .Now if you could only identify those ones i could nt remember on the \" Best \" thread .I ve noted down your ist post .you sound like you have the same sort of preferences as me , and if i ever get to watch movies without a meal tray in front of me with tinny headphones on a bumpy plane , I will remember them !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nobody else belives me except my partner at the time , but that really did physically put me to sleep !Had been working very hard for that week and as soon as i saw that plush seat I just went all drowsy after 10 mins and woke up 10 minutes before the end , looking at people who were laughing and pointing at me ... .Hmmm , I must be out of step ...I thought LOTR did a good job of converting the book to film - I came expecting the worst , and was surprised at how closely the characters and setting matched what my mind had created from the books .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As far as knowing what was going to happen 5 minutes in , I assumed that everyone knew what was going to happen before they arrived in the theater .There are actually people who never read the books ?I rather liked Gladiator , too , and Independence Day was fairly watchable if you turned your brain off .Thanks for the warning on Ghosts of Mars , I was thinking about renting it ... .I 've been a fan of lord of the rings for almost 30 years and have read the books 32 times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is also an extended version due to come out on video shortly which even includes the scenes that were not included - my understanding is the extended version has just about everything .Book / movie conversions are often pretty dicey .Last year had two reasonably faithful adaptations , Harry Potter and LOTR , both of which seemed to appeal to loyal readers as well as new fans .That 's tough to do , IMO , as readers almost always want every detail of the book included ( e.g. , all the people who could n't imagine why the movie left out Tom Bombadil ) , while moviegoers expect a couple of hours of fast - paced entertainment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Going way back to Dune - that movie was relatively faithful to the book , which probably made it incomprehensible to the average guy who stumbled into the theater ... .I 've loved those books for a long time and they were the first books that got me really excited about reading .I remember looking at them and saying \" phew- they 're really big ! \"A couple of weeks later I had finished them after abandoning my social life completely .The films , on the other hand , were just a waste of time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That s not a problem for me , I did n't ever think the films could live up to the books anyway , so I really am not that bothered about that so much .But I do think that the attempt to convey the wonder of the book on film should have been half decent- it was n't .It was boring with a capital B and I really wish they had n't bothered .Just because you can wow people with special effects does n't mean that its a good movie .It could be a lesson in why the person who oversees continuity has such an important job in making a movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just awful ; made no sense at all .The one thing that makes it interesting , however , is the truly bizarre performance by Marlon Brando , which is worth the cost of a rental .Then there are the movies that are so bad they fun to watch -- well , at least watch once .Has anybody seen Nice Girls Do n't Explode ?How about Assault of the Killer Bimbos ?The latter is notable for having one of the longest \" deaths \" of any movie I 've seen .Like a monster in a horror movie ( or the dog in The Omen ) who just does n't die no matter how many bullets are pumped into it , a normal human goes through this for at least 10 minutes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I ca n't beleive nobody mentioned \" Buffalo ' 66 \" , which is what you get when you take a great ( though un - original ) idea and then film it while ( allegedly ) high on amphetamines .Example : \" What 's this ?Is this a shifting car ?Do I have to shift gears ?My car is a Luxury car : Cadillac Eldorado , that 's my car .It shifts itself , it shifts itself .Luxury car , do you understand ?I do n't have to shift it .LUXURY CAR ! \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's amusing if you watch movies while consuming cheap beer .It 's Ed Wood - esque in its execution , except the scenes are consistent with regards to time continuance ( no day / night / day in the same scene ) .The worst film I have EVER seen has to be Life Flight .There 's 5 storys about people who have accidents from various activities , and then the principal characters end up doing something that \" The Good Lord \" does n't want them to , and end up in the Hospital .There is an interesting Altman / Tarantino type plot twist that is executed horribly , making you groan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It is a documentary about a indie film maker trying to get his movie made .He is a drunk white trash rocker guy and his friends and family are hilarious .I watched it last week and thought it was great .Uncle Bill is the most memorable character in the film .One detail that bothers me the most : The Dime that Kate Winslet gives DiCaprio is a Roosevelt Dime .Roosevelt would n't have even been president for another 20 years when Titanic went down , much less have his head on currency . titanic ( sure sure , it was n't meant to be historical , but if you 're gon na change history , why not at least make it more interesting than reality ? ) the matrix not so much because it sucked ( it may not have without kanotact reeves ) but because the concept had everything it needed to truly be an epic film , they could have made it amazing , instead they made it crap .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fear and loatheing in Las Veagas ( saw 30 mins in the service and left it sucked ) Tremors Arnold movies Van damme movies Stalone moves Best in show Any movie where by in the first 10 minutes the movie can be over with the use of a shotgun .Mainly horror movies .Fear and loatheing in Las Veagas ( saw 30 mins in the service and left it sucked ) .bah , Fear and Loathing is one of those big idea stories .Hunter S was rather brilliantly portrayed by johnny depp ( who does rather well in messed up roles , anyone see dead man ? ) - all in all it 's a disturbing movie , but necessary . much like a clockwork orange . suckiest movie ever : Urban Legends II the final cut .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of the worst films I 've ever seen is \" Orgy Of The Dead .\" That movie is so bad that it 's good .The acting ( what little there is of it ) totally sucks , the special effects are really bad , and there is very little plot to it .Despite that , my friends and I love to watch it just to make fun of it .But hands down , the worst movies that I 've ever seen were Seven and Legends Of The Fall .Besides sci - fi I love comedies , so I 'll throw in a movie from that genre : Little Nicky Man was that terrible and lame .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And it 's not like I do n't like stupid comedy sometimes , I mean I enjoyed Blazing Saddles for example .I hated Pearl Harbor , way too much love for a war movie .After awhile I started to fast forward as soon as that woman 's face filled the screen and was able to watch that movie in 70 minutes .However , the movie I would least like to see again is ............Gone with the Wind .I can not believe people actually like that movie , it is a long tedious love story which is interrupted by the Civil War .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
