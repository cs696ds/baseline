{"text": "Michael Jordan 's sons gone wild ?Media Take Out has obtained photos of NBA legend Michael Jordan 's two teenage sons , 18-year - old Jeffrey Jordan and 16-year - old Marcus Jordan , engaged in some illegal behavior during what is said to have been a recent vacation .Most of the photos show the two underage young men , who are both still in high school , drinking , smoking and dancing provocatively with girls , but the most \" controversial \" picture is the one of Marcus allegedly passed out in his own vomit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Have you even looked at the photos ?I do n't see any outrageous behaviour on them , just some teenagers having fun .In my opinion the only strange ( and gross ) picture is the one with his head in the sink .Yes , we looked at the photos .Wow .That 's pretty offensive .This behavior is VERY different than that of a lot of teenagers .Their age does n't excuse this disgusting behavior , and writing that it 's just \" typical \" is what 's making it more and more acceptable in this day and age for young people to act like this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's obvious that someone from within their own camp would have the access and opportunity to leak these photos .Hopefully both boys will learn from this and realize that when you are the child of a celebrity your actions are subject to public scrutiny .bk , is it rude for me to ask how old you are ( you do n't have to say if you do n't want to ) .Because I am on the younger side , and I can assure you that what Jeffrey and Marcus did is not \" VERY different than that of a lot of teenagers \" in the least .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think a common misconception regarding teens who drink , smoke , and act provocatively around girls is that they are lower - class people who do n't know any better .The reality is that MANY teens who get wonderful grades , participate in one activity after the other , and whose parents bring in six - figure salaries spend their weekends getting smashed , having sex , and generally acting inappropriately .It is not an issue of class anymore ; it has gotten to a point where the kids who do n't smoke , drink , or have sex can be counted on both hands instead of the other way around .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I could post far worse ones ! ) , but the thought that they are being unusually outragous is wrong .This is how teenagers act nowadays , for better or for worse .To say that a large number of teenagers across this country do n't have experiences like this is just plain naive .Sure , there are always exceptions but in general , come on now .That just makes me laugh out loud ..... .I agree with Lauren-I 'm not saying its ok , but it does happen .I 'm 21 and now a responsible mother who does not party or anything , and yes , I did party just like that !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would go out with these kids that I met at work and I could not believe how they partied and how they acted , and I was from lower middle class and they are upper middle class people .People like to generalize that lower class people are more prone to drug use and poor behavior , but I beg to differ .Wealthier people have the money to go out and put it up their nose .( just an example )I just hope you all are n't sitting at home saying that you children will never do anything like that , because they probably will .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Who are we to judge ? !I think in this day and age it is normal for children to experiment as long as they do nt take it to the extreme .Also we are lead to believe that all these boys are interested in is sex , drugs and alcohol , yet this is just one set of pictures .However they were stupid not to think that pictures like this would not end up on the internet .I did n't think that there was anything illegal about drinking once you are 18 and smoking once you are 16 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I know alot of kids of my age ( 13 ) and younger who do those things and worse(drugs , sex ) .In the United States , the age to buy cigarettes is 18 , and the drinking age is 21 .pink.lioness on May 22nd , 2007 .Who can really judge these boys ?Things are n't always the way the seem .20-odd years ago my friends , my older brother and I had some pretty wild parties as well - no drugs or sex back then but plenty of drinks to go around and a lot of fun .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nobody who knows us now would believe that but if there had been photos of us from those days , oh my god !I 'd have been labelled a pretty bad kid I suppose .I did this sort of thing as a teenager , but in Australia .I was a regular bingedrinker at the age of 14/15 .I was lucky that cigarette and \" other \" smoke made me sick , or I would have been doing that too .Funnily enough , I do n't drink at all now , except for cooking with red wine occasionally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I teach at a university here and a lot of my first year students are still in this boozing phase where they go out twice a week and drink until they 're blotto .Unfortunately we have a social drinking culture ... because it 's legal , it 's acceptable behaviour for adults , so kids like to do it too .I 'm not condoning this behaviour , but it does happen ( and not just in the US ) .augustmoon6075 on May 22nd , 2007 .I do n't see it necessary to insult all other 16 - 18 year olds just to make these two feel better about themselves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" What 's the point ?I wonder where they are on vacation .Perhaps they are outside the US where there is no drinking age or the drinking age is 16 or so .Then what they were doing would not be illegal .I think smoking and drinking , for many teens , is just a normal part of growing up and being somewhat rebellious .I know when I was 16/17/18 , I also went out and smoke and drank and danced provacatively .Not ALL teens do , but many of them do .How do I know ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't see these photos as anything to raise a ruckus about .Just because \" everyone is doing it \" does NOT make it right ....That is a classic phrase , but it will always ring true in my book !Where were these boy 's parent 's ? ? ?this is so obnoxious , no one would care about them doing these if they were n't micheal jordans kids beucase yes every teenager is doing this kind of stuff .I am a teenager at their school and my guess is it is n't anyone at our school letting these pictures leak .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lay off of them !Yes , teenagers do drink and smoke and have sex .This even happens in small , middle class , midwest towns .IMO , you ca n't just get all high and mighty with teenagers and forbid them to do things .I hope I have gotten through to them .I have always stressed to them that they can always tell me anything that is going on in their lives and I will listen .Many of my daughter 's friends tell me that they can not talk to their parents because the parents get all high and mighty and do n't listen to them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
