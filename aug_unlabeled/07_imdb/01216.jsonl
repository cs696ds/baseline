{"text": "Filled with adventure , unconditional friendship , and lots of laughter , POOH 'S HEFFALUMP HALLOWEEN MOVIE is a sweet treat for the whole family .Halloween can be a frightening time of year for piglets and young Heffalumps , but the power of unconditional friendship should never be underestimated .When a fierce \" Gobloon \" and an absence of candy threaten to ruin .5 Comments : .Review by Monty Moonlight for Pooh 's Heffalump Halloween Movie Rating : Little Roo is filled with excitement over being able to introduce his new friend , Lumpy the Heffalump , to his first Halloween ever !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Amidst all the excitement , Pooh devours the candy to be used for the festivities that evening , and everyone is at a loss for where to get more .Luckily , Tigger has told everyone his story about the Gobloon , a magical creature that grants a wish to anyone who catches him , but who will turn you into a Jaggedy Lantern if he catches you !Roo decides the only way to get more candy for everyone is to catch the Gobloon and WISH for more !After some convincing , Lumpy agrees to go with him , but their dark and frightening travels through the Hundred Acre Wood reduce Lumpy to a state of utter fright .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , occasionally , Disney releases an \" All New \" direct - to - video movie that is really just a compilation of TV show episodes or specials .This is often the case with Pooh and the gang direct - to - video releases .On the bright side , there is quite a bit of all new footage here too .In fact , if they had left the flashback to the old Halloween special out , they 'd basically have a pretty solid \" all new \" Holiday Special on their hands .Perhaps they should have just kept the two separate , but released them together on the one DVD .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Regardless , the older , 22-minute TV special ( minus the credits and with some re - narrating ) fits in well enough within the context of the new Heffalump plot , and the older footage looks only SLIGHTLY different .Two other issues come to mind though .One , this film is more targeted at young children than the \" whole family , \" made clear with the focus on Roo and the new Heffalump character , Lumpy .Personally , I 'm not totally in love with the Lumpy addition to the cast yet , though perhaps my problem is that I have n't seen the theatrical \" Pooh 's Heffalump Movie \" yet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even the inclusion of \" Boo To You , Too , Winnie the Pooh , \" does n't help much , as it was n't the most captivating of Halloween specials .Let me put it this way : The new footage , which is pretty much its own story , even though it surrounds the old Halloween special , focuses on Roo and Lumpy , as I stated before .The older footage , the made - for - television Halloween Special , focuses on Piglet .These , in my opinion , are not the most interesting Pooh cast members .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Do n't get me wrong , I love the Pooh movies , and maybe if I had watched this in the family room , on the large TV with the volume blasting , well , I probably would n't have had a problem then .However , when you cut back on the scenes with Tigger and Pooh , the Hundred Acre Wood gang is a little less entrancing .Still , I am not saying this DVD is n't worth owning .If you are a fan of Halloween programs and the Pooh gang , it 's not without its charm and is definitely a must have .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact , I 've heard some folks say they prefer this Halloween themed release to \" Pooh 's Heffalump Movie .\" I really need to pick that one up and give it a watch .Over time though , I 'm sure I 'll realize that I more often reach for this longer Halloween \" movie , \" with it 's very nice picture and sound , over the old VHS , and will finally part ways with it .Though , I do hope that we eventually see a Winnie the Pooh \" Holiday Collection \" of the television specials , much like the Garfield one that is currently available and that I highly recommend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As for the DVD extras , well , there is n't much for an adult to be too thrilled about here , unless you are trying to plan some Halloween games for a group of kiddies .The extras basically include 3 games and a party planner ( which just gives details on how to set up the 3 games ) .The first of the three games is n't half bad , and is basically a \" look and find \" game for little kiddies .The other two games are n't remote control games , but rather a hot potato type game called \" Pass the Pumpkin , \" for which the DVD provides the music , and a Bingo game for which the DVD handles the number calling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yeah , unless you 're planning this kind of party , the only real reason to buy this film is because you love Pooh and Halloween programs , which I do .It 's a bit overpriced ( at 14.88 or thereabouts most places ) , but it 's a worthy addition to your Pooh or Halloween DVD collection .Review by Roberts Mommy for Pooh 's Heffalump Halloween Movie Rating : My 2 year old loves Pooh all of a sudden .He sits & watches this movie with his stuffed Pooh bear .He has never seen the other movies that the other reviewers mentioned,(the flashbacks are supposedly from another movie ) so we have no complaints .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Review by G. W. Hallin for Pooh 's Heffalump Halloween Movie Rating : I have never seen nearly an entire old video embedded in a new one .Disney 's \" Boo To You , Too \" takes up about half the movie in a cheap \" flashback \" ten minutes into the new movie .Now , \" Boo To You , Too \" was fairly entertaining on its own , but I can not get over the audacity to lift it nearly whole into this new one .Et Tu , Mickey ?Review by Nicole D. Hayes for Pooh 's Heffalump Halloween Movie Rating : This movie was not quite what we expected .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Grandparents and my 3.5 yr old alike .Everyone loves it !So , as you can imagine , we were anticipating the Halloween Heffalump movie .My son was counting the days so to speak .It was hard to find ... even my local Disney store did not get in in upon release ...But finally I found it ... but when we watched it , we were disappointed .This movie basically recycled \" Boo to you too \" the first pooh halloween movie .Most of the cute scenes involving Roo and Lumpy were shown in the trailers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He actually came and sat in my lap and hid his head as he was frightened .The \" Gablooon \" was little bit much for a toddler if you ask me .Too much of Piglet 's story and not nearly enough Lumpy and Roo ....A few days later , I went out and bought Max and Ruby 's Halloween ... he LOVES it and would watch it over and over !Cute not scary and you get 10 + bonus episodes , a much greater value !Review by Seth J. Schwartz for Pooh 's Heffalump Halloween Movie Rating : This movie was a BIG disappointment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
