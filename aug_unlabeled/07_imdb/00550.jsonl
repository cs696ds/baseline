{"text": "What did the war do to us ? \"The director deliberately omitted a voice - over narration , to avoid the ' voice of god ' effect common to documentaries .This would have not been a problem when the film was released since the events were fresh .But since the film is largely about the effects of war rather than a historical analysis , this lack of detailed information does not affect the film 's power .When I first saw the film ( in 1976 , I think ) it made a huge impact on me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "During the Vietnam war , news crews were free to roam the battlefield and so you had plenty of footage of the effects of the bombing and the shattered lives and property of the people at the receiving end of it .You also saw the casual brutality of the occupying forces towards the people of Vietnam .I was doubtful if the film would have the same impact on me thirty years later but it did .The interviews with villagers whose family members had been killed , their mud and thatch homes set on fire or brought to rubble by high altitude bombings were heartbreaking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the end , the film provides answers to the questions \" What did we do there ?What did the war do to us ? \" but the first question \" Why did we invade Vietnam ? \" remains unanswered , even to this day , just like the question \" Why did the US invade Iraq ? \" In fact , the parallels with Iraq are eerie .By 1968 or so , it was clear that US policy makers had realized that Vietnam was ' lost . 'But rather than admit it and stop the war , they hoped to create some distance from the looming defeat by withdrawing US combat troops and replacing them with South Vietnamese forces so that when the end came , the US might avoid being seen as the loser .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film argues that this bombing was largely meant for US domestic consumption , to signify that the US retained muscular power , although the US the government had already accepted the fact that the forces opposed to them would never give up until they achieved full victory .We can see the same thing happening in Iraq now .I suspect that the US government has realized that Iraq is ' lost ' and is desperately seeking a way to disengage from the fighting while still maintaining a significant military presence in the massive permanent bases it is building there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is also currently a escalation of the bombing campaign in Iraq , largely unreported in the US , creating an increasing number of civilian deaths .Even railway stations are being bombed .As William S. Lind observes , increased bombing is usually a sign of failure : \" Nothing could testify more powerfully to the failure of U.S. efforts on the ground in Iraq than a ramp - up in airstrikes .Calling in air is the last , desperate , and usually futile action of an army that is losing .If anyone still wonders whether the \" surge \" is working , the increase in air strikes offers a definitive answer : it is n't . \" Hearts and Minds is a landmark film and should be seen by everyone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
