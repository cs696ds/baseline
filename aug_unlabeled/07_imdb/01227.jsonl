{"text": "The owner of a liquor store finds a dusty box of really cheap wine called Tenafly Viper in a crawlspace .He then begins to sell it off at a dollar a bottle .The cheap wine is obviously bad but sells it to the local hobo 's anyway .Little did he know , that everyone who drinks it melts almost instantaneously .This film was originally supposed to offend everyone , but it became a favorite for midnight viewings .This cult classic has recently been released by Synapse Films twice .The first release had really awesome Tenafly Viper labels , with almost nothing else except a trailer and some notes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This films effects are just amazing .The people bubble and melt down spewing purple and green goo .Keep a look out for random breast shots also .Who knew a movie about melting liqour could be one of the greatest horror - comedies of the 80 's .Watching people melt into a shitty toilet , what could possibly be wrong with this film ?A spate of killings of teenagers by a maniac dressed like a hippie causes a detective to check the records for similar killings .He discovers that every five years , in the fifth month of the year , for five consecutive days , the same type of killings has occurred , and the few descriptions of the suspect always match : he 's dressed like a hippie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The acting in 555 , considering what kind of movie this is , the acting is actually really good .Most shot on videos have some of the worst god awful acting you will see , but 555 is somewhat watchable .This movie is pretty gory ; it has some really cheesy effects though .The effects range from an awesome looking decapitation to random stabbings there cheesy purple looking blood is shooting from the wounds .There is lots of T&A in this movie .There is lots of random nude scenes before the hippie killer comes and starts the slaying of the innocent lovers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Movies like this are n't for everyone .If you do n't like really low budget cheese fest this is most defiantly not for you .But if you go in to it with an open mind I think you will have a really good time with this movie .It is one of the best shot on video movies but sadly it is one of the hardest to find , you are lucky if you see 2 - 3 copies of this on eBay .But if you can find this movie , snatch it up it is pure gold .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film plays \" Memento \" style .The movie opens with two men talking in a cell ( The characters from Gasper Noe 's other film , I Stand Alone ) about how the one had sex with his daughter , and then the film continues with the ending .A scene that I can not , No , Will not talk about because when you see it , I want you to be as horrified as I was .After that , the film plays in reverse chronological order , with the film ending with the beginning of the story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film unflinchingly has a rape scene , in all its graphic brutality that lasts for more than nine minutes .The camera styles that this French Auteur uses are remarkable .This movie cares about its characters but has no pity for them .WARNING : Do not watch if you get easily offended or if your morale values are too high .The soundtrack consists of eerie groans , crowded streets , and chaos .Monica Belluci 's role is heartbreaking in this film .She is such a beautiful woman , its horrible to see such brutality happen to her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This film is , a horrible , disgusting , honest movie .Do not watch if you are in the throes of sadness .While playing with a puzzle , a teenager is repressed by his mother , and he kills her and severs her body with an ax .Forty years later , in an university campus in Boston , a serial killer kills young women and severs their bodies in parts , stealing body pieces from each student .Pieces is not a very good movie by any means .Is it watchable ?Well possibly once or twice but its far from a masterpieces .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Everything seems over acted and people do n't really seem to worried about the grizzly chainsaw murders that have been happing .As for the gore , did this shock and disgust people in the 80 's ?The gore is really weak in this film , nothing really too special about it .There is not a whole bunch of it either .You think possibly there could be a whole bunch of T&A(tits and asses ) to save the movie well , there is some mild T&A not a ton , but it is extremely hard to see due to the film looking like complete shit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No , this film is not easy on the eyes ; the picture is really blurry and has a lot of scratches on the film .Mainly because it was just a copy of the VHS , yet when it says on the back of the DVD case that it was re - mastered , ha .Butchery and Carnage will Reign upon all who enter THE REDSIN TOWER .Mitch and Kim were in a long six year relationship when Kim decided to break up with Mitch .Mitch looses his mind and will do anything to get Kim back , even kill .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Mitch follows them the entire way there and ends up getting his ass beat at a gas station .He continues to follow them to the tower to get Kim back .The Redsin Tower is Toe Tag Pictures first film that steps away from the fake snuff underground vibe .They did an awesome job with film and is extremely well made .All of the actors are unknown actors and all do a terrific job with all of there roles , also the effects / gore in the film are top notch as you would expect from any Toe Tag Pictures film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
