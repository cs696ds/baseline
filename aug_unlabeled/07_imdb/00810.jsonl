{"text": "Why Kali Wo n't Rage : A Critique of Indian Feminism . by Rita Banerji , Calcutta , India . 1 Two unique factors distinguish Indian feminism from the feminism in the west .One , it rejects the notion of a deep - rooted , tradition - fed gender hierarchy in India , defined , dominated and exploited by men .Secondly - it does not ascribe the abysmal state of women in India to longstanding patriarchal oppression , and hence sees no reason to rage against it .While to western feminists , these factors might seem oddly perplexing , there is within Indian feminism a rationalization of these outlooks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "A majority of rape cases in India are never even filed with the police .The general fear , particularly among the women of the lower economic strata , is not just that the police will disregard their complaints , but that they might see it as motive for rape .There have been numerous cases of women being raped by the police , when they went in to file a rape charge ( The Times of India , Girl Who Accused ) .The council declared Imrana \" polluted \" and ordered her to divorce her husband and marry her father - in - law , while the village ostracized her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "India 's feminist movement needs to clearly recognize that the gender roles defined by Indian culture and traditions both perpetuate Indian women 's internalization of their social oppression , as well as give leeway to men to exercise their tyranny on them .Interviews with battered women show that the one crucial characteristic that most of these women shared was their tendency to accept traditional gender roles ( Avni ) .Studies show that gender scripts , roles , and attitude to violence on women , are learnt primarily through observations of other people 's behaviors - at home , in school , in religious institutions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Studies show that the difference in the degree of gender based discrimination , repression and violence that exists in different societies is determined by what is socially permissible in each society ( Crowell 58 , 62 ) .The excessive violence and acute oppression of women in India exists because there is a cultural and social sanction for it .Indian feminists must use aggressive public and media propaganda to create a social and psychological environment of acceptability , support and esteem for those who do violate gender norms .The few attempts to engage with the public on gender issues have been indirect and suggestive , like \" Save the girl child .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
