{"text": "It will be released on DVD in this country on September 15 by Oscilloscope Laboratories .Azazel Jacobs 's low - budget second feature Momma 's Man ( 2008 ) serves as yet another example of an independent film that deliberately blurs the line between non - fiction and fiction as an alternative narrative strategy ( see previous post ) .The thirty - something protagonist is roughly the writer / director 's age .Jacobs sets the film in the lower - Manhattan loft in which he grew up , casts his own parents - noted avant - garde filmmaker Ken Jacobs and painter Flo Jacobs - in the role of parents , and his best friend from high school as , well , his best friend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "OTOH , I do concur with Ken 's assessment that Mary - Louise Parker is hot .I think the reason she 's often overlooked as a sex symbol is that she is fairly plain looking .Her acting ability is decent ; she gets the short - end of the stick sometimes because she 's been frequently upstaged in movies with top - notch talent - Whoopi Goldberg in Boys on the Side , Jessica Tandy and Cicely Tyson in Fried Green Tomatoes , etc . .It starts good , with Willis packing more funny into a retiree wordlessly going through his morning rituals than a lot of comedians can manage in the same number of seconds of high - decibel mugging .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
