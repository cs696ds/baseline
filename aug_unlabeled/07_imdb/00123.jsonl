{"text": "But Michael Small and BT McNicholl , who wrote the book for the show , have raised the level of conflict in the story to better hold our attention .McNicholl has also given the actors some very clever lyrics to sing to Paul McKibbins ' richly theatrical melodies .The show is actually more accomplished than it might appear at the York , because the cast members do not all have \" It . \"Still , the production is definitely worth seeing .The plot is sweetly framed as a movie within a play .The show opens with a young woman in a red dress peering into a mutoscope , watching a black and white , silent flick that then begins to unfold in the form of a stage musical .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Most of the time , though , the story is simply told with the wide - eyed innocence of the silent era replicated through dialogue filled with period slang , emotive acting , and some nifty black and white ( and gray ) costumes designed by Robin L. McGee .There is a winning sense of fun about the piece .The It Girl is n't camp or parody ; its intention is that we enjoy the honest earthiness of its heroine and the depiction of a time much simpler than our own .This is one of those delighful musical theater experiences in which a song can evocatively suggest the Midway ( \" Coney Island \" ) or touch the heart ( \" Step Into Their Shoes \" ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She 's stunningly pretty , but she ai n't got \" It \" ; nor does Jessica Boevers in the role of her nemesis , a society gold digger .Neither performer can sing or act well enough for the audience to root for or against them with much passion .Fortunately , the rest of the cast is swell .Jonathan Dokuchitz is endearing as the malleable , rich lug sought after by the two women .And Stephen DeRosa is sensational as his soused best friend , performing with such a natural frivolity that you find yourself wishing some of it would rub off on the \" It \" girl .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
