{"text": "The reason I chose to watch Platoon was because Johnny Depp has a small role in the film and being a fan of all things Johnny I found myself buying the DVD .In general , I am not really into war films but part of me is glad I watched Oliver Stone 's Platoon ; I think he has done a great job .Based on his own experience in Vietnam , his firsthand knowledge and memories have enabled him to convey the horrors of war in a frantic , disorientating way ; he has created a great antiwar film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I liked the way they showed the soldiers to be human and not heroes , the way they were scared our of their wits at times making them do rash things like shooting innocent people .You could see how hyped up they were at the time what with all the killing and maiming going on .The scenes were shot really well , in the jungles with the light coming down through the trees so you got a lot of dark scenes which added to the tension of the story .The music going through the film was the very poignant Adagio for Strings by Samuel Barber , whenever I hear this music now it always reminds me of this film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "What makes this riveting to watch is the combinations Stone uses .There 's good acting , direction , visuals , atmosphere , and music throughout the film .The music is perhaps the most powerful element , a clever use of string classical music to provide tension that was attempted in films such as The Thin Red Line but ultimately did n't quite work .Stone has a good group of actors at his disposal , from a young Charlie Sheen as Chris , to the more established pair of warring soldiers as Willem Defoe plays Elias and the ever scarred and grumpy Tom Berenger takes on the gritty role of Barnes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , it 's not all plain sailing , and there were parts when I was a little disappointed .The story lost its way at points , and some of the attempts to drive home the harsh conditions fell slightly short .There is a tendency to over - politicise events here , something which was attempted with success in sequel Born On The Fourth Of July .However , the cold and paranoid jungles of Vietnam were n't really the best place for political statements , even though it 's every director 's right to show his personal feelings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Those bits are brilliant .Overall , it 's a film I happily recommend , and one that you 'll likely find easy to watch over and over again .It 's not perfect , but gets home the message about the war being a messy and unpopular thing for many , showing what it can do to you in a positive as well as negative way .Well worth a watch : beautiful use of musical , acting and visual combining to make some stunning and memorable scenes .Not perfect , but very impressive indeed .Recommended .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "So there is now a war inside the army , and a war outside in Vietnam .The tension builds up as the film nears a very violent and poignant climax , with everyone arguing and no one knowing who to trust or who to listen to .The acting in this film is on fire , it 's that good .Willem Defoe and Tom Berenger are both as brilliant as each other in this , while Charlie Sheen adds for some cracking support in what is his best role .Defoe is very believable as the compassionate Sergeant Elias , while Tom Berenger makes the character of Sergeant Barnes truly hateful in his single best role .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He 's a Vietnam veteran himself , so the scenes are totally realistic and much of the story is based upon many of his own experiences , which makes this film all the better .The only thing that lets it down is that there is a constant political undertone in this film that at times takes the point away from the film .Films that have a political message sometimes detract from what is important .We should n't be made to feel bad that leaders make bad decisions .We should be focused on those that fought in the war , and though it makes very little difference in this film , it 's not as good or as unbiased as Full Metal Jacket .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Overall a great Vietnam war story that is unique .I did n't watch platoon when it first came out way back in 1986 but watched it recently after watching a few other Vietnam related movies and it was pretty impressive but again quite a harrowing account .There have been so many films on the subject I thought it might be just another one that would add to the list but this was very moving and seen through the eyes of a young soldier .For me of all the war movies I 've watched this remains one of the most powerful in my opinion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This was the first of Oliver Stone 's ' Vietnam War Trilogy ' and for me was the best one .The others being ' Born on the Fourth of July ' and ' Heaven and Earth ' .The story follows the experiences of 19 year old Chris Taylor played by Charlie Sheen .He is full of unrealistic ideas about war is like and pictures it being more glamorous than it is in reality .From a middle - class background , he volunteers for the army , still unaware of the horrors that would await him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His letters home which are actually narrated by Charlie Sheen himself depict his feelings at the time , from his relationships that he develops over time with fellow soldiers and also with the two sergeants of the platoon who divide the group .You have Elias Grodin played by William Defoe who uses drugs to escape the horror and the nightmare going on around him as a release .Then there is the dangerous Bob Barnes played by Tom Berenger .Here is a man who is violent to the extreme and you would n't want to cross him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At the same time I did n't want to look away for fear of missing something important .Slowly but surely the character played by Charlie Sheen becomes disillusioned with it all as I 'm sure alot of American soldiders did and realise that it 's not worth fighting over .Charlie Sheen puts in a good performance and shows his versatily as nowadays I always think of him as a comedy actor in Hotshots and Two and a Half Men for example .But he really gives us a great insight into the war and the horror that unfolded around the soldiers of the time caught up in the middle of it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I found that this film was indeed nothing like I had expected it to be .There was a story to it and not just men being blown up .I found the story which followed Chris to be very emotional at times and I think Charlie Sheen did a great job portraying this character .I liked the naivety which he had at the beginning of the film being unaware of the horrors which faced him and I enjoyed seeing his character grow and toughen up as the film went on .He was a likable character and I enjoyed seeing him trying to do the decent thing for people during the war and not just being completely brutal and uncaring .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think the two actors who played these parts were excellent and made their character very believable but I really did not like the one of the sergeants as he was just to brutal and hard .There were a lot of supporting actors in the film and I was actually surprised to see a small role by Johnny Depp which I found was excellent but I did not like the ending they gave him !A few of the actors included , William Defoe , Tom Berenger and Kevin Dillon .The film was set in the Vietnamese jungle and I thought that all of the sets and scenery was excellent done .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The special effects throughout the film really were amazing and looked so real .I think this is what helped make the film so good as some of the horrors and wounds which we saw looked so authentic and at times were horrid to watch .The music was also another good point to the film and I think it helped a lot with the tensions and emotions of the film .I was always able to tell when the men were going to be attacked as a certain piece of music was played which did actually help and give me a bit of warning !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The running time of the film is 1 hour and 55 minutes and the certificate is a 15 as there is a lot of violence , string language and drug use .I do definitely agree with this rating as at times I did find it hard to watch and do not recommend this to anyone under the age of 15 .I managed to get this DVD for just \u00a3 3 in Tesco which I felt to be a great price for such a moving , emotional and well made film .Overall I do recommend this as it shows the story on one innocent man who is thrown into a horrific and brutal war and his struggle to deal with this and loose all his innocence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Harrowing beyond words .Platoon is an extremely powerful film about the Vietnam and is frequently regarded as the very best war films ever made .Perhaps what really makes it so powerful is that its writer and director , Oliver Stone , was actually a soldier in Vietnam , meaning that he 's able to better avoid romanticism and sensationalism than any other director that has made a film about the subject .This is gritty , visceral filmmaking that 's topped with a slew of career - best performances , and of course , stunning writing and direction as usual from Stone himself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On arrival , he quickly learns the state of affairs - soldiers are dying at an expontential rate , and of course , soldiers are shellshocked left and right , left with life - changing traumatic mental disorders from the horrors that they have seen .What really makes this so engaging is the characterisation - Taylor is torn between the more compassionate and level - headed Sergeant Elias ( Willem Dafoe ) , and the extremely crude and harsh , but seemingly invincible Staff Sergeant Barnes ( Tom Berenger ) .Each promotes their own system of keeping alive , and Taylor will have to decide which he thinks is going to work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Elias on the other hand is , despite also being a veteran soldier , more in touch with reality and the war has not had the effect on him as it has Barnes .The differences between the two are the cause of a rift in the ranks and results in a power struggle which splits the platoon in two .My Thoughts .There are enough battle scenes in this film to keep your juices flowing .With both Berenger & Dafoe playing such strong characters you will find yourself admiring both the level headedness of Dafoe and the no - nonsense nature of Berenger .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
