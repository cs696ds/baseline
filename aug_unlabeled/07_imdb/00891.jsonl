Somerset Maugham .I 'm trying to get through all the books I 've read and not reviewed in 2011 , so there will be a flurry of reviews over the next fortnight .Prepare yourselves !A while ago I did one of my novella reading weekends , but I do n't think I ever actually told you about it , before or afterwards .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Which was n't the one I read .Up at the Villa ( 1941 ) came recommended by Simon Savidge ( see links at the bottom ) and is only 120pp - plus it has a lovely cover , so why not ?Up at the Villa is rather difficult to classify - in terms of length , it probably counts as a novella , but structurally it seems much more like a short story .There are all manner of attempts to define the short story , and I find a few quite helpful .Brander Matthews suggested over a century ago that \" a short - story deals with a single character , a single event , a single emotion , or the series of single emotions called forth by a single situation . \" In 1979 Wendell Harris picked up on the same focal word in his definition : \" single memorable curve of action revealing a single memorable personality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All these definitions essentially suggest singularity - no room for interweaving plots , multiple focalisation , etc . etc .Of course , there are dozens of writers and hundreds of short stories which break these rules , but rather fewer novellas and novels which fit so neatly into the definition .Up at the Villa does n't take us far from beautiful young widow Mary Panton 's perspective , nor from the events of a single momentous day .In the wake of her husband 's death , Mary is living in a beautiful borrowed villa overlooking Florence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not to mention the rakish attentions of Rowley Flint , who does n't have marriage on his mind .So where does this single memorable curve of action take us ?It starts with one act of generosity : .They had dined late and soon after eleven the Princess called for her bill .When it grew evident that they were about to go , the violinist who had played to them came forward with a plate .There were a few coins on it from diners at other tables and some small notes .What they thus received was the band 's only remuneration .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Mary is impulsive and romantic and not always able to deal with the outcome of her actions , and this makes for a plot which snowballs out of her control - a touch melodramatically , but still within the realms of feasibility .My only confusion is why it became a 120 page book .Most authors would have condensed it into thirty pages , or added more characters , more ideas , more occurrences - and another 120 pages .It might seem an odd thing to focus on , but Up at the Villa falls between two stools , which is difficult to ignore .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Juna - thanks for your recommendations - I do have a heap of other Maughams to read , so it 's nice to know which directions to look in .The ending was , I agree , a bit too neat - but I suppose , again , that 's got something to do with the length of the story .If he were going to be more complex , he 'd need more space .maybe ?I really liked this novella -- but I was very amused to see that the copy I got from the library has pretty big type and enormous margins !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There are a dozen loglines that could have been used to pitch The Horse Whisperer -- Ordinary Equine People or The Bridges of Some Montana County or The Horse with No Face or Hot to Trot 2 .It basically combines the family psychodrama of Ordinary People , Redford 's Oscar - winning directorial debut , with the middle - aged romance of The Bridges of Madison County , whose screenwriter , Richard LaGravenese , also co - wrote Horse Whisperer -- surely no coincidence .\" Middle - aged romance \" may not be an entirely fair phrase here : July - November would be more accurate , as Redford is pretty much past the \" middle \" that Scott Thomas has n't even reached yet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Still , for many there will be something off - putting about the age difference .But a bigger problem for the film derives from Redford 's curious notion of his own image .After Quiz Show and -- for all its flaws ( basically its final third)--Ordinary People , it 's clear that the man is an intelligent director .But , as a producer and a star , he 's always shied away from portraying negative characters -- or even characters with negative qualities .( Remember when he was replaced on The Verdict because he wanted to soften the hero 's flaws to the point where his \" redemption \" would be meaningless ? )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Or rather , the film treats it in an oblique way , focusing its overt outrage instead on the Fascists who are fast making incursions into the Florentine resident aliens ' la - de - da lifestyle .In this strategy , the film is not unlike the previous one by the husband - wife team , director Philip and writer - editor Belinda Haas , Angels and Insects .In the first movie , colonialist abuses of natives and resources were displaced onto a horror - movie - style display of brother - sister incest , discovered , it so happens , by a pleasant - enough student of insects and a fellow worker at his wife 's estate , played by one Kristin Scott Thomas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I suppose the case could be made that the story is emulating a popular bodice - ripper and that both Mary and viewers believe her love will transform him , though whether as parody or as homage is difficult to figure .After setting up some tension that Mary will be found out , the film drops that ball in favor of the romance ( though Rowley is offscreen for much of her developing affection for him , which we can only hope was contractual on Penn 's part ) .The movie 's most colorful and pleasantly distracting moments actually have very little to do with either plot , and instead feature Derek Jacobi as a flaming and besandaled art aficionado ( also , it seems , a friend to Mary because he poses no \" threat \" ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
