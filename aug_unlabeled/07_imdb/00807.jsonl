{"text": "The 1990s was a good decade for Jennifer Jason Leigh .She was not only prolific , flirting with mainstream films like Backdraft ( 1991 ) , but also at the height of her creative powers , turning out one astonishing performance after another , disappearing into her roles with chameleon - like proficiency .It was also the decade where she tackled her most challenging roles in a way that threatened to alienate the critics and her fans .In Georgia ( 1995 ) , she played a struggling musician who has the heart but not the talent as evident in an excruciatingly awful cover of a Van Morrison song that goes on for so long that it tests the resolve of even the most die - hard Leigh fan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With Altman attached as producer , Rudolph was able to assemble an impressive cast - a who 's who of ' 90s character actors , like Campbell Scott , Lili Taylor and James LeGros ; and survivors from the 1980s , like Matthew Broderick , Jennifer Beals and Andrew McCarthy .It is to Rudolph 's credit that he is able to handle such a large and diverse cast , so much so that a cheat sheet is almost required in order to keep track of who everyone is .Admittedly , Rudolph plays large portions of Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle fast and loose , letting this talented cast run with their characters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dorothy Parker 's heyday was in New York City during the Roaring Twenties where she was part of a thriving literary scene known as \" the era of giants .\" She got her start writing captions for lingerie ads at Vanity Fair magazine and worked her way up to drama critic , an unheard of position for a woman at that time .She quickly made enemies with her scathing reviews .Parker was fired and became a freelancer along with her close friend and editor Robert Benchley who quit the magazine in protest .She and other New York writers lunched at the Rose Room of the Algonquin Hotel in gatherings they cheekily referred to as \" board meetings . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We first meet Parker ( Jennifer Jason Leigh ) in Hollywood circa 1937 where she runs into Benchley ( Campbell Scott ) .Even though they 're both married they still flirt with each other by trading witty barbs .After they go their separate ways , a stagehand says to Parker , \" Must 've been so colorful in the ' 20s , \" to which she replies , \" Was it ?I barely remember .\"This entire sequence is shot in black and white and has a melancholy air to it , accentuated by Mark Isham 's moody jazz score .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These scenes demonstrate Altman 's influence on Rudolph as people talk over each other and the overlapping dialogue forces one to follow whatever conversation they please .As the scenes in the Algonquin continue , the table gets larger to accommodate all of the people and the dialogue flies fast and furious .It 's a veritable feast for lovers of witty repartee .In fact , Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle often feels and looks like the best Altman film he never made .Right from the get - go , Jennifer Jason Leigh disappears into her role complete with Dorothy Parker 's distinctive way of speaking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , it is Parker 's trademark scathing wit that Leigh nails perfectly .It is her devotion to the characters she plays and her willingness to give herself completely over to them that is one of her most admirable traits .It 's a hard scene to watch not because Rudolph shows it ( he does n't ) but we hear it and our imagination fills in the rest .It is so much fun just to see the way she carries herself in any give scene .The actress makes it all look so effortless as it almost seems like she 's channeling Parker .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Regardless , it 's a brave performance and an absolute crime that Leigh did n't get nominated or win an Academy Award for her efforts .The rest of the cast follows her lead , especially Campbell Scott as her best friend and confidante .Leigh and Scott have fantastic chemistry together and do a great job of conveying the unrequited love that existed between Parker and Benchley like the proverbial elephant in the room in the sense that they never address it .Scott is Leigh 's ideal foil as he captures Benchley 's idiosyncratic mannerisms and slightly nervous speech pattern .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Initially , it looks like he 's going to flop in a big way as he dryly rattles off facts .Scott nails his character 's nervous tics and awkward physical gestures .And then an interesting thing happens - Benchley gradually wins over the audience with his awkward shtick .Scott pulls it off with a showstopping performance .Alan Rudolph was fascinated with writers from the Round Table as a child and this manifested itself in his love for Gluyas Williams ' illustrations in a collection of Robert Benchley 's amusing essays .After making The Moderns ( 1988 ) , a film about American expatriates in 1920s Paris , he wanted to tackle a fact - based drama set in the same era .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In 1992 , Rudolph attended a Fourth of July party hosted by Robert Altman who introduced him to Jennifer Jason Leigh .Rudolph was surprised by her physical resemblance to Dorothy Parker and impressed with her knowledge about the Jazz Age .The screenplay originally focused on the platonic relationship between Parker and Benchley but this did not appeal to any financial backers .There still were no takers even when Altman came on board as producer .The emphasis on Parker was the next change to the script but Rudolph still had no luck finding financing for \" a period biography of a literate woman . \" Altman finally stepped up and bullied Fine Line Features and Miramax Pictures - two studios he was making films for - to team up , with the former releasing Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle domestically and the latter handling foreign distribution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I did a lot of lying . \"He and Rudolph were able to raise the money for the $ 7 million budget but this did n't come through until four weeks into principal photography .Leigh was so committed to doing the film that she agreed to be in it for \" a 10th of what I normally get for a film .\" The rest of the cast followed her lead and agreed to work for much lower than their usual salaries .She did a great amount of research for the role and said , \" I wanted to be as close to her as I possibly could . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She also listened repeatedly to the two existing audio recordings of the writer in order to perfect Parker 's distinctive voice .Leigh found that Parker \" had a sensibility that I understand very , very well .A sadness .A depression .\" Rudolph shot the film in Montreal because the building facades in its old city section most closely resembled period New York City .The Rose Room in the Algonquin Hotel was recreated at two - thirds scale on a soundstage .Rudolph invited the actors to write their own dialogue which resulted in a chaotic first couple of days of principal photography .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" They trusted their director implicitly during the 40-day shoot .The cast stayed in a run - down hotel dubbed Camp Rudolph and engaged in all - night poker games .Leigh chose not to participate in these activities , preferring instead to stay in character on and off camera .Originally entitled , Mrs. Parker and the Round Table , it was changed to \" Vicious Circle \" because New Line was worried that people would think of King Arthur and not Dorothy Parker .In anticipation of the film 's release Altman admitted that \" it 's going to be a tough sell .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A rough cut was screened at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival and predictably divided critics .There were rumors that after this screening Leigh re - recorded several scenes that were criticized for being too difficult to understand because of her accent but she denied that this was done .Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle was generally well - received by critics .Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and felt that the film was \" best appreciated , I think , by those who already know the players around the Round Table , and have read some of their work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" The Washington Post 's Hal Hinson praised Leigh for giving \" a disturbing , emotionally raw performance .\" The New York Times ' Janet Maslin found that \" there are major gaps , like the absence of any significant mention of Dorothy Parker 's left - wing political passions .But this film crams a remarkable amount of fact and nuance into the telling of its wrenchingly sad story . \"The film failed to wow Entertainment Weekly , however , which gave it a \" C+ \" rating .Owen Gleiberman wrote , \" The question the movie fails to come to grips with is : How do you get audiences to care about a woman who , in the end , did n't give a damn about herself ? \" The great tragedy of Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle is that Dorothy Parker and Robert Benchley were so obviously in love with each other and yet never worked up the courage to express their true feelings for one another .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Rudolph 's film portrays her as a complex person that wrote out of a great pain .She was brilliant and a trailblazer for her time .She never found the true happiness that she sought with Benchley and resigned herself to an unhappy life but out of this produced some great literature that has stood the test of time .12 comments : .An excellent review of a sadly still underrated and little shown film , certainly one I 've not seen in about decade .It 's depressing that Altman 's quote on the film 's dicey chances of finding an audience - \" It 's about literacy \" - is so indicative of the Hollywood mentality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thanks for stopping by and for the compliments .It is amazing that this film still remains underappreciated , esp .with so many film buffs fans of Jennifer Jason Leigh 's work .Altman 's quote is certainly telling and quite prophetic as well .And you 're right , Gwyneth Paltrow has a small role in the film , along with every other character actor in the 1990s ( it seems ! )MRS .PARKER is definitely worth another look and is still my fave Leigh performance , hands down .How was Jennifer not nominated for this film ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Wonderful post on a really special , and underapprecaited , film .I think this and GEORGIA are my two favorite JJL performances .I 've always heard about this Rudolph film , but I 've yet to see this .I 'm going to have to fix that after reading another of your splendid reviews , J.D. Also , add my vote for Jennifer Jason Leigh in RUSH ( she was so good in that ) .Thanks , my friend .There 's little question J.D. that this is a lamentably underexposed film , that does indeed showcase a spectacular performance by Ms. Leigh , who portrays a singularly fascinating character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And yes Altman 's complicity is seen throughout , though I 'd tend to agree that the left wing leanings are n't really explored , though they do n't really need to be .It 's an exquisite film , and you 've done it full justiice here with your magisterial treatment .This was a great film to resurrect here at Radiator Heaven .I saw this in a dinky little arthouse theater and really liked it but damn , that was over 15 years ago !Have n't seen it since .The other \" big \" early ' 90s movie Leigh excelled in was Last Exit to Brooklyn , in which she played Tra La La , a young prostitute who comes to a horrible end .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No DVD , however , so I have n't seen that one either since about 1990 or ' 91 .Do n't know if it holds up or not .I will piggyback a bit on Will Errickson 's comment .I remember some years ago the movie critic on the CBS Sunday morning show talked about LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN when it was out first run .I had n't seen it , but watched as he talked how brutal this film was .He included the clip of Ms. Leigh 's character at the end of the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Amazon sells a Korean import of it .Ms. Leigh is a very gifted actress , and I 'll watch her in just about anything .But , I still choose not to see this film ( so haunted by her end in it I still am ) .Just my thoughts .Thanks .Thanks for stopping by , my friend !Good comparison between Leigh 's immersion in her literary role and that of Philip Seymour Hoffman in CAPOTE .Both of them have a complete dedication to getting into character and I think that 's why they are among the best of their profession .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think that Rudolph was so concerned with cramming so many actors / characters in the film that some stuff got left out !Heh !I too saw this film at a small arthouse theater and was blown away by it .The film always stuck with me and I 've managed to get it on VHS and later DVD when it became available .And good call on LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN .Leigh is amazing in it but it is a brutal film to watch .It 's been years since I 've mustered the courage or had the desire to see it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I also remember the ominous reputation LAST EXIT had and how hesitant I was to see it .It is truly a film that gets under your skin and stays there thanks to Leigh 's unflinching portrayal .Like you , I would watch her in pretty much anything ( even BACKDRAFT ! )but I have no real desire to revisit LAST EXIT any time soon .My pleasure in the insights and information of this piece far outshines my one niggling correction .The first draft title of the script Rudolph hired me to write was , as I recall , simply \" Mrs. Parker . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
