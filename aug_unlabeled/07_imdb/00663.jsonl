{"text": "26 comments : .Sartre 's hell , while do n't get wrong is indeed terrible , it 's in a sense more livable for me being that , I believe his drawing room of everlasting torment spawned from his own vexes and peeves .I certainly believe that something without rest could be considered hell .Imagine the concept of becoming \" burnt out \" exaggerated infinitely .To become physically , emotionally , and mentally \" burn out \" until you are not only tired of something , but eventually you become bothered by it and eventually suffering because of it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However as the others arrive and their presence takes its toll , soon Sartre 's idea of Hell without rest begins to take form as the three can no longer tolerate the presence of each other .\" No Exit \" really interested me .I had a lot of fun reading this actually , I liked figuring things out before they were mentioned by the characters .I did have a question though , the allegory was hell and being trapped with people you hate , but how does this relate to The Republic ?In No Exit they were all trapped in hell together , learning about each other .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Is to take someone 's word for it ?There was no way that Inez , Estelle and Garcin could have known that they were telling the truth ... .Also , are we supposed to post the questions here ?I thought they were rhetorical , well , I 'm gon na do it anyways .... .Well , I 'm not one to believe in heaven and hell , but I suppose that if I were to picture my hell it would be torture of the mind .I imagine being close to the things I desire but constantly out of reach or blind to them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Being compeltely isolated with my unfulfilled desires would be torture .I believe that there could be some sort of peace in hell though .If you could just isolate your MIND from your torture and imagine a perfect scenario in your head and concentrate on it , I 'm sure that you could find peace even if it 's just for a short moment .Of course too much of anything without a break could be hell , if there is no end to it at all .If hell was a constant consciousness with no rest and constant work of the mind you would want to just sleep , but you ca n't , so you would want to die , but you already have .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't even want to imagine Garcin 's hell .At first he retains a sense of arrogance , he does n't want to give in to what he now faces - hell .He mocks it .Then as the story continues on he starts to give in , he let 's himself be driven mad by Inez and Estelle ... .If I were to create my own hell it would not consist of torture devices or anything of the sort , it would be a place where I was constantly reminded of my failures .It 'd be a mental hell I guess , where I would spend eternity with all my regrets playing on a loop , things I said , did , and thought , playing on a loudspeaker or projected all over but only you can see this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do not think it would be possible to find peace , if it were then that hell would not serve a purpose .There would be more fire and less furniture .Maybe more physical suffering to go with the mental component .If you do something too much you wo nt want to do it anymore .May it be tolerating people you can not stand or having to watch the same show all day .By Garcin 's surprise at how normal it looks , and him beginning to think it wo nt be so bad because it does n't appear like it will .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you look at anything that you have to do frequently you could begin to see it in a hellish way , like school , its really not bad unless you really make it that way , and dread having to go everyday .My personal Hell would be one ridden with large spiders .God I hate spiders .It would also be one of solitude , me being isolated not just from the ones I love but everyone .I 'm one of those people who just needs human interaction .I think that doing something way to much would very easily become hellish .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Yes hell can be described as something without a break .If you do n't stop doing something , you will eventually become annoyed by it and see it as something bad .Balance , moderation , and variety are great ways to keep us from seeing something as hell .Sartre creates a sense of place through dialogue by making the characters ' conversation mainly about the place they 're at and being descriptive .Garcin tries ignoring the matter at first .Yes there is a matter of circumstances that reinforces the experience of hell .Having a routine gets irritating and maybe even painful for some .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Disclaimer : I know that fish are not sentient beings capable of human emotion and consciousness , but I wonder nonetheless .And I am entirely serious about the comparison I am about to make , even though everyone that I 've ever brought it up to thought I was being silly .Anyways ...I have a small twenty - gallon fish tank in my room .In it live five small fish .Sometimes , before bed , I sit and watch them , wondering how bad it would suck to be a fish , stuck in a small tank with nothing to do but swim .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is absolutely no variation in their daily routines .I decided long ago that this would be my version of hell .Having said this , reading the beginning Sartre 's \" No Exit \" made me think a lot about my perception of a personal hell .I was able to identify with Garcin 's discontent with not be allowed human dignities like brushing his teeth and sleeping .I knew that the constant swimming would literally bore me into a deep depression ( since I could n't die again ) much like Garcin was worried that a bland uniform \" life \" would be hellish itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is not the setting that tortures Garcin , it is being trapped in his own mind that will .Whereas it is impossible to find peace in an intellectually hellish state , in a physically hellish environment it is possible to acquire peace of mind and somewhat escape the physical tortures surrounding you .Like I mentioned above , my version of hell is characterized by an unrelentingly uniform routine .It is hellish because it is devoid of all variety .So yes , I do believe that hell can be described as too much of one thing without a break .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sartre used the characters ' dialogue to describe the room that Garcin was to remain in for an eternity .His conversation with the Valet sets up a picture of what the room looks like and what his hell will consist of .Although it does n't seem like such a bad place Garcin reacts violently to it .Once the Valet leaves , Garcin begins banging on the door an repeatedly ringing the bell , desperate for companionship .Though my nagging flawd are nt as harsh as Garcin 's considering the mental component of his hell is reason enough to fear such a condemnation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Eventually I would drive myself insane .I guess you could say that my daily routine resembles a hell similar to the one in \" No Exit \" , provided that you take out any sort of variation .I wake up every morning at 5:40 am ; go to school by 7 ; wait around until softball practice , then go home and do homework and so on and so forth .It 's the little moments of variety , like hanging out with friends at lunch , or texting someone during the day , that differentiate my life from my misery .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They are able to leave at one point but they do n't out of fear .They stay in their chains like the prisoners in the cave .They have the power , even if they did n't have the opportunity to leave , to at least not torture each other .Yet they make themselves powerless .The prisoners play along and accept what is given to them , and so does the characters in \" No Exit .\" That 's at least a thought to get you thinking .If you 'll also notice , the characters in both stories do n't seek to change themselves or understand the world around them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Everyones personal hell is different , that is what makes it personal .It could be a situation like in the movie Beetlejuice where the deceased couple has to suffer through living with the modern family , and to make matters worse the woman is exactly the nightmare they always feared .My personal hell is definitely very mental rather than physical .I can handle physical pain if my life depends on it , but when it comes to a loved one in excruciating pain where I can not do anything in my willpower to stop it , that is where I am just ... done for .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is too much driving , too much eating , too much working , too much fun , etc .If you do something in an exaggerated manner it will end up affecting you in a negative manner .The play is basic dialogue .There is n't much description so the reader experiences the different senses of hell through the descriptions of characters .Garcin believes he can outsmart \" them \" but when he slowly realizes that his personal hell is in fact planned and that his actions were already going as should be he slowly drives himself mad .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I guess if you have a mindset , where you do n't care and can block the pain , you can find peace in a hellish enviroment .Or if you know what you did was wrong .I could see how one would think Hell would be full of norture devices .It would be mighty depressing to be in the same room day after day .Not knowing if it was morning or day .Having the light on all the time and never being able to sleep .I can see as being hellish .The dialogue in the setting gives a sense that the drawing roon is depressing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Would be frustrating , especially when all you want is peace and quiet .Garcin reacts to the room it seems at first like he does n't care .But then he brings up how he can break the light so it wo n't always be on .I believe he does n't like the idea of never being able to sleep .I also believe he does n't like how he ca n't control anything and that is why he brings up the light switch .I believe that 's worse than being tortured physically .You take the persons greatest fears and push them to the point where they 'd rather die than have to deal with it anymore , you essentially break them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anyways , no I assume that the whole point of hell is that you can never achieve peace .Otherwise ... it would n't really be hell , would it ?Doing anything without a break can be considered hell , I mean , that 's why we have 12 step programs .Too much of something can negatively effect you in many manners .Everything becomes redundant once you do it enough , words become meaningless and actions unnecessary .I think hell would take our most prized qualities , possessions , etc and make them redundant because what would be worse than that ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Garcin tried to rise above it , pretend it did n't affect him , but eventually and defeated , he resigned to the fact that he was in hell and that that was his situation .You can make anything your ' hell ' , but you should refrain from that .\" We are our own devil , and we make this world our hell .\" The place I call hell is n't at all like Burgeois but is more like Dante 's inferno .I believe the mind will act a part in a persons hell and will be a hell for the person themselves and their surroundings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hell in itself is too much of anything without a break .After so long you do n't find enjoyment in doing so .Variety and moderation keeps us in balance with who we are and what we need .The dialogue Sarte uses creates vivid pictures of what the characters are feeling and what they are seeing .I would find it terrible tp know that i 'd be trapped without escape .Garcin however has accepted the hell he has been put to .In which too much of anything has become his hell .My picture of hell is isolation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Knowing that I could be done and it seems within reach , but I would never be able to .Hell can be described as having to do the same thing over and over again .Never getting a break from doing it and always knowing what the end result of it will be .Knowing that there is nothing you can do to change it .Satre creates a sense of place through dialogue by having Garcin question everything around him .He asks about things in the room and things that are n't in the room , which help you visualize the room .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It can wear you down until you finally break and ca n't manage another minute .Each fail runs deeper , and as soon as you give in to the simple , taunting temptation , whatever it may be , it then has a new kind of control over you .A new kind of hell .Garcin is indecisive in the beginning when he is placed within his new residency .Yes , like any human being he is slightly put off by the differences than what he may call \" normal \" , but he is definitely not in any kind of hell .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Saerte 's creates his hell by tormenting his character 's into hating everything , therefore creating the worst hell they could ever imagine .Think about the place you have chosen as your hell .Does it look ordinary and bourgeois , like Sartre 's drawing room , or is it equipped with literal instruments of torture like Dante 's Inferno ?Can the mind be in hell in a beautiful place ?Is there a way to find peace in a hellish physical environment ?Enter Sartre 's space more fully and imagine how it would feel to live there endlessly , night and day : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
