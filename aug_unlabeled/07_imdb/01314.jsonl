{"text": "The Series Project : The Pink Panther ( Part 1 ) .Professor Witney Seibold slips into his smoking jacket , and looks at the early chapters of the famed slapstick saga .Note : While you read this installment of The Series Project , I suggest you cruise over to YouTube , and keep this video playing on a constant loop .This will make my article cooler .I do n't mind that it 's the same for most of the movies in The Pink Panther series .It 's welcome .The Pink Panther movies occupy a nebulous state in the annals of popular culture .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Everyone can hum the theme song , but few can list all eleven ( yes , eleven ) movies in the series in the correct order ; I 'm working my way through them right now , and I 'm already getting them mixed up .They seem to be simultaneously familiar and unfamiliar to most people I talked to ( i.e. the one or two friends I bothered to mention them to , and my mom ) .I recall the few I had seen , but it was n't until I sat down to complete this project that I bothered to worm my way through all 11 of the films made to date .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Blake Edwards ' The Pink Panther movies , it could be said , almost serve as a dark mirror of the James Bond movies , which were gaining traction at about the same time .Well , at least they were intended to be .The first film in the series , which hit theaters in 1963 , was actually less about the infamously klutzy French cop Inspector Clouseau , and more about Sir Charles \" The Phantom \" Lytton , a gentleman thief and notorious Lothario .Watching the original film , one can easily see it as a setup for The Phantom , and not an intended vehicle for Clouseau .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Pink Panther movies are also notorious for the constant downhill slope of quality that never seemed to abate .The series started strong , and just gradually got weaker , through a few films that were made after Peter Sellers ' death , all the way until the ' 00s when we had to deal with a pair of unnecessary remakes .The further the series got from Peter Sellers , the more the series would suffer .The premise of the series : We follow , for the most part , one Inspector Clouseau ( played by various , but mostly Peter Sellers ) , the world 's most incompetent cop .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yet , his is confident , bold , and often charming enough to actually bed some of the pretty girls he sets his sights on .Clouseau works for a fellow named Dreyfus ( Herbert Lom ) who hates him so much that even he attempts to murder Clouseau on many occasions .Clouseau is not the Pink Panther .Just as Frankenstein is not the name of the monster .Each film depicts Clouseau wrecking valuable things with his clumsy behavior , being grossly negligent , and somehow stumbling his way to the solution of the case .Early on , the series was comedy gold , and I encourage all young people t seek out these sleek and enjoyable and totally goofy flicks from the 1960s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These are movies directly from the jet set , all advertising the comedy and fun that could be had in the high - end world of gentlemen thieves engaging in baffling bedroom door farces .In the first few chapters , the slapstick will be textured and pleasantly wacky - like a MAD Magazine from the same era , but with a little more sanity .It wo n't be until the fourth film where the slapstick would begin take center stage .The Pink Panther ( dir .Blake Edwards , 1963 ) .Note : Each of The Pink Panther movies begins with an elaborate animated title sequence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So as I indicated above , the first Pink Panther film was actually never intended to be a vehicle for Peter Sellers , the series ' eventual star .It 's not so much a slapstick farce as a clever and charming heist comedy .The main character of The Pink Panther is Sir Charles Lytton ( David Niven , charming as always ) , who travels in high - end circles , beds numerous women , and practically seems like royalty .Lytton is so decadently bored , he has to moonlight as The Phantom , a notorious catburglar who steals important and expensive trinkets , leaving behind an embroidered glove as a calling card .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lytton must seduce the virginal Indian Princess Dahla ( Claudia Cardinale ) to steal the gem .Other complications in the plot : Lytton 's irascible criminal nephew George ( Robert Wagner ) has suddenly appeared , and threatens - through sheer dint of his own charm - to counter - seduce many of Lytton 's marks .Lytton is also having a torrid affair with Simone ( Capucine ) , the wife of Inspector Clouseau ( Peter Sellers ) , the clumsy and embarrassing investigator determined to arrest The Phantom .While Clouseau does have a few golden moments of slapstick ( the violin bit cracks me up ) , most of the humor on this film is straight - up sex farce .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Indeed there is an extended central sequence wherein Simone must hide both Charles and George in her hotel room both from each other and from Clouseau who keeps leaving and entering .It 's a graceful and funny dance , this kind of bedroom farce , although it may ring as somewhat old - fashioned to current audiences .There 's also a central sequence , not really funny but enjoyable nonetheless , where Charles tries to seduce Princess Dahla on a bearskin rug by feeding her champagne .Before watching this movie , I heard a lot about Claudia Cardinale 's legendary beauty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She has the same qualities as a young Brigitte Bardot .Of note : Charles does not succeed .Although he does manage to get a few drunken kisses out of the deal , which is no loss .Eventually George learns that his uncle is indeed The Phantom , and demands a cut of the action .Charles and George hatch an elaborate plot to steal the Pink Panther during a costume ball , leading to another farcical scene wherein two men wear identical gorilla outfits and actually abscond with the gem .Clouseau is only vaguely on the case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I kind of miss when comedies were this boldly chaotic .The 1960s were a great time for genuine wildness .Not that protracted \" edgy \" wildness that producers like to talk about these days , but an honest - to - goodness go - for - broke insanity that was on full display , in flagrante delicto .If you 've never seen It 's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World , this would be the best place to start .The film ends with Clouseau learning his wife was actually in cahoots with The Phantom , and then being framed for the robbery of the Pink Panther .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Pink Panther is a casual , loosely plotted , and leisurely paced film that runs a long 115 minutes .You 'll feel its length .Indeed , for extended stretches , there are no laughs at all .It 's more a pleasant film than a hysterical one .Edwards opted for charming and chastely sexy over outright knee - slappers .I do n't mind this , and a kind of overarching whimsy can actually be just as fun , if not more fun , than outright jokes and iffy bits of goofy slapstick .I like the film a lot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A Shot in the Dark ( dir .Blake Edwards , 1964 ) .Some cursory internet research has led me to the unwitting origin of the Pink Panther series through A Shot in the Dark .This film , technically the second in the series , was originally conceived as a straight - up French stage farce , very much like the last film , and was eventually translated into English as A Shot in the Dark .Both plays surrounded a murder mystery , but also involved multiple affairs and the usual door - slamming shtick that is a feature of the genre .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When they saw the potential of the Clouseau character , they rejiggered the screenplay at the last minute , and transformed it into a Clouseau vehicle .A sequel was born , and a franchise began to take hold .Well , maybe .The story is pretty irrelevant this time around , as the bulk of the pretty long film ( well , 102 minutes can be long for a comedy ) surrounds wacky situations and comic set pieces .This is also the first film to have Chief Inspector Dreyfus ( Herbert Lom ) , and it saw the birth of the slow - burn dynamic that would be seen in several of the following films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dreyfus is Clouseau 's boss , you see , and his frustration with Clouseau 's clueless incompetence leads him to a burning , psychopathic , murderous hatred .Had these films been about Dreyfus exclusively , they would have been a dark , daring psychological study .But even though Dreyfus is abused and frustrated constantly ( and it 'll become really twisted in the fourth film ) , and begins doing things like accidentally severing his own thumb in distracted anger , it 's still pretty hilarious .I guess we 're supposed to see Dreyfus as a hoary Malvolio , deserving of his self - inflicted punishment merely because he 's so straight - laced .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , he 'll become more cartoony in later films , but he 's way funny here , and in the fourth film .This film also introduces the character of Kato ( Burt Kwouk ) , Clouseau 's live - in butler .Not only is Kato the butler , but also Clouseau 's impromptu sparring partner ; Kato attacks Clouseau randomly throughout the day , ensuring that Clouseau is sharp at all times .The sudden fights are often unexpected and usually pretty funny .If you like those oddball chicken fights from \" Family Guy , \" I would encourage you to watch A Shot in the Dark , and see where that sort of thing came from .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In an opening sequence , we see in through the windows of the mansion , and learns that half of the people staying at this mansion are having illicit affairs with the other half .Someone is killed , and the suspect is the pretty - and clearly innocent - Maria Gambrelli , the house maid ( the gorgeous Elke Sommer , the requisite Eurobabe ) .Clouseau falls for Elke Sommer at first sight , and spends the film defending her from his superiors , even though the circumstances are dashedly incriminating ; she is found locked in a room with the dead body , for instance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Clouseau , so smitten , refuses to suspect her .Dreyfus becomes so mad at Clouseau over the course of the film that he eventually tries to murder him with a sniper rifle .Eventually the real killer is revealed ( of course it 's not Elke Sommer ) , but I could n't tell you who it was .I think the ultimate conclusion of the mystery is irrelevant .Wait a sec .Did n't Clouseau go to prison at the end of the last movie ?Either he got out , and there is no reference to how he managed this , or this film does n't give a dip about continuity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Who cares how Clouseau got out of prison .He 's back being funny , is n't he ?There 's a funny sequence inside a nudist colony ( which were becoming more visible in the mid-1960s ) , and we get to see Sommer and Sellers with no clothes on ( but tastefully covered ) .A brief aside on slapstick .The 1960s were , in my estimation , a kind of slapstick renaissance .The first wave of film slapstick came during the 1930s , with the films of The Marx Bros. and the theatrical cartoon shorts of Warner Bros. Groucho and Bugs Bunny were the word of the day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think Woody Allen , a Groucho Marx fan , kind of pioneered the renaissance , and physical humor was back in the mainstream .Watch a film like Sleeper sometime , and you 'll find that much of the laughter comes not from the direct cheap physical humor , but from the fact that the filmmakers are using cheap physical humor .Essentially , we 're looking at ironic slapstick .I think much of films like A Shot in the Dark are comprised of ironic slapstick .The Pink Panther series will eventually become unironic , but that wo n't be until the fourth film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Remember , A Shot in the Dark was n't intended to be a Pink Panther film at first , and was almost a sequel merely by default .I guess the first proper movie in the series would be ... .Inspector Clouseau ( dir .Bud Yorkin , 1968 ) .But then , Inspector Clouseau is n't really the first either , because we 've swapped crews .This is the only film to be absent of one of Henry Mancini 's iconic scores , it was not written or directed by Blake Edwards , and Peter Sellers does not appear .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In a way , this was a studio 's attempt to expand Clouseau into his own proper franchise , but was a failed experiment .It feels less like a stalled first try , and more like an odd non - canonical entry in an otherwise canonical series .In that regard , I would compare it to the James Bond movie Never Say Never Again , the one that was made with Sean Connery in 1983 , but that no one considers a proper part of the James Bond series .Inspector Clouseau is a fine film , I guess , but it is n't as funny or as charming as its predecessors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't mean to rag on Alan Arkin in any capacity - I think he 's an excellent actor - but I think the central problem with Inspector Clouseau stems from the casting of Arkin .A lot of the comedic charm that came from Peter Sellers was a result of this somewhat diminutive Harlequin cluelessly hurting his bosses and just as cluelessly bedding attractive European models .Sellers is not a classically handsome man , so his charm had to be what carried the part .Arkin is plenty charming , I suppose , but he is a taller , stronger , more masculine a screen presence than Sellers ( this was the late 1960s , and Arkin was a lithe and active young buck ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He seems much more active a comedian , more willing to use wit than pratfalls .As such , the funniest parts of Inspector Clouseau come from when Clouseau himself is the one being put upon by a broad weirdo , and not the other way around , which is how we knew the character previously .So the film entire plays odd .There are plenty of good comic moments , mind you , but Arkin seems entirely miscast .This is also the most story - heavy of any of the Pink Panther movies , focusing on the bad guys almost as much as Clouseau himself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think much of the comedy is supposed to stem from Clouseau 's goofy French accent , which was n't so pronounced in the previous films , but will become a centerpiece by the fourth film .We are introduced in rapid succession to several potential bad guys - all pretty indistinguishable - who , as it turns out , are all in cahoots with one another .They plan to rob several banks across Switzerland , all at the same time , and all wearing lifelike Clouseau masks that they have secretly molded from Clouseau 's own face .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I like that scheme .The funniest scene .Clouseau and the bad guy get into a heated argument when they play a game of jacks .This film , more than any others in the series , feels like it sorely wants to be a James Bond film .He even has a cigarette case that fires laser beams .There is a babe in the film too , although Delia Boccardo is less well - known than Elke Sommer or Claudia Cardinale .There 's a charming montage in the flick wherein Clouseau and Boccardo attend several bars , unwittingly avoiding assassins .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's also implied that Clouseau is a stellar lover , as an older Scottish woman climbs all over him at one point , and he almost has a threesome with two nameless buxom gals ( they turn out to be bad guys who would steal his face ) .So we have a sexy man known for his good police work and stellar skills in the sack .Sounds like James Bond to me .We 're already three films in , and I feel like the Pink Panther movies are still not yet fully formed .When you refer to a Pink Panther movie , you 're actually talking about the fourth in the series , which , in my mind , is kind of the first .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Return of the Pink Panther ( dir .Blake Edwards , 1975 ) .So now we have the tone correct .It 's been 11 years since the original crew were involved in the series , and when they came back , film comedy trends had shifted a bit .The ' 60s jet set stuff is now long gone , and a much more broad kid - friendly slapstick has taken its place .Peter Sellers is back as Clouseau , but now has a thicker and sillier French accent , and spends a lot of time wrecking stuff with his chaotic clumsiness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are several slapstick set pieces that are just as funny as anything Harold Lloyd or Buster Keaton did .I do n't want to give much away , but the scene where Clouseau , disguised as a janitor , breaks into a suspect 's apartment , and ends up vacuuming up a parrot ... it always has me in stitches .Dreyfus ( Herbert Lom ) is also back , but his casual murderous twitch has grown into a full - blown psychopathic hatred .He does so many horrible things to himself and others in this movie , you 'd almost think it was a horror film in description .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The final scene of the film is Dreyfus locked in an insane asylum , writing \" Kill Clouseau \" on the wall with his feet .Usually this kind of violence and cruelty rubs me the wrong way , and I have trouble finding it funny , but something about Herbert Lom 's performance has me accepting the violence as extreme slapstick rather than horrific mutilation and murder .Maybe it 's the more kid - friendly tone .The animated titles are back ( now done by Richard Williams ) , Kato ( Burt Kwouk ) is back and still attacks Clouseau randomly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even Sir Charles \" The Phantom \" Lytton is back , and is now played by Christopher Plummer .So , yes , the Pink Panther has been stolen , and Clouseau is called to the scene of the crime ( despite having been fired ) to find it , as he was the one who found it last time .Well , he was framed with it , and , given that The Phantom is free now , Clouseau actually did n't solve the case last time , but whatever .I 'll accept this .The Phantom , it is established , did not actually steal the Pink Panther this time around , and is a little distressed to be on the short list of suspects .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A fun thing about these films : The bad guys are usually immediately savvy to Clouseau 's bumbling .They know what he 's up to because he 's so incompetent , and seem kind of bemused that such a screw - up would have the audacity to pursue them .They usually just sit back in the corner of the room , an amused smirk on their face , and let Clouseau screw things up in his own time , as he storms through a den or something accidentally setting things on fire .Clouseau never seems to crack the case , except by pure luck or even by misunderstanding .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Clouseau just bumbles blindly through the bedlam he creates , and eventually everything shakes loose .Even though the gem , Kato , Clouseau , Dreyfus , Lytton , and the girl - craziness were all established in previous films , the tone of the series all hinges at this one .The Return of the Pink Panther is just the right balance of kid - friendly goofiness , edgy violence , madness , and sublime slapstick .I hesitate the call it the best of the series - the first two are pretty excellent comedies - but it 's certainly the exemplar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
