{"text": "In America , we 've been taught that pork is \" the other white meat , \" but in Africa , that title goes to a different animal : the civet .The meat is said to be excellent , and very lightly fruit - flavored , because of the high fruit content in the civet 's diet .The civet is also valued for a very different reason ; glands near its tail produce a strong , musky substance .While it smells decidedly funky on its own , perfumers love it as a rich , earthy addition to scents . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
