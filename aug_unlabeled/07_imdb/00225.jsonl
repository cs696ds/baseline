{"text": "If seeking to be culturally controversial in 1980 , admitting to liking Heaven 's Gate was a surefire way to do it .Bathed in the post - Oscar glow of The Deer Hunter , director Michael Cimino had banked on achieving similar success with his $ 44 million epic Western based loosely on the little known Battle of Johnson County .Unfortunately for Cimino , the obscurity of the battle was the least of his problems as the movie received a critical mauling , virtually bankrupted United Artists studios and changed forever the relationship of business to art in Hollywood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But that was then .And though Cimino is unlikely ever to be forgiven by horse - lovers , after 33 years Heaven 's Gate merits re - examination as an extraordinary piece of work .It exemplifies the old heroic model of epic film - making , where streets had to be constructed and hundreds of bodies arranged in a way that CGI has all but eliminated .Moving on to 1890 , the film takes up Averill 's story in Johnson County , Wyoming , where as marshal of the town , he is facing brewing conflict between the poor European immigrants and the wealthy , established cattle barons from whom the newcomers steal to survive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But both men are in love with Ella , a bordello madam , played by captivating Isabelle Huppert , who accepts stolen cattle as payment .Ella is evidently enamoured of both men , though I found this hard to believe as her loving dance with Averill in the \" Heaven 's Gate \" roller - skating rink suggests where her affections really lie .But romance is not really what this film is about .It 's about Ivy League elites instigating a class war against toiling immigrants who find themselves on an official hit - list authorised by the President .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
