{"text": "Top positive review .I have long been a fan of Julie Garwood 's work , having first fallen in love with her historical novels .I admit to being disappointed when she switched to suspense romance though .Her newer books ( Mercy , Heartbreaker ) lack the sense of humor she had in the historical pieces .In fact , the humor was the reason I so enjoyed her books .For the first time Ms. Garwood has included that humor in her suspense novels .I enjoyed Killjoy , though as with other reviewers I was disappointed also with the ending .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
