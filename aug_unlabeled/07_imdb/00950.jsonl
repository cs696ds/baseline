{"text": "As a literature professor who specializes in the most ambiguous and open - ended works of art , I can assert that the ending of this film did not work -- artistically , psychologically , or in any sense .It was a self indulgent dodge by two taented but very spolied directors .It matters who \" got \" the money ( and one could argue that the wife , Bell or Anton wound up with it ) and it matters that Bell does absolutely nothing , nothing , nothing in the film except philosophize in faux Texas thoughts and looked creased .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Bring in Quentin Tarantino and produce something \" Pulp Fiction \" style where we get to see exactly what happens to the main characters in the film .They did have a ( bloody ) face - off and the point was , neither of them won .They both ended up bloodied and injured and then one of the main points is brought up - that if you are good ( lets say Moss ) , you are inherently disadvantaged as you have morals and other people you care about .Even if he was tactically or physically the equal of Anton , he was still at a disadvantage and the only way to win was to get lucky ( which is the usually Hollywood formula ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Due to having attachments and not being a loner psycopath , he ends up dead because first he felt bad and brought the dying gang member water , and second he has familial attachments .In this case , both directly led to his demise .I agree with the assumption that this movie revolves around the theme of greed , and that Anton is a representation of greed .Proof of this is at the very end of the movie , after Anton is badly injured in the car crash he limps and whithers to the ground as he can hardly move .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This minor detail almost shows that Anton is non - existent and that he is just a symbol of the greed that centers around the whole film .first , no movie , even one with such a tremendous point , needs paragraph after paragraph to explain it .It is all very simple .The characters are trying to deal with the new thing that has happened in the world , as we all do all the time .The ending is just simply stating that we can not change the world .The forces in the world , be it good or evil , change us .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Once you retards learn that movies are just acts of personal conscienceness , how other people view the world , we will all be better off .now having read some of your comments on the subject , I must say , you guys have no idea what you 're talking about .This movie is about good vs. evil , and the ending means that evil wins ... which it does .There 's an awful lot of chatter here about which character may be the central figure in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN .Let me add my poetic 2 cents .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Cormac McCarthy adopted that language for a reason , no different than John Steinbeck did when he cribbed OF MICE AND MEN from \" To a Mouse \" by Robert Burns , or Ernest Hemingway did when he \" borrowed \" FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS from John Donne .All of you should read the poem !Once you do , I believe that you 'll deem Ed Tom Bell as the film 's \" protagonist \" -- even if other characters provoke more drama or have more screen time than he does .Films are not \" life and death \" nor do they have much of an impact in the lives of people who must go to work every day to feed their family .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They have no other reason for \" being \" except to make the people who are involved with them some cold hard cash .The ending of this movie failed to give me \" my money 's worth \" of entertainment .Just as the athlete that performs well for three and a half quarters of football but fails to win the game .I pay for pure and simple entertainment , not lingering questions that need answered while I 'm doing my real job .Make movies that are entertaining , intriguing , and have a good , tidy ending ...

{"text": "I just could n't let this go .Fair enough if you only watch movies to fill 2 hours with mindless entertainment .Everyone 's different .But to alot of people , movies can be more than that .They are art .The best books , music and movies are those that have something under the surface .Those that ask questions or make us think in a particular way .Nothing wrong with a silly entertaining action movie now and then .I love them as much as anyone .But to say that 's all there is to the medium of filmmaking is downright ignorant and offensive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
