{"text": "Already Too Many Stories in the World .Already Too Many Stories in the World . by .Set in a multiplex theater in the Mall of America , Olsen 's 10:01 takes place in a very short interval of time , the ten - minute span of factoids and trailers preceding a movie .But time in 10:01 is spatialized , located not in the pace of a film unreeling or in the motion of a clock , but in the minds of many characters waiting in their theater seats .In any instant of time , an infinite number of events are happening .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Olsen skillfully compresses this experience into a short novel , yet manages to suggest the vastness of time when it is not strictly confined to numerical sequence .This expanded notion of time is apparent on the first page of the novel , where we are introduced to an aerobics instructor named Kate Frazee , who happens to be Franz Kafka 's great - great granddaughter .Kate does n't fully inhabit the present moment .Part of her is trapped in the past , in recurring nightmares based on the plots of Kafka 's stories .She is unaware that she is related to a famous writer , since her great grandfather was the result of an illicit affair and he never knew that Kafka was his biological father .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yet in her sleep she is haunted by stories that surface from her unknown genetic past .Olsen 's novel is filled with stories , many of them inside his characters ' heads .Most of these people are at the movies to watch their own movies , and 10:01 revolves around the ongoing tension between the cinematic time of frames moving in a linear , mechanistic sequence and the human time of subjective experience moving freely , in many different improvised patterns .But the word \" freely \" is perhaps too optimistic in describing a character like Kate Frazee , who suffers from an odd species of genetic determinism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Later , we meet Cynthia Morgenstern , who \" is almost positive she is gradually becoming transparent \" and imagines that if Cary Grant \" ran a hand through his beautiful hair ... beautiful dreams would pour out \" ( 134 ) .She is so locked into a cinematic version of the world that she seems to have no life outside it : \" When the theater within the theater is gone you get to return home .Sometimes this takes a minute .Sometimes this takes a lifetime \" ( 134 ) .Many of Olsen 's characters are controlled by outside influences that assault , inhabit or consume them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But this powerlessness is not the case with all of Olsen 's characters .As 10:01 develops - panning from one character to another , appropriating the process of cinematic construction by moving frame by frame - we meet people who are not quite so limited .For instance , one of the theater 's employees , Celan Solen ( the author 's name in scrambled form ) , has little interest in film narratives because he knows they typically develop according to nine established formulas .He is more interested in \" the how and why of telling ... the mind in motion as it is disclosed by celluloid \" ( 41 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We turn them into significance \" ( 42 ) .We are later given a glimpse of the kind of film - or rather , meta - film - Celan imagines himself making , based on the insight that \" the form of film is really a philosophy of disruptive movement \" ( 88 ) .Celan is not just another aspiring director .He wants to make films that challenge viewers to think about what happens when life is transformed by an aesthetic medium .Another mall employee , Vito Paluso , has taken Celan 's project a step further .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He works as a security guard and is constructing his film from footage taken from the mall 's surveillance cameras , a strong example of someone refusing to be chained to the banality of his job and using it as a vehicle for his own aesthetic projects .Though we are told that Vito will never actually finish this project , the activity itself is leading him to perceive his environment in a highly imaginative way : .Vito Paluso imagines each brief shot in the experimental short he is making a heavy gray stone .His project will be to sew them all together into a suit of rocks , which he will wear everywhere he goes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He plans to embroider it with delicate butterfly wings .Vito Paluso and Celan Solen are practicing a form of aesthetic resistance , refusing to let the ethos of U.S. consumer culture set the agenda for them .Like Lance Olsen himself , these characters see the Mall of America as raw material , primarily because it provides them with subject matter for their own creative actions .Makes you feel lost even when you 're not \" ( 53 ) .Against this consumerism , Leon has generated a vivid interior space filled with verbal rhythms and phrasings that sound like Stephen Daedalus in a Wallace Stevens poem : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Again .Rowing through the minutes , one home to another .Morning fog suffused by peach sunshine .Coffee and apples .These are your angels walking arm - in - arm , faces white light splashed on broken columns .Picture this , but picture it taking place in another dimension .An antispace thought .I have spent my life asserting the possibility they are there .Here .Here , of course , and not here .Call it the dynamics of metaphor .Later in the novel , Leon directly contrasts the richness of his internal monologue with the banality of the mall and its theaters : \" in this place lightmist is no angel 's breath but a clamor from morning to midnight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Childish Americans with their eyes shut against the .World .All they want is more \" ( 163 ) .As if in response to this noise and consumer craving , a terrorist attack apparently erupts at the end of the novel , narrated from nine different angles and one of them imported from Garcia Marquez 's One Hundred Years of Solitude .Then suddenly , in the novel 's final frame , the attack seems to have disappeared - or perhaps it has taken its place among the other trailers flashing across the silver screen .Milo is a middle - aged man who remembers spending his eighth birthday in an ecstatic visit to the first enclosed , multi - level mall in the United States .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He remains a human embodiment of America in the age of mechanical reproduction , with his American flag bowtie and his celebration of the mall as \" a new kind of zone for human activity . \" But now he is more of a high priest than a worshipper .He has learned to enter the thoughts of those who have \" opened themselves up to the prospect of diversion \" ( 183 ) .He knows how to examine and exploit the fantasies of the people in the theater with him , and in the final pages of 10:01 Milo scans the theater with panoptic authority , watching the minds of his customers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And besides , for people like Milo , terrorism is just another topic for a movie , just another way to manipulate the hormonal community .Of course , not everyone falls victim to this manipulation in the same way and to the same degree .Olsen has shown us several characters who have not been fully absorbed into the consumer pattern .In such a society , all resistance is doomed from the start , and even the most politically committed writing is powerless to change the increasingly technocratic trajectory of post - industrial capitalism .Such dismal prospects are forcefully addressed in one of Lance Olsen 's earlier works , the futurist novel Time Famine ( Permeable Press , 1996 ) which depicts the United States as a dysfunctional machine dominated by urban sprawl , traffic jams , and corporate logos .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Indeed , the film these characters are preparing to watch never makes it into the novel .The cinematic spectacle has been replaced by the novel itself , directing our attention away from the screen , suggesting that the real subject of any movie is the people watching it , their thoughts and feelings , hopes and dreams , their strategies of perception .Though Olsen 's frame - by - frame approach to his characters might suggest that he is replicating the process of watching a film , the experience of reading 10:01 is not like watching the Hollywood movies typically shown in malls .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
