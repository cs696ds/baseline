{"text": "With a plot whose twists and turns match the hilly Scottish terrain in which much of the film is set , The Thirty - Nine Steps combines a breezy suavity with a palpable psychological tension .Hitchcock was already a master at conveying such tension through his cinematic methods , rather than relying just on situation or dialogue .Sometimes his ways of bringing the best out of his actors brought the worst out in himself .If the scene in which Donat is handcuffed to co - star Madeline Carroll has a certain edge , for instance , that 's perhaps because the director mischievously cuffed them together in a rehearsal , then left them attached for a whole afternoon , pretending to have lost the key .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "-- David Stubbs --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title .Top Customer Reviews .1935 's The 39 Steps is the film that really put Alfred Hitchcock on the map as a world - class movie director .With its mixture of classic Hitchcockian wit , dark ( and light ) humor , and suspense , it brought to the fore the man 's genius and set the stage for many a classic thriller to come .All he has to go on are a cryptic reference to something called \" the 39 steps , \" a name of a town in Scotland , and a warning to stay away from any man missing the upper digit on his right pinkie finger .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Our hero has stumbled on a den of spies .He must prove his innocence and thwart the theft of military secrets and escape Scotland Yard from London Music halls to Scottish moors .The Hitchcock blonde is Madeline Carroll and her stocking scene must have been tough for American censors .Hitchcock learned his craft from the German expressionists and you can see the darkness of that genre in this gem .In the top twenty of best movies ever made , I recommend 39 Steps . 1 of 1 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's just so much that 's missed in a bad print .Here , we have Hitch at his finest .... there just is n't a dull second in this film .It 's really as sure - fire as any movie ever made , in terms of entertainment .I believe this too was Hitchcock 's first huge breakout international hit , although happily for us , he did n't \" go Hollywood \" for another 3 years or so(and gave us the later \" Lady Vanishes\"-another Criterion must - have ) .Read more ' .\" The 39 Steps \" will never be called anyone 's favorite Hitchcock film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Most famous in this film is the use of the \" MacGuffin Principle , \" seen in movies such as \" Pulp Fiction \" and \" The Maltese Falcon .\" There is something everyone wants , but what it is is n't really important .Still , it is an enjoyable movie and worth the time to watch it .The film starts very slow , with an extremely contrived beginning catapulting our wayward protagonist into adventure and mystery .Robert Donat is very charming as the Canadian Richard Hannay , and he accepts the call to adventure readily .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Along the way , he ends up handcuffed to the lovely Madeleine Carroll , and then drags her along for the ride .How the movie ends ... well , you certainly do n't expect me to tell you !If you do buy \" The 39 Steps , \" definitely pick up the Criterion Collection version .The extras are deluxe , and well worth the extra cost .The Lux Radio presentation is a real gem .One of my favorite extras on the Criterion disks .\"The Art of Film : Vintage Hitchcock \" is an excellent documentary on Hitchcock 's British films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
