{"text": "Throughout the 20th century there have been many great comedians .But which ones will the world continue to celebrate in the new millenium ?Cults have arisen around these supremely funny artists , who have all left lasting marks on 20th - century popular culture .Yet no one has brought the world more laughter than the comedy team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy .Nor is anyone more beloved than these two funny , gentle men - the thin one and the fat one .The wry - faced , dim - witted Stan Laurel , with the natural fright - wig hair , and the courtly , portly Oliver Hardy , with his bangs and expansive gestures .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They were geniuses without showing it , without knowing it .They made their artistry seem effortless and completely natural .Their comedy style is unique and timeless , their appeal basic and universal .They were first and foremost visual comedians , who let us see ourselves - and laugh .Hal Roach paired Laurel with Hardy , pretty much by accident , at the Hal Roach Studios in 1926 , as silent films were nearing their end .Fans agree that the duo 's silent films were their best efforts .Fans and critics are intimately familiar with slapstick classics like TWO TARS , LIBERTY , BIG BUSINESS and THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nothing ever put on film is funnier than these sequences .Laurel & Hardy adapted with ease to talking in movies , practically paying no attention to it .Their voices matched their screen personalities .Sound effects aided their talking films .So did the wonderful , peppy period background music .The Boys were then able to punctuate their physical and visual comedy with catch phrases long familiar to fans who smile when they hear variants of this dialogue : .I 'm Mr. Hardy , and this is my friend , Mr. Laurel .Why do n't you do something to help me ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Tell me that plan again .Here 's another nice mess you 've gotten me into !At the heart of their appeal , underlying all their behavior , is one simple concept .Love .These films were made with love , and they reflected love .Stan and Ollie are nice people .Lovable people .They comport themselves with dignity .Their innocence is fundamental to their appeal .We see them as overgrown children , ignorant of evil .They blithely offer goodwill in a harsh world that would instantly crush them if ever they were even noticed !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's like taking a watch apart , or grabbing at smoke .Oliver Hardy , however , did say , \" Those two fellows we created , they were nice , very nice people .They never get anywhere because they are both so dumb , but they do n't know they 're dumb .One of the reasons people like us , I guess , is because they feel superior to us .\" This notion is echoed by the opening title card for their 1929 short subject entitled THE HOOSE - GOW : \" Neither Mr. Laurel nor Mr. Hardy had any thoughts of doing wrong .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The idea was to execute a gag which arose naturally out of the situation at hand , then top the gag , then top the topper .Hal Roach always maintained that \" except for Chaplin , there was no better gagman in the business than Stan Laurel .He could always get the most out of every single gag . \" As the economics of motion picture exhibition changed in the 1930s , Hal Roach needed to produce feature - length vehicles for Laurel & Hardy .Filmgoers then and now treasure WAY OUT WEST , BLOCK - HEADS and SONS OF THE DESERT among their best full - length feature films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yet belated critical acclaim has now been showered upon Laurel & Hardy .More books have been written on this comic duo than anyone else named above with the single exception of Chaplin .Now there are Laurel & Hardy biographies , critical studies , chronologies , picture books , quiz books , and even a Laurel & Hardy encyclopedia .As Wilfred Lucas said playing the prison warden in PARDON US : \" And still they come . \"The Boys , Stan and Ollie , Laurel & Hardy - they enjoyed perfect harmony , on and off - screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "And each and every time , Meyer would reply , \" I 'm still here .\" Once , entertainment super - lawyer Bruce Ramer asked Ron to speak to an industry luncheon : of course , on the topic of surviving .It 's not only a miracle - a word Meyer himself uses from time to time - it 's certainly a footnote in the history books of showbiz .\" Fear of failure has taken me a long way , \" Meyer once told me on the record .It 'll be basically the same job he 's had since August 1 , 1995 when Edgar Bronfman Jr lured him from the presidency and his partnership of Creative Artists Agency , the tenpercentery he co - founded in 1975 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It 's not about age , it 's about taste and that he has in spades .Well said , Nikki .I want to believe that Meyer would extend , if only to put his \" fear of failure \" aside and leave the studio in a better place than his contemporary , Zucker , did with NBC .Meyer did good work and perhaps with another 5 years or so he could leave on a better note than that fact that he 's the guy who gave the keys to Stephen Sommers for far too long and as the guy who made 5 Fast and Furious movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They also know how to develop long term relationships with the creative community .My experience with the younger execs is that they are focused on the business and short term goals .A successful business thrives with solid relationships and clear long term goals .Making Entertainment is a process that needs both .As our industry morphs into something new because of the mammoth influence of new technology , the creative aspects become that much more essential .It is why folks like Meyers , Wasserman et al . were so successful , they could see the change and adapt to it and thus influence the entire industry .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
