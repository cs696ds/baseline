{"text": "I found the reviewer of Eagle v Shark .I am expecting a copy of the review today or tomorrow .Sherry , I am going to post it here in this thread unless you tell me different .EAGLE VS SHARK 2006 Director : Taika Cohen with Jemaine Clement and Loren Horsley .At the end of July , I attended a Miramax test screening of the film , Eagle vs Shark .I was at the time , completely unfamiliar with both the film 's director , Taika Cohen , and the film 's stars Jemaine Clement and Loren Horsley .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Really , it just all sounded to darn precious to be any damn good .Imagine my surprise then , when I found myself in the focus group following the screening doggedly defending the movie .Most who disliked the movie felt it was way too derivative of a handful of small pictures that have achieved great mainstream success over the last few years .Indeed , many felt that the sole purpose of the movie was to cash in on what they perceived to be a thriving quirky cinema market .One woman went so far as to say , \" Like , um , if Me and You and Everyone We Know had a baby with Napoleon Dynamite , it would be this movie . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It feels warm and sincere , but at the same time one is slightly aware that even the slightest misstep could sink the story , so fragile and basic is its premise .The risk pays off , and the movie never once careens off course .The acting is very strong , with Jemaine Clement filling the role of awkward and self - important social retard with such ease and humanity that it is hard to legitimately compare his character Jarrod with Jon Heder 's well - crafted caricature , Napoleon .And it makes you squirm because , damn , you know that guy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Twice .Anyway , even if one is not entirely sold on Clement 's performance , all would hard pressed to find flaws in Loren Horsley 's performance .Not since Angela Bettis 's inspired turn as the title character in the film May , have I seen a better or more complex representation of the female social misfit / geek .Horsley 's portrayal of chronic loser , Lily , is incredibly complete .Her performance is so subtle and believable , that I found myself connecting with her , and leaning forward in my seat as I might during a gripping live performance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is just a very well put together film , and I did my damnedest during the focus group to voice my enjoyment of it in hopes that this one will not end up simply collecting dust on shelf at Miramax .I do not actually believe in this mythic thriving quirky cinema market that other focus group members told tale of , I and it seems the fate of this film 's future here in the states is hardly set in stone .I 'll resist the urge to call Cohen a pure bread puppy , and instead reaffirm that he really did his job well in the case of Eagle vs. Shark , and I hope to see it 's release in the near future .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "TBH , there are so many lilttle snippets of news around atm , its easier to do one big update rather than keep adding little bits here and there .Well , that s my excuse .EDIT - I 've updated the site and given the two reviews their own page Jenni emailed in and asked me to make a couple of edits to her review , a tiny bit of wording which I have duely done .Also the film poster and some other newsy bits - Official site , Takia interivew - Can read it all over on the Eagle vs Shark page on WTF !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Note - As the film is currently screening at Sundance , it will no doubt be mentioned on blogs and Sundance related sites and the like .However I 've covered the film here on WTF ! in a fair amount of detail and as its not a Conchords project , but a Jemaine acting one , I shall not keep updating the main news page with news and articles off the back of Sundance .All WTF ! updates for Eagle vs Shark shall be on the film 's page .Sound fair enough ?Any and all updates for the film will not go on the main news page of WTF !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not everyone who is a fan of the Conchords wants to read every bit of news from other projects the guys work on .So to be fair , I 've done it this way .After hearing I Do n't Want -- and knowing a little bit about the film -- I can see why Taika wanted that song for the film .I hope the film does well and gets some more exposure for all of those involved .And I hope I get to see it at some point ! \" It was a hilarious , hilarious moment in a very bleak , bleak time of my life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The Napoleon Dynamite comparison was widely used .Taika has never seen Napoleon Dynamite and nor have I. So when I finally get to see Eagle vs Shark , I 'll then go watch Napoleon Dynamite and say ' Hey , it reminds me of Eagle vs Shark ' Just trying to be different .Or just trying .Windrider - Reviewer liked it .Quite a lot .Summed up saying ' Of all the films I got to see at Sundance , I 'm not sure it was the best , but it was definitely the one I enjoyed the most .

{"text": "/film - Gave it a film rating of 8.5 out of 10 , 'nuff said .Almost .The review mentions a few other films , to help you out .The Royal Tenenbaums , Little Miss Sunshine and some film called Napoleon Dynamite .Indiewire - Second from bottom paragraph on the page .Another one who liked it .Says ' Director Waititi has a promising future ' .What might also catch your eye is the mention of some film called Napoleon Dynamite .So that s a feeling the love vote for Taika methinks !And the reviewer gets in a mention of some film called Napoleon Dynamite .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "SHARK reminded me a lot of NAPOLEON DYNAMITE .The worlds are completely different , but there 's a similar tone .There 's a kind of nerdy kitsch that is shared , the lead character is an annoying idiot , but somehow he 's still likable .The performances are all great , there are no lulls in the pacing and the funny is consistent .It 's a really sweet movie . 'Awwww sweet .And nerdy .And reminiscent of some film called Napoleon Dynamite .Moviehole - Thought it was an ' absolute gem ' and says to watch out for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No mention of some film called Napoleon Dynamite .O wait , I just typed ... o crudlet .Quintana Books - One reviewer used lots of long words but seemed to enjoy it , the other said ' Bah ' and talked about The Castle a gem of a movie from 1997 .One of my top films I have to admit .The review also mentions some film called Napolean Dynamite .Never heard of it .Yes I 'm trying .Also Variety has named Taika Waititi as one of the top 10 directors to watch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
