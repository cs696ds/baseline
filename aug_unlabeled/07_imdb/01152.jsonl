{"text": "Criminal Minds had me hooked from Episode 1 .Good for a pilot .Pilots are generally supposed to illustrate what the show 's about , give general character descriptions , and they are generally not very entertaining because of these facts - plut the low budget .This was a pretty good one , though all the characters were excessively ... them .For instance , Gideon was excessively PTSD , Reid was excessively weird , Hotch was excessively tightass ... but it all set up the show .The profiling was simple compared to later seasons , but this was good as it taught the audience about profiling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They had no evidence the password was from a CD at all , and I 'd have thought a teenager clever enough to set up that kind of protection on his computer would be more likely to pick a random password with randomized letter and numbers .Criminal Minds pilot . \"Kinda hard to feel good about catching one when you know there are 50 more still out there .\" This episode contained all of the ingredients for a compelling pilot .The great characters were each introduced in a plausible way , and we got just enough of a hint about each one to make us want to know more .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Gideon was troubled , but not so troubled that he was ineffective .Reid was a nerd , but not unable to relate to others .Hotch could have been a rat - sent to inform on a fellow officer - but he did n't turn out to be that either .The plot was riveting .Here was a race against the clock to figure \" it \" out before someone else died .This was n't a standard police show or forensic science show - we were n't looking back on evidence , we were trying to predict behavior and save a life that was in imminent danger .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The moodiness of the characters and plot were well revealed by each shot .The pink umbrella among the sea of black ones emphasized that we were going to be focusing on the victim .The stuffy , cramped feel of Slessman 's house showed us that he was too limited a character to be the brains behind these crimes .The delivery of each line was muted , quiet - no shouting or histrionics - so that when the drama of the climactic scene came , Gideon 's changed demeanor distracted us along with the killer .The cliffhanger ending was the icing on this rich , gooey , delicious cake .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When women begin to go missing in Seattle and are found strangled several days later , the Behavioral Analysis Unit at Quantico is called in to hunt the killer .Supervisory Special Agent Jason Gideon has just returned to his job as the head of the FBI 's Behavioral Analysis Unit following a six month period of medical leave due to his involvement in the case of Adrian Bale , a bomber from Boston .Gideon and his team were on the case when he made a decision in tghe field which , in turn , lead to the deaths of six agents .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is an excellent first episode of what has become an amazing show .The incredibly talented actors and actresses , along with terrific scripts and a sense of realism to the characters as well as the events and the way the action unfolds make this show a ' must see ' .If you watch this first episode and see the BAU team in action , you 'll know why .The Epitome of a TV Pilot .I 've been a fan of Criminal Minds for a long time but had not seen the pilot until this week .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thus , I have the benefit of reviewing this episode after years of being a fan of this show .What makes this such an expert pilot is that it preview several important aspects of this series ' plot .For starters , it gives a subtle yet revealing glimpse into the personality of each BAU member ( and the soon - to - be member , Elle ) .The episode also shows not only what profiling is all about and how it is an effective criminal detection method , but it also shows ( via the Gideon fighting PTSD subplot ) how much of a toll profiling takes on the profiler .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Great Start .I do so enjoy psychologically intensive TV shows and this one was every thing I enjoy with enough of a difference to make it stand out .The first time they used the photo to scene trick it was a bit of a shock but worked very well .The establishing scenes with showing small glimpses of life outside the unit were a good addition whilst the story built up slowly , gaining momentum to the all action finale .The facts are clearly stated to make sure the viewer knows what going on and each character was made slightly distinctive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There were also light moments to take the edge off the situation .The scene in the classroom was a nice touch whilst the story was appropately tone setting for future episodes .A cop from Virginia gets recruited to solve a series of murders in Seattle , perhaps the work of a serial killer .Yep , this is similar to other shows \" Profiler \" , \" NYPD Blue \" , \" Hillstreet Blues \" , but it was an ok pilot .Was I impressed ?Both yes and No .They spun a bit of originality in this one by having the character of Gideon be sort of poetic cop who likes to recite lines from Emerson , Nietzsche \" If you look too deeply into the abyss , the abyss will look into you . \" Gideon is definitely out there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I did like the character of Elle Greenway ( Lola Glaudini ) , she 's tough and speaks her mind .She and Derek have this gender battle going which is funny .In the pilot , they are tracking killer who likes to keep his victims alive for seven days before killing them , thus exploiting them .However it 's not over , Gideon does n't think by the profile that this kid is as crazyas he seems and his right , he eventually comes up with a theory that they are two killers .The next couple of scenes are well executed , yet very familiar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes I know it 's standard stuffbut actually this is still part of the strategy of most profilers .Overall it looks like an ok show .will it last ?Just what I expected in this show !Finally , a bad boy in the bureau in Derek .Hey who says all FBI types of stiff and cold ? ?Hotchner is trying to convince Gideon to help them locate a kidnapper before he kidnaps again .Apart from this Hotchner evaluates Gideon for his work without his knowledge .What i can say a great start for a great tv series .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although i 'm downloading any episodes of that serie trying to collect season 1&2 .On this episode was really exciting to watch how five Special Agents put their minds together to get into the mind of the abductor to forecast his next move .Director achieved to show us a group of five Special Agents that each one of them has his own knowledge that will lead finally to the solve of the puzzle .Good start and interesting case for the pilot !This is where it all started ... the pilot episode .We are introduced to the team with Gideon , Hotchner , Reid , Morgan and Elle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Gideon the father figure with a history , Hotch as boss of the team with family , Reid as the young strange Dr. and Morgan the detective type .I missed a bit more of Elle in this episode , but it will come later .The case is very interesting and the episode led an open end at the gas station .It was definetly the reason why I watched the next episode !I wanted to know what was going on there .After this first episode Hotchner was my favorite character , because I like leading persons .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Will watch it again someday !Great , sets us up nicely for a brilliant couple of seasons of a great show !I just recently started to watch the show , about mid - first - season , when it started appearing on living(here in Britain ) , but know I went back to the roots and watched the first few episodes , and there awesome !Our introduction to Gideon comes in the form of an introduction to a mentally unstable genius , perfect for a lead role !THe first plotline - although not as clever as it becomes - is still gripping , with our introduction to Reid and Morgan also setting the scene for some highly interesting charachter developement later !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This show is a must see !I tuned in only because I like what I thought this show would be like .I will continue to tune in because of the quality , excitement and rapid heartbeat I felt during the show !I was very impressed !From the sneak preview ads , I presumed that Criminal Minds would be similar to other shows I enjoy .Although it is similar on some levels , it was a pleasant surprise that many levels were unique and exciting !The twist of the main character having some emotional difficulty , but working through it physically and emotionally was encouraging .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The wonderful casting of this team was well orchestrated .There is strength mixed with unmatched brilliance and good looks .I am truly looking forward to future episodes and already have my DVR set to record , just in case I am having to work late !Really great new show !This show takes a well - used subject and breathes a lot of new life into it .The characters are interesting and have good interaction and the show eschews gimmicky or cliched elements in favor of very well written dialogue .This is the one new show I 've seen this year that really makes me look forward to seeing it again ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ok .Let 's start with the obvious .This show is patterned after Grissom and Co. over there in Las Vegas .Both shows revolve around a sage who pilots younger agents to make quality conclusions .This is not a complaint , but I somehow expected the supporting characters in this show to be a little more off beat .After having seen the episode , the best conclusion is the supporting characters are going to matter that much .This show is about Gideon as portrayed by Mandy Patinkin .He brings a drive and sense of purpose to the show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I suppose they went with the gimmicky ending in order to reel people into the new drama .I 've found my new favourite show !With the cancellation of the West Wing , I was getting depressed with the thought of not having a favourite show to watch .But depressed no more I am ( as Yoda would say ) .My new favourite show is CRIMINAL MINDS !What 's good about it ?It 's intelligent , fast moving , suspenseful and the characters seem to be likable .I have always been interested in character profiling and criminal pyschology and so this is the perfect series for me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just good old rock - solid entertainment .Highly recommended ! just what i thought this show would be ... .ok , so considering that i have been studying criminal psychology for the last several years of my life , i was obviously interested in the idea behind this show .i enjoy other crime dramas , and thrillers , so why not this one ? and let\\ 's face it , anything from the creators of c.s.i . deserves a chance !anyway , i wasn\\'t disappointed .i like the mix of charectors , the insight , the way they play off each other , and actually thought this was a really good case to grab veiwer attention . who didn\\'t like silence of the lambs , right ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "TOO MUCH ! ! !i love this programme already and it was only the pilot episode ! ! !the build up to the premiere showing on FIJI TV was intense and provided the public with a brief but detailed view of what \" Criminal Minds \" is all about ! amazing amazing amazing pilot episode ... youire given a brief idea of what each main character is all about and what abilities and qualities they all have .The character of Special Agent Jason Gideon is strongly portrayed in this episode and Mandy Patinkin plays this role extremely well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The criminal minds that are investigated in this episode are so complex , that it is so obvious who they are in a twisted sort of way !Like I said before , this was an amazing pilot episode and I ca nt wait until next Wednesday for episode 2 ; Compulsion !Sounds INTERESTING ! ! !Yay !A great new series !This is a wonderful series , and you can tell just by watching this revealing episode !I loved it !I really think that CBS has found a great new way to fill Wednesday nights from nine o'clock to ten o'clock .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They each seem to have their own qualities , or quirks if you will , that seem to help them solve the case .I am telling you right now , Garcia is the most awesome person on Earth !She 's hilarious .I love this series !It is awesome !Review .When you go to watch a crime drama the first thing that comes to mind does nt tend to be Character Devolopment because it takes so much longer for you to get a handle on a characters personality and real - life in a crime drama style television show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I thought the episode was good as it got going .Everyone needing to travel to another city to solve the case kind of made the first 25 % of the episode go by kind of slow .The monolouge by Gideon once he had found the man on the dock was a very good scene , I liked the intensity and fast pace in his voice as he was trying to break the man .The ending is another thing that took me off guard as you do nt normally see endings like that in a crime drama .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do nt know what to make of this ending , with Gideon in real danger as the man is now pointing a gun at his head .I do nt know if they will show us what happens with this situation next episode , but I certainly hope to see how he managaed to get himself out of this situation .I loved it !Funny Hotch , Morgan and Gideon at odds , mysterious pre - series backstory relating to Boston ... . ... all the things a great pilot needs .Having Gideon come back from ' medical leave ' is a much better plot device than introducing a new character to what we 're supposed to assume is an already formed team like most shows tend to .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In this episode Hotch got to crack a joke , with a smile , and show how hopeful he was before everything seemed to fall apart for him in later seasons .I love the beginning and end parts where Hotch is talking baby names with Hailey and , later , with Gideon .Ironic that they named the baby Jack , since Hotch wanted to avoid serial killer names for his kid , 'cause , hello ?Jack the Ripper .Quite an obvious connection to be made , if you ask me .I was never a big fan of Elle , but I also did n't start watching the show until Paget Brewster had been on the show for a while so my dislike of Elle might be because she was n't Emily .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "well , this was my 3rd episode of CM ! the first was that ripper one in season 4 , and the 2nd was the season 5 premier ! those episodes were so good , that i decided to start watching CM from the beginning ! !the episode was GOOD .... not great ! cause i personally had bigger expectations ... , but considering it was a pilot , i would say they did a pretty good job !The Whole Gideon ' dark past ' thing was interesting . also the 2 killers thing was a surprise ...", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This episode starts with gideon getting back from medical leave following the Adrian Bale Bomber incident .Seems quite surprising that they focused so much attention on him yet they only have one episode on him ( Would nt get fooled again ) .You can see that at first , they only focused on one character ( Gideon ) instead of the chemistry of the group as a whole .Everyone else , from Elle to Hotch seemed to play second fiddle to Gideon .Interesting move , that could be seen from other shows as well ( CSI ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Overall , great pilot and criminal minds season 6 should go back to the roots ... .Best pilot ever !Not many shows can start out with a pilot as good as Criminal Minds did .I think that this was definately the best pilot that I have ever seen .The episode started off with the BAU being brought into Seattle after a fourth woman goes missing in four months , and they are asked to try to help find him before he kidnaps again .Meanwhile , Hotch is asked to secretly evaluate Gideon to determine if he is really ready to return to work again after returning from a six month leave of abscence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A decent pilot episode for CBS ' dark crime thriller .\" Criminal Minds \" is one of many CBS crime procedurals , a fact that alienates many viewers right there , who are tired of the nearly all - crime lineup that CBS currently has .Yet \" Criminal Minds \" is now in its third season and is an official hit , getting over 14 million viewers , and it is in its third season .I finally started watching it this year and after watching many season three episodes decided to go back and watch it from the beginning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
