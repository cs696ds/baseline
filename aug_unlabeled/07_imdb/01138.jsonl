{"text": "After finally watching the film with tempered expectations , I 'm calling Fury a borderline snub .As with most coming - of - age war movies , Fury is told from the perspective of a young and naive young man not prepared for the horrors of war .In this case the protagonist is Norman ( Logan Lerman , aka Percy Jackson ) , who is assigned to the crew of Don \" Wardaddy \" Collier ( Brad Pitt ) , chief of the fictional WWII tank Fury .Together with a veteran crew - played by an interesting ensemble featuring Shia LaBeouf , typically comedic actor Michael Pena and Walking Dead alum John Bernthal -Norman is thrown into the deep end , where he must learn to kill or be killed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fury is a visceral affair , with plenty of explosions , ripped limbs , bodies getting shredded by bullets and exploding heads .It heightens the sense of reality and also offers a sobering reminder of how cheap life is in times of war .Both the Americans and Germans are depicted as humans as opposed to WWII stereotypes , with even individual members of the Fury crew showing shades of good , bad and in between .When it comes to the battlefield , however , there is a camaraderie and trust that allows them to put their differences aside , adding further depth to the narrative and the characters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And as much as he might be a douche in real life , Shia LaBeouf demonstrates once again that he 's one of the most remarkable young actors of his generation , even with that horrible moustache on his face .Logan Lerman has been the lead in coming - of - age dramas before ( The Perks of Being a Wallflower ) , so he 's right at home as the innocent Norman .Michael Pena showed he could do drama in End of Watch , which is probably why Ayer brought him back , and we all know after The Walking Dead that Jon Bernthal can play an a - hole to perfection .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Now , I 'm not saying for one second that I believe Tyson is innocent - only he and Washington know what happened - but I do find it shocking that he was convicted based on the lacklustre evidence that was available and adduced at court .The truth is , if the accused was not someone as universally loathed as Mike Tyson , he probably would have walked away .She may have initially wanted to go through with it and changed her mind at the last moment , but Tyson was too much of a reckless animal to hear or sense her terrified opposition .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's why I also do n't doubt at all that Tyson honestly believes he is innocent , which is why he turned down an opportunity at an early release because he simply refused to apologize to her - just an apology , not even an admission of guilt .In any case , the rape case is a fascinating part of the book , and I would recommend everyone to read up about it as much as they can before making their own judgment .That was heavy .The book slows down towards the end and becomes more contemplative , as Tyson 's drug and alcohol abuse , sex addiction , accumulated boxing injuries and uncontrollable fury prevent him from having any semblance of a real life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's strange , because despite wasting all his talent and hard work and throwing away all the fruits of his success , I ca n't help but feel sorry for the guy .On the other hand , even Tyson 's staunchest defenders would concede that he is a destructive individual with loathsome qualities - and that 's even if you believe he is innocent of rape .Tyson understands this himself and appears genuinely remorseful at times ( though at other times he remains defensive ) , attributing his insanity to the combustible combination of a massive ego and extremely low self - esteem .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's why I say you can not treat Tyson like a real person if you want to truly enjoy this book .It 's a strange comparison , but I like to think of him as Homer Simpson - a character you find endearing in spite of , and maybe even because of , his anti - social qualities , but would hate if you knew such a person in real life .Everyone probably has an opinion on Tyson , both as a boxer and as a man , and neither might be flattering .But do n't let your prejudices get in the way of one of the best books you might ever read .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Shaun of the Dead is very funny .I Am Legend had its moments .Resident Evil is a guilty pleasure .REC is terrifying .But as of now , I 'd still rank World War Z on top .Why ?Well for starters , while it is one of the most intense cinematic experiences I 've had with a \" zombie film \" , World War Z does n't feel like your conventional zombie flick .Yes , there are loads of zombies , carnage and people fighting for survival , but the mood of it feels ... different .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Throughout the 116-minute running time I never got the sense that I had \" seen it all before \" and never felt like I knew where the story was heading .There are also heavier political elements in World War Z than typical zombie movies , though I do n't want to say much more than that because of potential spoilers .The film centers on Brad Pitt , who plays Gerry Lane , a former United Nations employee , and his family ( wife played by Mireille Enos , whom I am unfamiliar with ) , as the zombies start to take over the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lane travels to several locations around the world in search of an answer , battling hoards of zombies and scraping through extremely close calls along the way .A few of the particularly pivotal scenes are still vividly floating around in my mind , a sign that director Marc Foster ( Monster 's Ball , Quantum of Solace , The Kite Runner ) really got them right .They were intense without overdoing the whole crazy - mutilated - zombies - jump - out - of - nowhere routine we 're so accustomed to seeing in these types of movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The special effects were better than the trailer suggested ( I initially thought they looked terrible ) but some of the scenes with masses of zombies still looked a little too CGI .But these are my only complaints .I would compare World War Z to my favourite film from a couple of years ago , Rise of the Planet of the Apes .Sure , there are lots of flaws and holes , but it 's one of those rare films that kept me engrossed from start to finish , and at one stage during the movie made me want to say out loud - \" this movie is freaking awesome !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
