{"text": "We know that of the week 's new releases , The Mortal Instruments : City of Bones opened at No . 1 in the U.S. ( No . 3 overall for the weekend ) .For the time of year the film was released it did well domestically .It also opened at No . 1 in Australia , as well as other countries .The film will open this weekend in other major international markets , including Germany , Italy , Spain and South America .Plus , the movie will be in theaters for awhile so it will gross much more over a long period .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We encourage you to keep seeing it until it bows out of theaters !i have already left lots of messages on youtube and facebook and i honestly hope that people realise what an amazing movie the mortal instruments is and go see it .There are lots of movies which i only watched when they were no longer in theaters and i totally regret that because there 's nothing like watching it in the movie theater .Now i want to watch those movies sequels in the movie theater as soon as they get out .Probably many people will watch TMI after it is no longer in theaters and regret it and then they will want to watch the sequel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of course the US media is trying to label this a fail , but I am not convinced that Constantin or Sony feel that way .Overall , I have never relied on or ultimately agreed with critics on what movies or books I should read and this experience just cements that perspective further .People : its OK to love Mortal Instruments ( the books and the movie )The hatred of the critics has only served to stiffen my resolve to IGNORE their misogynistic and elitist asses .BTW , my son went with me to see it , loved it ( particularly the fighting and the runes ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even the skunks would agree bc their attitude stinks to high heaven get out the air freshener .I have seen it three times and my mum has gone twice with me and a friend once .Loved the film , I really hope it continues to do well because I want city of ashes and city of glass as a movie so badly .I loved the movie and I have to say that i 'm worried .Even when they 're trying to calm everyone .I 'm trying to make everyone I know to go and see the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm deffinitely gon na watch it again and again .But I prefer to think from now that we wo n't make it to the seaquel .Just in case .So it does n't hurt so much if it happens .It really hurts to see the movie suffering like that .People calling Cassandra Clare a hypocrite for jumping ship(That was such a bitch move though ) .I feel like I do n't even wanna continue being a fan(which really hurts me alot ) .I love the books , and I feel like loving it too much caused me to hate it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I hate going on IMDb .I hate reading articals .She went from saying she had so much input in the film to saying she had none after the numbers were n't favourable .How is that not \" jumping ship \" ?It was a terrible thing to do , disingenuous toward the cast and filmmakers for sure .She did n't jump ship , she 's been saying for weeks she was going on vacation .And SHE HAS ALWAYS SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH THE CHOICES !They asked her opinion on some things since they did n't want to deviate to far .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But again she 's said it a million times anytime someone asked her about it .@Josie : She does have SOME input in the film , but inputs are likes suggestions and nothing more .If they ask her for her opinion , she will give it , does n't mean that they will do what she wants though .She meant that they asked her for thoughts and some in which were taken to consideration , others were not , BUT she did NOT call the shots .That 's not jumping ship at all , it 's called be honest .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Seeing those negative reviews should make you want to support Cassie even more .Why would you let people 's opinions change something that you love ?I mean I see those reviews and articles too , but it does n't make me not want to be a fan anymore - it makes me mad that some people are so ignorant .If you were truly a fan , you 'd be empowered by this .So no worries ok ? :] .That feeling when you really love the adaptation of a book and people kept telling it sucked and that you can really feel the fandom trying so hard to make it a success ... only in TMI fandom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm so thankful that the rights for the franchise where bought by a studio who looks at the big picture and does n't only think of the profit it 's going to make .Bless you Constantin .My only thought is that the movies will do better with each sequel .It will be more well known by the time City of Ashes , bigger fanbase , etc .Plus I find that usually the movies themselves are better with each sequel .The actors find their footing and learn the characters even more , the scripts improve ... so yes lets not loose heart Shadowhunters :) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We all really liked the movie .I 'm going again this weekend with a friend and in 2 weeks with my mom ( who had read the books ) and 2 other Friends .I live in the netherlands and the books are n't that know here .There were n't that many people at the first screening .But there were more people , than there was with the first Twilight movie , so I 'm keeping hope alive .Twilight became very populair after New Moon , so maybe TMI has to grow and build a fanbase , beside the book fans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "SO RELIEVED THAT THE NUMBER WENT UP .Everybody estimated it would be like 9 million or something , how do you like us now hhahafdklasjfdkls;fj dsakl ; yay .Saw it again today ! twice !In a row !It was so great !The movie is just awesome ! !And you get this little high after seeing it and then you feel like you just have to watch it again !So it 's kind of like a drug ... hehe .I loved this movie , I 'd read a lot of negative press and went anyway because of my passion for the books .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": ":D That friend went back with her hubby who liked it , even though he said it was more teen oriented ( ' Cus of the love triangle I think ) but still , he had fun :D Go go Shadowhunters , will make it happening :D .I think it will be better and better in the long run , but who knows ?Anyway , I 'm going in a few days , when it opens here .Too bad I ca n't see it in English , but I will .:) I 'm going with a friend of mine , she did n't know anything about the movie ( or the books ) , I sent her a link to the trailer and she loved it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I just do n't understand why the majority of US book fans have n't gone to the theatre yet .And there is a building amount of new youtubeers rant about the movie ( most of them are book fans ) .They do n't know the US box office thing and what they are doing as a fans .I will be pissed if the COA is cancelled ( even the Percy books have a 2nd film ) .and i did n't understand magnus a bit ( pantsless ? :P ) but overall , the movie was n't too bad :D .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hopefully they learned their lesson and wo n't have the 2nd movie come out around this time next year .Hopefully they 'll make more money as the weeks go by and more fans have the opportunity to see it .I was disgusted when I heard a DJ talking about it this afternoon - he said they did n't know for sure if they will be making a sequel or not !Apparently he has n't done his research !This movie wo n't get a sequel , it does n't matter what the plans were .Here 's how box office and accounting works - movies always fall after their first week .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It wo n't make a lot from other territories because most of them are smaller territories - if it 's a smash in say , Mexico , it 'll make 4 million USD .The studio is only going to see , and this is they worked out regional rights very well , 50 % of the revenue minus the advertising costs .A studio can say it 's got plans to make more than one movie , but plans do n't matter unless the first one does well - unless you 're stupid rich and have endless amounts of money to waste like the man making the Atlas Shrugged films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Any chances of getting a sequel are slim to none if you ca n't bring in even HALF of your budget costs from America , the biggest market in the entire world .The majority of the comments here really just do n't get it and strike me as incredibly delusional .Unless this movie has some incredible set of legs - which I 'm betting it wo n't , no sequel will be made .I do n't get why you keep insisting that there wo n't be a sequel when Constantin Film already said that there WILL BE one ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Seems the only one that is delusional here is YOU .Unless , they take back what they said - which is unlikely - then they will make City of Ashes .Watched it 3 times now , I feel I well and truly did my part for the movie going along with fans and family .Upon watching it again last night I really wondered why people are n't going to see it .It 's a really great movie .I decided to enjoy it for what it was \" an adaption \" not word for word from the book .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's interesting to see reactions for non fans .My brother had n't read the book but loved the movie and although I kind of cringed at the whole Bach scene he actually thought that was kind of cool .I still cringe at the Madame Dorothea scene with the door and the humping of Luke 's chair ( why oh why were they added ) but the actors should hold their head high as their acting was pretty darn spot on .I could n't imagine anyone else in their places now .I think sadly the movie was doomed from day one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wonder .I just hate how critics can seal the fate of a movie .I hate they have a power to ruin something so wonderful .Hats off to all the cast .Hold your heads high .You were given a script and you acted it superbly .I so hope there is another for my own selfish reasons although I do feel for the cast doing another knowing in advance it probably wo n't perform well .No matter I wish them all well :) .It wo n't make much money in Japan or Korea , two other big money makers , because of the themes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This movie will probably drop 50 percent next week .It needs to make about 220 million to BREAK EVEN since Kulzer , Constantins co - president , reported a marketing budget of 60 million .Studios only keep 55 percent of total box office revenue .This movie ca n't expect to make more than 30 million total off DVD sales , syndication rights , and merchandise .Also SONY made its predictions after the awful Wednesday opening , whereas for successes , it makes predictions a week in advance before opening day .Hey everyone !So glad and refreshing to here all of the support for the movie !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm so glad the movie is doing better !I went to see it with three friends and again with three family members , and will hopefully see it once more with some more friends .We need to get all the way to CoHF everyone ! ps its great to have fellow fans supporting each other , cuz thinking about the franchise failing and reading all the negative reviews was so depressing .I am a huge fan of the books and I usually hate adaptations from books to movies ( i ca nt stand any and all things Twilight related - books or movies ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I really enjoyed it and i have already seen it 4 times .I thought the casting was incredible and the movie was very fast paced and exciting .I do hope that they continue to make the movies and at least finish the city of glass .COA should be made especially since COB already exceeded expectations .As long as COA does well internationally ( if it is nt strong domestically ) - they should continue to make sequels .Have only seen the movie once , although I definitely intend to go again in the next week or two .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I really loved the first half , but once the action started ramping up ...I do n't know , I kind of lost the magic a bit .Because then it was less the characters being themselves and interacting and being awesome , and more people just fighting vampires / demons / what have you .The main actors were spot on , though .Portrayed their characters brilliantly .Hats off to them !I think they did poorly with the movie .I was really disappointed .Yes sometimes movies need to change the story line a bit , but honestly , the scenes I was looking forward to were n't there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jace was n't jace .Magnus was just weird .Most of the scenes were awkward and it lacked comedy .I really hope that , if they do film a sequel , by some miracle , it will be less disappointing .They should really read fan reviews , it would help .Finally some positive information about this movie .I read the books and saw this movie and honestly it was a very good movie .I do n't know why people are giving such bad reviews .I 'm guessing because they just do n't understand or because some older folks are just to old to care .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
