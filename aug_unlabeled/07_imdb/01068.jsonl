{"text": "Lacking nearly everything that makes such films a spectacle , this flick is like a long fake travelogue that happens to have a rubber gator killing people in a relatively bloodless fashion .The cast is full of instantly recognizable Italian vets like the aforementioned and even the little red - haired girl from Fulci 's House by the Cemetery .Yet this line - up alone simply ca n't help this from being an exercise in constantly looking at the watch .Even Stelvio Cipriani 's usually memorable film score work sounds phoned in .Film : 4/10 DVD Picture : 6/10 ( a bit too bright and a shoddy standards conversion ) DVD Sound ( English Mono ) : 3/10 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
