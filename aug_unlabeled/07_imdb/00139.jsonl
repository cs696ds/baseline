{"text": "The characters are just so colorful , insightful , extremely funny ( looking at you Karen ) .And I am proud to be a viewer to say the least .Looking forward to seeing the rest of this brilliant piece of television .90 's rocked :) 9,0/10 .Loved how the writers treated gays .AWESOME ! !This was the funniest damn sitcom to ever grace the airwaves .I said many times , \" I do n't want to meet the cast .I wanna meet the writers ! \"The writers are absolutely certifiable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't care what your interests are - politics - theater or basket weaving - there 's a joke for you and it 's a highbrow joke and not just toilet humor .The sight gags are hilarious as well .It was VERY well written by brilliantly insane writers and all the regular cast had absolute perfect timing .Just funny , funny , funny .It was very \" out there \" for it 's time in an era where if you were gay you still needed to be in the closet and shut up .The only other \" sitcom \" type program that I remember really comparing to Will & Grace 's non - stop humor was Jack Benny 's radio program in the 40 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "turned out great for WIll and Grace !I love the random wittiness , Karen 's bubbly and snotty personality , and the roleplaying here is superb !Everyone 's so dramatically humorous on this show ...I never got enough of it !A once great , groudbreaking show that is ever rapidly sinking to mediocrity .Will & Grace was once upon a time a groundbreaking show .Not one , but two male , homosexual main characters , complimented by two straight female women .The show was never too \" stereotypish \" with its leads , and really used Will and Grace to show that gay and straight people have the exact same romantic dreams and difficulties .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For a good 5 years , this one one of the finest half - hours on television .Sadly , the writers painted themselves into some corners with Grace 's nuptuals and the ill - conceived concept to have Will and Grace nearly end their friendship over a ditched plan to share a child together .The plots were not well - received , and then they had to scramble to get the characters out of those plot threads .They also started to rely more and more on guest stars as comedic crutches , and even worse , Jack and Karen 's quirks , once used to slam home jokes to great effect , became jokes on their own .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This overkill has greatly dulled their effectiveness as supporting characters of late .Will and Grace themselves have also crossed the line from \" romantically unlucky / picky \" to \" slightly pathetic and mildly unbelievable . \" Sadly , the audience , including myself , have pretty much abandoned this show , and the network rerun I saw last week did nothing to win me back .I ca n't grade this show too harshly due to several years of excellence , but they 've been no better than a 6/10 the past two years .2005/06 will be their final year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of the last great sitcoms .These days there are some terrible sitcoms being produced .It seems that Will & Grace was one of the last few truly great TV sitcoms .The cast had great chemistry and director James Burrows continuously drew terrific performances from Eric McCormack , Debra Messing , Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes over an incredible 8-year run .Statistics speak for themselves - between this talented foursome they garnered 5 Emmy Awards and 23 nominations .Not to mention the 2000 Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series .The plot lines were simplistic , but the clever jokes and the sheer enthusiastic guest stars ( Debbie Reynolds , Matt Damon , Alec Baldwin , Cher and Madonna , to name a few ) were second to none .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I still ca n't believe it 's over ... .Probably my third or second favorite show .It 's just so addicting to watch !Once I started I could n't stop watching it .The plots are always to absorbing and all the characters are hilarious .That 's enough to be a good show .But I think the main concept that makes it so good is the creativity .It 's not just another show of two friends who will end up falling in love at the end .The thing is , is that they ca n't !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I love this show !I can watch it all the time .Mostly because of Karen !The casting was perfect for everyone , do n't get me wrong , but to me Karen is the best .And that voice !I sometimes start laughin without even hearing the joke !But there is one episode that I 'll never forget when she was scared of cockies and heard them talk but then she realised it was the pencil sharpener and felt relived .I laughed so hard I think people on the street heard me .Thank God someone did n't call 911 thinking I had a seasure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This show definitely tops any sitcom I 've ever seen , and maybe even any live action show .Each of the four characters has their own distinct personality .Both Will and Jack are gay but Jack seems more like an effeminate gay stereotype than Will does .Karen is so mean to be so nice , and Grace ... well , the show 's not called \" Will & Grace \" for nothing !For six and a half years this was a barrel of laughs , but not only of laughs , of an everlasting bond between Will and Grace .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For example , imagine Rocky & Bullwinkle being about Boris and Natasha .Also , remember Joey .I do n't really like how Will interferes in Grace 's life all the time , but hey , it makes story .Anyway , I highly recommend this sitcom , but be warned .In my opinion , after \" Will & Grace & Vince & Nadine \" , the show just became not even close to what it used to be .The eighth season was just terrible IMO , and I did n't like the finale that much , but I guess it was a better finale than the season 6 or 7 finales would have been . will and grace is one of the shows that make you want to live life to the fullest and have fun all the time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
