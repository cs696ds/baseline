{"text": "Despite the high energy opening , the script is noticeably lacking in - jokes , leaving the job of providing humor to the performances .Brian Henson , having produced and directed such high quality sci - fi fare as \" Farscape \" should know well the level of sophistication required to appeal to audiences of the sci - fi genre and its parodies .While some nods to films like \" Shankshaw Redemption \" is present , most of the script 's jokes are weak and predictable such as \" May the fish be with you \" .Even a Statler and Waldorf exchange is recycled from the Muppet Show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "We all can in a way .It 's too bad that society has somewhat labeled Henson as a children 's entertainer , and nothing else -- refusing to look deeper and recognize the adult humor and sophistication put into so many of his projects .I mean , come on , we all get funny looks when we pile Muppet stuff on store counters , and at one point in time or another , we were all teased for liking a \" children 's entertainer \" when we went through our teen years .In this aspect , I see a lot of myself in Gonzo when I watch this film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "From the time I first saw Big Bird on \" The Muppet Movie \" to the time I realized \" Hey , that 's Liza Minelli ! \" on \" The Muppets Take Manhattan \" , the guest stars were a great part of the fun for me .But I was really let down by the cameos in MFS .They were all pretty sorry ( with the exception of Kathy Griffin ) .In the old Muppet movies , the Muppets interacted with the guests , like Fozzie buying ice cream and swapping jokes with Bob Hope , Kermit thinking John Cleese is a butler , and Miss Piggy being given a make - over by Joan Rivers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But I have to admit that Dr. Phil Van Neuter 's brief , yet hilarious cameo was wonderful !Next to the Muppet Boarding House scene , Phil 's is my favorite .He is probably one of the funniest Muppets ever created .Even with all of the disappointments along the way , Muppets From Space was a hilarious , delightful , happy movie about family and love .Even with all of the \" could have been betters \" , it 's still a Muppet movie and that 's reason enough to love it .Noah Ginex ( 3 - 13 - 00 ) - After seeing Muppets from Space four times , I can now say that it was n't as horrible as I thought it was the first few times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Leaving Bunsen and Beaker at the gas station was also something that was written for a cheap laugh , and was obviously not in the characters mentalities at all .Kermit would never let them be left there .The last negative thing I will say is this : The movie was filled with too much dialogue and action ripped right out of other Muppet movies , i.e. The \" sadly temporary \" exchange in Bunsen and Beaker 's lab ( The Muppet Movie ) , and although it was nice to have Scooter back , Scooter selling T - shirts at the Alien Landing was basically a tracing of Scooter selling popcorn at the 3-D house in MTM .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
