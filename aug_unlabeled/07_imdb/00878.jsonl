{"text": "Yeah , I 'm talking to you .I know you paid money to see Daddy Day Camp in theaters .I would also recommend this movie to Dolph Lundgren fans , who will get a kick out of his performance .In fairness , this movie is actually slightly better than a lot of direct - to - video movies out there .But it is still a mostly anemic feature .At best , it 's a rental .DTV and it definitely looks and acts like it .Mr. ' Snow Dogs ' just can not pull off this role and even Dolph Lundgren ca n't make things any better .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Everything else STINKS .Straight - to - rental but a much improved version of bigger budgeted movies as 1991 \" Assassins \" starring Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas , and the dreadful 1991 film starring Bruce Willis called \" Last Man Standing \" .Cuba succeeds into killing one but not the other as he hides behind a scared female escort , and one of the things he does n't do is shoot helpless women .Because Cuba botched this assassination , they then hire a new hit man nicknamed \" The Wolf \" played by Dolph Lundgren .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All hell breaks loose as the wolf is eventually going to clash with the Cuba Gooding JR character since they 're both hired hit man 's .Watchable fare with Gooding Jr just sleepwalking through it all .Dolph Lundgren however , is quite good in this .This \" B \" level of film is sadly too familiar for Lundgren , who is alot more entertaining to watch than this film 's oscar winner .This seemed like a complete amateur film .Lines were bad , plot was very mediocre , filming was a bit amateur .Action scenes were largely nothing special .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thumbs down in my book .Unfortunately I thought this movie was really very terrible .Very , very terrible .Acting was average from Cuba Gooding Jnr . , awful by Lungren though he has a certain charisma regardless of his poor acting and as for the supporting mobsters - OMG they were just plain bad .I was actually laughing at their attenmpted accents . 'm not normally one to be so negative but I honestly feel like I 've lost an hour or so of my life that I ca n't get back .If this was classified as a comedy I would 've given it another half a star .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In any case it 's nice to see that Dolph Lundgren is still working and has even started to do a bit of clumsy acting in between action scenes .Welcome to another edition of Dtoid Community Discusses !I hope everyone had a good weekend ....I'm currently at the airport with my brother , Elem08 , as we wait for the plane that takes me away from Easter fun and back to work :( .So I thought what better way to spend this hour long wait for the plane than by putting a DCD together !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Rev and the gang basically went all MST3 K on one of the most epic videogame movies , Street Fighter .( Its an awesome show , and would LOVE to hear more like it ! .... maybe a Dtoid Science Theater 3 K ? )Anyway , I decided that this weeks topic would be videogame movies .Since videogames started becoming more and more mainstream , Hollywood has tried to capitalize on this new medium , to horrible results .Here is the quesion I posed to the panel !\" It 's no surprise that the success of videogames has caused Hollywood to try to capitalize on them , and try to make Box Office bucks adapting video games to the big screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sadly many things have gone wrong in videogame adaptations .Namely , they suck .Most recently , Street Fighter :The Legend of Chun Li did HORRIBLY and for the longest time had a 1 % on Rotten Tomatoes .Other movies that did relatively ok at the Box Office just demolished the source material and made gamers completely dissatisfied .What will it take to make a good videogame movie ?What are some of the best / worst ones you 've seen ?Will the fact that game companies Capcom getting involved with the movies help or hinder them ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "For the sake of this discussion I saw \" Postal \" .Anyway , Suff , Bleach Boy and I were talking this weekend about how our favorite videogame movie was Mortal Kombat .Besides the fact that it had a wicked awesome song ( MORTAL KOOOOOOOMBAT ! ! ! ) , there was a pretty cohesive story , and lots of fan service .( People using their actual moves in the movie , like Johnny Cage 's Punch - in - the - nuts ) .You guys remember Mortal Kombat ?How 'd you feel about it versus Street Fighter ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think Postal is a great cult film .It did n't try and take it self seriously at all and in the end I believe it paid off .I like Mortal Kombat so much because out of all of the video games movies I have seen , it is the most faithful adaptation .All of the costumes are perfect and the story was alright enough to keep me entertained .As for Street Fighter though , I find it great because it is so bad .The concept of the story worked , but it was very poorly executed and the dialogue was atrocious as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To be completely honest though , I 'm not really a big fan of video game movies , at least ones that we 've been seeing lately .If they 're supplemental to the story line , like the Dead Space movie ( have n't seen it ) , then I 'm fine with it .Movies that are just using the setting and plot of the games and attempting to make a movie out of it just feel cheap and not as immersive as the games to me ( save Silent Hill , kinda ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm fine with the fighting game movies , as the story in fighting games generally is n't presented too well in the games .The player typically has to turn to other mediums to get it , such as the instruction manual , a fan site / forum , comic books , or in the case of Mortal Kombat / Street Fighter , the movies ( however loosely based on the plot they are ) .It 's cool to see something visualized into a film cross - medium , like Watchmen , but there are a lot of movies that just should n't exist , like the Bloodrayne movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But for me , it was Tuesday .Tactix .As far as the future of videogames are concerned , it seems like some game companies , such as Capcom , have interest in getting more involved with this side of the entertainment by having a greater say in the process .Do you guys think this is ultimately a good idea ?Wexx .For the fans of the stories in the games , I think the game developers taking more control over the films is a great idea .I do n't think any respectable studio that wants their game to be well represented in a film would hire Uwe Boll to direct it ( unless ... you know , they want that ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
