{"text": "Heroine Movie Reviews .HEROINE astounds you with its brutal bluntness .Also , the director illustrates the heartrending and lamentable realities of the movie world brilliantly .On the flip side , although the writing borrows from reality and has ample shock value , the writers could 've avoided a few episodes in Mahi 's story , which seem unimportant .HEROINE is Kareena 's film all the way and she delivers an award - worthy performance .On the whole , HEROINE is yet another hard - hitting motion picture from Madhur Bhandarkar .For persistently choosing women - centric themes , for consistently winning national acclaim and most significantly , magnetizing moviegoers in large numbers to view his cinema , the efforts of the maverick film - maker deserve to be lauded .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Try not to miss it .Very clearly the written material at hand draws from unflattering accounts of various real and reel Hindi film heroines of the 80s who were in messy situations with their married co - stars .The film is made enjoyable by some pithy dialogue credited to Niranjan Iyengar .Heroine would have been crisper had it not digressed to cover every Bollywood insider account .Of course the saving grace of the film is Kareena who not only looks drop - dead gorgeous but is also adept as the girl interrupted .Heroine is Kareena 's Dirty Picture .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Definitely worth a dekho .For those who are enchanted by Bollywood and its troubled stars , this film is delightfully voyeuristic as it takes you into their sexy - yet - shady world .While the film 's first half is brisk , the second half meanders but manages to get its act together towards the end .There are some obvious loopholes -- such as how a top actress such as Mahi can be this isolated from the human race and reality -- but the weak links aside it 's a satisfying watch .Ratings:2 for the film and one extra one for Bebo .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film could easily be written off but for Kareena 's performance .As the bi - polar , erratic , insecure and vulnerable fading star , Kareena gives a superb performance .She looks beautiful , glamorous and makes Mahi her own .In fact , some of the incidents seem to be lifted straight out of Kareena 's life ( yes , there is an MMS scandal as well ) .Kareena , who has for a long time been used as a glamour quotient in Rs 100 crore films , gets a meaty role and gives it her best shot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And then , does them so convincingly .Kareena is in virtually every scene in the film .She is particularly good when she dons the no - makeup look and allows herself to go with the flow of the emotions .But when she is called upon to strut around like a heroine , she is , surprisingly , far less convincing .The place where the film scores is performances , and mind you , this ca n't be said for all the actors .Kareena does a good job , however tries too hard to give a powerful performance , which is very evident .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Arjun does a good job .Randeep , as usual does justice to his role .Shahana Goswami is brilliant , but it is unfortunate that her role is limited .Helen has a charming role and she plays it effectively .All said and done , the film may be a one - time watch .But if you expected too much out of the film , it may not be worth the anticipation and your money .Actually , to be fair , Heroine is quite stupendously glossy , with every actress soaked in bronzer , and much flattering lighting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "How then does Kareena do in this feature - length showreel ?Impressively well .Ever a strong actress , she takes the opportunity to emote her guts out , but has been given far too large and unexciting a stage .She wails and moans and grumbles and huffs and pouts and sticks out her hip and uses those insanely captivating eyes to tremendous effect .Kapoor acquits herself admirably and while the performance is overtly showy , it 's more than most of her peers can do .A film called Heroine would evidently be a heroine 's journey .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She was never quite big enough for her downfall or rebirth to matter .For most of the movie , we watch instead her trip from being a \" zeroine \" to a \" zeroine \" in a mad , sad jungle .Mainstream Bollywood movies surveying the film industry is a genre of its own .This one is the most obvious .This is Kareena Kapoor 's first film post ' Agent Vinod ' .So even as her eyeliner bleeds in some of the high - voltage melodramatic scenes , she ca n't go any lower than her previous release .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But Kareena takes this opportunity , puts it in a brown paper bag , blows in it , seals the opening and slaps it for an optimal explosion .Arjun Rampal has n't managed so many expressions in any film before and his acting skills have surely gone from a ' chair ' to a ' dressing table ' .Randeep Hooda 's role is limited to a few courtship scenes with Kareena and can be deemed unobjectionable .Divya Dutta has carved a niche for herself and any role that requires shedding of morals for commercial gains will have her name on it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

'-NDTV review .AHAHAH ITS SO TRUE ! shallow , arrogant , insecure actress , bebo is playing herself in the movie , it is nt a big stretch at all for her , i expected more !I found Kareena over - acting , like she was trying way too hard to try to win awards acting is supposed to be effort - less , i saw kareena trying to act rather than mahi , i m not the only one who thinks this , read these reviews : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But largely , the effort to act is too in - your - face to be enjoyable , and the lack of a character graph does n't help her cause . 'YAHOO REVIEW : ' I guess Kareena had hoped that this would be a National Award winning performance and to give credit where it 's due , Bebo 's neurotic portrayal of Mahi Arora is not all bad .But if this one was an acid test for her abilities as an actor , she is yet to prove her craft .HOLLYWOOD REPORTER REVIEW : ' At the center of it all lies Kapoor , whose characterization and performance end up being the most disappointing aspects of the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps he 's taking the viewers for granted , assuming we 'd automatically accept Kapoor as a superstar -- but Kapoor 's performance is artificial all the way through , marked by mannerisms and seemingly delivered into a mirror ' ._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": ", 2012 - 09 - 22 07:09 - Anonymous totally agree with all the above ! !Glad ppl are nt blinded by bebo !some bollywood ppl like kjoher and filmfare praise her blindly anything she does they love , they suck up to her so much ! glad these reviews are honest .Firstly as someone below accused me of FYI I was n't defending Kareena .Inspite of being a fan I 've not liked her in most of her recent films , but in Heroine she was really , really good .I mean her eyes emoted so much and she was the bright spot in the whole film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I might be a fan of Kareena but not a blind fan & I can realize that other actresses have delivered better performances this year .So you see I 'm not defending Kareena and oh BTW I think the film is absolutely terrible . \" senior trade analyst Vinod Mirani holds a completely opposite view . \"The opening reports are not very good .The basic plot of this Madhur Bhandarkar film remains the same as his earlier films .The problem here is there is no story , as such , in Heroine to hold a viewer 's interest .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
