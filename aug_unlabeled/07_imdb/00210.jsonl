{"text": "Last night over dinner Garrett and I watched To Live and Die in LA .Despite feeling a little ripped off that there was no 2Pac in the soundtrack ( HELLO , the world can always use more 2Pac ) I thought it was awesome .Garrett has been hounding me to watch it since I loved Drive so much and so finally after almost 2 years of persuasion , I sat down to see what it was all about .Here 's the thing with me and movies - I really like going to the movies , seeing good movies , quoting random dialogue from movies - but if you ask me if I want to sit down and watch one ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They are so LONG and they take so much investment !I 'd much rather just watch something quick like a tv show ( no commercials , GAH ! ) or do something entirely different .But there are a few exceptions .I got a chuckle reading this post over on Cupcakes and Cashmere the other day about movies you ca n't say no to .It made me think of my own list of movies that no matter how busy I was , I would make time for .So I thought I 'd share it .In no particular order : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Sound of Music 3 .Singles 4 .Sleeping with the Enemy 5 .Top Gun 6 .The NeverEnding Story 7 .Reality Bites 8 .Basically ALL of Tori Spelling + Valerie Bertinelli 's Lifetime Movies ( what ? )Sixteen Candles 10 .Teen Witch .( Listen , I never said I was a movie critic .I asked Garrett to make the same list and he rattled off these : .Citizen Kane 2 .A Christmas Story 3 .Lawrence of Arabia 4 .The Bridge on the River Kwai 5 .Die Hard / Die Hard 2 6 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Caddyshack 8 .Predator 9 .The Great Escape 10 .Commando .So ...Is it any wonder we hardly ever sit down to watch movies together ?Are you judging us ?We 've watched some suuuuuper random movies lately .My netflix queue has clearly broken the recommendation algorithm because the stuff they have been suggesting lately is bananas .No thank you , Jean Claude Van Damme movies .But I thought I 'd share some snippets from the last few cinematic weeks : . Crazy Stupid Love : I wanted this to be GREAT and while I enjoyed it , I thought it was only okay .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even the gratuitous ab shots could n't compete with Drive .Entertaining - ish though .And Emma Stone is cuteness squared .Phil Ochs : There But For Fortune : Hey - O , not a feel good movie !But an interesting look at a time in history interspersed with an influential artist .Garrett has an incredibly large soft spot for Folk Music ( He 'd light his lighter up at a Peter , Paul and Mary show for sure ! )so this was his pick .But I love a good documentary .Elf : Dude I know .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I ca n't believe I had never seen it until recently either .But HOLY HELL it was so funny we 've watched it twice .It will definitely be added to the Holiday Rotation .Will Ferrell has this uncanny ability to make me do a full body belly laugh with just an expression .I do n't know what it is .I miss his Saturday Night Live years .Another Earth : I loved this movie .It was beautiful to watch and I 'm still thinking about it .When I read the plot synopsis I was n't sure it would be my kind of movie ( it sounded a little sci fi for my tastes ) but it was REALLY emotional and interesting in a way that I did n't anticipate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While we do n't watch movies nearly as often as I would like , my heart still goes pitter - pat over the potential of a good film .Every year around the time of the Oscars I get a little bit of entertainment industry nostalgia .Have I ever told you that I was once a very aspiring film student ?I think I have but I ca n't remember .It was during The LA Years ( obviously ) and the short story goes like this : when you flunk out of your previous college , film schools in LA laugh at your applications .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And so my life took a different path .But I still have fond memories of living down there and every year I try my best to watch all of the Oscar contenders to recapture a little bit of that buzz that I used to feel while living in LA .We are woefully behind this year , but I 'm going to do my best to make a valiant effort !I love this free trial thingy , cuz I 'm watching movies like a mad woman and when they are crappy I do n't even feel bad because I 'm not paying for them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Speaking of terrible movies ( and by terrible I mean TOTALLY AWESOME) ...I watched Miami Vice last night .Well , most of it .Have you seen it ?The dialog is PHENOMENAL .I think it really sums up how intelligent this movie is .Det .Ricardo Tubbs : [ Crockett is holding a live hand grenade ] I 'm gon na tell you what 's gon na happen .People are gon na come in here , and you know what they gon na say ?They gon na look around and go ' Oh ah , hell .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jackson Pollock ? 'Det .James ' Sonny ' Crockett : No , viero .That was Jos\u00e9 Yero .Got splattered all over his own wall .Nice use of popular culture art references to put the fear of god into a druglord ( Jose Yero ) , dontcha think ?( yes , please note that does say Crockett is holding a live hand grednade ) , but it sure does also show their softer more intelligent side for all the ladies watching .To say \" look at me ladies , I know art \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm also now quite sure that I totally understand the mechanices of a Ferrari 's paddle shift since I saw close ups of it like 5 times with the Miami skyline behind it .I felt like I was in a Sisqo video a couple times , and really how often can you say that a movie transcends art forms like that ? ? ?Not too often , I bet .On top of all that , there were some interspersed soapy tits with really great synthesized music in the background .Now that 's quality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
