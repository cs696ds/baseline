{"text": "Search this blog and The Mike 's favorite blogs !While the first two parts of this series may have been familiar to most horror folks of my generation , the movies that sent me to where I am as a horror fan will be more familiar to the kind folks that read this here blog .Most of the movies I 'm about to talk about have been covered here numerous times , so coming up with something relevant and useful to say in what follows has been a strong challenge for me .But as I look at this list of horror movies that inspired me in my path toward horror , I am taken aback by how totally random these movies seem to be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'd be completely wrong to negate the impact films like The Shining , Fright Night , Happy Birthday to Me , and others had on me , but there 's something about each of the movies I 'm about to mention that just feels incredibly special to me .I know I 'm not the only person that likes them , but it 's kind of like these movies just happened to be in the right place at the right time for me .And that time and place was , for lack of a more intellectual word , awesome .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That same bio still sits in the right hand column of this site - and you can still see these three films listed there as the movies that awakened the monster that I now am .I ca n't remember all the details , but I 'm pretty sure Phantom of the Opera came to me first .Whenever people ask me about my first horror movie , I mention this one .Creature from the Black Lagoon came next , I think .I remember being in awe of the green dude on the cover when I first had the VHS tape brought to me , and I remember taking it to a friend 's house when I was in second grade to watch during a sleepover .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Was this the first time I tried to push someone I know to watch a horror movie against their will ?It may very well have been .Considering that it 's the one of these three that I mention the most , it 's slightly funny to me that I do n't have any vivid memories of my childhood encounter with The Blob outside of the question mark that pops on screen at the ending .( And sometimes when I did n't . )As I look at these three VHS tapes now - and that 's them , in their original glory , as they look tonight - I am completely in awe of how much what these three movies meant to me before I was even 10 years old .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Remember that time in part one of this series when I talked about \" those orange back monster books from the library ?( If not , you should go read it and stuff . )Well , The Monster Squad was the film adaptation of those books - and the library had it too .Again , this was one of those things that kind of got lost in my memory except for parts - \" Wolfman 's got gnards ! \" is part of my philosophy on life , obviously - but it was my gateway to the monsters that I had n't really seen outside of those books .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's a very simple and not very exciting reason that Pumpkinhead is on this list .When I was 8 or 9 , I was ready for all the \" scary \" movies I could get .I 'd seen the trinity , I 'd seen the Monster Squad , I 'd seen Dracula , and I wanted more .And I thought a monster with a pumpkin for a head sounded like a creepy idea , for reasons that I will elaborate on next week .Well ..... .It was NOT a good idea for little me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And I remember being instantly shocked and terrified and completely uninterested in seeing any more of that .Did I act cool ?Yeah , I was a cool little pimp .But I was terrified .I went away from the screen and I did not come back .I was n't completely ready to go where I wanted to go , but I learned from the experience .There it sits , alongside the plastic protector from Freedom Video Superstore in Marshalltown , Iowa that protected it ( poorly , as you can see ) for over 10 years in store and over 10 years in my hands .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've long ago written a detailed rant about how much Clownhouse meant to my sister and I as we became old enough to watch horror movies .But I could n't talk about movies that contributed to my horror love without Clownhouse .I must have watched it 50 times between the ages of 10 and 15 , and I always knew it was n't a good movie .But I loved it .And it led to every bad horror movie I 've loved , and every horror movie I 've watched and shouted at with friends , and every stupid grin I 've ever given during a stupid movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When that Freedom Video store went out of business , my mother rushed to town and ran through the store to grab it before anyone else even had a chance .You know how that watch was Bruce Willis ' birthright in Pulp Fiction ?Clownhouse is like that to my sister and I. .Speaking of stupid and bad , there 's Dr. Giggles .I have to list Dr. Giggles here , for similar reasons to Clownhouse .We did n't watch this movie religiously , nor did we necessarily like the movie , but Dr. Giggles became a cult figure in our house very quickly when we first encountered him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And it 's still funny .Heck , I 'm pretty sure he somehow mentioned Dr. Giggles while she was in the hospital after giving birth a couple of weeks ago .Dr. Giggles was our home 's Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees or Cropsey , and that still makes me smile .The VHS Tape shown above demands your attention .First of all , anyone who 's worth their weight in horror immediately realizes that the image that has been chosen - completely spoils the final moments of the movie .Then they might notice that they even spelled Duane Jones ' name wrong on the cover .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Oh , and the blurb on the back of the box reads EXACTLY as follows : . \" Possibly the greatest low - budget film of all time filled with non - stop action .I 'm sorry you guys , but I just got really distracted by that blurb .It's .... so bad .Does that make sense to anyone else ?OK , back on topic .This VHS tape .This VHS tape may have been in my parents ' VHS cabinet as long as the rest of the trinity .Yet I was strictly told that I COULD NOT watch it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I told you guys I was a good kid .Now do you believe me ?If they were that adamant that I could n't watch it - it must be the scariest thing ever , right ?I 'm pretty sure I saw the remake on Monstervision before I finally got the guts to put this VHS tape in the player .The spoiler on the video cover was n't a big deal , because my dad had already explained the differences in the endings when we watched the remake with Joe Bob Briggs .Night of the Living Dead and I were just not meant to have a perfect meeting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of course I did !It 's bloody brilliant , and the hype and the distractions and the stupid VHS package only make me love it more .The anticipation was worth everything that followed , and watching Night of the Living Dead for the first time was a key moment in my life as a horror fan no matter how it happened .Did I got long winded there ?Man , I got long winded there .Apologies to those who do n't like rambling incoherence , but these are the memories of horror that give me goosebumps .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact , those last three experiences would almost push most people to avoid horror movies .But these movies got to me at the right moment and it all just came together perfectly for me .And now it 's your turn - what movies got you in to horror ?How did you learn to love cheesy goodness or overwhelming zombies or big green gill - men ?Hit up the comments below , and then comeback next week for a the How The Mike Met Horror finale , in which i will present a \" grab bag \" selection of the other stuff that helped me fall in love with horror films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'd have to say that the first couple of horror movies that had an impact on me were forbidden viewings of \" It \" and \" Pet Semetary \" both when I was about 6/7 .I watched them downstairs in the apartment of the family that lived below us with my friend who was a couple years older than me .I do n't think we actually finished either as her older sister shut the movies off when she saw what we were watching .I think they remain the only movies I 've have nightmares about- especially about the guy who gets hit by the truck in the beginning of Pet Semetary .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also from my early years I 'd say viewings of Waxwork and Prom Night stand out to me ....I know Prom Night is n't the greatest movie ever , but I maintain that the opening sequence is great and super creepy .Unfortunately we did n't have a VCR until I was in middle school so I did n't have the pleasure of viewing VHS tapes much in my youth .I love that you have a \" horror trinity \" .Which begs the question what my third would be .Obviously I 've got Jaws and Psycho ....", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
