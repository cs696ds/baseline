{"text": "I watched this as a kid and I can honestly say this frightened all the fright out of me .No movie has scared me ever since , none !Not a single other one on this list .Honest truth , really some might be gross , some make you jump but A Nightmare on Elm Street is the be - all and end - all .The birth of being afraid to fall asleep .A Nightmare on Elm Street attacks you from all directions .What ever you do ...Do n't fall asleep .Great movie , has really stood the test of time and is as good now as it ever was .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "- iTragik .When I watched this movie I thought it was not to scary .Then when I went to sleep I had a dream of it and stood awake for the whole night .I have a reoccurring dream that I 'm being chased and ca n't get away .The scenery changes .Sometimes I 'm in a big mansion , sometimes the woods .But it 's always Michael myers who is chasing me .That 's saying something .I watch scary movies because they are fun ; they just do n't scare me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After the movie ended , I went to the bathroom and checked my shower ...Four times !Awesome !That was a very scary movie I first scary movie I ever saw !I saw it at my friend 's house when I was only 6 years old .And trust me it 's not my last !Scary is n't the word I would use .It was eerie and demon possessed When it was over , I felt the evil in my house !Turned gospel music on , LOUD and read my Bible to get rid of the demon spirits !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Scary ...Is that the word to describe this movie .I was all over laughing during watching this movie . - appindia .I really LOVE this movie .Samara is a little cute bastard and Rachel is a wonderful character .I sing all the day the Samara 's Song : Round we go , The world is spinning , When it stops , It just beginning .Sun comes up , We live and we cry , Sun comes down And then we all die .Very atmospheric from start to finish which puts the viewer in a jumpy frame of mind for the finale .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Only movie I 've ever watched and felt fear when the credits rolled in the dark , dark theater .Definitely a movie to see if you like scary movies !A lot of scary movies do n't make me jump ...But this one made me jump several times .Just with loud noises and pop - ups .If you like scary movies .SEE INSIDIOUS .I do n't know why this movie is n't even in the top 3 at least .This movie seriously freaked me out .I actually have a scar on my arm from hurting myself in an attempt to run from the T.V .. -", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Newcomers .It Follows .Masterpiece of subtle terror that has the hair standing up on the back of your neck , yet you really do n't know why ... and even after the shattering conclusion , your mind is still filled with many questions and doubts ... highly recommended .The Contenders .11 Saw .Personal all time favorite of mine , well not just the first movie , but the entire series all together .I make it a habit to marathon the entire series at least twice a year with a few of my girlfriends .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As I write my opinion on this movie I get the chills .I see flashbacks of the first time watching it in the dark in 4th grade .I remember the sleepless nights and the tears .I dreaded the night time .I watched the movie again when I got older thinking I 'd get over it but I did n't .Just looking at the cover if the disc scares me .Every time I look at the T.V. in my living room I imagine jigsaws face popping up .This movie really makes me want to be a better person just so I do n't ever have to be in that predicament .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thank you .Great Movie .The way the story is set up especially in the first 3 films .My favorite was SAW II because the ending surprised me that I said what just happened .Overall AWESOME Movie .Gory and I like how he did n't want them to cut their chains but their legs ... .Any movie that still unsettles me every time I hear a noise when taking a shower has to be the scariest movie ever .What an impact , even more than 40 years later .Very scary indeed .This movie 's shower scene is so famous all the way up until now , and will most likely continue to be !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But NOES is a little scarier .Maybe about 10 times .Because what 's worse than the fear of sleep ?YOU CAN'T AVOID IT .I loved the low - budget realism .All the special effects and cgi in today 's horror flicks detract from the horror in my opinion .I actually felt the terror of the main characters and wanted to escape when I watched this because the realism felt like a glimpse into real life insanity that exists in the world .Also , I heard it was based on real events , but now know it was all just a made up story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Very gripping and scared my grandma to bits !Based on a true story too guys , so watch at your own risk and NEVER GOING TO Texas OR AMERICA AT ALL !This movie is terrifying but the only thing I never really got was the Guy running with a big heavy chainsaw and the victim never being able to escape .Come on you ca n't run THAT fast with A big heavy duty chainsaw weighing you down .Other than that A Brilliant Creepy Horror film .Man do n't worry I 've watched many movies with chainsaws but when I saw this all I dreamed of was leather face breaking my door and cutting me up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I like watching horror movies so that I can sit and laugh at the children .But this time it was reversed .I slept with my bed light on for more than two weeks .Letting my obese dog sleep between my feet that if something grabbed me his going to struggle .This was the first horror movie that actually scared me .I do n't find little girls , clowns , or maniacal killers that scary they 're a bit cliche now .But this movie struck a chord of the fear of the unseen , what demons come out at night .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I remember I was a freshman in college when I watched the first one .I did not get any sleep that night and I had nightmares when I did .Even the first case of sleep paralysis was after that movie .The second time I had sleep paralysis I felt a presence and saw a shadowy figure looming over my bed .I heard someone ask me my name , I refused and told it to leave .I broke free finally and I prayed on it .I have n't experienced the nightmares ever since .I know that it 's normal symptoms but I believe in God and I 'm terrified of demons .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But I do thank God he answered my prayers , no demon related ... more .I do n't scare easily , but this did it for me .The Exorcist has nothing on this film !This movie was perfect , honestly .It was n't scary , but it had its moments that were ...Odd .I 'm a huge Hannibal The Cannibal fan , and loved all three movies .It 's quite realistic as well and Jodie Foster was an amazing Clarice .Most scary movie I have ever seen .The dialogue and images go deep into your psyche .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My best friend and I went together .We came home from it and to go to her house we had to go through a dark alley and through her mom 's closed store .We were terrified to be out in the dark after that film ! this movie was so dmented how could it not be in the top 10 - Okami .What did he say again ?I think it was I ate his livers with some beans or something like that but I must say good movie .A monster , that turns dogs inside out and you do n't even know it 's their till its about to kill you , is really creepy(and awesome at the same time - Razor79 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "How it is not in the top 5 astounds me !The exorcist just made me laugh , alien is pretty darn scary and so is paranormal activity .This film is just psychologically horrible .Watch in the dark alone \" i 'm outta here \" - LukeB .This movie has no boundaries on how scary it is .It 's like the director said:\"Well lets push people 's mind tolerance to fear beyond its limit and if they go crazy I guess it would be a great film and a success laugh out loud \" Its scary .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I first watched this movie when I was about 12 .and I 'm now 25 and iam still scared to anything bigger than a swimming pool .those DAMN sharks ... .How is Jaws not in the top ten ?In 1977 ?This movie FREAKED PEOPLE OUT , single - handedly made shark hunting PC , and also kept a nation of people out of the ocean AND LAKES for three years ... -corebare32 .Come on people .Of course , some movies right now are pretty thrilling , but Jaws was the movie that got millions of people out of the water .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Alongside of Halloween , this is my other all - time favorite horror series .Much like Halloween did in its time , Scream completely re - energized the horror genre which had grown stagnant and paved the way for a whole new generation of scary movies .So well - written , and with characters that are actually well - developed .When you actually feel emotion when the characters are in danger , you know you 've got a good one .This should at least be in the top 10 !This movie changed the status of horror movies in the 90 's , when the genre was going downhill .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "- MarilynMansonFan .I like scream , it has great actors in it and it is scary , you will think twice about picking up the phone at night , in my opinion definitely number 1 .i was choosing between this and Amitvyle , well this movie scared me more . phew ! -mesh13 .True it is disturbing and quite violent .Wanna know something else scary about this movie ?It spawned one of the worst songs of all time ( The Weeknd can go bankrupt ) . -WonkeyDude98 .This is easily one of the most scariest horror films made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would recommend it to any horror fan out there or anyone who wants the living hell scared out of them laugh out loud .I 've got all 3 films of the series and would definitely suggest watching the 2nd ( REC ) as well as I believe it 's even better , the 3rd one is not quite as good but still very entertaining !I think the only reason it 's not higher is because of subtitles .So ...Paranormal Activity , Human Centipede and Predator made the list , but ( REC ) , the scariest , most chilling movie ever made didn;t pass the cut ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
