{"text": "Expand .This show could have been so good if it would have taken the XMen or Alphas approach and made the super powers a metaphor for something greater .And they could have explored the story of a teenager grappling with mental illness in a world he is not sure is real , but they glossed over all that to get to the secret lairs and secret government labs .Swing and a miss .The show has gone downhill since its premiere which was n't that great to be honest .The show lacks a great storyline i think Julie is focusing more about The originals and the vampire diaries than this show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Boring .Just , boring .You can tell this show has all the pieces that the CW says their shows should have , but you do n't really care about any of it .THematically it has nothing to say , tonally it is everything we 've already seen , and the big bag government agency is so outdated and cliche .The one bright spot in the show is Peyton List , who I 'm glad is finally getting the recognition Boring .Just , boring .You can tell this show has all the pieces that the CW says their shows should have , but you do n't really care about any of it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The cast is not surprisingly attractive , with perfect white skin and teeth .The plot is extremely cliched .You can call it an X - men rip - off , Heroes - rip off , Alphas - rip off , or whatever .The whole idea of having a young teen discovering I think this is a terrible show .I was disgusted by even spending time watching it .It 's predictable , boring , stupid , cliched , and so commercialized .The cast is not surprisingly attractive , with perfect white skin and teeth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You can call it an X - men rip - off , Heroes - rip off , Alphas - rip off , or whatever .The whole idea of having a young teen discovering about his hidden powers has became the ultimate YA cliche .I do n't know how can any sane person consider this show good ?I am also baffled by Dan Steven 's involvement .A rising star , from Downton Abbey fame .He left that show ( which has turned into a boring soap opera , but it 's still superior to this one ) so he can pursue a career in Hollywood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A freaking computer voice .And Dan Stevens has more talent than the \" perfect looking \" lead .The sole thought that there are people watching this , and considering it good , makes me wanna vomit .I ca n't believe that after shows like Game of Thrones and Mad Men , The CW still exists .The only positive trait this show bears are the effects .I was very surprised by the visual direction The CW had taken .Other fantasy / sci - fi shows like Arrow and Smallville had terrible effects .These effects can rival many modern television shows .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Expand .Watched the first 2 episodes ... bad show . bad production .bad stories . just not interesting .This is not a reboot it 's a retread with a hole in it .It 's off my viewing schedule .Heard The Hundred is much better .This review contains spoilers , click expand to view .This show is what happens when you take a good premise and write / play it out extremely poorly .The idea that superhumans are evolving from the general populace is intriguing , following the same line as the X - men series , but making it more plausible with the fact that the new generation all has the same powers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The part that makes this series unbearable ( aside from the fact that the main character always has an annoyingly open - mouthed confused look on his face ) is that there is no depth or thought put into anything storyline- or mechanics - related .The love interest part of the story is ambiguous at best with two possible girls for Stephen to fall in love with and the writers just coming up with a random third girl , an Ultra agent , out of nowhere to shove them aside .The aforementioned Promised Land is really just the Tomorrow People tucking themselves into a paused interval of time that is somehow supposed to be better for their existence ( you ca n't drink water that is frozen in time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Those are just a few of the reasons why this series is meant for people who do n't like to think as they watch a show , just want something with superpowers ( me ) , or just need something as background noise .Really not worth watching if you actually care about what you are viewing .If you fit one of those three categories , this is a great show for you , but otherwise , do n't waste your time . ...Expand .The CW has established a reliable [ network formula ] : beautiful young things plus alienation plus supernatural powers plus slim - fit leather jackets .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
