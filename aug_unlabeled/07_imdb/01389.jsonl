{"text": "He is a nymphomaniac , and he does n't associate sexual desire with the natural , healthy feelings of attraction he has for the secretary .Because he 's increasingly at odds with his sex addiction , he begins to associate with things he dislikes .That 's why he ultimately ends up getting blown in that gay sex club , and is able to do it .The way the character treats and experiences sex is n't normal .It 's obsessive , chronic , and destructive .He could n't get an erection because this was the first sexual encounter he had where he was emotionally vulnerable and actually felt connected to the person .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is exemplified by the strong attraction shown between him and the woman on the subway -- it does n't get much more random than that in NYC .You should also make a note of the fact that he also does cocaine before he attempts to have sex with her .It makes it seem as though this phenomenon is familiar to him and he 's preparing himself for it .In fact , a lot of the plot points seem very familiar to the characters which is intriguing in its own right .But that gets into assumptions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I also think the fact that they are so comfortable when they 're naked in front of each other , and just how physically close they get with each other , hints at some sort of sexual abuse , incest , or something of that nature .The secretary represented a \" normal \" relationship .It 's something he desperately wanted but after a pervasive lifetime of sex addiction could n't fall into .He knew that his sex addiction was ruining his life , it affected his job , his relationship with his sister .He was deeply ashamed of the life he had and could n't change .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Watching this film was the first time I could concede that sex addiction is a real and terrible thing .Overall , it 's an amazing film and furthers my love for Fassbender as an actor and will seek out more movies from the director Steve McQueen .I always wondered what other people thought about the relationship between the brother and the sister .I felt there were some strong implications of childhood trauma between the two of them , but the people I saw it with did n't think so .I think you could make a fair argument that in the confines of the world the movie shows us , the brother and sister were likely abused or at least suffered some kind of childhood trauma that could be a root cause for his sex addiction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The cause is n't what the movie is about , so why bother ?It 's never elaborated when it 's mentioned , which makes the film feel more real .There was no exact reason given for his and his sister 's problems .She is a drifter type who moves in and out of his life it seems .There is a lot of open subtext in this movie which can be frustrating for answering specific questions .Her suicide or attempted suicide ( never really reveals if she dies ) seemed rather rash and all of a sudden to me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Never did he seem comfortable or cordial to her and for all we know that is how they have been always .Seems rather rash that she would commit suicide for his verbal lashing he gave her about his boss and fucking with his life .Her suicide or attempted suicide ( never really reveals if she dies ) seemed rather rash and all of a sudden to me .When her character is first introduced and they go to Subway , she 's seen inching closer to the edge of the platform .He grabs her and tells her to \" stop fucking around \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Additionally , at the dinner scene after she sings , the boss looks at her wrist and asks her what had happened .She pulls her hand back and says something about being bored .He saw her scars from either a prior suicide attempt , or self mutilation .So overall I think given the hints into their childhood , and these key moments , it 's pretty well established that she is mentally unstable .Seems rather rash that she would commit suicide for his verbal lashing he gave her about his boss and fucking with his life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's what makes this film so appealing to me , because it paints a picture of real people with real complexities that we may or may not understand , but certainly recognized .But how does it depend on your taste ?It 's only vague if you managed to miss all the signs given to us throughout the film .Simply wanting more information to go on does n't make the actions in the film \" rash \" .The suicide at the end came to no surprise to me because I felt it was pretty well established that she has had problems with suicide in the past .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It depends on taste because either the little hints are enough for you or they are not .Signs and hints are not answers .There is a lot of open / vague subtext to real problems .We are seeing the symptoms but not given the causes .I do n't think every single film needs to adhere to the same narrative , and because of that I think some films can take a more mature and honest approach .It 's honest because it 's not catering or pandering to the audience , instead it 's simply showing us a story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maybe that style is n't for everybody so maybe it does boil down to tastes , but I think it 's obvious when a movie adopts this approach to a story rather than suffer from weak story telling .Because of that , I have a hard time noting it 's approach as a negative .It did what it wanted to do and it did it well .And as I 've already said , the story is n't about his sister or her mental problems , and I do n't think it could have been expanded organically without taking away from the film 's intended narrative .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Her suicide is more important than his sex addiction at that point .We do n't get answers or a resolution because it is not her story .I did n't like that .Why include it and go that far ?I do n't tie the events together either .It minimizes the importance of his addiction to me .Some nice shots and good performances but the narrative and story did n't do it for me .Thanks for the discussion though .It actually helped define what I did n't like about the story .Yeah that would be a bit much , but that 's not what happens in the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is a significant different .Also , it is n't disregarded in terms of character development .I think his emotional breakdown and hesitance on the train indicates that he does n't want his old life .He even tossed his porno and computer in the garbage earlier in the movie .He makes some pretty clear efforts to not be the person he is at the start of the film by the end of the film .But he slowly discovers that it 's more than simply not having porno or fucking people , it 's about the emotional connections that he 's unable to make .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is n't though .The suicide is there to show us how distant they are .He has an inability to connect emotionally to people and the problem runs so deep he 's unable to properly communicate with his sister , a person that probably badly needs some kind of support .Her suicide attempt is n't the first and it 's just a way to show how adults can have broken lives if raised poorly .His life is ruined by sex addiction , her life is ruined by being dependent on people .Unfortunately for her , her dependance is on her brother who can not make the emotionally connection she needs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Why include it and go that far ?Because it 's the event that will likely change him and help him see that his sex addiction is more than an embarrassing pornography problem .It 's something that can hurt people that he does care about , and simply caring about a person is n't enough .He has to make a real emotional connection otherwise he will end up alone .I do n't tie the events together either .It minimizes the importance of his addiction to me ... but the narrative and story did n't do it for me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yeah , it 's interesting to see your point of view because I did n't think it could exist haha It 's weird how differently two people can view the same film .Good or bad , if you liked it or not , at least it has enough character to invoke a meaty discussion .A lot of films ca n't do that .It actually helped define what I did n't like about the story .No sarcasm here , I 'm actually glad to be able to do that .There 's nothing I hate more than not liking a film but not being able to pinpoint why .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also her character was annoying .A lot of us have these kind of broke , drifter family members who ca n't make their way themselves and leech off of different friends and family to make do in life .We let them in because they need help and they are family but they are annoying and they interfere and start fucking things up .So when he was annoyed by her at various times and told her off for fucking with his life and his boss , I was on his side .I thought yep , time to kick her ass out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
