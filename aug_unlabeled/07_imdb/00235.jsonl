{"text": "\" I believe what we 're looking for is a certain horse - like quality . \" -Linda Fiorentino , The Last Seduction .To put it broadly , film noir was more a cultural moment than a viable , long - lasting genre , arising naturally - and without such a label - from the darkness and cynicism that gripped the country after World War II .They ca n't simply execute the genre ; they have to comment on it , rework it , or pay homage to its past .That is n't entirely a knock on what we 've come to call \" neo - noir , \" but even the title of something like Brian De Palma 's Femme Fatale - previously covered in this column -makes it clear that neo - noirs come in quotation marks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And though his later Rounders , another NCC entry , was n't a neo - noir per se , Dahl treated the underground - poker scene with a seedy romanticism that helps explain why poker aficionados find that film so alluring .But Dahl 's best film , 1994 's The Last Seduction , is more than just an attempt to reheat old genre tropes or mine the past for moody atmospherics , though those elements are certainly at play .The question that drives Dahl 's alluring , darkly hilarious film is this : What does the modern femme fatale look like ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fiorentino is dark and sexy , similar to Lara Flynn Boyle in Dahl 's Red Rock West ( though more adult ) , and her distinctive voice is the kicker - spectacularly deep , flinty , and suggestive of mortal sin .Yet the context explains half of her appeal : Fiorentino does n't look or act like anyone else in the world of The Last Seduction , and the film often seems as much a fish - out - of - water comedy as it does a noir .Embodying New Yorkers at their most unapologetically brusque , Fiorentino 's Bridget Gregory is first seen pacing through rows of telemarketers with a stopwatch , driving them through sales calls like a jockey with a whip .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Meanwhile , she 's already mid - scheme .Her doctor husband Clay ( Bill Pullman ) is out rendezvousing with drug dealers under the Brooklyn Bridge , exchanging pharmaceutical cocaine for a briefcase filled with $ 700,000 in cash .It 's a shrewd risk / reward calculation : His risk , her reward .As soon as he hits the showers , she takes off with the money , and the beauty part is that he ca n't claim half the ill - gotten cash in the divorce .She just needs to hide out from Clay and his hired help ( Sam Nunn ) in the meantime .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Though she 'd be smart to blend in with the locals , Bridget is n't one to compromise her monstrous big - city arrogance and callousness so readily .Trying not to seem intimated , Mike Swale ( Peter Berg ) , a Bestonite with big - city aspirations , swoops in to buy her drink and work his hayseed charms on her .He 's a bit out of his league : .Bridget gets what she wants out of Mike-\"a certain horse - like quality\"-but her lawyer ( J.T. Walsh ) advises her to lay low in Beston for a while , which makes her shudder with revulsion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Really , greater explicitness is a common denominator among all modern femme fatales .What really sets Fiorentino apart is how far Dahl and his screenwriter , Steve Barancik , go in pushing her voracious appetites to the surface .If the suggestion of classic noir does n't play anymore , why not make her sexual aggression and avarice completely transparent ?There 's really no fundamental difference between Stanwyck and Fiorentino : They want the same things , and go about getting them in the same way .Fiorentino 's character just does n't hide her monstrousness .The Last Seduction is fascinating , too , for how it fiddles with gender politics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is behavior that 's accepted from a man , and a drunken man might have no compunction about asking a woman to show him the goods , just as Bridget does with Mike 's supposedly equine appendage .Mike keeps trying to get the upper hand in their relationship , and he struggles to locate some hidden reserves of feminine vulnerability within Bridget that will make her need him for more than just a roll in the hay .But he 's the emotionally needy one , and Bridget never fails to put him in his place .Beyond its noir trappings , The Last Seduction has great fun exploiting the city - girl - in - the - sticks premise , starting with poor Mike , whose relationship with Bridget is aspirational : He believes he 's bigger than Beston , and therefore she 's his ticket to the big city .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( \" Maybe it 's my quaint small - town values , \" he says , \" but I do n't murder . \"He later tries to murder someone . )One of the best of the neo - noirs , The Last Seduction revitalizes the genre without losing the core appeal of illicit passions , labyrinthine plots , and deliciously ornate dialogue .Barancik 's script has a snappy , Mamet - like efficiency and teems with memorably salty one - liners , but Fiorentino sells the movie with her voice , her body language , and an array of sighs , eye - rolls , and sinister smiles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
