{"text": "Lost ' Dueling Analyses : The Other Woman .By Liz Kelly .In which Jen and Liz dissect last night 's episode , introduce today 's new 2 p.m. ET \" Lost \" chat and unveil a new \" Lost \" feature .Liz : Last night 's episode title was clearly meant to throw the spotlight on to Juliet , the hour 's prime mover and first flashback of season four .But I 'm thinking this was really all about Ben , who deftly shifted between his portrayals of the puppet master and the man - child who smashes his toys when they do n't bow to his desires .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But I have to ask : .Ben ( Michael Emerson ) spins a tale for John ( Terry O'Quinn ) .( ABC ) .How 's that theory about Ben actually being one of the good guys faring ?Jen : I , too , worship at the altar of Michael Emerson .Would someone please give him an Emmy for this performance , like , yesterday ?His line deliveries are borderline poetry .Just listen to the way he told Locke : \" Your people are going to be so angry when they realize you still do n't have a plan . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Clearly Ben has some serious problems , not the least of which is his mommy fixation .As Harper suggested , Juliet looks an awful lot like Ben 's mother ( who , to make things more freaky , is played by Emerson 's real - life wife ) .It 's hard to see how his means can possibly justify his ends .But I still contend that he believes he is working for a higher purpose that , if evaluated on its own merits without the messy knowledge that Ben has killed people because of it , may be a noble one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Liz :Right .Glad you pointed out the resemblance to Ben 's mom , because many are buzzing that the resemblance to which Harper referred was Ben 's childhood friend Annie .Jen : Speaking of Ben 's purpose , we should probably analyze the story he told Locke about Charles Widmore .Liz : Sure , let 's start there -- there 's probably a little bit of truth to it -- the bit about Widmore funding the freighter .But I doubt his purpose is to exploit the island as if it were some kind of midway freak show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jen : I completely agree .Ben told Locke that Widmore sent the freighter people to the island .I believe that part is true , and I believe Abaddon also probably works for him ( and that Sayid 's Elsa may have been working for Widmore , too ) .However , I do n't think Widmore wants to come to the island so he can turn it into some sort of tropical Graceland .I believe he is hunting for Ben , but that his overarching purpose has to do with assuming control over the island .I wonder if he understands the unique properties that impact the island and might want to exploit them in some way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But only every once in a while . \"Liz : Or , \" where I can control the fabric of time . \" Here are some screengrabs of the Widmore video sequence .Jen : I also think Ben knows that only half of what he told Locke is true .When he told John it was his \" last bargaining chip , \" I thought , no way .That dude never runs out of chips .He 's too smart for that .Liz :Right .Ben is always in control and , as Harper told Juliet , right where he wants to be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Last night we were treated for the third or fourth time to the flashback scene of Oceanic 815 splitting in two and crashing to the ground and Ben 's subsequent plan to send Ethan and Goodwin off to the two main crash sites .His instructions included the direction that he wanted \" lists \" in three days .We 've seen all this before .My new question , though , is why would Ben assume there would be survivors ?Not to be morbid or pessimistic , but survivors of a jetliner crash are about as rare as Martians .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jen : Do n't tell me that !I 'm not terribly fond of flying , so I sometimes comfort myself by thinking , \" Well , at least if this plane crashes , maybe I 'll get to hang out with Sawyer .\" I thought Lindelof and Cuse had said pretty definitively that Desmond made the plane crash because of the system failure he caused in the Hatch ( see end of season two ) .As for why Ben would assume survivors , I think he understands the unique electromagnetic properties of the island and maybe he guessed that at least some of the crash victims would be affected by them and prevented from dying ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Liz : I think he knew which way the wind was blowing with Goodwin 's relationship with the Tailies and let it play out .Jen : I have always believed the people on the plane were \" called \" to the island , though , so in that sense , there is orchestration at work , though possibly not by Ben .Liz :Right .That 's supported by the intermingling storylines and coincidences .Another old island trick resurfaced last night , too -- the whispery voices .This time , Juliet was the target -- right before Harper emerged from the jungle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jen : I did n't hear much in that whisper audio either .But the presence of the whispers , especially noticeable when Harper suddenly showed up then disappeared , suggests that she was not really there .Juliet told Jack at the end of the episode that Ben had tried to get to her , which suggests he sent Harper or a manifestation of her to speak with Juliet .As far as the whispers themselves , we typically hear them before the smoke monster shows up or when people get near Jacob 's place , right ?Liz :", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Though we know that Jack saw Harper , too , so it was n't a phenomenon limited to Juliet 's perception .Jen : Agreed .But multiple people have seen Jacob and Smokey , so is it possible there is a connection ?I want to touch on the phrase you mentioned a little bit ago : \" He 's exactly where he wants to be .\" We heard that very same wording from Miles a few episodes back , just before he tried to extort a mega - wad of cash from Ben .The obvious read on those lines is that they are where they want to be metaphorically .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Are n't the barracks inside the sonar fence ?Liz : That 's an interesting point .The barracks are indeed inside the sonar fence and in one of Ben 's flashbacks last season the ghost of his mother warned him off leaving their protective confines .And Ben certainly does seem content there .My favorite line of the night was his \" See you guys at dinner \" to Hurley and Sawyer .So good .So \" dissociative psychopath . \"Jen :Right .And if you remember back to our beloved McPatchy , when Locke pushed him through the fence , he had what appeared to be a cerebral hemorrhage , not unlike Minkowski .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Right .But -- correct me if I 'm wrong -- we assumed at the time that McPatchy 's hemorrhage was a result of coming into contact with the fence itself .We also know he recovered from it long enough to turn up at The Looking Glass station .Jen : We did assume that 's why McPatchy bled at the time .But if he were having the same issues as George and Desmond , that could explain why he managed to survive .He had n't completely died and he was able to stabilize and show up again elsewhere on the island and underwater .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But my favorite line was Juliet 's : \" It 's very stressful being an Other .\" I so want that saying on a nice ringed T. It 's the perfect look for spring .Liz : Let 's touch on Harper , the hostile therapist with really frightening eyebrows and an uncanny resemblance to Priscilla Presley .Her full name -- \" Harper Stanhope \" -- is such a mouthful it just has to signify something .The closest I ( and several other bloggers ) can find is a reference to Charles Stanhope , who \" disagreed with Edmond Burke 's take on the French Revolution . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It could be an anagram of some sort , too , but I do n't have the energy this a.m. to rearrange all those letters .I wonder if Harper had experienced some weird issues with Ben , too .I am basing this on nothing concrete , but I wonder if she had tried to conceive , unsuccessfully , on the island , which made Ben angry with her and also caused a rift in her marriage .Which would make her even more likely to resent Little Miss Fertility Doctor ?Again , total speculation .Liz :", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Remember , she may also have been held on the island against her will .That 's enough to make anyone mad .Jen : True .Oh , I also thought it was funny that in the beginning , the writers set you up to think Juliet was one of the Oceanic Six because she talking about feeling like a celebrity .Clever .Love , or the suggestion of it , was a major theme .What did you make of Jack kissing Juliet ?Liz : I 'm glad you asked .I 'm not sure Jack knew until that moment that he was choosing Juliet over Kate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It may be more about his dislike of Ben than his feelings for Juliet .Jen : Was he choosing Juliet over Kate ?I 'm not sure that he was .Liz :Well , at least for now .I kept waiting for the shot of Kate seeing them kiss , but it never happened .Jen : I see Jack and Kate as having the same conflict .Kate is drawn to Sawyer , the bad guy , as well as Jack , the good guy who could make her become a better person .Similarly , Jack is drawn to Kate , a fugitive , and Juliet , a woman with seemingly pure intentions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Speaking of Kate , I so thought of you when Charlotte hit her over the head , then said \" What ?\" I thought , \" Man , Liz has been wanting to do that for years ! \"Liz : Yes , Charlotte definitely scored some points with me last night .So , want to talk about a totally unfounded rumor making the rounds ?Jen : Sure .Liz : When Ben told Locke he 'd better sit down to find out the identity of his man on the freighter we assumed Michael , right ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They are speculating that Locke himself is Ben 's man on the boat .Is that even possible ?Jen : Anything is possible .Especially if time goes all screwy when you leave the island .I actually would be psyched if the man on the boat were not Michael , only because it would be more shocking .We 've all been saying Michael for weeks .Liz :Right .The Michael assumption may be a total set up on the part of LindeCuse .I definitely would n't put it past them .They 're almost as diabolical as Ben .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Okay , so the whole diffusing gas thing at the Tempest ( last night 's Shakespeare reference ) ... what was up with that ?When did Faraday and Charlotte suddenly realize they needed to go there , and how ?Liz : I have to ask , re : the Tempest -- did you also flash to the ' 80s version starring the John Cassavetes and Molly Ringwald ?Jen : Duh .Of course .I sometimes flash to Molly Ringwald without even being provoked .It is worth noting that the original \" Tempest \" is about people who wind up on an island after a shipwreck .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Carry on .Liz : Obviously Charlotte and Faraday had been tasked with disabling the gas from day 1 .They arrived on the island with gas masks and Dan had a handy map .Jen : True .But the situation suddenly got more dire and I wondered why .And who set up the system to unleash the gas .Charlotte said Ben , but did he really ?Liz : That use of Charlotte and Dan really reduces them to mere pawns in a Widmore vs. Ben war .Why would they agree to that ?There must be something in it for them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I thought about the timing , too .But this may have been their first opportunity to get to the Tempest .They 've been busy helping Desmond survive his coming unstuck in time and trekking to the beach and playing cards .Jen :Yeah , I feel like the freighter people do n't fully know what the stakes of the game are .They clearly did n't know Naomi thought they were a bunch of rubes .Jen :So next week 's show ... it 's Jin and Sun - centric .And we 'll find out who the last two Oceanic Six survivors are .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jin and Sun .Liz : Yes , it 's titled \" Ji Yeon \" ( presumably the name of Sun 's baby ) and Zoe Bell ( of \" Grindhouse \" fame ) will finally make her bow as -- well , we do n't know .I read one account of next week 's show that cryptically read : \" Ji Yeon also does something highly interesting with the flash device .Something you probably wo n't be able to figure out until the end .\" Tantalizing , no ?Jen : Indeed .This week 's episode , while entertaining , did n't drop any major bombshells or deliver a twist ending .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Liz : About this time , I would normally type \" next week , then ? \"Happily , though , today we 'll debut our new weekly \" Lost \" chat at 2 p.m. ET .And I believe there 's something else you 've been cooking up for us ... ?Jen : Thanks for that segue , Liz . \"Lost \" can be a heavy show .So I thought we should put the fun back in Good Ol' Fun Times Hurley .For starters , I came across this link to a band in Brooklyn who call themselves \" Previously on Lost .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So if you 're bored this afternoon , enjoy the sounds of \" Be My Constant , \" \" Ballad of Sayid \" or , my favorite title , \" Just Wink .\" I will warn you that much of the music sounds like it was composed in someone 's basement while using a 1986 Casio .But I give them points for creativity .And now , on to our more important announcement ...Presenting \" Lost \" Madness !What is \" Lost \" Madness ?It 's much like March Madness , except it involves your favorite \" Lost \" characters instead of the North Carolina Tar Heels .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On Tuesday , round two will begin , and you 'll all vote again for a series of winners to advance to the \" Lost \" Sweet 16 .The competition will continue until we declare a \" Lost \" Madness Champion , otherwise known as your favorite \" Lost \" character of all time .It 's full of bracket busters , baby !Liz : I 've already cast my votes and I 'm so happy to finally be able to bracketize something in my life .I 'm not much of a sports fan , alas , so this is a really welcome gizmo .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jen : Sorry , thought I was Dick Vitale for a second there .Anyway , for me it 's a fun way to bridge two of the great loves in my life : \" Lost \" and college basketball .So please vote , and pass it on to your friends and their friends , and so on , and so on . 1 ) Charlotte still annoys me . 2 ) Ben definitely is n't out of chips .He 's not the type of man to run out .3 )The wife & I were talking about Ben 's man on the boat last night and came up with a few thoughts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My latest theory is that Ben 's man on the boat is ... wait for it ...Charlie .We know that the island has healing properties of some sort .We know at least one person who died ( McPatchy ) did n't stay dead .We know from Hurley 's flash forward that Charlie shows up in the future .And finally , we can surmise that it is someone Locke knows .Ben would n't tell Locke to sit down in preparation for a shock just to say , \" It 's John Smith .You do n't know him , but that 's who it is . \" Not to throw water on the fire that 's been burning so bright this season , but can we all agree that last night 's episode kind of sucked ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Let it be said that I have absolutely no problem with that .Not every episode can be a gem , but as long as we regularly get episodes like \" The Constant \" , I 'm more than happy to pay for it with episodes like \" The Other Woman .\" i was thinking maybe ben 's man on the boat is ben himself .if it was michael , that revelation would n't require him to instruct locke to \" sit down \" . seemed like he was about to drop a very big , confusing bombshell .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The over - arching plot has just gotten to stupid for words , I only enjoy the characters now , and Ben is great .I hate , hate , hate all of the assinine theoretical physics on this show .whoops , also meant to say that i do n't think locke could be the man on the boat because once locke is off the island , he 's probably back to being in a wheelchair .that ship did n't look very wheelchair - accessible .Oh , also .4 ) Jack has now moved on to Juliet because she needs rescuing from Ben and the Others .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now , especially that Juliet has told Jack to stay away because Ben 's after her , he will be stuck to her like glue .Wait , how can there be two for the Oceanic 6 ?We already know five - Jack , Kate , Hurley , Sayid , & Aaron .Or does Aaron not count because he was n't born until after the flight crashed ( though , technically , he was still on the flight ) ?I think most people are not counting Aaron , especially since he is considered Kate 's son , and Kate was not pregnant on the flight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You fools !You want to make the matchups more compelling as they move forward .Why in the world is Hurly 's imaginary friend paired up with someone who we have n't even seen yet ?It 's just awful , you really should have done some seeding in there .It might be true that Widmore is planning to turn the island into some freak show / amusement park .Remember in season 2 when Sawyer and Michael were floating back to the island on the remnants of the raft and Sawyer comments on turning the island into a resort ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It would be pretty corny if that 's how it all ends , but we 've all seen the show stumble between greatness and Desperate Housewives before .The episode 2 weeks from now is the one to keep your eye on .During the writer 's strike there was much banter that if the season was reduced to 8 episodes that the final episode was ( unintentionally or not ? ) quite the mindblower / cliffhanger whatever you want to call it such that if the season ended w / that episode , fans would still be satisfied .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That implies that Losties have left the island as recently as after Ben showed the tape to Jack .Does anyone recall if Jack watched the tape before or after the submarine exploded .This scene was not very shocking since everyone has assumed that Widmore was looking for the island because he sent Desmond on the sailing race and he purchased the diary of the Black Rock sailor .I agree that last nights episode was weak .It was the worst episode since the first group of episodes last season .Just a thought about Ben 's ally on the boat -- what if it 's the real Sawyer , Locke 's father , who was n't really killed by James ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wish it would turn out to be Mr. Eko , but that 's just me missing the big lug .I think Ben 's tape proves nothing one way or the other about Widmore .Anyone can \" fake \" a video .Random thought here : Shakespeare 's \" The Tempest \" was supposedly written about the shipwreck of the ' Sea Venture ' on the island of Bermuda in the early 1600s .That 's right ...Bermuda ... of Bermuda Triangle fame .I forget , what 's the time frame for when the ' Black Rock ' ended up on the island in LOST ? harper and goodwin - I had the feeling that their 's was an arranged marriage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "the man on the boat - I think the favorites are Walt or Miles , with Walt in the clear lead .Walt would be a sit down moment for Locke , because Locke has been taking instruction from Walt .How mind blowing would it be for Locke to know that the person he was taking instruction from was taking instruction from Ben ?( Miles is in 2nd as Locke would then be preventing the person who is helping them do his job . )I have a wacky theory that the reason Daniel and Charlotte know what to do and when is that Daniel has been there before .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That explains why he said \" Juliet !You 're not supposed to be here ! \" with particular inflection - he had been there before , and it had played out differently .what would be the possibility that Ben learned about the boat while Walt was in captivity with the Others .That is , at the time of captivity then - future Walt was on the freigher and present - Walt , having the ability to shift consciousness through time , could tell him about the boat .Of course , this consciousness theory then would n't just apply to Walt .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also a sitdown moment .One other point - the teaser from abc about the episode 2 weeks from now informs us that Michael 's time after he left the island will be explored .While there are no mortal locks ( or Lockes ) in Lost world , I think Michael being the proverbial \" man on the boat \" is a sure thing .BigIsland , I agree that last nights epeisode was n't that great ; especially when compared to last week 's \" The Constant .\" But series ' do have ebbs and flows , so no biggie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was fun to see ben prancing around , both in flashbacks and after he had negotiated his freedom with locke .As for the spy on the freighter , it could be anybody , but my bet is on michael just because it makes the most sense ( and that s what we have been pushing since the start of the season ) .Which brings me to my observation , it appears that alot more characters are doing the crazy time jump thing that they are letting on .Farraday seems to be living life backwards , having no idea what s going on one minute and then having a mastery of what s going on the next with knowledge he should n't have .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also , i assume everytime i hear those voices it is the work of jacob .but it was interesting to see both juliette and jack interacting with him ( as the therapist ) .Another comment on the overanalysis of why Ben new there would be survivors of the crash .Remember , he said that the tail looked like it was heading into the water , which it did , and it is much easier to survive a crash into the water than on land .Also , Ben told Ethan to go where the fusilage landed , because there \" might \" be survivors there , he did not know ahead of time that there would be survivors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Remember , her killed the original people in the complex when he was a boy or young man .How then did he take over and eventually get the resources he had to apparently be able to leave the island as he pleases .I think that he must have made some sort of deal with some other group ( Widmore ? ? ? ) or even Hanso to continue the work on the island and doublecrossed someone in the process .Otherwise , Ben and his crew would truly be a bunch of barefoot castaways with no resources .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Everyone seems to think that Aaron is Kate 's son .So my theory is that part of the big ruse was that she was 5 - 6 months pregnant on the plane and had him on the island .That leaves us two survivors left to be revealed .Or I am completely wrong and Aaron is one of the six . \" ... it is much easier to survive a crash into the water than on land .\" True story : water is harder than the ground at falling from thousands of feet speeds .If your parachute does n't open , the worst thing you could do is aim for a body of water .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The two \" evil \" groups getting ready for a big show down , the girls fighting each other , the strange plot twists .I turned to my wife and said when did they bring Alias back without Jennifer Garner ?Although I agree there could be some time - jumping going on all over the place , would n't that mean we 'd see Ben 's limp body every now and then , when he visits the ship / outside / etc .Same thing with Daniel and Charlotte .Your bracket is ridiculous .Did you even consider ranking the characaters and not just matching them up based on a category ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't think this will tell you who the true fan favorite is .Did n't Daniel Farraday ask if Desmond had recently been exposed to radiation or something electromagnetic when trying to figure out why he was \" confused \" on the ship ?Could n't this be related to the incident with the hatch explosion ?I think DudeAbides has it right .Dan and Ben ( and Charlotte ) are living the mind - travel reality that freaked Desmond out , but they have better control of it , heading back into the past with information on how not to let something happen or do it differently , as Des did .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She already had one success , wearing the bullet proof vest when Ben shot her , which scared the bejezzus out of Ben if you watch it again , since it seems Ben now has a real adversary .The mole on the ship - Miles , since Miles seemed to give Ben a message when he tried to extort him .If Miles really knew who Ben was and what he could do , the last thing he would do is try to extort him .Has anyone tried to determine the time lags when traveling to and from the island ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The chopper should have landed in 30 minutes but took over a day .So it seems things travel much slower going to and from the island .About 30 times slower .Now consider Michael and Walt .Their boat moves much slower than the helicopter .So it would take weeks to reach the distance of the freighter .I 'm expecting an episode where we see Michael / Walt making that journey and finding the freighter after having gone 40 miles in about a month or however long its been since they left in the boat , but only a few hours of their time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What a waste !Very disappointing .And who are they fooling with their teaser for next week - \" you 'll see a face you never thought you 'd see again \" ?Well , given that Harold Perrineau 's name has been in the credits since Jan. , do n't count on us being too surprised ... .A few thoughts : 1 ) stop whining about the LOST Madness game .We get it ... you do n't like that it 's not seeded .We do n't need 20 of the same comments .You know you could say , \" hey even though I do n't like the way the matchups are set , thank you so much to the Washington Post ( and . com ) staff for dedicating so much space to this great show and us the fans ! \" 2 ) I agree with some others that the \" man \" on the ship is n't Michael ... too obvious and the writers do n't tend to swing that way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
