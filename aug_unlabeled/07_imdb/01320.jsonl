{"text": "Indeed , even before that , the title \" The Communist Manifesto \" itself was an ironic attack on Europe 's fear of \" communism , \" at the time meaning a return to loosely - allied city - states .Given the fact that the Soviet leadership was often tremendously paranoid and ran large - scale systems of political repression and censorship , the Soviet government 's reputation in the west is bound to be very negative .This trope , however , is for when the previously mentioned evils of the Soviet Union are caricatured or used for comedic purposes ( as pictured ) , or when Communists are shown carrying out their policies ForTheEvulz rather than out of expediency or misguided idealism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
