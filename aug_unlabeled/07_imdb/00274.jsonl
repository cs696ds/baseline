{"text": "The Wizard of Oz ( 1939 ) , perhaps the most watched example of classical Hollywood cinema , is a fantasy film .Yet , the fact that the film is often considered against a specific set of aesthetic concerns relating to a fantasy style of filmmaking seems worth emphasising , given a consistent trend in its critical analysis to avoid describing it as such .The Wizard of Oz has been analysed as a meditation on Aristotelian virtues , as a celebration of Kantian humanism , as a lesbian fantasy and as a demonstration of Baudrillard 's symbolic exchange .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By ignoring this part of its identity , a key aspect of the film 's appeal has consistently been overlooked by the scholarship .In an attempt to address this oversight , this article will analyse The Wizard of Oz specifically as a fantasy film .It will interrogate the set of aesthetic specifications associated with this unique genre and scrutinise the communication of its pleasures through cinema 's audiovisual plane .By focusing so intently on Kansas as a place of return , yet investing so much in Oz 's transcendence , this dual spatial focus allows the film to present a reassuring encounter with its magical delight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In doing so , it will implicitly speculate upon the reasons as to why the film has so successfully ensured its place in cinema 's pantheon .Defining Fantasy .It is extremely difficult to pinpoint a precise definition of exactly what constitutes a fantasy film , a task not helped by the fact that so few academic studies currently exist on the subject .In an attempt to engage with this problem , David Butler 's Fantasy Cinema ( 2009 ) reviews the significant contributions towards the study of fantasy literature made by individuals such as J.R.R. Tolkien and Rosemary Jackson ( 1 - 42 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These arguments undoubtedly carry some weight ; a key aspect of fantasy seems indeed to be its ability to embrace a lack of certainty and fixity .Any attempt to define such pleasures too rigidly will invariably lead to an inorganically doctrinal approach to what is clearly a rather malleable and organic generic practice .One must allow fantasy to be what it is : a type of storytelling that displays a distinct lack of typical iconographies or narrative tropes .However , to abandon a generic understanding entirely is to abandon any attempt at a precise theoretical understanding of a specific type of filmmaking , which is recognised as such by producers , journalists and , perhaps most crucially , viewers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "According to Fowkes , the fantasy genre 's uniqueness lies in its ability to separate itself from a sense of mimesis by utilising narratives and iconographies that rupture a representational relationship with reality and establish something new .In The Wizard of Oz , the idea of an ontological rupture seems to be crystallised in one famous sequence : Dorothy , startled by the impact of the tornado , cautiously steps out of her house to find herself in a strange location where everything is suddenly different .It is a rupture that occurs largely through a break in space , moving almost instantaneously from a known , representational world of Kansas to a place where everything is different , a place over the rainbow .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , what is perhaps left unarticulated within her definition is the lack of trauma found within these mimetic breaks .As the ghosts , ghouls and monsters of the horror genre break through the windows of their victims ' houses , they not only smash the glass but smash reality too , rupturing it violently to travel to another , rather frightening alternate realm .Yet , Dorothy 's rupture as she enters Oz seems strangely pleasant .Perhaps one should or would be afraid of talking scarecrows , animated tin men and witches - even good witches in pink dresses ; these things represent something altogether alien , but in the fantasy film they are much less traumatic and altogether positive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Magic .This is a key word in the definition of fantasy ...Magic fuels fantasy , manifesting as miracles , mysterious forces or inexplicable events , none of which can be ascribed to the laws of rationality , nature or science .Magic in fantasy films is ultimately unexplainable ( 10) ... the fantasy film genre is a branch of fantastical cinema that never rationalizes the impossible and generally seeks to reconcile us with a more positive state of being ( 12 ) .Worley 's notion of magic seems to address a fundamental characteristic of the fantasy genre and , indeed , The Wizard of Oz itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , this land is not perceived as threatening to either Dorothy or the audience exposed to it , separating it also from the fear - ridden imagery of horror .There are things to be afraid of in Oz , the Wicked Witch being the supreme example , but the land itself is not fearful for its otherworldly nature alone .On the contrary , its otherness is joyful .It is perhaps this positive encounter with a sense of magic that seems to best represent the unique aesthetic response of the fantasy viewer .Fantasy as Fantastic Hesitancy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Instead of simply destroying reality , fantasy only ever really tweaks at its fixities as it attempts to delight rather than astonish , celebrate rather than shock .In fantasy films such as Mary Poppins ( 1964 ) , the rupturing elements take place within a largely mimetic reality and the source of Worley 's sense of magic can be assigned specifically to a central character .The magical possibilities of the film are limited , containing the specific implausible circumstances rather than totally abandoning the rules of the known world .The Wizard of Oz 's spatial rupture can be seen to be equally hesitant .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Most obviously , Kansas is shot in sepia , straddling various tones of grey , whilst Oz exists in vibrant Technicolor .In addition to this device , the general presentation of space in both realms contrasts significantly .Kansas is sparse and desolate : the introductory shot of the film displays a long road framed by empty fields and utilises a static camera to give a sense of loneliness to the frame .As the solitary figure of Dorothy travels further away , she seems to strip the frame of all movement and life , and this sense of moribund emptiness continues throughout .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When Dorothy runs away from home , a brief montage sequence fades between various shots of roads and scenery without a sense of temporality or distance .It seems precisely because Miss Gulch can move so efficiently through this world on her cumbersome bicycle that she possesses that strange , otherworldly presence that Dorothy later associates with witchcraft .In contrast , the realm of Oz is lively and cluttered .Upon Dorothy 's arrival , vast numbers of Munchkins emerge from their hiding places to fill the site with action on multiple levels of vision , filling the frame with activity for as far as one cares to gaze .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As its large green gates swing open , a briskly paced tracking shot glimpses briefly at a seemingly endless sea of activity .The camera travels further in , managing to merely hint at the vast array of magnificent and magical workings , displaying a vast assortment of horses of different colours , strange indoor woods , pools and alien businesses that populate this packed city .Its eclectic inhabitants are all shot with a tight , cluttered framing style to emphasise a lack of coherence and a sense of multiplicity .The Witch 's castle is packed to the brim with flying monkeys and singing soldiers , which is why it is so intimidating to the Cowardly Lion , and the woods surrounding it are seemingly full of \" spooks \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Oz is magical and otherworldly whilst Kansas is reality , the film 's visuals highlighting the difference .In setting up this visual dichotomy , The Wizard of Oz proceeds to use this contrasting relationship to further establish the identities of each world .Oz ultimately needs Kansas .The former 's magic is so firmly established because it is offset against the banality of the latter , the Technicolor dazzling precisely because it is preceded , and indeed followed , by black and white ( coloured in a sepia tone ) images .Kansas may be barely focused upon in terms of visuals but , despite its lack of depiction , it shapes and influences everything on screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although slightly aggravated , Dorothy seems instantly appeased when told that she has needed her journey through Oz to shape her into the person required to use the ruby slippers .The fantasy viewer , in turn , has needed the presence of Kansas to delight in all that it is not .The spatial focus of the film is therefore caught in an ethereal duality , unfixed and oscillating between the dullness of the worldly and the trauma of the otherworldly much like the strange conflict suggested at the heart of fantasy 's reassuring encounters .As both realms can equally consume our thoughts , it is unclear which to place the greater importance upon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thus , the film hesitates between the two realms within its spatial focus , a hesitation intrinsically tied to its function as a fantasy film .In his study of the Fantastic , Tzvetan Todorov articulates a theory that perhaps illuminates the function behind this hesitation , as he puts forth an understanding of a text 's ability to rupture a sense of reality that seems to speak of Oz 's spatial curiosities : .In a world which is indeed our world , the one we know , a world without devils , sylphides , or vampires , there occurs an event which can not be explained by the laws of this same familiar world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The fantastic is that hesitation experienced by a person who knows only the laws of nature , confronting an apparently supernatural event .( 25 emphasis added ) .The use of Todorov 's theory within film studies has also predominately favoured this generic approach .Butler 's Fantasy Cinema rejects Todorov 's uncertain notion of the fantastic as a type of storytelling \" at odds with dominant filmmaking traditions \" , finding it of limited use to an understanding of fantasy ( 26 ) .However , the highlighted passage in which Todorov sets out his definition of the fantastic does not actually perform this generic limitation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "[ 4 ] It is possible to utilise this notion of the fantastic to theorise a more precise understanding of the function of a hesitant reaction to the fantasy fan 's delight in rupturing magic present within a film text such as The Wizard of Oz .If Oz is real , it belongs to the realm of the marvellous , and one must therefore accept that such things as witches and wizards are also real .If Dorothy has instead fallen into delusion , the film is presenting an uncanny event .However , crucially , the fantastic hesitancy described by Todorov does not ask us to choose between these two conclusions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It encourages it , it prolongs it , it values the instability and the oscillation .In this receptive mode , the impossible events can be witnessed as both existing and not existing , floating between reality and beyond reality , between savage truth and a fearful lack of truth .This understanding of the fantastic as an aesthetic relationship between receptive viewer and text solves the crisis of ontology that the supernatural occurrence presents in the most joyous way possible .Rather than fearing its vagueness and its lack of fixity , it becomes the very quality which gives fantasy access to its celebratory mode of being .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Wizard of Oz can be seen to replicate this joyous hesitation through its space , which also wavers precariously between its all too real reality , Kansas , and its lack thereof in Oz .As Glinda states to Dorothy , we are able to return to Kansas at any point if we so wish but it is perhaps slightly more fun to follow the path of the yellow brick road to see what further delights it contains .Oz 's otherworldliness becomes gentle , becomes positive , creating a reassuring sense of the magical intrinsically tied to the duality of the film 's spatial realms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By utilising various visual tropes that avoid the traumatic conclusions of the uncanny and the marvellous and that prolong its hesitant vibrancy , The Wizard of Oz occupies a sense of fantastic space .All eyes are on Dorothy in the cluttered , ego - centric space of Oz .One such way in which the film achieves this sensibility is through an overt feeling of subjectivity .Although Oz seems packed with all manner and assortment of magical creature and location , it only really has one concern : Dorothy .She is very much the centre of everyone 's attention .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She is sent on her way along a road that starts precisely where she is standing and ends precisely where she needs to get to .She arrives at a crossroads and contemplates which way to go when , suddenly , an unknown voice off - screen gives her advice on the matter .The character of the Scarecrow is introduced , appearing in a field that was previously empty not because of some magical justification but because he had not been noticed by the protagonist , and was thus not part of the film 's visual landscape .The newly formed duo merrily continues onwards without any sense of trepidation as to where the other paths on this crossroads might lead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Emerald City can only be seen when Dorothy reaches it and , even then , the iconic shot of the vast green towers is filtered through an establishing shot of wonder in the face of the little girl and her companions .As she allows the viewers access to this menagerie of wonder , her presence serves to solve the many tensions throughout Oz 's space .She frees a Tin Man from a rusted paralysis that has lasted a year , unmasks its ruler as a man pretending to be a wizard and melts the Wicked Witch of the West with a bucket placed very helpfully beside her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The narrative may be an uncanny experience for the character , forcing Dorothy to grasp with her own consciousness , but not for the more detached stance of the audience , because it is ultimately her dream , her world , her space .[5 ] Indeed , this aspect of the film is highlighted in many of its psychoanalytic readings , as the film has consistently been interpreted as a dramatisation of various elements of Dorothy 's psyche .Bonnie Freidman 's analysis describes The Wizard of Oz as a female coming - of - age story of enforced domesticity , as Dorothy confronts a horrific vision of feminine power in the Wicked Witch and thus embraces her own enforced passivity ( 41 - 59 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These readings differ in individual interpretation but they all reflect the subjective quality of the film 's imagery .The film , indeed , is packed with quasi - Freudian imagery that positions Oz as a realm designed solely around its protagonist , becoming not an exclusively external realm of wonder but a realm Dorothy utilises for her own perceptive gain .The film may not quite depict an overt dreamscape - Oz seems to contain too much order and external wonder for it to be a purely subjective realm - but it certainly uses various tropes to promote such a reading .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fantastic Space : Avoiding the Marvellous .It is not just Dorothy 's physical presence that seems to dominate Oz but also her desires .Most crucially , it is not a desire to be over the rainbow that powers her fantasy quest but , instead , a desire to return from it .Despite the film 's joy in strange visual concoctions , The Wizard of Oz is a very conservative narrative .It is a story invested in home , in its virtues and in returning to it .This strange relationship between the film 's visual and thematic considerations is described in many of its analyses as an antagonistic one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And this is the home that ' there 's no place like ' ?This is the lost Eden that we are asked to prefer ? \" Elizabeth Bronfen 's work on the film even suggests that this unresolved dichotomy explains the very reason for the film 's enduring popularity , as viewers struggling with its thematic denouement re - watch the film to \" regulate its ideological message \" ( 74 ) .When considering the film 's presentation of Kansas , with its empty space and grey visuals , its conclusion that \" there 's no place like home \" seems to be the most implausible notion that the fantasy viewer has to encounter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The camera only glimpses into the interior of Dorothy 's house twice : once in a scene where Miss Gulch enters to take Toto away and another when Dorothy enters the house to be knocked on the head by the force of the tornado .Kansas is a world where Dorothy 's presence intrudes on an inhospitable working environment .As she rushes back to the farm panic - stricken , wanting desperately to tell her Auntie Em about the threat posed to Toto by Mrs. Gulch , she finds her guardians too busy to talk to her .Instead , they reprimand her for daring to take up their time with such trivial concerns .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dorothy 's very presence invades and disrupts , causing Hunk to hit himself on the thumb with a hammer and sending Zeke into blind terror as Dorothy falls into the pigsty whilst playing on the fence .This incident ends with Auntie Em shooing Dorothy away , telling her to find a place where she will not get into any trouble .As she turns disbelievingly to Toto to ask him if he thinks there is such a place , launching mournfully into the \" Over the Rainbow \" musical number , it is shown acutely that it is precisely Bachelard 's sense of protected space that Dorothy lacks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This rather negative portrayal of Kansas , and Dorothy 's subsequent obsession with finding her way home throughout her journey in Oz , can perhaps find a purpose when considered as another crucial device in the film 's fantastic spatial hesitancy .Because of the manner in which Kansas is presented in the opening sequences of the narrative , the film becomes not a pursuit to return to some ideal state but , instead , a journey to find one .It becomes a film that desires for a home as much as it desires to be away from one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dorothy arrives as a child searching for a home and finds herself in a world that , despite its various pleasures , is intrinsically incapable of serving as this protective environment .Oz is a not lived - in world .It is not a realm where we can \" comfort ourselves by re - living memories of protection \" ( 6 ) , as Bachelard states ; its delights , on the contrary , lie precisely in newness .It is perhaps through this newness that Dorothy finds herself yearning for a sense of the familiar .Oz can not invest in memory , the Scarecrow lacks a brain in which to store such trinkets and the Tin Man a heart to generate them in the first place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Similarly , as Kansas remains off - screen , it is the memory of such a realm invoked continuously throughout Dorothy 's plight that prevents the film from engaging with the marvellous potentials of its narrative .At the moment of supreme anguish , when Dorothy is locked in the Witch 's castle , an image of her aunt manifests itself on a globe .Dorothy is hit with the realisation that she is indeed small and meek , as she described herself earlier to the Wizard , helpless in a dangerous world of threat .This fantasy of Auntie Em , a fantasy born out of memory , infuses Kansas with the sense of homeliness it has sorely lacked .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At the film 's denouement , she awakes lying in her bedroom surrounded by various companions and protectors , a scene noted by its marked difference in presentation .Now , she is nurtured by her Aunt and Uncle , becomes the centre of all activity and the figure of Mrs. Gulch , set against the figure of the Wicked Witch , perhaps does not seem so bad after all .Similarly , against the comparison of Oz , Kansas can at last be considered familial .Just as Oz needs Kansas to be so supremely magical , so too has Kansas needed Oz to be infused with the qualities of home .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Home is not just a place of comfort or shelter for Bachelard .It is also a crucial site for the imagination as , by allowing a protective sense of space , the home allows its dweller a realm to dream safely .As Bachelard states , \" if I were asked to name the chief benefit of the house , I should say : the house shelters daydreaming , the house protects the dreamer , the house allows one to dream in peace \" ( 6 ) .It is perhaps these notions of the home environment that strike most potently at its relationship with the fantastic joys embedded in The Wizard of Oz .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The fantasy viewer is invited to see Oz not as an abandonment of the rules of reality in favour of a daunting new future but , instead , as a temporary suspension from which the film consistently suggests an inevitable return .The emphasis on home helps to infuse the fantasy with a sense of mortality that gives it vibrancy , allowing a safe and reassuring abandonment of reality within the safe hesitant world of fantastic space .The fantastic sense of space that prevails throughout the film is given perhaps its most acute distillation in this famous image of Dorothy hesitantly looking out on Oz for the first time from the confines and security of her house .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is a genre that somehow seeks to present strange , otherworldly iconographies without leaving a comforting sense of the everyday world fully behind .Its aesthetic joys oscillate between the potentially shocking and the potentially banal , carving up an in - between status to revel in that lack of fixity and lack of precision .It is precisely these qualities that make the genre 's appeal so hard to define .Oz 's character - centred and separated realms avoid the uncanny potentials of its narrative by eliminating a sense that the film threatens the security of reality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The magical Land of Oz is a clearly constructed realm within a film , a film about a little girl 's dream and , yet , its receptive viewers have partially inhabited that space for themselves and thus can not dismiss it quite so easily .They have not perhaps placed two feet on the ground outside the house but , instead , they remain , as Dorothy is in that famous shot , stuck in the black and white of Kansas yet staring out onto the lavish Technicolor .[ 6 ] At the end of the film , the viewer 's position is perhaps best represented by Uncle Henry who , when asked by Dorothy if they believe her , smiles and says : \" of course we do \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Ultimately , this sacrificing of American principles , which begins with violent acts of torture justified in the name of ending terrorism , ends with an even more violent and unethical act - the assassination of mostly unknown targets .These include at least one woman during a raid on a compound when it was far from certain that their desired target was even present there in the first place .It is the final raid sequence which sees Bigelow confronting the moviegoer with some of her strongest challenges , albeit with a deft subtlety , as to the ethical nature of what took place in that compound in Pakistan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then we have the point blank shooting of targets who have n't even been properly identified before they are killed , and who seemingly pose no immediate lethal threat to the US soldiers carrying out the mission .To drive home the point that these shootings are not simply acts of self - defense , Bigelow shows us the US soldiers shooting extra rounds into victims , including the woman , already lying dead on the floor .Make no mistake about it : she is subtly confronting America with the fact that this was a mission to kill , a revenge mission , and not an attempt to capture a criminal fugitive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "-- tell the US soldiers \" you 're going to kill [ bin Laden ] for me \" .And then comes the ultimate crescendo of the film , the assassination of Osama bin Laden .According to Bigelow 's portrayal of events - which she claims is based on first - hand accounts - Osama is gunned down while unarmed in his bedroom after opening the door to a US soldier pretending to be an ally and calling out his first name .Zero Dark Thirty ends not with a triumphant and victorious celebration , but with a weeping Maya all alone in a totally empty military cargo plane .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This was American foreign policy at its consequentialist worst .Bigelow is careful to avoid being politically partisan in her film .This is n't about the polices of either left or right , but about the American nation as a whole , and what it has allowed itself to become as a result of a blind obsession with seeking vengeance for 911 .When Maya is viewed as being representative of post-9/11 America , the words of the pilot who welcomes her aboard that aircraft at the end of the movie become chillingly profound .When she boards the plane and takes her seat she is greeted with : \" You must be pretty important , you 've got the whole plane to yourself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
