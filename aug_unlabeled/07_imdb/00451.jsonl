{"text": "It is a good series .Not amazing , but good .I 'm not a Twihard fan , but it 's still better than the first four movies .I 'm so lucky that the Twilight franchise came to an end .On the bad side which is the cheesy dialogue , the story , and the acting , but on the good side which is the battle scenes , but kinda ruined the ending .Anyway , Goodbye Twilight and never come back .This review contains spoilers , click expand to view .The first hour of the film consists mostly of unnecessarily prolonged montages , while the film 's final portion consists of a ridiculous , ingenuine , and unbelievable fight scene that ends up being a false premonition .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nothing to see here . ...Expand .as much as i adore Stephenie Meyers ' work , twilight in a weird way is good but her books are fine as well the actors are well giving terrible performances as usual in the saga ( Pattinson , Lautner ) .The saga is constantly being ruin once again with Melissa Rosenberg 's screenplay and director Bill Condon 's vision also direction sucks .Grade C- .It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in the entirety of my life .I hated every little second that lingered while watching this pathetic excuse of filmography .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , in Part 1 , Bella finally marries Edward , has his baby , and becomes a vampire .What are they going to do for Part 2 ?With all the main objectives already out of the way , Part 2 is pretty much a moot point .That evident things are uneasy to forget along the entire series , makes me constantly ask : \" why is he so stupid having such experience ? \"Seriously , he looks more dumb than romantic ... ...Expand .No es un final digno de recordar ( Tampoco es que la saga sea una obra maestra ) pero sin duda alguna es mas entretenida que \" New Moon \" \" Eclipse \" y \" Breaking Dawn Part 1 \" ...", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
