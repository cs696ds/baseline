{"text": "It all turns out to be one big , sick lark involving some tasteless practical jokes in which they dig up a corpse ( nicknamed \" Orville \" ) and read spells which will supposedly bring him back to life .The omnisexual Alan also arranges for his two flamboyantly gay pals to run around in cheap costumes and scare the folks for no apparent reason other than his own twisted private amusement .Unfortunately , as it turns out , the black magic spells really do work .The corpses begin to rise in a particula rly foul mood , and Alan finds his callous witticisms useless in the face of the clutching , rotting hands of the undead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In essence Children operates like an E.C. Comics tale stretched out to feature length , with thoroughly obnoxious , vile characters who all get their just desserts .Despite its flaws , Children features a terrific concluding half hour in which the horror finally takes over completely .Clark generates a truly chilling atmosphere throughout , but once the dead start to walk , things get very , very creepy .This first \" restored \" edition of Children originally appeared on laserdisc from Phantom Video , a fledgling company who unfortunately had to discontinue its pressing immediately due to an unforeseen rights issue .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film will never look pristine due to its impoverished budget and deliberately hazy look , but there was still room for improvement .It also includes a gallery of lobby cards and promotional art .Anchor Bay UK issued an anamorphic print with ( mostly useless ) Dolby 5.1 and DTS remixes but fatally failed to thoroughly check their source materials , releasing the shorter cut of the film which runs for barely 75 minutes .Even taking into account the PAL format speed - up , this amounts to almost 10 minutes of missing footage compared to the NTSC version .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately the chat had to be recut to accommodate the shorter running time .In the US the film was reissued by VCI as a 35th Anniversary edition whose first pressing ( erroneously containing the cut version and a seriously botched compression job ) was recalled and reissued in much better quality .The commentary is carried over here ( in its shorter form ) along with a video Q&A with Ormsby , composer Carl Zittrer , construction chief Ken Goch , and set decorator Albert Fisher chatting about Clark at a double feature screening .Then Goch appears solo for a \" Confessions of a Grave Digger \" interview , followed by zombie - themed music videos by the Deadthings and Freak along with a promotional gallery , the trailer , and an Ormsby bio .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As for the double feature part , it 's paired up with another Bob Clark horror fillm , Dead of Night .Released by Blue Underground in the US as Deathdream , it 's the grim story of Charles and Christine Brooks ( Marley and Carlin ) , a couple devastated by the news that their son Andy ( Backus ) has been killed in Vietnam .Christine insists he ca n't be dead , and soon Andy does show up at their doorstep ... but he 's a little different and keeps wearing sunglasses .Soon Andy 's off on a strange , sinister mission and looking a bit more decomposed by the day , while his family refuses to confront the awful truth ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
