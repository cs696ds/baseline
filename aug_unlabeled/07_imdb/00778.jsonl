{"text": "February 17 , 2006 .Everlasting Regret , 2005 .Chronicling the life and romantic trajectory of a postwar beauty queen named Qiyao ( Sammi Cheng ) over the span of forty years , Stanley Kwan 's epic period drama , Everlasting Regret is a film about unrealized ambition and missed opportunity in more ways than one .Comments .Much of the music in this film is NOT period music , but verbatim borrowings from Ozu films of the 1950s !A major disappointment .Many people blame the actress Sammi Cheng -- and I think this is largely unwarranted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I agree , Cheng did a respectable job with what she had to work with , the more problemmatic aspect was in the ellipses in the sense that what was left in was n't rendered enough to give you that contextual insight .I can see that Kwan was going for a kind of Hou elliptical distanciation , but he did n't quite pull off the \" essential - ness \" of the scenes that he chose to leave in as a representation of the era .I am mystified about Kwan 's extensive \" appropriation \" of Ozu 's film music -- it just did n't seem to fit well at all most of the time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
