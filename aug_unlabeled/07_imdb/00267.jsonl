{"text": "Worked hard on that ( not on composition , but in placement of the score into the piece and trying to get the tone and beats right ) .The \" stiffness \" of the male actors was as a result of the poo poo director - they were just following instructions .And at least as far as the courtroom scene was concerned , have you been to Court lately ?Stiff .Stiff .Stiff .Maybe it 's good we captured that - maybe not .I hear you on the balaclavas .I wanted to put the budget into other things and they were a compromise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
