{"text": "It 's almost as impressive as ' Bad Lieutenant ' and ' The King Of New York ' , yet I very rarely hear it even mentioned .I really do n't know why !The movie has one major stumbling block that the viewer must accept before they can begin to get on with watching .That is the casting of Christopher Walken ( ' The Dead Zone ' ) , Chris Penn ( ' Reservoir Dogs ' ) and Vincent Gallo ( ' Buffalo ' 66 ' ) .Three great actors sure , but playing blood brothers ? !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This would make Ray ( Walken ) in his late twenties , which is absolutely ludicrous .However , if you can put this all to one side and not let it worry you then you will be pleasantly surprised .Some viewers complain that the movie is \" slow \" , \" boring \" and that \" nothing happens \" .I totally disagree .Of course if you think it 's going to be a Mafia thriller or some kind of action movie you will be disappointed .But I thought it was fascinating and very involving .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Penn alone is worth watching the movie for , he is just so damn good .The supporting cast is one of the best you 'll see anywhere .Edie Falco , and Ferrara regulars Victor Argo ( ' Taxi Driver ' ) and Paul Hipp ( ' Teenage Caveman ' ) .Also keep an eye out for David Patrick Kelly ( ' The Crow ' ) as a left wing agitator .Every time I watch ' The Funeral ' I appreciate it a little more .It 's a very subtle and intelligent film that does n't serve things up to you on a plate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Those four movies are his best to date , and not to be missed . beautifully and intelligently made .I have always been impressed by the dramatic intensity of Abel Ferrara 's films and ' The Funeral ' does not fall short of any of them .The true beauty of this film lies in its characters and their emotions and relationships .The plot takes second stage but , honestly , the incredible acting performances will make you feel that a more complicated plot would be absolutely unnecessary .All the important bases of small - time mob life are covered here - God , family , revenge , lies , anger , etc .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You will be blown away .Bury Our Sins ?The Funeral is a dark and gritty story that plumbs the characters in a New York band of criminal brothers .It does n't have the romantic sweep of a Godfather movie , nor the rawness of Scarface .But it does have great acting : the cold , sinister aloofness of the leader - brother(Christopher Walken ) ; the raging insanity of the bartender - brother(Chris Penn ) ; and , the cockiness of the younger communist - influenced brother .Annabella Scioria as the wife with a tortured psyche who \" had two years of college \" , and Bennissio del Toro , as the suave and slick rival mobster round out the terrific cast .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The abrupt , \" surprise \" ending is consistent with the arcs in the movie , and is supported by trends in the characters ' developments , but seems unsatisfying .Also , long philosophical conversations between killer and victims seems unrealistic .While these conversations(and flashback sequences ) give insight into characters , it just does n't seem likely .Watch this movie if you are a fan of crime / Mafia films , and you can enjoy a thoughtful introspection of characters and relationships between characters .Do n't watch it if you want to see a \" thrill - a - minute \" , or explosions every other scene .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Once again Ferrara attracts big star names to a small picture with large ambitions .This film would have made a great gangster saga but Ferrara and writer St. John are more interested about the characters than the story .What occurs on the surface may be minimal and very uncreative but deep within you enter the souls of each character who question their values as they mourn the death of a family member .Each one carrying a dilemma to the very surprising ending .This film could have been set in any era as it deals with intelligent issues such as the complex male macho image as questioned by Sciorra 's character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All of director Abel Ferrara 's movies are deeply flawed , but he is willing to take you into darker places than almost any contemporary filmmaker .His best movies are the bleakest kind of cinematic art , and The Funeral is one of the best .To complain about the lack of action in this gangster movie is to miss the entire point .This is a character study of people who have made choices in their lives that have left them without hope , in much the same way as Ferrara 's \" Bad Lieutenant \" .Although it is often pretentious and a little boring , it also contains many potent , unforgettable scenes , most notably those featuring Chris Penn , who I frankly did n't think could act until I saw this movie . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm not sure that I would recommend it , but I am extremely glad to have seen it .Solid Ferrara movie that takes the glamour out of gangsters .The lives of gangster brothers Ray , Chet and Johnny are changed forever when Johnny is killed .His funeral acts as a time to look back at the past but also to look inwardly and to the future .The story is told in flashbacks that mix the past and present to see a gangster life style in all it 's glory .The characters make it come to life but the drama inherent in the subject matter helps as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Penn is also good as the self destructive brother and gives a powerful performance without becoming OTT ( a la Nice Guy Eddie ) .Rossellini , Argo and Soprano 's Ventimiglia are all good and del Toro does yet another quiet cool role .The subject matter will appeal to the mass audience ( most people seem to like mobster movies ) and his unromantic spin on the genre makes up for the occasionally bitty storyline .Interesting , if Uneven Gangster Drama .When it comes to cult film - maker Abel Ferrara , people seem to either love his work or hate it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fortunately \" The Funeral \" is far from being rubbish , but then it 's not great either .Set in New York in the 1930s , the film centres on an organised crime family , headed by brothers Ray ( Christopher Walken ) and Chezz ( Chris Penn ) who are set to bury their younger brother Johnny ( Vincent Gallo ) .As Johnny 's wake progresses the two remaining brothers reflect on his life and try to track down his killer .The film is pretty well made , and benefits from strong performances all round .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also , as in many Ferrara films , there is a very blatant religious subtext which sometimes gets in the way of the drama .Also , be warned that there is a lot of pretty brutal violence in this film .If you like gangster films ( and obviously if you 're a Ferrara fan ) give this a go .It 's worth trying anyway just for the quality of the performances .Mafia 's Hearts of Darkness ... .\"The Funeral \" is a mind - blowing experience that demands a particular patience .In fact , you do n't need the patience to ' get ' it , but to try to put yourself in the shoes of men who 're nothing but criminals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But if you 're interested by the torments invading the souls of these underworld humans , prepare yourself for a disturbing and dark journey into Mafia 's hearts of darkness .Yeah , I see where you 're coming from , how can I ever use the word ' ethic ' for criminals ?Well , ethics refers to a code , to some behavior that does n't necessarily take the law as a reference , and from that point , anything is debatable .And when the movie says anything , it sure means it , as even God is concerned .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These men do n't believe in God , but they do n't sound atheists , it 's just as if they had a proud reaction over a religion that casted them out anyway .So if they have n't been touched by the divine grace , which could have inspired them to be good people , so why do they have to blame themselves ?If everything is due to God , why should they feel guilty ?And now , if it all is a matter of free will , and decision , then what makes their acts more condemnable ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After all , they have hearts , have n't they ?To label them as only cold - blooded murders is another trick to avoid questioning our own approach to evil .But whatever rationalization it tried to inspire , the counterpart of this thinking relies on the female characters , the wives , who endure the machismo of their husbands and try to figure what the purpose of all this is .Why and how have criminals , killers , fooled them ?The whole confinement of \" The Funeral \" , in its setting , is crucial here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is what the whole claustrophobic setting of the film is about , it 's an extrapolation of the coffin , symbolizing the whole fate of the family in microcosm .These men are in a dead - end , and they know it damn well .During a heart - breaking scene between Chris Penn and a young prostitute , refusing to deprive her from her innocence , he pays her for not having sex , she asks for the double to have sex with him , provoking an incredible outburst of rage .She 'll get paid twice the price then pushed against the wall and assaulted as a punishment for having sold her soul to the devil .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In other words : their lives are only a suspended sentence to hell .They do n't believe in God , but they do n't deny His existence either .So , when it ca n't get any better , the best you can do is to make it better according to your own codes .And this is the constant disturbing feel of the film , men trying to act according to their sense of justice , their morals , trapped between their humanity and their evilness .Again , Abel Ferrara does n't invite us to feel empathetic toward gangsters , as sometimes , the movie indecently flirts with some stereotypes to better remind us , the world lying beneath that sober and familial atmosphere .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To a point you wonder if the title \" Funeral \" refers to one man or three souls . \"The Funeral \" is an extraordinary , dark and disturbing journey , that will simply wow you at the end so you better get ready .Interesting movie but the sound was awful ... .I found this an interesting movie , admittedly a bit slow at points , but if you 're out for another \" crime gone wrong \" or \" gangster crime war \" film , forget it .Several reviews complain about a lack of action .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Several reviews complain about a lack of plot .It 's more an examination of characters than a story .The movie would have been much better had I been able to hear more of it .The sound editing is truly abysmal .People 's shoes make more noise than their raised voices do .I actually stopped and rewound a few times to try and catch what people said .It 's not the fault of the actors .It 's simply a bad mix job .Communist mobsters ?Now I 've seen everything !Though he was the director of that awful thriller , ' Fear City , ' Abel Ferrer offers a movie about mobsters that distinguishes it from a decade of far too many mobster - themed movies in that it does not glorify mob life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ray ( Christopher Walken ) , Chez ( Chris Penn ) , and Johnny ( Vincent Gallo ) are brothers and members of the same crime family .I suspect that of the small crime unit , the eldest , Ray , is the leader .The film is centered around the funeral of the youngest , Johnny , who was mysteriously shot to death .And the mobsters , especially his brothers , want revenge .Johnny was an unusual part of such a violent family , too intelligent and often passive .He seemed to be drifting from his destined life of crime , handed down to him from his father to his brothers to him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ray is a much different character than Johnny .As the oldest , he was the first to kill a man when his father offered him a gun to shoot someone he did n't even know .Ray also absconds from any responsibility for what he does , consistenly justifying his actions as something that God forces him to do .Jean ( Annabella Sciorra ) , his wife , asks whether he thinks it is suitable to blame God for his actions .He apparently blinds himself to any reality , and basks in the idea that he is only carrying out someone else 's plan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jean even remarks to Johnny 's wife , Helen ( Gretchen Mol ) , that Ray and Chez and everyone else involved just keep perpetrating this one - sided , illiterate way of life .Chez is yet another counterweight caught in the middle .He is a very sadistic character and one who soon realizes what damage is being done .With Johnny dead and Ray eager for revenge , it is up to him to determine with the cycle continues .The nature of these characters are particularly interesting in a story that points out the realities of mafia life ( for both the mobsters and their wives ) as violence begets violence , making for a very intriguing story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
