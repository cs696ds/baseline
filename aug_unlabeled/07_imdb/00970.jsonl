{"text": "Snake on a Chain .Jackson and Ricci make ' Black Snake Moan ' an uneven , but ultimately enjoyable , tale of violence and rebirth .First off , an important disclaimer about Black Snake Moan .The snakes are metaphorical - they did not follow Samuel L. Jackson off the plane .In fact , there are absolutely no snakes in the entire film .There is a beaten and bruised blonde woman clad only in her underwear chained to a heater .But no snakes .This will undoubtedly be good news to fans of Jackson , who leaves behind his \u00c3\u00bcber - macho , one - dimensional persona from Snakes on a Plane to assume the role of Lazarus in Black Snake Moan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Obviously , the film lacks both snakes and subtlety .Nevertheless , what could easily have been a film overburdened with stereotypes and clich\u00c3 \u00a9 s turns out to be surprisingly touching , funny and redeeming .After his wife unceremoniously leaves him for his brother , Lazarus finds his chance for new life in Rae , an oversexed and reckless young woman who is desperately seeking something .Shockingly , whatever it is she 's searching for , it 's not to be found by having sex with lots of men .In an attempt to cure Rae of her wicked ways , Lazarus nurses her back to health after she is beaten and left on the side of road , ultimately chaining her to the house to ensure she does not escape .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Strutting around in her Confederate - flag tube top and Daisy Dukes while working a thick Southern accent and her large , doe eyes , she 's at once a lost child and a predatory vixen .Ricci is shockingly skinny , but still manages to make a heavy metal chain look sexy , wrapping it around herself in a manner that 's both seductive and protective - a sex toy and a security blanket .Starring Samuel L. Jackson , Justin Timberlake , Christina Ricci Rated R 116 Minutes Opens March 2 Area Theaters .Lazarus and Rae are living lives that are spiraling out of control - he 's despondent over the end of his marriage and she 's unable to control her urges and be true to her boyfriend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you can get past the whole chain and bondage bit , it 's actually a fairly touching story .Rounding out the cast , Justin Timberlake gives a surprisingly strong performance as Rae 's military - bound boyfriend .But , to be fair , he starts out by playing to his best assets with a sex scene .Fortunately for JT , his character has several tender moments because the tough guy routine is just one step beyond his acting range .Anyway , do n't you have to be a sensitive , new age guy to bring sexy back ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Best known for her role on Law & Order , Merkerson brings great life to Angela , a potential love interest for Lazarus .She 's the only touch of class in a story otherwise filled with victims and snakes .Writer and director Craig Brewer walks a fine line with Black Snake Moan .At once crass and vulgar and sweet and touching , the film teeters between succumbing to the violence or finding hope for the future .Given the lives of Lazarus and Rae , either direction is just as likely .With the prominence of blues music throughout the film , one would be remiss not to mention Jackson 's attempts to sing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the end , the actors should stick to their strengths : Jackson should leave the singing to Timberlake , and vice versa with the tough - guy scenes .Though the whole transformation of characters takes place during one week , a leap of faith is required to enjoy the film 's message .Because if you 're going to be picky , it 's easier to ask why Lazarus does n't just bring Rae to a doctor when he finds her passed out in the road .But despite the unevenness , a couple of carefully crafted moments featuring strong actors make the film a worthwhile endeavor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
