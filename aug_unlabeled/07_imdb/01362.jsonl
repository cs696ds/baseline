{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .Stoker is the type of film you do n't see very often .It has a small cast with huge star power , a brilliant script , expertly crafted design in both set and costume , and a truly fascinating story .The film is told less through dialogue and more through action , facial expression , and the imagery of a scene .Stoker does n't spoon - feed its audience .It expects them to be attentive and alert , ready to come to their own conclusions .As a horror film it is strangely elegant .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As a coming - of - age film , it is simply chilling !Nicole Kidman , Matthew Goode , and Mia Wasikowska all provide some wonderful acting here .Kidman 's talent is to be expected , but Goode and Wasikowska are especially impressive .Matthew Goode is nearly unrecognizable in his emotions on display here and Mia Wasikowska completely owns the role .Its hard to take your eyes off these characters .The elegance of the set and costume design is surprising , giving the film an unusual style ; the shifts in tone contrasted with the various designs often times creates a sense of disorientation yet overflows with beauty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Music and sound design is expertly crafted as well .Classical piano and strings fill the score , while the sounds of the Stoker House are startlingly clear ( due to a character 's ability to hear extremely well ) .The sound of India cracking an egg , for example , will surprise many viewers .She is in - tune with the world around her , and the sound design helps create this illusion flawlessly .Read more ' .3 Comments 61 of 67 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Brother Charlie 's arrival is a shock to everyone including the family 's long time housekeeper ( Phyllis Somerville ) and the brothers ' aunt ( Jacki Weaver ) .Charlie 's behavior is pleasant , proper and formal but at the same time , the way the guy focuses on people and things will give you the heebie jeebies .He reminds me of Norman Bates .Charlie is 9 years younger than his brother and no one has ever talked about him .In a couple scenes , Charlie who sees himself as a pretty good cook , presents dinner to India and Evie but does n't eat himself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( I wonder if the title suggests a reference to Bram Stoker ) .Korean director Chan - wook Park has a good handle on this film , given that the premise is a bit ridiculous .It has some extreme sexual elements to it , but never goes too far ... well except for Charlie 's longing looks at his niece .Charlie originally uses his considerable charms on Evie which is disturbing enough , but it is clear his primary focus is elsewhere and those who get in his way will have a price to pay .Goode is very good in this role .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She stays within herself and is terribly suspicious of Charlie , yet fights an urge of attraction .Her nature is perhaps hinted at early in the movie when a spider shows up on her leg .Read more ' .Comment 16 of 16 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... . \"Stoker \" is a beautiful , twisted , hypnotic trance - it 's meant for an audience not overly concrete in it 's thinking but who have an open imagination and are able to take the plunge into the darkly poetic vision of it 's director .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This movie is filled with images that are as disturbing as they are lyrical and open to endless interpretation .I 've seen the movie three times in theaters and find that my impressions change with each viewing and that it has really haunted my imagination . \"Stoker \" is one of those unique and mysterious masterpieces that I 'm sure I will be returning to frequently over the years - there 's much to drink in , as the well runs deep , .Comment 57 of 70 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Another masterpiece by Park , who playfully , coldly and ruthlessly explores the darkness of the human psyche .The movie is not only as good as the trailer , but hugely better and even more mysterious and captivating .It simply blows your mind away .Fortunately , I ignored the negative Anglophobe reviews and watched it .To fully appreciate this movie , you must have watched Old Boy and Sympathy for Lady Vengeance , and in general to be a fan of Korean and Japanese cinema .The script is excellent , violent , unpredicted , the plot mysterious and sinister , and not for those who love the silliness of American spoon - fed cinema .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This movie and Matthew Goode 's performance are Oscar material , if Oscars were not political travesties .I have never watched such a cinematic masterpiece before .Highly stylised , every move , every word , the posture of the actors , every tiny detail has a meaning .The mansion filmed on location has an ominous air of decadence .The plot is clearly outlined : India is a strange girl , with something dark and off about her .Her mother is a depressed rich stay - at - home housewife , and we understand that her marriage has become a chore .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
