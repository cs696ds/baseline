{"text": "I think a lot of reviews of this film have been unduly harsh .I have had a fair amount of Shakespearean exposure ( I was an English major in college ) , and I am actually impressed with Baz Luhrmann 's interpretation of the text .Some people are so blinded by the seeming erudite stuffiness of Shakespeare 's work that they forget what this play is really about . 'Romeo and Juliet ' is a teenage melodrama !With that said , this film works well .They handle their lines - perhaps - a bit awkwardly , and their key scenes are overacted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the reality of the play - Romeo and Juliet 's behavior ( though arguably passionate ) is less than genuine .They are young , fickle , and full of hormones , and what might seem like acts of heart - felt love and desire are actually just curious explorations of subversive behavior .Shakespeare 's plays are not famous because they have a great story line - they are famous because of the unbelievable writing .It would , therefore , be pointless to modernize the dialogue .Shakespeare 's plays ARE the dialogue .The cars , guns , drugs , and music suggest 1996 ( or thereabouts ) , whereas the gothic mansions , the ball , the feuding families , and the oppressive presence of the Church seem somewhat anachronistic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "One may be a tad hesitant to embrace its new shape and form and rightfully so .When you look at the track record for remakes it becomes apparent that in general what was once golden should be left well enough alone .In Romeo + Juliet 's case though this is a reimagining so magical it surpasses the original and becomes a momentous piece in the history books of cinema .Yes , Baz Luhrmann single handedly breathes a whole new life into this adaptation , handing to his audience a masterful and experimental film that never lets us out of its grasp .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A lot of people initially balked at the fact that the dialog was not updated along with the setting but I felt that artistically it was a much grander feat to have the original dialog kept intact .The fact that each and every actor slips into this way of speaking fluently and without issue is an ode to some great talent indeed .No one seems out of place of phoning it .Each and every actor handles the difficult wording marvelously .The next thing Luhrmann did right was trashing his setting .What I mean by this is that he did n't go the easy route and make this posh and beautiful but rather he played everything down , creating an almost gritty and dirty feeling to the surroundings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
