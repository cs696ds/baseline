{"text": "In 1982 , I participated in a movie about a group of baby boomers who attend the funeral of a mutual friend who has committed suicide .During the course of the weekend together , they reflect on their lives and the loss of their sixties idealism .In The Big Chill , I played Meg , a single career woman who , after a disillusioning experience as a public defender , joins the corporate world as a real estate attorney .She jokes that her clients have gone from raping people to raping the land .Meg expresses a sense of loss from the bonds of their community of friendship and a sense of a shared commitment and goals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Meg 's frustration in finding a man hit a chord in many career women of my generation .I was constantly stopped on the street by women who related to that predicament , whose longing for intimacy and partnership was thwarted by the inability to find the \" right \" man .Meg thinks she might not even want a man any more , just a baby .By playing Meg , I was able to try on all of her emotions , processes and decisions .I wore them and lived in them for three months .They aroused disturbing feelings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I became conscious of my own alienation .Like Meg , work had become my family .I had no time to pay attention to the nagging feeling of separation from some core that I could n't articulate .Meg thought a baby would bring her the connection , the intimacy , the \" heart \" she missed in her life .I realized that I needed to discover my own path to wholeness .I intuited that for me , this missing element would have to come from within before I could share it with someone else , whether that was a man or a baby .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In her book , A Passion for This Earth , Valerie Andrews writes about the eighteenth century philosopher , Leibnitz , and his book , The Monadology .In it he said that the whole of his life is reflected in the smallest unit of reality or , in our context , what is happening among individuals is happening societally and to the entire planet .The effects on the planet may not be quite as easy to see as personal problems in our daily lives , but they 're there , and getting worse .Thomas Berry writes in The Dream of the Earth , \" our entire society is caught in a closed cycle of production and consumption that can go on until the natural resources are exhausted or until the poisons inserted into the environment are fed back into the system .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Marijua Gimbutas , in The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe , gives evidence of a matricentric society between circa 7000 and 3500 B.C.

{"text": "The dominator model is now deeply embedded in our cultural traditions , in our religious traditions , in our language , in our entire value system , and its negative effects are accelerating .Berry , Eisler , and many others suggest we must move toward a more encompassing , holistic mode of existence .We must move toward a partnership society , and that means including the feminine values that were once part of our culture - feminine values which , while largely ignored , remain an important part of our collective unconscious .When I 've mentioned this concept of balancing the masculine with the feminine , I 've noticed resistance from some of my men friends .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is not another divisive concept , but an inclusive one .Masculine forces have been at work in our culture to the exclusion of a counterbalanced feminine force .These archetypal forces are creative , and men and women contain both the masculine and the feminine .But there is much evidence that the predominance of masculine forces has become counterproductive - life - taking rather than life - giving - and needs to be balanced by the nourishing , nurturing energy of the feminine .This does not mean that men should become like women , but that the whole culture , men and women , should begin to appreciate and discover values that are more intuitive , relational , and interdependent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" We all share the blame for what has happened to our planet and must work together in partnership to reach a new way of being .In moving toward partnership ways of being , as both men and women , we also need to discover our own authentic voices .We need to learn to form relationships with our unconscious , to \" hear \" the inner wisdom and guidance it can offer .Our bodies are conduits for this information , but through excessive food , alcohol , drugs , sex , and busyness we numb our bodies , and its signals are unable to reach our consciousness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
