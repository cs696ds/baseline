{"text": "I agree they got a little too distracted by the political moralizing and the humor suffered a bit in the second half , but man they finished it up with a bang .I do feel there 's a bit more of a rapid - fire tone to the new episodes , I 'm hoping they settle down a bit as they go on .I 'm still laughing my ass off though .I do get the feeling that there are more jokes ( in the last movie or two as well as the new episodes ) that are just there for the point of being jokes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That whole thing did n't give any insight into Leela 's character , it was just there for a pointless laugh .Did n't get one from me , but from others anyway .From my jaded , nostalgic memory I remember more jokes with character insights , even though I knew there were others as well .The Killer App episode strikes me more as Superhero episode .Still funny , barely part of canon , and we shall never speak of it again .Edit : again , LOVING that the series is back , and still very much enjoying the new episodes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I concur that they 've been plugging to hard on some of the political messages , but there is a lot of gold that they touch on .The eyePhone hardware / interface , the robot ' reform ' retreat , the crew attempting to impose morality on Earth , etc .The writers just need to settle down a bit and stop trying to justify their re - hiring .If they relax and write funny episodes , they will find the poignant and important episodes and minimize the ham - handed content of the last couple of episodes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These are the proof in my mind that the writers have still got it , but they are pushing too hard at the wrong areas .Gon na be honest , I did n't even finish last night 's episode , but the whole premise of it disgusted me anyway .Not because of the actual subject matter , but throwing Amy and Bender together like that just felt like the writers themselves no longer care about what they do with the characters .I was glad to see Kif in an episode , and then they went and basically made him a vehicle for what amounted to , as stated before , an idea out of a terrible show like Drawn Together .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That should never happen where Futurama is concerned !I agree with this part of your post .When it first happened , before I even knew where they were going with it , that was where my genuine laughter turned into uncomfortable chortles .But , it was n't the first ( and I 'm certain it wo n't be the last ) character pairing that served as the disposable cardboard tube around which to spin cotton candy .Fry and Amy , anyone ?The Professor and Mom ?Bender and Planet Express Ship ?Honest question , because I 'm too lazy to look it up myself ... is it pretty much the same writers they 've always had ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Every last one .\" -Handsome Jack .The bit that felt really old - style Futurama was Kif leaning somewhat unconvincingly against his vintage motorbike dressed up like Marlon Brando .Apart from that , the episode did feel a little bit hollow , too much like a string of worn jokes and stuff thrown in at random .Ratboy wrote : .I liked it better when I thought she was speaking in tongues .Cute tongues , but tongues nonetheless .Concur .There were some good jokes but overall it was just alright .Then again , new Futurama is better than not new Futurama .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Generally , I think this is people just settling back into the groove of Futurama actually having new episodes .When it was gone we could cherry - pick our favorite moments and pretend the entire show was that way .Now we have to deal with the reality of the fact that it 's a TV show with it 's ups and downs , like anything else .Concur .There were some good jokes but overall it was just alright .Then again , new Futurama is better than not new Futurama .And again it 's certainly not the worst the show has ever done .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I did get the impression that Fry and Leela broke up .I asked my roommate and he figures it was implied when Leela slept with Zap .The fourth episode was weaker but had some great moments .Spoiler : .And the ending was classic perfect futurama .Perfect smash cut , perfect choices by all three characters involved .It 's like right there the writers remembered who these characters were and what there histories .Although Bender does have a bistory of dating asian women .And again it 's certainly not the worst the show has ever done .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
