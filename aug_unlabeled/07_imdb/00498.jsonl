{"text": "Years pass and the prophecy seems forgotten until the priest 's troops disrupt the marriage of Ator to his sister Sunya ( wait for it ) , massacring the entire village and taking Sunya as a concubine for Dakkar .But just when the high priest Dakkar has finally been dispatched and all seems well , Ator discovers the Spider King is far from a myth .Is the prophecy to remain unfulfilled or can Ator manage one final triumph and run off into the sunset with ... his sister ? because he 's got his share of things to answer for .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact , D'Amato ( aka David Hills ) produced Troll 2 , an act which all by itself would guarantee most people time in purgatory .You read that right , the FOURTH Ator movie .How 's that possible , you ask , when the second movie in the series was so awful that it even taxed the endurance of Joel and the Bots on MST3 K ?( Servo : Yes ladies and gentlemen , thirty - five minutes into the film and we FINALLY have our first plot point ! )Just what is it that makes Ator so special that he rates three sequels ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I guess because anytime someone dresses a muscle - bound goof in a loincloth and has him fight some paper - mach\u00e9 monsters with his ( ahem ) mighty sword , dummies like me are gon na come running to buy a ticket .What , I did n't mention the paper - mach\u00e9 monster already ?Oh yeah , the all - powerful terrifying Spider King ; it turns out to be an immobile lump of vaguely spider - shaped cardboard standing in front of a web made from clothesline with its front legs moving up and down via perfectly visible wires .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of course , to get to the shadow , Ator and Roon must first pass the blind master warriors who fight their opponents using their sense of smell .That 's no problem , however , as our heroes cleverly manage to slip by the masters by rubbing flowers all over themselves to disguise their scent .Apparently the masters can smell human beings well enough , but ca n't seem to catch a whiff of the walking shrubbery wandering through their heretofore plantless smithy .Look , I know I 'm going through the film backwards here , but I thought I would give it a shot since it did n't make any more sense when I started from the beginning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( Sigh ) Alright , let 's just get it over with .The sister thing ...yeah .After an extended prologue , the movie proper opens with Ator in turmoil over his feelings for his sister .What was D'Amato thinking when he came up with that ?( Did I forget to mention he wrote this too ? )Okay , it is true that Ator and Sunya are n't blood relatives , but when we first meet them as young adults declaring their love for one another , THEY do n't know that .And when Ator approaches his father to discuss the possibility of marrying his sister the way some of their ancient ancestors used too , he still does n't know .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But since we 're dealing with D'Amato ( aka the guy who made Porno Holocaust)there 's just something about all of this that feels a little slimy .Hey , it 's a natural reaction .\" When incest occurs , it is not only violating a cultural taboo , it is crossing ancient neurological wiring for avoidance , \" says Jonathan Turner , professor of sociology at the University of California , Riverside in an interview with ABC News .( Almost as if it were part of some , oh , I do n't know , natural law or something . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After all , since Ator is adopted , his and Sunya 's relationship is n't really incest is it ?Biologically speaking , no , because there 's no consanguinity involved , no relationship based on descent from a common ancestor .( So while Ator and Sunya might eventually churn out some freakishly big - haired children , it wo n't be because of the genetic consequences of inbreeding . )But most jurisdictional bodies do n't rely on just chromosomes when drafting laws against incest , they also usually include provisions regarding familial relationships based on affinity , kinship by marriage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One reason for the expansion was that later authorities judged the Levitical lists to be only a limited set of examples of the marital and sexual relationships that should be banned . \"And I 'll give you one guess as to which \" authority \" happens to have some of the most expanded rules around regarding incest .Right the first time .But to find out just how restrictive the Church is in this matter we have to dig a little deeper than the Catechism , which does condemn incest , but does n't get too overly detailed on what exactly constitutes the act .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( aka the tedious book of Catholic ecclesiastical law most people stall out on during their attempts to explore Church doctrine . )So , while the marriage of Ator and Sunya seemingly gets a free pass in the heathen paper - mach\u00e9 spider worshipping kingdom they live in , from a Catholic standpoint it definitely COULD be considered incest .But it does n't HAVE to be , not in every single instance .And this is where even good Catholics get tripped up sometime , because it comes down to understanding what can and ca n't be changed in Catholic teaching .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "( 4 ) Disciplines - These are rules of conduct which faithful Catholics are expected to follow in their everyday lives .They are designed , as John Paul II put it , to \" create such an order in the Church that , while giving primacy to love , grace , and charisms , it at the same time renders their entire development easier . \" Disciplines can be altered , excepted , or even dismissed by the Church if she finds it appropriate .Surprisingly to most people , the celibate priesthood goes here .( 5 ) Devotions - Non - mandatory actions carried out by individual Catholics to enhance their faith .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fortunately for Ator and Sunya , the code in Canon Law which affects their situation falls into the area of Discipline , and as such , could possibly be appealed .In fact , Ator is actually a good role model for Catholics in this situation .He does n't just say , \" I want to marry my sister so to heck with the rules I 'm gon na do what I want ! \"Instead , he goes to the proper authority and makes his case for an exception and it 's granted .Good for him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , in the case of Canon 1094 , it 's because the world still needs it .You see , while there are still plenty of governmental incest laws in place , the social taboo against the act is slowly losing its hold in popular culture .For the last few decades we 've had people like Wardell Pomeroy , co - author of the original Kinsey reports , saying things in public like \" It is time to admit that incest need not be a perversion or a symptom of mental illness .Incest between children and adults can sometimes be beneficial . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
