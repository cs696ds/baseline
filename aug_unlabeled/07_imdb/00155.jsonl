{"text": "In this movie , Grace and Jim are on a journey , not only in terms of their road trip but also in terms of their relationship .So there was a good character thriller here for actors , which made it something I was interested in directing .Form remembers , \" After The Amityville Horror , we were thinking of doing a movie that was n't a straight - ahead horror movie ; a thriller with action .At a lunch one day , The Hitcher came up .Like most people , I had seen it a long time ago .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The new movie now has not one but two protagonists , Grace and Jim , driving it - both literally and figuratively .Form notes , \" Most of our movies - the ones we 've done and the ones we 're developing - have female protagonists .We did n't think that a young woman driving cross - country by herself would pick up a hitchhiker , but a college couple would - and it becomes a very different kind of journey for them .Fuller adds , \" Grace and Jim are in love and they get into this horrible experience ; they desperately try to make the right decisions , but things get worse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" One difficulty for us in developing the new story with our screenwriters was getting John Ryder into the car with our young couple .That had to be changed from the original movie , considering that 20 years later drivers just do n't stop for hitchhikers any more .So , in our version , Ryder had to be able to maneuver his way in - which he does ... \" .Something new and not just do the original movie again .The Hitcher director Dave Meyers says , \" If you 're going to update a picture , then you need to bring something new and not just do the original movie again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Hitcher is more dreamlike and ours is more real .\" The biggest and most exciting change , for me , is having two leads who you can be emotionally connected to , on a more articulated journey and in love .There 's more conversation in our movie because this boyfriend and girlfriend play off of each other and deal with the attacks , the situations , and the cops .In turn , I think that helps The Hitcher come into focus a little bit more , in terms of what he 's after .That 's something I wanted to explore , too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fuller admits , \" Our casting process is unorthodox , but it 's what we 've done and will do every time ; we sit down with a number of actors and actresses and talk with them .This way , we get a sense of who they are as people .We tape these sessions , and then recommend which actors and actresses should audition for Michael and the studio . \"Andrew and I had taken note of Sophia Bush in another movie previously .She seemed to have a lot of energy - which you need to star in one of our movies , because they can be grueling physically .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

'Fuller clarifies , \" We had already met Zach , while we were casting The Texas Chainsaw Massacre : The Beginning .For whatever reason , we did n't go with him on that one .When he came back this time , we fought for him during six auditions over several weeks - during which time he came back to read with Sophia - because it 's not conventional to go with an actor who has not starred in a movie before .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He had lost fifteen pounds in two weeks ; he was doing whatever it took to get this role .It 's rare to see that kind of commitment from an actor before they were cast .\" The chemistry between the two young leads .The chemistry between the two young leads was evident from their read together .The producers knew that it had to be immediately believable on - screen to audiences .Form remarks , \" On all of our movies , we bring the talent out to location two weeks early ; this is so people can get to know each other .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Bush reports , \" Dave and Zach and I spent most of the first week sitting in a room going over how couples talk to each other .We all drew from experiences we 'd had , and Brad and Andrew had their own stories , too .For Zach and I , it was like putting a puzzle together , and we started working as a team and figuring out how to play off of one another . \"Knighton reflects , \" You always worry that you 're not going to get along with someone .But I had gotten comfortable with Sophia throughout the audition process , where she was already really giving as an actor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Form notes , \" When actors are playing friends , or in this case boyfriend and girlfriend , that time together matters .On our productions , the only people who do n't come during that period are the actors playing their adversaries . \"As such , Sean Bean laughs , \" It was quite appropriate for what we were trying do on this picture !Sophia and Zach did n't know anything about me , and I did n't know anything about them .\" There was a separate sustained uncertainty over just who The Hitcher was , because Bean was late getting cast - though not for lack of trying .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Michael had worked with Sean on The Island , so we had met Sean and his agent .Sean had read the script and liked it .Finally , three or four weeks before shooting , Sean 's dates opened up and worked out .It was down to the wire .\" Bean felt sanguine about the way things worked out .He reveals , \" I always try to choose projects that will challenge and excite me , and I 've found that playing villains can be more psychologically rewarding .I quite like being scared by movies such as this one , where it 's based on psychological fear and suspense and tension .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also , I had seen the original film when it came out , and I remember being very scared by it .So , I was delighted to be asked to play this very disturbing character - someone who pushes limits and gets away with it .I felt it was important that , initially , you encounter him as a regular guy and not as an out - and - out psycho from the beginning .Ryder is intelligent and shrewd , and a good actor ; I see his clothes as coming from a previous victim , as he takes the part of someone else .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Meyers notes , \" Sean is the strong actor we needed to bring a strong interpretation to the role .Rutger Hauer 's performance in the 1986 movie helped define who our Hitcher was written to be .Form clarifies , \" Clearly , no actor would want to imitate what Hauer did , so Sean 's is a different John Ryder - and just as powerful .When Dave called ' action , ' Ryder would be right in front of you .The actor offers , \" I like to see what happens on the set and be spontaneous about the possibilities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "\" The biggest challenge , though , is that the heart of this movie is Grace and Jim 's relationship , which is something we really have n't done before ; in order for this movie to work , you have to believe in their relationship .Meyers says , \" I worked with Zach and Sofia to create a believable romance for their characters ; Jim is not ' whipped ' and Grace is not objectified .Bush comments , \" Grace 's boyfriend happens to be her best friend , and they get put through something horrific together .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "We shot during monsoon season , so we had storms circling our locations .The weather would change quickly , from hard sun to diffused sun , but that worked for filming Sean as Ryder . \"A film like this is made stronger by the lighting and compositions , which are extremely important to me .The early scenes start out very nicely lit , but then things start to darken and get grittier , even as Grace and Jim are driving through these beautiful landscapes . \" Fuller marvels , \" The rocks in Santa Fe are so red and rich .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" That beautiful terrain sustained a considerable amount of action - packed mayhem , as the production carefully staged what stunt coordinator Kurt Bryant assessed as \" hellacious stunts .We had a car chase at nearly 100 MPH , a stunt man jumping off a 30-foot embankment , and guys getting thrown out of cars , among other action scenes .We built a Mustang with special camera mounts on it .There was a lot of prep work on the cars ; everything had to work precisely .\" Car stunts . \" Kurt is the best stunt coordinator in the world , \" states stunt man and stunt driver Corey Eubanks , whose career recently passed the quarter - century mark and who took a busman 's holiday from working on the Michael Bay - directed Transformers to be part of Bryant 's team .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
