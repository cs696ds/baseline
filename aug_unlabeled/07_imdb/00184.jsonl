{"text": "About 10 minutes in , the decidedly dark humor kicks in .For a while , Fulci is fashioning one of the sickest comedies ever to come out of the horror genre .There are conversations with boom boxes and an eerie series of copycat murders making our nutjobs life even more slapstick and surreal .Indeed , for the first hour , Touch of Death is super .The storyline hums along fairly well , with only occasional lapses into illogic land .But the minute our killer goes crawling around an abandoned cottage looking for the individual mimicking his crimes , Touch of Death derails .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nothing much of consequence occurs at the vacant hovel , and when Lester leaves to continue his escapades , the slightest hint of something supernatural is still in the air .But Fulci never capitalizes on this concept .Instead , we get more of the same - except now sans the blood .Indeed , one of the film 's biggest failings is that , after the first two murders - and some creative slaughter of an ancillary character with a car - we 've seen all the slasher stuff that the movie has to offer .Fulci will do away with a couple more people as the plot moves along , but their deaths are nothing in comparison to the carnage we see at the beginning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After the shocking , sluice - filled first act , the brutality peters out until all we are left with is exposition and waiting .Fulci may feel that all this builds suspense , and he 's partially right .We are consistently at the edge of our seat waiting for the next volley of violence .Sadly , it never comes .Indeed , one could argue that when Touch of Death goes from visceral to psychological , the fun falls apart .All the black humor that supported the splatter fades off into the ephemera and all the bodily fluids dry up and disappear .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By introducing the mental madness in the beginning , Fulci has to find a way to readdress it and fill it out .But as he did in the past , the filmmaker always found a way to mix the exposition into the craven excess .Characters discovering the secrets to old houses or abandoned graveyards had legions of the undead , or throngs of demented demons to deal with .Here , we get lots of conversations , discussions about monetary issues , and a last act denouncement that never fully fleshes out our main character 's compulsion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The opening death by power tool is terrific , and if we had enjoyed similar slaughter throughout Touch of Death , we 'd have an instant classic .But the filmmaker pulls back on the reigns , doing something he is not famous for - trying to make sense of the storyline .He did n't do it in The Beyond , or City of the Living Dead , so why try now ?We do n't want a mental mapping of the hero 's psychosis - we want to see buckets of bile .True , the sequences where Lester discusses his problem with the electronics is wonderfully dopey , but we 'd gladly trade the talks for another Black and Decker autopsy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the leading role , Brett Halsey is hilarious .He is supposed to be a crazed cannibalistic serial killer , feeding his hapless gambling habit by murdering wealthy widows .But he 's more like the punchline to a joke about individuals who are desperate and dateless .Halsey , who some MST ies may recognize as the iconic Bix Dugan in The Girl from Lover 's Lane , does befuddled banefulness very well .We know he 's evil , but his klutzy cluelessness makes him sort of endearing - especially when he 's saddled with the kind of seamy slags he must woo here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We get gals with furry moles on their faces ... and breasts , ladies with lip occlusions , and the hairiest honey this side of the Soviet bloc .Their readily repugnant nature makes them easy targets for Lester 's lunacy , and we actually find ourselves rooting for their removal .Fulci should have really explored and tapped into this tendency .Had he followed his mutt ugly Miss muse to its end , Touch of Death would have been magnificent .As it stands though , this is still a recommendable movie .It does n't represents the legendary director 's best work , but it more than makes up for some of the failures he forced on the public toward the end of his career .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After all , no one does death , dismemberment and disease better than the fetid Fulci .His eye for evil was always exceptional and his notion of how to exploit overkill for its maximum effect is unparalleled , even today .On the off chance that the F / X failed him , Fulci could still salvage the slaughter .He just had a knack for the nasty .If you 're looking for a comedy that is truly black , or a slice and dice with lots of gooey goodness , Touch of Death will delight and disgust .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
