{"text": "Seeing how the mutated humans lived above ground versus how the non - mutated lived below ground was intriguing and interesting .I wish more time had been spent building this world and less on the emotions of the main character ( not to mention her friend , Emma , and the werewolf , Silver ) .The scifi explanations for the fantastical creatures was also engaging , but again not enough time was spent on it .Similarly , while the typical werewolves and vampires exist among the infected above ground , there are also the more unique such as the ewtes who mutated to live in the water but can walk on the ground with water tanks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They were far more interesting than our stereotypical main character Lilith .The world and minor characters are what kept me reading .... not the plot or main characters .The initial plot set - up is painfully stereotypical .Clueless teenage girls wind up in danger .Two men save them .One is an angst - ridden werewolf .The other is a mysterious , handsome intelligent fella .The girls protest they can care for themselves but the reader can see they ca n't really .The main teenage girl feels inexplicably pulled to the werewolf angst man .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And on we go .The last few pages of plot , thankfully , did n't take the typical turn , but honestly the pay - off was incredibly minor compared to the rest of the stereotypical YA plot .Even just making it a teenage boy from below ground saved by a female werewolf would have been a change enough to make me more interested .I also was disappointed to see no depth or examination of the human condition here , which I saw in Harte 's previous work .I was excited to see what depth she could bring to YA but she did n't even bring an empowered female main character to the genre .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ignoring my own quips with the plot and main characters , the book simply does not read like a solid first entry in a series .It gives the reader mere tastes of what we want to know from a first book in a series , like who the DEI are and why everyone is afraid of them , while lingering on things like how the main character craves the werewolf .That is fine if it was a paranormal romance , but it feels more like it is meant to be a post - apocalyptic / dystopian style novel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There has to be a clear world and a three - dimensional main character set up before the danger if the reader is to feel any connection or caring at all .As it is , I mostly just wanted to wander off and follow the ewtes .Overall , then , this is definitely a book for YA fans only .It 's the basic plot from YA with a twist set in a unique future world that was fun to visit .YA fans will have to try it out for themselves to determine how much they will enjoy that visit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Source : Kindle copy received from author in exchange for my honest review .Summary : Amanda Flynn 's life changed forever when her Red Cross relief team was exposed to a deadly virus in the Honduras , leaving her the sole survivor .Review : I admit that I bought this book in a haze that I call \" Kindle Sale Fever . \"Periodically Amazon has sales of Kindle books where they suddenly cost 99 cents to $ 2.99 , and I tend to impulse buy .Oops .( I mean , if you 'd told 7 year old me such a thing would even be possible one day , I probably would have curled up and died in pure bliss ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's nothing against the genre ; I just do n't do politics in my happy fun reading time .So , this book was already facing a challenge to satisfy someone who does n't tend to like that kind of story .At first , it definitely was working for me .The plot of Amanda Flynn mysteriously surviving the illness and escaping the CDC to avoid being treated like a guinea pig was engrossing for the sheer humanity of it .The initial break - out in Colorado Springs was also intriguing with the virus killing some people but healing others from serious illnesses like childhood leukemia .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The book was trying to straddle multiple genres and plot - lines that did n't quite mesh .See what I mean ?This would be totally fine if they all somehow tied up in the end , but the main issue in the book of these survivors with psychic powers is just kind of dropped .We get far more information on the foiled terrorist plot than on the effects of the virus on the survivors , and that is by far the more interesting part of the story .It 's also bothersome that the main character , Amanda Flynn , is the least well - rounded and likeable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps part of this is that we see the priest and the coroner before they become infected and are still entirely human .The story of Amanda and her survival in the Honduras is simply never fully told , and I think that would have helped a lot , even if addressed only in a flashback .Overall , although the story itself is not for me , it does suffer from some characterization / plotting issues .Thus , I would recommend it to huge fans of terrorist thrillers , who would probably still enjoy it .Summary : The zombie uprising has struck , and chances of survival are looking dire .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They find it in a classic suburban mall , but how long will they be able to hold off the hordes - not just of zombies , but of other survivors ?Review : This Romero classic is the follow - up to Night of the Living Dead ( review ) .Some similar themes may be found - holding off both the zombies and fear - but new ones exist as well , such as the danger presented by groups of other survivors .Perhaps most interestingly , the question of how much does this apocalypse create a new world and how much of the old world should be held onto .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is jumbled and confusing as we land right in the middle of the uprising , as opposed to at the beginning of it .Everyone is talking at once , and it takes the viewer a bit to get acclimated .Additionally , the scene in which the soldiers are introduced is confusing .Plot - wise , it makes perfect sense , but logically , it makes no sense why the people the soldiers are going after are refusing to kill the zombies .It does not seem like it should even be a problem , and yet it is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps this reflects the ideals of the 1970s , but as a modern - day woman , I was completely unable to relate .After the opening scenes , however , the story quickly picks up .The four main characters are all well - rounded and interact well together .Moving the plot to the mall was a brilliant choice on Romero 's part .Much could be said about the commentary on the zombie movements through a shopping center , relentlessly wandering , up and down , around and around , surrounded by consumerism .In fact , after the opening scenes , the entire film seems to be a commentary on consumerism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In any case , the scenes of zombies wandering through the mall are incredible and clearly became iconic for a reason .The concept of being able to have fun in the middle of a zombie uprising shows up here .The characters run around the mall , blasting zombies , looting , learning to shoot , and more , and mostly seem to have fun doing so .The distress mostly comes from boredom and feeling trapped , not so much from the zombies themselves .This theme is certainly its own special section of zombie stories .There are the stories that focus on the virus and the being eaten alive , and then there are the stories that focus on being trapped .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact , they are worse than in a black and white film because in color , it 's easy to see that the colors are off .Obvious face - paint is used on the zombies .Incredibly fake - looking blood that flows too slowly is present throughout the film .One does wonder why they could n't at least get realistic - looking blood .Overall , although the reasons this became iconic are abundantly evident , I still did not fall in love with it .The plot was rather meandering , followed - up by a cliche ending , and there were portions that were just too illogical to suspend disbelief .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
