{"text": "\" The problem with movies is that you 're in with the most bizarre group of people . \" - as quoted in Losing the Light : Terry Gilliam and the Munchausen Saga .Terrence Vance Gilliam ( November 22 , 1940- ) was the only American in the Monty Python troupe ( although he does have British citizenship ) and added the most surreal elements of the show through his many animations .; he was also Cardinal Fang of the Spanish Inquisition ) .He wrote a number of the sketches , and from there co - wrote the troupe 's three films based on original material with the rest of the troupe , on which he also played much more parts than he usually would in the series .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "From there , Gilliam moved into writing and directing non - Python films , though some of his fellow troupers have appeared in and/or co - wrote them .His specialties are fantasy and science fiction films , often laced with dark humor : one could construe his worldview as \" We 're all doomed !Is n't that hilarious ? \"He was J. K. Rowling 's choice of director for the Harry Potter movies - however , Warner Bros. decided against it .This is understandable , given that few directors in the history of film have been so prone to Executive Meddling , production delays and budget overruns , and just plain bad luck as Terry Gilliam .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It put him at odds with Universal Pictures when executives attempted to recut the movie , especially its ending ; the subsequent book The Battle of Brazil tells the tale .His next film , 1988 's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen , went wildly over budget and then bombed in the U.S. thanks to Columbia Pictures undergoing a regime change that kept it from getting proper release and promotion .In the 1990s , things were looking up with The Fisher King ( 1991 ) , Twelve Monkeys ( 1995 ) , and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas ( 1998 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
