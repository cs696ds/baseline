{"text": "For example , the rapist was improvising his insults , and we did that scene six times .But actually , I cheated a lot in the film too .The master shot looks real , but it 's full of tricks inside .When she gets into the tunnel she watches the panel above and then the camera tilts up ; we see the entrance of the tunnel , and then it comes down .With that quick movement I could edit the beginning of one take with the rest of another of the six takes of the rape that we did during two nights .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also , in that scene , a lot of small details were added to make it more real .For example , when the rapist comes out of her , of course the actor had his zipper closed and there was no penis there .We digitally added it so when he 's finished you see an erect naked penis which makes the scene much more shocking .I was maybe one of the first to introduce that kind of \" porn \" visual trick inside a commercial movie with famous actors .Lars von Trier did this a lot in Nymphomaniac Volume 1 & 2 , his latest film , which contains a lot of fake explicit sex .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When the producers signed with me to make Irreversible , they did n't expect the detail of the added penis .Also , because the dialogue was not written yet , they did n't expect the rapist to say such nasty , disgusting things .Because it was not written - that may be why we could make that movie .The whole movie was made with master shots , and the contract I had signed protected me from any forced re - editing .Of course at one point the producers said , \" This has to end , you need to cut it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a master shot .\" There was no way to cut , the whole movie is made of master shots , leading to each other .I was very lucky with the actor who played the rapist and I was very lucky that Monica was ready to go that far in the representation of the scene .As the director , I just created a playground for the actors .The whole scene was in their hands .They made the scene .And then , in post - production , I added a few elements to make it stronger .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "GN Yeah , of course .The rape scene was twelve minutes long .I normally do a scene over and over from the beginning to the end because it gives the actors a better energy .And it opens possibilities for improvisation .MB It 's interesting that there 's no proper script for the film .That 's fantastic .GN Have you ever thought of directing a fiction film , a narrative based on a novel or a personal story ?Matthew Barney and Jonathan Bepler , production stills from River of Fundament , 2014 .Photo by Hugo Glendinning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Courtesy of Gladstone Gallery , New York and Brussels .MB Well , River of Fundament is based on a Norman Mailer novel called Ancient Evenings .So in that way , having the novel as a text to work from , toward a script or a libretto , is completely new to me .And I 've enjoyed that very much .You know , I would not say that it 's a traditional narrative film by any means , but it has aspects of filmmaking that I have n't worked with in the past .There are scenes with dialogue carried by professional actors , and I worked with an editor who comes from a commercial filmmaking tradition .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Technically I could , but my interest in storytelling relies so much on experimentation with structure - and this is one of the reasons why I like your films so much .GN I think there 's something very square about how scripts , and movies in general , are written now .You see one or two and you 've seen them all ; you can close the whole thing inside your head , like , Oh , I understood that , it goes from point A to point B and from point B to point C. There are not many movies that stay in your mind the way dreams stay in your mind .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I can watch them over and over and never get bored by them .2001 is narrative but at a certain point it reaches a level that toys with a part of your mind that does n't read events but reads symbols .What are your favorite movies ?MB For sure The Shining is up there .I like films that are trapped in one location-Das Boot or Jaws or the ' 70s \" cabin in the woods \" horror genre films - where the location often becomes the main character .I also loved early Cronenberg .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "GN If you have n't seen it , you should check out Wake In Fright .It 's an Australian movie from the ' 70s .It 's very sick .MB A lot of my favorite films are actually commercial films .I mean , I love the spirit of experimental films , but I 've been influenced much more by commercial films .It has something to do with the fact that my development as a filmmaker has come from a performance background .It started with performing an action by myself and having one person hold the camera and simply document the action .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was a bit of a tourist with cinema , but I had an interest in horror from an early age .GN Are you a fan of Lon Chaney ?MB Definitely .GN I think he 's the best actor ever . \"The Man of a Thousand Faces . \"And in each movie he plays another cripple - his face is burned , his legs and arms are missing .For his time , he was the master of transformation .MB When I first started working with performers other than myself , I was thinking about something along the lines of Lon Chaney - like how can you , as a director , put a performer into a situation that can overcome their tendency to act ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was the kind of thing I was doing to myself as a young artist - I was putting myself into situations where my body was restrained as an attempt to change my behavior , the behavior of my art - making gestures .So once I began working with other people I started restraining the actors .And it led to very interesting situations , for sure , like experimenting with prosthetics and costuming in the development of a character - and Lon Chaney was always a model for that .GN Do you always work with the same makeup artists ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And with Keith Edmier , who is a sculptor based in New York , who worked in the makeup FX industry when he was younger .I just did this last project with him after not working together for almost twenty years , which was really fun .For obvious reasons I 'm very interested in prosthetic makeup artists because their process is so similar to mine as a sculptor - the casting and the mold - making and the experimentation with material behavior .The alchemy in that interests me very much .I 've got another question for you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "GN In France ?Just because they are , or were , easier to finance here , I guess .MB Is that all ?GN The French are not softer or harder than any other country .There 's an even stronger tradition of cruelty in Japanese cinema compared to European film .And among the Europeans , the Germans tend to top the French , Spanish , or Nordic countries when it comes to S&M or hardcore gay sex or things like that in real life .But mostly , when you make a movie , you need money .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So when the door got closed in America for projects of that kind , maybe at that time it got opened wider here in France .I did Irreversible , Virgine Despentes did Baise - moi , Catherine Breillat did movies with fake explicit sex scenes ; and there are many other directors who also managed to do horror movies that were quite extreme .But that was a few years ago and now it has gotten bad again .There is one pay - TV channel called Canal+ that was financing a third , or sometimes more , of the budget of all these partly transgressive movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The last feature film that I saw that is quite extreme when it comes to the reproduction of sex or violence is the second part of Nymphomaniac .There are some graphically explicit images in there that are very frontal .MB Have you heard of this book called The Art of Cruelty ?GN No .MB It 's by a woman named Maggie Nelson and it follows the history of extreme visual culture , from Marquis de Sade and Antonin Artaud to the present .And the position the author takes is that , because of our current situation with images of torture in the news and pornography online and reality programming on television , we do n't really need extreme images the way that we did in the past .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But this may not be true anymore with extreme image making .I 'm curious what your position is on this .GN In France , like anywhere else now , when it comes to pornography and images of cruelty , the Internet is the gate to the Wild Wild West .You can find everything , even things that I thought were illegal , on the web .Do you remember the story of that Canadian guy who killed a Chinese student a year ago and then escaped to France ?He made a short film about himself killing the guy and cutting him to pieces , then he added the music from American Psycho and put it on some regular websites .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Because it was edited and had music , it looked fake , but all of it was real !I was raised during a time when there was censorship .But now , any seven- or eight - year - old can just type the name of a porn star into the computer and see the most savage double or triple penetration .It 's very different and I do n't know how it 's going to affect the minds of the new generation .MB So do you consider yourself more on the cusp of advocating that kind of restriction ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "GN Censorship is when things are being put on hold - by your government or your family - to protect you from the dark sides , or what 's supposed to be the dark sides of life .Now almost all these images of what some call evil , are accessible from any iPhone , any computer .MB I 've been working with some adult film actors and filming some quite explicit scenes for River of Fundament .I think my interest in this has nothing at all to do with political provocation .I think it has to do with taking a kind of fundamental , albeit extreme , action and trying to naturalize it into the context of the narrative , or into what 's happening on screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So I 'm very interested in this book , Art of Cruelty and the questions it raises .GN Do you know this French artist from the ' 60s - Michel Journiac ?MB No , I do not .GN He was doing very radical performances in France , and was certainly inspired by Otto Muehl and the Viennese Actionists .He did something like . . .he brought a lot of people to a gallery or museum , where the event took place , and he was taking their blood .If you wanted to see the performance you had to give your blood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then he made sausage out of it and asked people to eat the sausage .MB Wow , excellent !GN A friend of my father described that performance to us when I was eleven , and it was the ultimate image of cruelty for me .I do n't know if it was Journiac or someone else who did this thing with cats - they were cutting their legs off and putting them on a large white canvas to run and create an abstract painting .I thought , How the fuck can someone do that ?But that was in the ' 70s - and now people do other kinds of cruel things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "GN Do you like Otto Muehl ?MB I do like Otto Muehl .Muehl 's relationship to sculpture is n't as strong as some of the other Actionists - Rudolf Schwarzkogler , for example - so Muehl is n't my favorite .But I like his films , especially the color films .They are lovely .GN When you start playing with the representation of cruelty , sometimes it 's easy to lose track , because there is a shock value that can excite you without a real need .Pasolini 's Sal\u00f2 , for example , was really shocking but it has a very complex vision of humanity , of human cruelty and power .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some people accused me of useless cruelty in Irreversible .I guess because parts of that rape scene were closer to a real rape instead of how you see it in most movies .MB Absolutely .GN There was a retrospective of cruel movies at the French Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que , among them classics like Umberto D .and Fassbinder 's Fox and his Friends .The Fassbinder film is just about a poor guy winning the lottery .His bourgeois gay friends end up stealing all his money and using him , and then throwing him away .The movie is so cruel that it 's really scary .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "MB Exactly .I 'm thinking now again about Enter the Void and how there 's a level of artificiality in that film - the aerial perspectives over the city , for example , or the sex scene where the people 's genitals are lit up , glowing with phosphorescent light .There 's an artifice in that film that is so different from Irreversible , and I 'm curious if your next project is heading deeper into that direction .GN It is going to be very artificial but in more of a Godardian direction .It 's going to contain a lot of words - maybe because my last film was very visual .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
