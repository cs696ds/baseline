{"text": "The characters were ... in character .Their costumes for the movie were fan service .They looked cool , there 's no denying that .Shiki and his crew were made up entirely of complete morons .They also felt like a forced attempt to emulate \" One Piece \" - the three main villains were given very blatant quirks .One Piece often does a good job of making each character unique , like how Don Flamingo is always laughing and scheming , how Jinbei is honourable and self - sacrificing , how Zoro can seem scary while actually being a really great guy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His assistant 's shoes made fart noises and he had his running gag ; the fart noise thing just felt really , really stupid .The gorilla dressed oddly and seemed to have a King Kong mindset or something .The characters had no depth ; there was nothing to them beyond the quirks .Shiki 's power was kinda nonsensical .I can accept the floating stuff , but his special moves just did n't relate to that at all .When the Straw Hats fight him , the results are just kinda typical ... like they want us to think \" Wow , Shiki is so amazing and is not a guy to be messed with \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He just did some move that made no sense and everyone was suddenly too slow to do anything .I ca n't accept that , even if Luffy was hungry .After thinking about it all , I think I rated this movie too high .The only good One Piece movie is the one where Chopper joins their crew ...But it is n't good because it 's a movie , it 's good because Oda actually wrote that story and it was really touching ; it was touching in the series .All of the movies are mere merchandise created to generate more money by throwing the \" One Piece \" name all over the place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One Piece has a good story , but you should just stick to the manga if you 're tired of fillers and empty movies like this one . read more .One Piece needs no introduction .It 's one of those franchises that everyone 's heard of , even people who do n't watch anime .It 's also one I have n't seen a whole lot of .I stopped watching after about a dozen episodes because it did n't interest me and Mr. Fantastic 's brain dead son was absolutely unbearable as a character .I might have watched more if he had n't been the main protagonist .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Because I received a request to review one of the movies .You might ask how I can review it when I have n't watched most of the series , but it 's pretty simple .It 's a movie .It 's not an episode , it 's a movie .Here 's the thing about movies , they have to be able to stand alone .Even most film trilogy parts can stand by themselves and still make sense .So , if it 's even halfway decently written , I should have no trouble figuring out what 's going on or reviewing it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , let 's take a look at One Piece : Strong World and hope that that stretchy moron dies a painful death .We open with ships floating in the sky .We cut to a pirate who causes them to fall on a group of government ships .We then cut to silly putty brain and his crew wandering around on a floating island .Why ?Well the film quickly moves into a flashback to show a pirate named Shiki , the same guy who made the boats float , trick elongated man 's paint chip eating roommate and his crew into crashing on the island so he can kidnap Nami .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have no idea , it does n't make sense .There 's no story reason for this structure nor does it create tension .Anyway , Shiki wants Nami to join his crew because he needs a good navigator so that he can take over the world .Okay , so the story is pretty cliche .How 's the execution ?Well , the first issue is that Shiki is n't even remotely threatening .He has sword legs which just look stupid and should n't be functional .Swords , they do n't work that way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Where any response you get will likely be pretending not to know who you are or what you 're talking about but do n't let that stop you .Then there 's his crew , which consists of a clown who wears shoes that make fart sounds , a pink gorilla and a bunch of nameless henchmen .I 've seen more menacing villains in the Care Bears .Maybe they 're trying to be funny , but there 's not a lot of humour here .There were all of two funny scenes .Another thing that really bugs me is that they use the term \" Evolution \" when what they mean is mutation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The characters are pretty one - dimensional .Let 's be generous and say that they 're relying on us knowing them from the show .But those characters who I remember from what little I 've seen of the show have n't changed , except for their outfits .Rousai 's disappointing grandson is still an obnoxious moron and the rest of the cast is pretty under - developed and bland .The art ...I do n't even know where to start .I have to admit that I hate the art in One Piece .The mostly lidless and blank eyes , the mouths that always seem to have their teeth showing for no reason , the bizarre proportions , the random things that replace various body parts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The voice acting is okay .I really ca n't stand Tanaka Mayumi 's performance , although I do n't really blame her since I know she can act .It 's probably the direction .The rest of the voice actors do a decent job albeit exaggerated a times .The strongest performances are probably from Cho and Okamura Akemi .The music is pretty underwhelming and forgettable .The yuri factor is a 1/10 .There is n't any in this .So , how does Strong World fare ?It 's not that bad .The story is pretty stupid , Elastic girl 's brain damaged admirer is the worst aspect and the weak antagonists do n't help matters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
