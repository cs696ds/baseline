{"text": "I find the judging aspect rather repetitive ( on virtually all of the reality shows ) and with so much time spent on such this show becomes tiresome ( for me ) .How many times can they say the same thing before you tune it out .The judges themselves are fine .I simply do n't tune into the show to hear them go on and on .Much like I do n't tune into the show ( or any of the singing competitions ) for great singing .It 's a reality show plain and simple and best served when that 's the focus .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
