{"text": "The Love Triangle Paradigm .With the popularity of Twilight , it seems as if there 's been an explosion of love triangles in fiction recently , especially in YA novels .What I find interesting is that the two guys the girl has to choose from seem to follow a paradigm .I.e. , .Take Twilight itself for a moment : Edward is Bella 's love - at - first - sight , ring - my - bell kind of guy .Then she meets Jacob and they 're friends and then she falls in love with Jacob as a friend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No , but he 's still a good mate candidate , right ?Despite the fact that the author seemed to disagree .Right now I 'm reading a book called Friday Night Bites , and there is a bit of a love triangle between Merit , the girl ; her boss , Ethan ; and cute , funny , and awesome Morgan .Ethan is definitely the one who lights Merit 's fire , but Morgan is a great guy who is more of the friend type .Although this love triangle has n't shook out yet , I have the depressing suspicion that it will predictably fall in favor of the loins .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite the fact that Linton is a good man , he 's not good enough for Cathy , who can only be broken out of her passionate narcissicism via her passion for Heathcliffe .Who , FYI , is an ass .In all of these love triangles , one thing is clear : lust trumps friendship every time .I would say it 's another example of nice guys finishing last , except that none of the guys in these examples are very nice after the girls get through with them .So , if you had to pick , what would you chose : lust or friendship ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many topics in science are notoriously difficult for students to learn .Mechanisms and processes that exist on a scale outside student experience present particular challenges .While instruction often involves visualizations , students typically explain in words , spoken or written .Visualizations have many advantages over verbal explanations , especially for science , so asking students to produce visual rather than verbal explanations should improve their learning .This hypothesis was tested in two domains , a mechanical system and a chemical system .The explanations were analyzed for content , and learning assessed by a post - test .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For the verbal explaining of a mechanical system , the bicycle tire pump , high spatial participants performed better than low spatial participants .However , low spatial participants performed better and as well as high spatial participants after producing visual explanations .Visual explanations included significantly greater amounts of structural information , as well as other features essential to understanding function , for example a complete explanation of the inlet valve , a crucial but invisible structural component .In the domain of chemical bonding , visual explanations were more effective than verbal explanations , and high spatial ability participants showed greater learning than low spatial ability participants .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Text added to visual explanations predicted post - test scores , as did the inclusion of invisible features .Many participants who drew identified actual examples of ionic and covalent molecules .Written explanations often used general terms and presentations of definitions .Explanations generated by high spatial ability participants contained greater amounts of function and were more likely to include specific examples .In both domains , text was often spontaneously added to visual explanations .In Experiment 1 , added text was equally likely to describe structure or function ; in Experiment 2 , added text was more likely to describe function .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
