{"text": "In 2008 at the Rotterdam film the catchy film name stick to my mind and it was n't until today that I was able to watch it as the film is screened online for free at The Auteurs .They want to see each other but Hama is not allowed to leave Iraq , especially when the Americans start to bomb Iraq and war explodes .So Ayca decides to go to him and the most extraordinary and very exotic to my eyes trip starts from Istanbul into Turkey 's north , the Iraq border , and Iran .You can really tell that Karabey 's has great experience as a document recorder as his directing style travels collecting little details that surround his main character Ayca .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But this docudrama is artish , so do not expect fast story development and you will enjoy more the ride .Wednesday , April 28 , 2010 .What a BEAUTIFUL movie !Beautiful , beautiful .The esthetic is perfect .The use of light and color absolutely dreamy and enhances what you will feel from the scenes .This is a movie about feelings , your feelings , the ample range of feelings you will feel while watching .I could go on and on talking about the few handheld camera takes to shake whatever was happening , the amazing compositions , the absolutely fantastic storytelling with a pace that goes slow , slowish , faster , back to slowish , slow and so on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Glorious performance .Bravo !Yes Julianne Moore is here and her role fits her like a hand to a glove , she should do more of this kind of roles set in the ' 50/60s .But also a pleasant surprise while briefly seeing Erin Daniels , she should do more films .On purpose never read about the story and I strongly recommend you do n't .You 'll eventually start to guess probably right , but it 's not a movie about destination is about the voyage and what a strongly felt voyage .Suffice to let you know that the story is about one day in the life of George , an English Professor living in Los Angeles area .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was sad , all right , and happy .I felt everything .It was wonderful .Love the film that personally believe is superior -as a film- to Brokeback Mountain .More complete cinema experience .Yes , I 'm still waiting for a lesbian interest film that so esthetically can provoke me such a torrent of intense feelings .Absolutely must be seen and yes , this is a keeper and goes into my collection to revisit now and then .Strongly recommend you do not skip this film as is truly a great American film about love , any love ; but also about life , anybody 's life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By now some of you know that I LOVE French cinema and that I have a hard time with comedies .If you browse the blog you will see that the words French and comedy together are simply non - existent .That 's until today .Yes waited until was shown in cable and finally watched one of the most successful French movies in recent times .The big surprise is that I like it !Yes , I laugh ( not too much but I did ) and felt very good ( after a terrible day ) when was over .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Tells about Phillippe , post office director , trying to please his wife and scamming to get transferred to a nicer ocean - side town in the South .When he gets caught he 's banished to the North of France to a tiny city , Berges .No worst punishment as up North is cold , inhabited by ' simple ' and uneducated people , unemployed miners that speak an incomprehensible dialect called Ch'ti .His wife stays in sunny South and he alone goes to a worst place than Siberia ... according to what everyone in the South says .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps is the best story I have ever seen about prejudice and the humor made it so easy to watch that was highly entertaining .If you have n't seen it I suggest to check your cable -or movie rental- perhaps they are showing this great film that maybe looses a bit in translation , but if you understand French you will laugh and laugh with the dialect speaking very funny moments .Excellent film for an entertaining and escape moment .A while back I remember I swore that will never watch again a French comedy , but gee this comedy was really an exception .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Recently the Romanian Gopo Awards had the awards ceremony and here are the winners in the main categories .As expected the movie that sweep the awards is none other than Politist , Adjetiv by Corneliu Porumboiu .To check winners in all categories plus the special awards go here available only in Romanian .Saturday , April 24 , 2010 .In my insurmountable quest to watch all the foreign films submitted to the 2010 Oscars recently I took a small step and decided to watch the UK official submission , a documentary by Havana Marking that troubled me more than I was prepared for .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But that 's the excuse to show how Afghan society has changed since the Taliban rule and my impression is that what we see is not so impartial and has a not so hidden intention .I 'm really torn with the way the documentary was edited as somehow I got the feeling that I was seeing propaganda .I will not get into explaining why , suffice to tell that it should have been a lot better if the story was told objectively .What I really appreciate is the story of the two women contestants as an example of cultural / religious rules that totally make women less than second class citizens and human beings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One positive thing the film did to me , made me think about politics , religion , Occidental recent popular culture and it 's not - so - good penetration in cultures with thousands of years , and many other subjects that definitively will not discuss in this blog .So , do I recommend the film ?No if you 're looking forward to an entertaining escape moment .No , if you want to have an ' objective ' document of reality .Yes , if you have to watch all the foreign films submitted to the 2010 Oscar , but be prepared to see and hear a lot more than a simply Pop Idol contestants story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It took me almost two years , but the wait was more than worth it as the film really becomes mesmerizing for the most unbelievable good story and the excellent performances from unknown to me actors ( or non - actors ? )It 's my first movie from Sri Lanka with an Italian director Uberto Pasolini that expertly handles actors and the story development .The film looks and feels like the raw reality of the poorest inhabitants that have to emigrate as \" normal \" life in their country is impossible .So it 's no surprise to find that is based on a true story of a group of men that have a clever idea to obtain the German visa .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The problem is that none of them play handball or have the slightest idea of what the game is all about .This is a film to watch for the story , the natural acting and a director that created an excellent and entertaining film and as such I do strongly recommend it to those that like to watch well - done dramatization of real life stories .The film is labeled as comedy and yes there is humor in this film , but what really touched me is the drama so well presented and handled about a very sensitive subject like emigration from a poor country into developed countries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But that 's the excuse to show us the ( real ) ridiculous side of art commercialism that is very similar ( if not the same ) all over the world .If you have ever been close to the Art March\u00e9 in wherever you live then you have to watch this film to uncover people you probably know and if you appreciate Brit humor then the pleasure will be double .Unfortunately I can not recommend this film to some of my loyal readers as is not the regular lesbian interest movie , but has all the ingredients including the sex scene .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "but this one definitively did , plus was a true delight to watch all the paintings , sculptures , etc that parade through out the entire film .I was n't sure if I wanted to watch this film , so I delayed as much as possible but finally I succumbed as is an Atom Egoyan film and had to watch .The good news is that visually the film has many good moments with excellent cinematography and some outstanding outdoor compositions .The bad news is that the original story was changed to make it the most awful story you can image , chemistry between main leads ( Julianne Moore and Amanda Seyfried ) was non - existent and after watching I was mad !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If something I was really curious about this movie was how they were going to adapt Nathalie 's very peculiar story that for me totally reflects France 's morality values that are SO different to values in English speaking countries .Well , just let me tell you that the main character becomes a stalker of the worst kind , which in the original story is very - very far from it .Yes this film is the very bad remake of Anne Fontaine 's Natalie .Bad because so many things that include the awful story changes but also -for example- Nathalie was all about voices and was really erotic , Chloe tries too hard to be erotic and becomes vulgar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Would I have liked the movie if I have n't seen Fointaine 's film ?Visually yes ; the story , no .Definitively Atom Egoyan should avoid doing mainstream films , he 's an excellent director that wasted his time with a terrible screenplay .If you saw and loved Nathalie as much as I did , I suggest you stay away from this movie as I 'm sure you will get upset with the old - fashion portrait of lesbianism in this film .Followed yesterday via facebook the awards with my favorite film of the year winning 10 Lola 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "AWSOME !When I saw Coco Avant Chanel I saw Tatou very alike to what Chanel looked like .Here Anna Mougalis does not look at all like Chanel but it 's impressive how she IS Chanel just with attitude and body language , you have no idea of how good her performance is , truly mesmerizing .Then Mads Mikkelsen 's Stravinsky says everything with very little expressions and lots of body language even when he 's stiff and deadpan faced most of the time .Last but not least , Yelena Morozova 's Catherine ( Stravinsky 's wife ) also is mesmerizing as the total opposite of Coco .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
