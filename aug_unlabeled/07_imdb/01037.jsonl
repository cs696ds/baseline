{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .As I loved the first Traveling Pants movie , I was looking forward to seeing how the girls ' lives had progressed in the sequel .Granted , seeing them as young women in college was mildly interesting , but the sequel left much to be desired .The writing and acting in this film seem to belong more to a really bad television series , the kind that gets cancelled after half a season , than a major motion picture .It seems that neither the writers nor the actors were truly interested in making a sequel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The most difficult part of the movie for me to accept , though , are the huge holes in the plot .I was able to reluctantly accept the notion in the first movie that a pair of pants could be shipped around the world ( twice ) in one summer .However , I can not seem to beleive that the girls could suddenly all fly to Greece at a moment 's notice ( explained away by the \" fact \" that Carmen 's stepfather has millions of air miles ) .This is a sadly disappointing sequel to a wonderful film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .After just watching a rather disappointing sequel to \" Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants \" , I can say that the first movie should have had the happy ending , instead of the sequel using 2 hours to try and find that happiness .The characters did not develop anything from the 1st film .They were still very shallow and drown in their personal miseries ; and were ( I thought ) overly emotional .The acting came up far past short of a decent applause of any sort , and the film had a misguided direction and an unclear plot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie fell apart as it went along , and the ending was okay .I felt the ending was phony , premature and forced ( it looks like a couple of scenes could have built up to it ) ; but all in all I think the whole sequel fell far from matching up to the first movies success . 1 of 1 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .The impression that \" The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 \" gives is that it 's a bubbly , bright , and -- for all intents and purposes -- meaningless sequel to the first film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unoriginal ideas ?Maybe so , but that does n't mean they 're any less effective .If anything , they make the film 's message that much clearer .It helps that many of the girls ' problems are based in reality -- high school issues , like being pretty and popular , are pushed aside in favor of adult issues , like pregnancy scares and family crises .We learn pretty much the same thing in this film , which sees each character facing new , more mature challenges .Let 's begin with Carmen , who doubles as the film 's bookend narrator .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Does she even know who she is ?How can know she when she 's torn between two men ?Naturally , the pants themselves have to play a part in this story , and indeed , they 're continually FedEx - ed from friend to friend .The question is : Do any of them need the pants anymore ?You 'd think that , at this point , a pair of old jeans traveling the world would reveal itself as a big metaphor .They may realize that by the time the film ends .I 'm not entirely sure , though .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At times , the dialogue is a bit contrived .Consider this conversation : When Tibby says drearily , \" I suck at relationships .I should have been a guy , \" Lena calmly responds , \" A guy would n't care about sucking at relationships .\" Only best friends in a coming - of - age story could get away with lines like that .Then again , I never expected a reinvention of the wheel .I think this movie will get the job done , not merely for teenage girls , but for anyone open to the idea .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I figured it would be based on the fourth book , and I hated the fourth book , so , you know , not all that excited .I came out of it a totally happy person .It seems to me that the screenwriter took everything that was wrong with the fourth book and fixed it .True , I would have liked to see Win , but that 's , imo , the only thing the movie really lacked .The acting was great , the chemistry was astounding ( and here everyone was saying the girls did n't want to do this ! ) , the storylines , amazing amazing amazing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "and \" We are terrible at not loving each other .\" One hilarious , one sweet , both pretty much summarizing the entirety of this movie and real life .I am not the type to EVER prefer a movie adaptation over a book .I always think the movies cheapen the written word .This is the one exception .Loved it , loved it , LOVED it .First of all , it is certainly an interesting experience to be the only guy in the theater for a movie like \" The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The best indication of how fast things move is that when Bee goes to Alabama her grandmother ( Blythe Danner ) immediately reocgnizes her , so they forgo the entire bit about Bee pretending to be Gilda .Additionaly , following Tibby 's pregnancy scare with having to be in the delivery room with Carmen 's mother added an additional resonance to Tibby 's story .There was reportedly some reluctance to get the band back together for this second film , but at least everybody got to go to Santorini this time around and watch Bledel freckle .However , the main thing I noticed in this second movie is that Amber Tamblyn is clearly the best actress in the bunch , which is saying something if you have seen Ferrera in \" Real Women Have Curves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The other thing I noticed is that the guys in this movie are all good guys .The only really villain in the proceedings would be Carmen 's supposed friend , Julia ( Rachel Nichols ) , but that just underscores the point that the girl 's are in many ways their own worst enemies .Their faults , dear readers , lie in themselves more in than others , and for the Sisterhood actualization truly comes from within .Again , because the film is covering so much , flipping from character to character as the Traveling Pants make their appointed rounds , there is a sense of sketching characters and connecting dots .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Still , being ' forever in blue jeans ' myself , I love these stories and have read every one .The coda for this series is excellent and a good testament to the stuff that binds friendship together .It 's not all blue jeans , but the shared memories and continued communication between friends .This is one of my all - time - favorite movies , mostly because of its celebration of people who devote themselves to the arts .As with Pants-1 , the film uses a pair of patched blue jeans as a device that provides a unifying feature to the story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
