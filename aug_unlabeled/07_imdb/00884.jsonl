{"text": "Do audiences hate Alison Ashley , too ?Another sad thing to report on the Australian film front , as yet another ' great white hope ' looks set to segue into ' big flat flop . 'Apparently , the film version of Robin Klein 's well - loved , funny , tender and whimsical novel of school and family life , Hating Alison Ashley , is not doing anywhere near as well as expected .The film was released just before the Easter break , and in its first week 60,000 people went to see it .But in the second week , takings had dropped by 28 percent , suggesting word of mouth was crook , and certainly the reviews also have been rather underwhelming .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I guess that last thing was a blatant attempt to woo the teenage girl vote , but apparently Delta looks much too old for the role .However , hopefully that 'll change - apparently the novel 's just been reprinted , with a film tie - in cover(naturally with Delta 's face on the cover ) , and apparently that 's doing very well and in fact going into the bestseller lists .Happily , I 've heard just recently that she is slowly getting better , but she 'll never be able to write again , and was unable to attend the film 's premiere .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But what a wasted opportunity , nevertheless , if it turns out the film has made a hash of the book 's lighthearted yet moving charm .When a film and a book mesh well - as is the case , for instance , with Melina Marchetta 's equally well - loved teenage novel , Looking for Alibrandi(which the author adapted herself ) it is a most singular pleasure .28 Responses to Do audiences hate Alison Ashley , too ?The film is quite good I thought , but suffers from all the shortcomings you 've anticipated Sophie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And it suffers from targeting the mid teenage market .The person playing the heroine was terrific , and a final scene between herself and her step father was very moving .He was the innocent .Reminds one of Bob Dylan 's line \" I was so much older then , I 'm younger than that now \" .Now ( at the risk of repeating something I said on a post several months ago ) those New Zealanders sure can make films .If the film \" In my father 's den \" is now available on DVD or VCR it is required viewing for all Troppodillians - and questions have already been set on it for the annual Troppo comprehension test .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think Robin Klein 's work was already fading a little during the early 90s .Hating Alison Ashley was supplanted by John Marsden 's Tomorrow When the War Began series .I 'm well out of the target market for the movie now and I almost certainly wo n't see it .But I really liked People Might Hear You when I was 12 or so .I 'm sorry to hear that Klein suffered from such a tragedy and that she will not recover enough to write again :( .Patrick 's right .Saskia Burmeister is BETTER looking than Barbie Goodrem , and certainly acts her off the screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This fact , and the commercial necessity to target older teenagers , probably explain both the casting and the plot deviations Sophie referred to .My biggest complaint with the movie , after the casting was the sheer lack of humour .It simply was n't funny .Not having read the book , I was n't sure of what to expect , but either the original book or its adaptation were lacking .Given the popularity of the book , I 'm guessing it 's the latter .It 's a real pity the film is n't funny , because the book certainly is - but like most good books , it depends for its humour on word play and language and characterisation , and if the adaptation does n't pick that up , then that 's a problem .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The charm of Rowling 's books , like Klein 's , does n't just lie in the sheer inventiveness and magic of it , or a great storyline - it also relies on excellent if archetypal characters , and lots of fun with language , puns , allusion , and irony .BTW I think the HP films have improved over the years - the 3rd one was the best .But they 're still not a patch on the books .Agree with you on the HP fillums , though the last two were particularly good adaptations to the screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Probably not , but one of the two instances where I 've commented on she - who - must - not - be - named was in response to Mme .Masson 's question .I actually wasted a morning seeing \" her \" film , and let 's just say my opinion of her acting ability pulled out the shovel after hitting rock - bottom .My sardonic teasing aside , I 'm actually with Ausculturejess on this one : DG is an over - promoted plastic hack .Saskia Burmeister , OTOH , is worth seeing in the movie - when it 's a weekly cheapy from your local DVD outlet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only way I could approach this play in order to engage these students is to present it as a period piece .How could it not be funny ?The play is a comedy .Poignant , searching , happy ending .A comedy that underlines the excruciating indequacies that abound in early adolescence .Re HAA I ca n't understand why anyone who saw DG on Neighbours would think she can act .The only reason I canthink she got the role was that there are no other well known young actors that could act as the draw for the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
