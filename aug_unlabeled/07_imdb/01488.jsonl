{"text": "My Thoughts ( For What They Are Worth ) : .Ok this is meant to be a farcical comedy and indeed you do get one as the plot of this is so unbelievable and silly yet you know the ending about ten minutes into it and there is no surprises with this film at all !There were no outstanding performance 's apart from the boss 's dog who stole the limelight for me in all its scenes , the story though as a whole is totally unmemorable , daft and I never laughed out loud once .Lindsay Lohan and the rest of the cast bumbled through this nightmare , seriously I only watched the ending just so I could write the review about it and it almost bored me death !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This review is also posted on Ciao under this same username .Comments .Good comedy .I had seen this film about for ages and thought it looked good and was definitely worth a watch .However I did n't get round to buying the dvd so I was pleased when I saw this was now available to watch on Netflix .This is a film only review .Her parents died in a car accident a couple of years ago which led to Thea needing to become the guardian for her 17 year old sister .Thea does n't mind looking after her sister but she finds she spends her life rushing about taking her sister to and from school whilst trying to earn a decent wage in between .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As a result of this , Thea 's supervisor calls her into his office and she knows that he has her papers ready to let her go .Thinking on her feet Thea decides a little white lie would n't hurt anyone and it would mean that she could continue working and supporting her sister .Therefore , Thea announces she is pregnant .I knew that the plot would n't be of the highest standard but I was fairly certain that it would be humerous and fun to follow .Lindsay Lohan plays Thea and initially I was a little skeptical that she may not be able to display a mother type figure as she was young when this was filmed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The plot was fun and I found it flowed well .There was a lot of humour encompassed within the plot which I enjoyed and I found myself laughing frequently .As Thea was ' pregnant ' she found herself trying to learn on the job and trying to display all the signs of pregnancy which she found quite difficult , especially when the time came for her bump to start showing !I found that I really enjoyed this film .Lindsay Lohan has been the centre of a lot of negative press recently which may put some people off of this film but it really is a great film which is perfect for any lovers of comedy and the acting is of a very high standard .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The ending was done well and all was wrapped up although it was predictable .However there were a couple of twists and turns which had me guessing too .It stars Lindsay Lohan .It runs for 89 minutes .It is rated a 12 .However , I personally found it to be an interesting light hearted comedy that I would definitely watch again .Comments .A decent film starring Lindsay Lohan .While browsing lovefilm recently for something new I decided that Labour Pains ( Labor Pains in USA ) was something that probably required little effort to watch so I set about adding it to my list and waiting for it to be delivered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The characters were well acted and there was quite a few funny moments that I could relate to , particularly when Thea is talking about someone and they overhear what is said and confront them .Not necessarily a funny moment for some people but it 's one that I could relate to and it gave me a big chuckle seeing the shock on the ladies faces at getting caught out , fantastic !I really did enjoy this storyline and because the film running time was just under 90 minutes I felt that it was just long enough to get the story across without dragging it out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I enjoyed watching Lohan and actually found her acting was quite good .Obviously this storyline was n't the most riveting ever and the fact that she is playing someone who is a liar probably made it a little bit easier for this to be acted out , however , I would definitely recommend this film .I love the typical chicklit book , and romance genre of films and this film matched the kind of thing I 'm looking for exactly !If you are interested in purchasing this film then you may do so from Amazon for around \u00a3 3.99 ( Price correct in May 2011 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only pain in this , is the film itself .Life is hard for Thea Clayhill ( Lindsay Lohan ) , after the death of her parents , she 's been left to provide for her 17 year old sister on a basic secretarial wage .Therefore with a now secure job things are on the up for Thea .The only problem being - how is she going to carry on this lie for the next 9 months without being found out ?Labour Pains , released in 2009 only received a theatrical release in certain countries , not the UK and strangely not the USA , where it was released straight to DVD to a somewhat mixed reception .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , I 've always seen Lindsay Lohan in a slightly more flattering light than her many critics and for that reason I was willing to give her , and Labour Pains a chance .Unfortunately , this was one of my ( many ) mistakes in life , as the film is actually a bit of a mess and the bargain bin is almost too good for it .From the very beginning , Labour Pains has no credibility and it would seem that common logic has taken a very wide berth with this film .Who said that pregnant women could n't be fired ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "For a character that the audience really should be able to bond with and relate to , the narrative of this movie really does make it an uphill struggle for even a glint of empathy to resonate from the audience .Thea ( and this is n't Lohan 's fault ) acts like a bumbling idiot for the majority of the movie , not knowing what 's she 's doing or even why she 's doing it .Thea comes across as a very cold character , ironically she sometimes looks like one of the ' mean girls ' from school , even a role that she can play comfortably she manages to fall flat with .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This gives the audience nothing to actually like about Thea 's character and in turn means that I really could n't care less what happened to her throughout the film .The premise of the film is rather original with a lot of promise to it , I think with a different actress on board ( possibly the Jennifer Aniston or Tina Fey type ) , it could have been a lot more successful .Of course the significant plot holes and flaws do it no favours either , so it should n't all be placed on Lohan 's shoulders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's these minor , yet major fragilities which really put the final nail in the coffin for this terrible , terrible film .Unfortunately after all that , this film was too far gone to possibly save , even with a few ( childish ) sexual innuendoes involving a pregnancy class and a suitably placed balloon ( you can imagine what happens to that ) .All in all , this film is a complete and utter mess from start to finish and if Lindsay Lohan thinks she 's going to revive her career starring in this sort of tripe , she 's sadly mistaken .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Comments .Worth a look - suprisingly good .People tend to know more about Lindsay Lohan 's personal life these days than her acting .This was a film she grasped with both hands when she was offered the role .Probably the only role she was offered that year !If rumours are to be believed Lindsay was a pain on the set while filming this as well !So the story is based on Lohan 's character Thea .Her parents passed away a few years ago and so its just her and her little sister Emma .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She suddenly realizes if he sacked a pregnant woman he 'd look really bad , so decides to pretend she 's pregnant .Thea was only going to go along with it for a couple of weeks until the argument had blown over , but she gets carried away , buying fake baby bumps from maternity stores and all sorts .And when her boss goes on leave for a few weeks she starts to fall for his replacement .Its actually a newish story - one that is n't done over and over at least .It 's somewhat believable until obviously she takes it too far , but then movies never really reflect real life totally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "OK , so she 's not without some faults here and there - you can tell she 's been out of acting for a while - but when you get into the film you remember what a good actress she used to be before the partying took its toll !She 's believable and does comedy well .The film is quite low budget , there is a good amount of outdoors filming but the sets themselves of the inside of the publishing house etc really do look like portacabins they rented out for a couple of months for the filming .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It did n't go to cinemas , and I can see why - I do n't think anyone would have rushed out to see Lindsay Lohan on opening weekend .But as a DVD film it works well .There is like I said a romantic interest between Lohan 's character and a colleague .I felt they did have chemistry but the male lead was n't very good looking in my opinion .Which made it a little less believable that Thea would fall for him .Nick ( her love interest played by Luke Kirby ) is adequate as an actor , but his character is just a bit feeble really .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Personally I do n't think Thea would have fell for him romantically in real life , and although the chemistry was there between the two actors for the role , it did n't feel believable for their personalities to match .Perhaps if he 'd looked like a stud I 'd have understood it !I liked Lindsay Lohan back in the day hence why I got this on DVD to see what it was like .I was expecting bad acting , and a bad film to be honest but I was proved pleasantly wrong .It 's a fun little film , some good performances , and overall it is done well despite having a very low budget .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
