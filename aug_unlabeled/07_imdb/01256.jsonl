{"text": "He does n't need our help to judge .While modesty is EXTREMELY important to me , I would say that I prefer to wear a bikini top underneath a loose t - shirt and a pair of board shorts .That way I 'm still covered and comfy .Tankini 's and one - pieces are too constricting and never fit properly ( not to mention how far down the necklines are ) .I am a teenage Christain girl and i have always been taught to dress modestly .I have read all these comments and I am stunned to see such bickering among Christains .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Thank you for that .I 'm very bothered by all of the attention on female modesty and not on male modesty .I will address that further below .But until then , here 's the way I see it .If you would n't wear it out on the streets , to school , to work , etc . , do n't wear it at the beach .How does where you are change anything as long as other people are around ?If it is n't appropriate elsewhere , why should it be appropriate at the beach ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I do n't usually comment on sites like this , but first of all one person commented you should not even go to the beach .That is too extreme .We travel all over the world and adore beaches & will not be giving up God 's beautiful beaches anytime soon .Also , another commented that Adam and Eve were dressed very scantily , as well .They were naked in the garden before sin .But that is beside the point .There are many beautiful bathing suits out there , as long as one is covered and it 's modest , I think it 's fine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
