{"text": "Tagline .Search .Site Navigation .In Memory Databases : HANA , Exadata X3 and Flash Memory ( Part 2 ) .In the first part of this blog series on In Memory Databases ( IMDBs )I talked about the definition of \" memory \" and found it surprisingly hard to pin down .There was no doubt that Dynamic Random Access Memory ( DRAM ) , such as that found in most modern computers , fell into the category of memory whilst disk clearly did not .The medium which caused the problem was NAND flash memory , such as that found in consumer devices like smart phones , tablets and USB sticks or enterprise storage like the flash memory arrays made by my employer Violin Memory .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My doubts are along different lines : if a database is running on flash memory , can it be described as an IMDB ?After all , if the answer is yes then any database running on Violin Memory is an In Memory Database , right ?What Is An In Memory Database ?As always let 's start with the stupid questions .What does an IMDB do that a non - IMDB database does not do ?Surely that 's \" in - memory \" in anyone 's definition ?So what is the difference between that and , for example , Oracle TimesTen or SAP HANA ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's a good start .So with an IMDB , the whole dataset fits entirely in physical memory .I 'm going to take that sentence and call it the first of our fundamental statements about IMDBs : .IMDB Fundamental Requirement # 1 : In Memory Databases fit entirely in physical memory .But if I go back to my Oracle database and ensure that all of the data fits into the buffer cache , surely that is now an In Memory Database ?Maybe an IMDB is one which has no physical files ?Of course that can not be true , because memory is ( or can be ) volatile , so some sort of persistent later is required if the data is to be retained in the event of a power loss .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So hold on , I 'm getting dangerously close to the conclusion that an IMDB is simply a normal DB which can not grow beyond the size of the chunk of memory it has been allocated .What 's the big deal , why would I want that over say a standard RDBMS ?Why is an In - Memory Database Fast ?Actually that question is not complete , but long questions do not make good section headers .The question really is : why is an In Memory Database faster than a standard database whose dataset is entirely located in memory ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These assumptions can not be easily reversed because they are hard - coded in processing logic , indexing schemes , and data access mechanisms .TimesTen is designed with the knowledge that data resides in main memory and can take more direct routes to data , reducing the length of the code path and simplifying algorithms and structure .\" This is more like it .So an IMDB is faster than a non - IMDB because there is less code necessary to manipulate data .I can buy into that idea .Let 's call that the second fundamental statement about IMDBs : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The HANA database runs entirely in DRAM on Intel x86 processors running SUSE Linux .It has a persistent layer on storage ( using a filesystem ) for checkpoint and transaction logs , but all data is stored in DRAM along with an additional allocation of memory for hashing , sorting and other work area stuff .There are no code paths intended to decide if a data block is in memory or on disk because all data is in memory .Does HANA meet our definition of an IMDB ?Absolutely .What are the challenges for databases running in DRAM ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you impose a restriction that all data must be located in DRAM then the amount of DRAM available is clearly going to be important .Adding more DRAM to a server is far more intrusive than adding more storage , plus servers only have a limited number of locations on the system bus where additional memory can be attached .Price is important , because DRAM is far more expensive than storage media such as disk or flash .High Availability is also a key consideration , because data stored in memory will be lost when the power goes off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now this could be any database , from Oracle through SQL Server to PostgreSQL .It does n't have to be Violin Memory flash either , but this is my blog so I get to choose .The point is that we are talking about a database product which keeps data on storage as well as in memory , therefore requiring more complex code paths to locate and manage that data .The use of flash memory means that storage access times are many orders of magnitude faster than disk , resulting in exceptional performance .Take a look at recent server benchmark results and you will see that Cisco , Oracle , IBM , HP and VMware have all been using Violin Memory flash memory arrays to set new records .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But does a ( normal ) database running on flash memory meet our fundamental requirements to make it an IMDB ?First there is the idea of whether it is \" memory \" .As we saw before this is not such a simple question to answer .Some of us ( I 'm looking at you Kevin ) would argue that if you can not use memory functions to access and manipulate it then it is not memory .Others might argue that flash is a type of memory accessed using storage protocols in order to gain the advantages that come with shared storage , such as redundancy , resilience and high availability .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Bingo .So running an Oracle database on flash memory does not make it an In Memory Database , it just makes it a database which runs at the speed of flash memory .That 's no bad thing - the main idea behind the creation of IMDBs was to remove the bottlenecks created by disk , so running at the speed of flash is a massive enhancement ( hence those benchmarks ) .But using our definitions above , Oracle on flash does not equal IMDB .On the other hand , running HANA or some other IMDB on flash memory clearly has some extra benefits because the checkpoint and transactional logs will be less of a bottleneck if they write data to flash than if they were writing to disk .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
