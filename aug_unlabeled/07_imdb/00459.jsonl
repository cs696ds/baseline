{"text": "Murder by Numbers Movie Review .Done correctly , a movie about a smart killer can not be topped .Look at movies such as Seven and Copycat , for example .But when a movie like this takes a more internal , character - oriented approach , things are n't so wonderful .Sandra Bullock , Ben Chaplin , Michael Pitt , and Ryan Gosling star in Murder by Numbers , a sharp - looking yet somewhat dull thriller about two high schoolers who kill a woman for the sake of outsmarting the police .Minds work against each other , as do the characters , as Barbet Schroeder 's film works its way from Point A to Point B with really not too much interesting stuff in the middle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It has good acting , a decent script , vivid scenery , and some character relations , but sometimes too much of one thing works against the overall result .I went in expecting one movie and was given another ; I wanted a film about a couple of smart killers that were very capable of getting away with the crime , and that killed multiple people .Instead , the two boys killed one person and they really were n't as smart as the movie tried to suggest .Almost immediately , the killers begin making mistakes , mainly focused around a common love interest , not to mention that one of them pukes at the crime scene .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I did n't really care about Sandra Bullock 's back story .As it is quite obvious from the beginning , Bullock 's character was stabbed and left for dead by her husband .Throughout the movie she is struggling over her past , and she is also a bitch to those in the present .Main characters can be snappy , but I really did n't like her at all .She delivers a good performance , but a likeable character would have been preferred .Furthermore , the movie does not make it clear whether they want to get caught or not .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This murder involves the dead young woman , with whom Cassie does n't exactly identify ( but with whom she feels mighty empathy ) , and her arrogant , foolish psycho - killers .These would be two homoerotically charged - up high schoolers , Richard ( Ryan Gosling , stunning in The Believer ) and Justin ( Michael Pitt , Hedwig and the Angry Inch and Bully ) , looking to commit the flawless crime .And they 're perfectly \" straight , \" of course , even fighting over the same not - so - bright golden girl Lisa ( Agnes Bruckner ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This demonstrates why the Joker is Batman 's greatest enemy .His crimes are not about logic or greed but his twisted mind .The Joker was 4 steps ahead of everyone for the entire movie .The entertainment buzz about Ledger being nominated for an Oscar is not an exaggeration .This will be the first comicbook movie to win an Oscar for acting .Christian Bale portrayed both Bruce Wayne and Batman perfectly .He was able to show the complexity of both characters and what was driving both of them .He demonstrated the shell that both Bruce and Batman have to keep .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Aaron Eckhart captures the character of Harvey Dent .This is great acting .He will be overshadowed by Ledger 's performance but do not miss it .This is the real Harvey / Two Face character ( sorry Tommy Lee Jones but Aaron was 100 times better ) .I really liked Gary Oldman as James Gordon in Batman Begins .He did a great job as a young Gordon .In this movie , he solidifies his role .He becomes the James Gordon that we love in the comics .This movie reminded me of the best Joker stories I have ever read including Death in the Family and the Killing Joke .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The filming of this movie was wonderful .The special effects were really good but they are not the main focus of this movie .After a twenty year absence , Indiana Jones hit the big screen last week .I went with a group of friends to take in the adventure .Here is my review .About this Movie : ( Beware : spoilers are included in this review )Indy is now twenty years older in the late 1950 's .McCarthyism is at an all time high .The cold war is raging against the Soviets .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They are after the crystal skull .This skull is not the typical religious symbol but rather something out of this world .In the process of chasing the skull , Indy joins up with a young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a familiar face from the past .What I liked about this Movie : Indy is back .Indiana Jones is one of the greatest action series of all time .It is great to have another movie in this saga .It is nice to see the Fedora and whip back in action .There were some great action sequences in this movie that are very typical for an Indy movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is the car chase and skull exchange in the jungle that reminds me of the truck chase scene in Raiders .There is plenty of action in this movie .Indy movies are known for their various creatures .There are snakes in Raiders , Spiders and bugs in .Temple , and rats in Last Crusade .This movie has mammoth killer ants that know how to swarm .It is very cool .I liked Shia LaBeouf as Mutt Williams in this movie .I loved how he arrived on a motorcycle dressed as Marlon Brando from the Wild One .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They left it where he could take over for Indy on adventures in the future .In the end , Indy even calls him Junior when is a nice tribute back to Last Crusade .Overall the affects in this movie are very good .The CGI is flawless in certain scenes .Effects have come a long ways over the last 20 years .There are other fun geeky things in this movie .There is the return of one of Indy 's previous love interests .There is the glimpse of the Ark of the Covenant in the Warehouse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Harrison stated 30 years ago \" I 've got a bad feeling about this \" .I did applaud when this line slipped out of his mouth .What I did not Like : Some of the scenes were very similar to other movies of this genre such as the Mummy series and National Treasure .The ants were cool but reminded me of the scarabs from the Mummy .It appeared that they had trouble finding things that were real fresh for this movie .This movie had a different feel than the other three .I think part of it is the setting in the late 50 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I understand that .Harrison is 20 years older so you have to make Indy older and this worked for the time frame but it just felt weird .The CGI for the Prairie Dogs was bad .They reminded me of the gopher from Caddy Shack .They seemed completely pointless and out of place in this movie .The atomic explosion scene seemed like filler to me .The fake people in a fake town was kind of fun but was not relevant .Indy jumping into a lead lined refrigerator right before the explosion and is blown clear of the site was completely unbelievable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the first 10 minutes we are introduced to aliens being the center of the story .I was confused if I was watching an Indy movie or the new X - Files movie .After the Inter - dimensional spaceship left , I half expected Indy to call .Marion \" Scully \" .My Review : I wanted to love this movie but I did not .But I did really like this movie .It was a fun popcorn movie .It was great to have Indy back .It had a similar feel to Star Wars Episode I for me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
