{"text": "Navigation .Should Go Back to my Husband ?Question : Dear Luise : My husband ( 47 yrs old ) and I ( 30 yrs old ) have been married for going on ten years , have been separated for about six months now and have formally filed for a divorce .He has been physically ( about five times ) , sexually ( twice ) , mentally ( innumerable ) , verbally ( innumerable ) , and emotionally ( innumerable ) abusive to me in the past .He even denied me children , as I raised his two daughters from two prior relationships .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is the fifth time I have left him , but the four times prior I was only gone for either a couple of days or weeks .During our marriage , I saw two counselors on my own and we saw two other counselors together .The second counselor we saw together , two years ago , told him that if he touched another hair on my head , she would see to it that he went to prison for a very long time , and he has not actually hit me since .Although , he has acted like he would do so , and even backed me up to a wall on two occasions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "From the moment I left him , he has been begging me to come back home .He has been going to counseling on his own since I left , claims to have read two self - help books and all of a sudden says that he wants to have a baby .He claims to be a changed man and promises to never abuse me again .Now , I heard all of this kind of stuff each and every time I left in the past .This time , I told myself that I was leaving him for good .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I still feel right in the decision I had made .The day after I left him I had coffee with another man and we even began talking over the phone .I did not feel guilty at all .He tells me that he just can not believe that I could start talking to another man the day after I left him .I simply decided that I was not going to allow myself to feel any more pain .I felt as though I had wasted so many years trying to please my husband , as I had nothing to show for the marriage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Nine months ago I had even added another part - time job at night on top of my full - time job and school .I cooked and served him dinner , cleaned the house , did laundry , children 's homework , my own homework , etc .He would tell me that I did nothing .I began suffering from severe anxiety attacks about six years ago .They would get so bad that I felt like I might die .I would eventually accept fault , apologize , and beg for forgiveness for any event that spawned an argument .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "He made me laugh .He was intelligent , talented , charismatic , and attractive .I wanted children with him .I did not leave him because I did not love him .I think I lost all respect for him as a man .When we spend any time together , he always wants to have sex .He says he just wants to make love to his wife and that he has been waiting a long time , but I do n't want to .I do n't even have the urge to have sex , when we are together .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
