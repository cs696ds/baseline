{"text": "Bernie has had man problems that put her past challenges in the shade - these days , she finds herself popping pills and forgetting details that she might do well to recall .Robin 's high - rolling life as a serial shopper runs into trouble when she loses her job to a merger , and she 's hardly faring any better in the world of online dating .Gloria still runs the bustling Oasis salon , but back - to - back family tragedies hit her hard .All four face tough questions about love and loss , but they keep faith in themselves and each other as their lives fall apart and reconfigure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "An ] earthy , funny , personal voice .\" - Raleigh News & Observer . \"A phenomenal read .\" - San Francisco Bay View .Q&A .The women of Waiting to Exhale became cultural touchstones and their stories inspired a hit movie .Why do you think these characters struck such a nerve ?In 1992 , it seemed that a lot of college - educated women ( of all ethnicities ) were having a tough time getting a date , which meant a boyfriend or husband was almost out of the question .Me included .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Women in their thirties , who thought they 'd done everything \" right , \" were finding themselves alone and often lonely .My girlfriends and I were among them .I think a lot of women related to the women in Exhale for this very reason : knowing they were n't alone , that other women were going through the same thing , and that their expectations were n't too high .By dramatizing the experiences of Savannah , Gloria , Robin , and Bernadine , I think many women identified with at least one of these women 's struggles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In what ways did this experience surprise you ?Do you think you would ever revisit any of your other characters now ?First , I 've never reread a novel I 've written .I did n't remember a lot of the details of what had happened to these women back in 1990 .I thought they were a little desperate , foolish , silly , angry , and , on occasion , pessimistic .I did n't remember feeling like this when I was in my thirties , but I suppose I did .I was somewhat embarrassed for them and by their behavior .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And I am grateful some of us have gotten past thinking that men are the key to our happiness .I had no intention of writing a sequel to Exhale and I have no intention of revisiting any of the characters who might still be living inside my other novels .I loved them as hard as anyone while telling their story , but I hope the endings provided them and me with enough closure to let them rest in peace !Where did you get your initial inspiration for Savannah , Bernadine , Robin , and Gloria , and where did you get your inspiration for their current situations ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What preparation goes into creating such memorable women ?Originally , I was thinking about my situation as well as those of my friends , in addition to reading about the distress many women seemed to be going through , over the notion that the clock was ticking .The idea that without a husband the chances of reproduction were slim .I started thinking about the various types of women who might have found themselves confronting the possibility of not having children , something that women before them were n't really concerned with .I also knew there were women who had already had children and been married , but I wondered what life might be like when your marriage ends or if you become a single parent in your thirties .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I also wanted my characters to have high expectations because I believe we should .I think about types of behavior when I create characters .I wanted to write about someone who was warm , caring , and a good mom , who did n't think she would ever find love again .I wanted her to be overweight because many women who are see themselves as unattractive .I wanted her to be strong in other areas of her life : she was a successful entrepreneur .This would be Gloria .Of course there are women who settle for whatever they can get and seem to be somewhat clueless when it comes to their personal life but quite proficient in their professional life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wanted to know what a woman would do and what kinds of regrets she might have , but also , one who would n't just settle for being a casualty and step up to home plate again .This was Bernadine .And Savannah .She 'd spend the rest of her life alone if she had to .This was a big deal to me at the time , and yet I wanted these women to be friends , to share a bond , because most of my friends and I had one , and still do .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I did n't know they would ultimately be so memorable .Your books focus on African American women 's struggles with men , money , and self - esteem , but these same issues plague women of all races .Are there distinctive aspects of the African American woman 's experience ?I think all women struggle with the same issues .Being African American just adds another dimension to some of them .In 2010 , I would like to think that it 's somewhat obvious , without having to go through the history of being black in America .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are more black women in college than black men .Black women outearn most black men .Drugs and violence plague our communities .Some black women ( not me ) feel that the rise in interracial marriages ( i.e. , black men marrying white women ) has created a situation where there are even fewer available black men .I have an aversion to writing didactically , so I tell stories about black women that hopefully all women can relate to , regardless of race .And when I read novels whose protagonists are white , I 'm not thinking : \" Oh gee , this woman is white ! \" I relate to the human component we all share in that we all want to be loved and be happy but things get in the way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When writing , do you have an ideal reader in mind ?How would you characterize your relationship with your audience ?I do n't think of my audience when telling a story .I 'm thinking about my characters .While writing , it is n't a \" story \" I 'm \" telling \" but a reenactment of someone 's experiences as they 're being told to me .I basically become the characters and share their fears , worries , and goals .When all is said and done , it feels like there is an intimacy my readers share with my characters , and thus , me , since I was the conduit !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't like to insult their intelligence nor do I assume they will like my stories just because I wrote them .A number of the men in Getting to Happy mistreat the women in their lives , by lying , cheating , or swindling .Which male character did you find the most difficult to write ?Are these behaviors representative of the relationships you see around you ?As the mother of a son , what advice can you give to parents to keep their sons from becoming like some of the men in your novels ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have come to realize that a lot of men ( not all ) are sneaky : they lie to women to protect their own self - interest , often without any regard to the impact their behavior may have on the women who love them .They make songs about this and they 're on Billboard 's Top 10 !I , of course , was the victim of a major form of betrayal , but I know there are millions of women out there who have been deceived on many levels .It does n't matter how deep the wound is , you still bleed and have to heal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is why so many women suffer from heartache .I chose to dramatize it because the aftermath impacts just about every area of your life .I raised my son to show everybody respect , to be honest , to not be afraid to express his feelings , even if they 're uncomfortable , to know that he 's not the only one who has feelings , and that what he does affects others .If a young boy loves and respects his mother , chances are he 's going to respect women when he grows up .They make the best boyfriends and husbands .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I write mostly about women 's empowerment .I write about characters who have been victimized but who refuse to be victims .I write about characters who are proactive and not passive .Sometimes they must react to situations , but this is usually a diversion , not the track they were on .I want to write more about people I empathize with but may have nothing in common with .As a mother , writer , and woman , how has your own life changed over the past fifteen years ?Over the past fifteen years I 've managed to be more mindful of what 's truly important in my life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I went through a horrible and very public divorce and discovered how angry I could get .I did n't enjoy feeling as though my heart and soul were like sandpaper and nothing could smooth them out .After three years , however , I was worn out , and the ugliness , angst , anger , hatred , flew out of me and up into the ozone .I got my spirit back .Have you \" gotten to happy \" ?Is happiness sustainable or is it necessary to occasionally feel pain or sadness in order to appreciate when life is good ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do not believe it is a feeling that is sustainable .Our lives are a series of valleys and peaks , and how we handle the valleys , how we address them and learn from them determine how long those peaks last .The better we are at solving our problems , owning up to them , and the more things we do that make us happy and allow us to feel joy , the more often we 'll feel it .What more can you ask for ?What did you learn from adapting Waiting to Exhale into a film that you would apply if Getting to Happy makes it to the big screen too ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was time consuming .In the past , I did n't have another novel in the works , but this time I do .I never thought that Exhale was going to be such a hit with readers , and I was surprised when it was optioned to become a motion picture .It 's a different world , making movies , and I certainly respect the interest and attention my books have gotten , but I prefer writing fiction .What is your next writing project ?I have about seventy pages of a novel written .I stopped in the middle of something and I 'm dying toknow how my character is going to handle it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
