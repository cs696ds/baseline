{"text": "I watched the first episode after following progress and being excited about an anime version of my favorite TV show for a very long time .I was not disappointed .Even though it starts off rather different from the show it still feels very similar .The first episode still gives us the basics of the plot , Mary Winchester was killed by the yellow eyed demon when Sam was only 6 months old .But this is seen as a dream by Sam in the Impala on their way to a case ( later Sam also sees a dream of Jessica 's death ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It keeps to the same basics as the original but with some minor changes and condensed ( since the tv episodes are 40 + mins and this is only 20 ) .The animation is really great and fits the show well .Sam and Dean look like Jared and Jensen .This really helps to get into the show very easily but the looks of all other characters is different so I do n't know how I and other fans will feel about that in the long run .Because of no budget or reality concerns the appearance of the shapeshifter takes the show 's concept and ramps up the freaky scale which is great .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Japanese voice actors do a great job and I wo n't mind listening to them but in the long run I will be eagerly awaiting the English release so I can hear Jared Padalecki voice Sam in all 22 episodes .Unfortunately Jensen only signed on for the last two episodes so I 'm fearing who will be gotten to replace Jensen as Dean for the first 20 episodes and how much dissonance that will create hearing Sam as Jared but not Jensen as Dean .The ending song is an engrish version of the show 's official unofficial theme song , Carry On My Wayward Son .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The real gems in the ending are the artist sketches especially the first one which depicts a very familiar ( very famous ) scene for fans of the show .I think for fans of the show this anime is going to be a great new spin on the story .For those who have n't seen the original I think this is going to be a must see anime and it probably will make you interested in the original .read more .Before starting , I should note that I am a fan of the TV series , but I will review the anime as a standalone piece .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Story : 7/10 The story is simple and easy to follow .It is about Sam and Dean , two brothers who hunt demons and evil spirits .Most of the episodes are following the \" monster of the week \" formula ... but there is a general plotline that advances slowly throughout the series .There is also a main villain and the Winchester brothers have a personal score to settle with him .Unfortunately , there are a few filler episodes with weak story and unoriginal enemies .Characters : 9/10 The personalities and the interaction between the two brothers makes the difference between Supernatural and other similar TV and animated series .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They can make mistakes , they can be paranoid , confused or angry and they always argue with each other .Because of that , they are a more realistic type of protagonists and the viewers can relate more to their problems and challenges .Sound and animation : 8/10 The animation is decent , but not perfect .Some things bothered me , like the awkward looking faces ... but if you deal with demons , your face will probably look strange too .There are also some good ideas , like the excessive use of black ink in every frame , which creates nice contrast and the camera movement during some of the action or driving sequences , which almost makes you feel the action .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The good sound effects ( like the Impala 's engine ) and the occasional scary noises enhance the whole experience and should also be praised .Enjoyment : 8/10 Supernatural has interesting heroes ( and villains ) and manages to create a scary and tense atmosphere , through good use of sound effects and music .There are a few great and very dramatic episodes with some interesting plot twists .The ending is above the average .It leaves the story open , but also gives some sense of completion .What hurt the whole experience is the lower quality of the stories created especially for the anime .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Overall : 8/10 If you are not familiar with the series , the flashbacks in the beginning would be confusing and meaningless .However , little by little the background story and the important details are explained .Basically , Supernatural feels more or less complete on its own and watching the TV series before starting the anime is not an absolute must .It may even have a negative effect , as some fans of the TV series hate the anime , because \" it is not exactly the same \" .You can be smart and ignore them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "STORY : 4 The plot seems okay .How Mary Winchester died is still the same as it was in the original series , but it was n't as detailed .The flashbacks that Sam had near the beginning of episode 1 made me go \" What ? \" once or twice , so I had to rewatch that scene a couple of times before I went \" Oh ...Okay \" .The anime desperately tries to have the same feel as the original series .Honestly , it did have the same feel , but there was just something lacking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Honestly , the background characters are more eye - catching than the two main characters .Since Madhouse was in charge of the animation , I figured that it would n't be too bad , but I was sadly mistaken .I put all this horrible art to a lack of a budget .To say the least , I was shocked when the scenery was so beautiful .The thing that should catch your eye are the characters NOT the scenery .All - in - all , they just needed more of a budget for art since it seemed like they did n't have enough money for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The English voice actors did put emotion into their lines , so it was n't dead .I have not seen the Japanese dub , but I assume they 're similar .The sound effects seemed fitting for the anime , but sometimes the sound effects just did n't fit .For the English dub , the words do n't exactly fit with the lip flaps .The sentences do n't go over , they go under the amount of flaps .It was n't enjoyable .The ending theme was n't the greatest because it was n't the original , but I suppose it worked .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "CHARACTER : 4 Character designs left so much to be desired .I understand that , no matter what , the animated characters wo n't look like the actual actors , but I just think they could 've planned out the designs more carefully .Dean 's design reminds me of someone who was put in jail for a crime .I have nothing to say on Sam 's design since it was alright .The extras , as I said before , were better drawn .ENJOYMENT : 3 I really do NOT care for this anime one bit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even then I 'd probably play with matches .OVERALL : 4 Even though the idea of turning Supernatural into an anime is good , I believe that it could 've been done better .If they did n't jump into it because anime is the \" in thing \" right now , I honestly believe it would be better .This is one of the worst animes I 've seen to date .If you plan to watch Supernatural : The Animation , I suggest that you do n't .Just stick with the live - action series .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Truthfully if your a fan of the series do n't bother .Sure it sounds like it 'd be good But with Jared Padalecki being the only one to reprise his role it was a disappointment .If Jensen Ackles ( Who was only in the last two ) and the rest of the cast had reprised their roles as well maybe I could have actually been able to stomach a full episode .Had they done this it could have made for something wonderful .But the animation for Sam was pretty much spot on .But Dean lacked a lot to be desired .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unlike the series there is no build up , the only explanation of what happened 22 years ago is just in flashbacks .Then the last two eps correspond similar too but at the same time completely different from the Supernatural Season 2 Finale ' All Hell Breaks Loose 1 - 2 ' .Personally I found both Dean and Bobby 's voice actors to be yeck !I could n't get threw the first ep because Dean 's voice was grating on my nerves .I did try to watch the final two since Jensen Ackles was doing it but it was n't that good of a story for me personally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jensen did a good job but for me it was too little too late to save the show . read more .As many of you are already well - aware , Supernatural is one hell of a series and for those who know it , seen it , love it I believe the animation is also worth seeing .But for the sake of a fair review , I 'll try not to compare it ( -much - I do compare it ) with the original series .So , the story is definitely interesting .Two brothers hunting down all kinds of monsters thought to be just fictions of mythology and legends does sound appealing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As far as the latter is concerned , I believe they fitted with the original series .But the 22 episodes just was n't enough to explain the plot thoroughly .Many questions arise and , honestly , I am not sure if I would understand the story so well if I was not familiar with the live - action series .Lastly found the ending fair enough , I repeat for someone who is not familiar with the original .The art was a real fit .I mean the intense black in the frames fitted well with the mysterious style of the story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But , I can not restrain from commenting on Bobby 's appearance .Man , what did they do to him ? ? ? ?( sorry about that ) .I have n't watched it in Japanese so I 'll comment on the dubbed version .Okay , the voice actors have risen huge complaints .Why Jensen Ackles is not in the show ?What 's wrong with the voice actors ?And bla bla bla ...Really , the voice actors were not that bad .They could have been better and having the original cast would be sweet but we should try being just a little objective .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What I found a bit disappointing were the characters .I ca n't be objective here because I know the potential of the characters .They are not as flat as the anime portrays them .They are more deep than that .Also , many characters and monsters had to be there .What about the guys from the Harvelle 's Roadhouse and the shape - shifters ?However , we can not expect that much from a 22-episode series while the original is 10 seasons !If you are new to the supernatural world I think you will like them as they are .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Each show is its own storyline without many things to link them together .The story is slow , and not really action orientated .Many of the shows act more like detective shows where something odd happens and they discover why only to have a small action scene at the end .There is a larger mystery that they have in this show about the brothers trying to find their Dad .The art style is rather interesting , almost a cross between anime and American comic book style .The characters are hard edged , and a lot of dark lines and heavy shadows that pretty much are black .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The characters look like the characters from the live - action as well which is what I would wish to see unlike some of them .Sadly , some of the images are pretty frozen , still images that feel like cop outs , especially when this was made in 2011 .The English voices do n't feel up to par with the animation , and feels a bit forced and does n't match the lip sink most of the time .They talk when the mouths are closed and part of it might be to get information out since this is shorter then the actual show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I really love the ending song though .I never thought I would hear \" Cary on my Wayward Son \" by Naoki Takao fit so well .EDIT : I have now seen the live action show , I really like it as well .The show has the same creepy feeling and the same slowness that the animation has .The stories are altered slightly from the original but that 's partly because they were putting a 1 hour episode into a half a hour one . read more .Therefore , it is best to just relax , lean back , and watch it flounder .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Because it 's hilarious .If you take it seriously , you 'll be very disappointed .I quite enjoyed this anime adaptation of the Supernatural series .The series take place over the span of the first two seasons of the original show , including animated remakes of fan - favourite episodes as well as completely new episodes .There were some episodes , such as ' Moonlight ' that I found did n't quite work as well , but this could be excused by the difference in episode length ( the original series being 40 minute episodes compared with the animated 20 minute episodes ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite this , I found the actor who voiced Dean for most of the English dub did a good job .The fact that the series was animated also allowed for the show to take some of the stories further .Some scenes packed in more extreme action , that the special effects of the live action series would n't have been able to achieve .The series could also make the creatures , such as the shapeshifter , look more disturbing .The style was very suited to the Supernatural vibe and atmosphere , and the animated Sam and Dean were accurate representations of their actor counterparts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The creatures look just plain freaky and there is actually a surprising amount of well - done blood and gore in the series as well .I watched the English dub and , while it certainly was by no means bad , it never really stood out either .The best part of the sound section for this anime though is that the producers managed to snag Carry On Wayward Son , the series unofficial theme song , as the ending ( Kansas haters will just have to deal with that ) .In that aspect , it shows how big of fans the Japanese are of Supernatural , and for that much , I am thankful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
