{"text": "search this site .Sunday , August 20 , 2006 .Freleng , Barthes & de Sade .Why is it that acts that would horrify us in real life instead evoke in us shameless , uncontainable joy when encountered in a cartoon ?While pondering this , I was reminded of Roland Barthes ' thoughts on the writings of the Marquis de Sade .( Seriously . )( I should admit here that I 've never read Sade first - hand myself , only accounts of his writings . )Barthes pointed out that by abandoning our ' realistic ' vantage point , and understanding that Sade was an elaborate ( if mighty peculiar ) sexual fantasist , it is possible to see the Sadean world as an intricate self - enclosed system unto itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sexual posture is the main one , and the others are : sex , male or female ; social position ; location , e.g. convent , dungeon , even bedroom ! , etc .Sade then combines these elements together in all manner of exhaustive permutations to elaborate a fully- fleshed out ( sorry ) set of possibilities .It is this abstract system of rules and combinations , completely and undiscriminatingly explored , that makes it a system fertile for intellectual discourse , just as , for example , a linguistic system might be .This discourse is what interests Barthes , less than each and all of the literal sexual acts themselves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What does all this have to do with Putty Tat and Tweety Bird ?Well , let me make three connections .One : Cartoons , by not being ' photographed reality , ' somehow liberate us from the preconceptions we would bring to a live - action film .What shocking violence and outrageous sadism we tolerate in our cartoons - not just tolerate , but celebrate , the more ingenious and plentiful in number and invention , the better !( Bazin was really on to something when he proclaimed the deep and primal power of the photographic image .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Second , by abandoning the ' realistic ' vantage point , we automatically gain a distance , a detachment , which allows us to view a cartoon in an abstract fashion , as if it were a set of diagrams , both conceptual and literal .( Correspondingly , the mise - en - sc\u00e8ne of a cartoon is itself abstract , just a few lines standing in for a house , a dog , or Niagara Falls . )And finally , many cartoons - Freleng 's are a perfect example - use this abstraction to strip the narrative of everything but invention and elaboration and inventorying .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "( 20 years ago , I loved Gremlins and Gremlins 2 . )Big day today : TIFF announces their film list .Back with a post on it this afternoon .Quite a surprising angle to compare cartoons and Sade , yet interesting indeed .Sex and violence proceed from the same duality of physical desir / moral frustration , but I wonder if the grammar system of porno and comedy really meet in permutations .Although this is obviously a disturbing similarity .Abstraction of pain and death is the key .Like Roger Rabbit demonstrated , toons are immortal , and they would kill for a laugh .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would more likely compare cartoons to fairy tales ( whiches are full of sexual symbolism though ) where magic allows characters to go through irrealistic dangers to face death , resurrection , torture and punishment .The childlike fantasy has no discomfort to play dead , to engage in virtual violence where the blows are simulated .Kids need this second - hand experience of harmless violence , and we can not rationalize it with a moral judgement , cause it 's not ill - intentionned but soothing .Pain is absent from cartoons , violence is spectacular but the reactions of the victim are disprotionately insignificant compared to the expected damages .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a sort of violence that has no physical consequences to fear .It 's not teaching kids the hazard of domestic violence , but helps them to bring out inner demons dealing with moral transgressions with their parents ( challenged authority , rules , forbidden games , phobia ... ) .It 's funny though that the Itchy & Scratchy or the Roadrunner are devoid of storytelling , because the instinctive point is destruction of the opponent without justification , taking cartoon violence to it 's barest .I love your take on Barthes and cartoons .I think it 's a great alignment of ideas because in the cases of both Sade and Tweety Bird sadism seems the only possible outcome of the porno - grammar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "An animated film like \" The Little Mermaid \" has very little appeal to adults but the frenetic and sadistic Bugs Bunny cartoons maintain in us a heightened state .While pushes the boundaries of the socially acceptable while nonetheless keeping us in line with tightly drawn rules and boundaries , we become trapped in the artist 's erotic world .And anyone who claims the relationship between Tweety and Sylvester is n't erotic is missing the point .One other thing of interest to Sade ( and perhaps too to Freleng ) comes from Sontag 's essay on fascism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She compares our current rituals of sadomasochism to Sade and notes that Sade had to make it all up -- his work is brilliant fantasy largely because it all sprang from his twisted , fertile and stylistically revolutionary mind .But the current BDSM scene is lifted only in part from Sade ( and \" The Story of O \" ) and almost entirely from the Third Reich .Which explains why Tom of Finland 's drawings are so much less riveting than 120 Days of Sodom or Tweety and Sylvester .Joshua : Sylvester and Tweety are more riveting than Tom of Finland ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It is primarily about Leni Riefenstahl 's photography , and therefore has very little to do with current discussion . sorry for throwing things out of whack .So to speak .I 've always liked Theodor Adorno 's explanation of cartoon violence .It 's over the top , but I think there 's something to it : . \"In so far as cartoons do any more than accustom the senses to the new tempo , they hammer into every brain the old lesson that continuous friction , the breaking down of all individual resistance , is the condition of life in this society .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" This is part of his , and Max Horkheimer 's \" Dialectic of Enlightenment \" schtick , where they analyze the unfortunate way that the rational pursuit of knowledge and freedom turns into its opposite .In the case of cartoon consumption , what appears to be uninhibited fun supposedly turns out to be a reinforcement to social conformity .And in content , what appears as the \" freeing \" of the spontaneity of the characters ( the \" freedom \" of their wacky hijinks ) turns out to be an expression of masochistic and sadistic tendencies that support violent and authoritarian social and political institutions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He is , in effect , a parody of the enlightenment tradition : universal freedom turns into universal enslavement .What does that mean for cartoons ?Freud suggested that humor involves a momentary lifting of repression -- consequently suggesting it is on the side of freedom .A cartoon might be seen as a temporary release of violent tendencies that are restricted by social life , on that view .But Adorno and Sade suggest that cartoon violence does n't satisfy a primary , frustrated desire , but are instead a training in repression , a support for , rather than an escape from , authority .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What I remember from cartoons ( I have n't consumed some in a long time ) , is the clear - cut identification of Good / Evil characters .Maybe I should scan cartoons for a more comprehensive study , but it seems the victim is always little , fragile , innocent , defenseless but smart or lucky : female / child figure .And the agressor is bigger , stronger , resourceful , hyperactive but dumb and unlucky : ( ani)male / adult \" pervert \" figure .So the underlaying moral invariably favors the victim , even if it 's fun to watch the baddie try and try again to break the ( moral ) law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Cartoons are a world where right and wrong can co - exist in \" harmony \" .I can totally relate to this description of social authority there .Children education is in fact a process of conditioning : every wrongdoing is immediately punished , recurrently , invariably , until full social inhibition is acquired .I wonder what it means that grown - up adults can still find pleasure in watching these scenes of repression conditioning though .I begin to see the sexual content in cartoons now .Hunger is a substitute for sexual desir : The wolf and the little red ridding hood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But I guess women find pleasure / satisfaction in being chased without being caught too , watching the men try and fail .I 'm also excited by the Adorno passage , but I think that Harry 's missing something in his response to it .Part of what makes the cartoons in question ( Tweety and the Road Runner are the prime examples , but we could add Bugs and Elmer , Tom and Jerry , ad nauseum ) so subversive is that they invert the roles of aggressor and victim .The cat / hunter / coyote earns our sympathy because he is frustrated in his desire to follow his basic drive ( to hunt and kill a bird / rabbit ) by a \" victim \" who is not only more cunning than him , but much more sadistic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And this is where Sade 's \" Boudoir \" comes in , though I do n't think it applies wholly or that Adorno really gets it right .The fact is , in cartoons , there is no instinct toward submission and in most cartoons there is no social order that is upheld .The \" social order \" would require the bird to submit to the authority of the cat , but the Tweety and Bugs are anarchistic figures who undermine the power of the law precisely by ignoring it -- and that 's what we find funny .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Joshua and Harry Tuttle 's points about the standard character roles in cartoons are really interesting .It 's true that the Adorno quote does n't seem to fit the inversion of victim and aggessor in so many cartoons .Adorno 's view is more nuanced than that I made it look .He does imply that there are liberatory as well as non - liberatory forms of humor : . \" Laughter , whether conciliatory or terrible , always occurs when some fear passes .It indicates liberation either from physical danger or from the grip of logic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , maybe Joshua 's examples are the \" right kind \" ?Actually , that 's tempting , since those Looney Tunes / Warner Brothers examples do constitute a kind of genre of cartoon , while Adorno 's examples are invariably Disney .Can we divide cartoons ( maybe not neatly ) into Good ( Looney Tunes ) and Evil ( Disney ) ?You 're right Joshua , I might overlook the sadism of the victim .But for instance the handless roadrunner never attacks actively , the coyote is clumsy and do it onto himself most of the time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The coyote endangers his own life by using deadly ( disproportional ) means .And this would be a perfect ilustration of Freud 's \" failed act \" ( is it the right english translation ? ) , where the baddie automatically makes sure to ultimately abort his own crime , because he knows it is wrong unconsciously and should be punished for desiring it .But you 're right for Jerry and Bugs , which is more of an Itchy & Scratchy model of reciprocated sadism .I 'm not sure about the link between Sade and cartoons , but I 'd need to read all his books .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The bird submits to the cat only in CK Dexter 's interpretation of Sade , which is not a conventional social order ( perverted ) .The moral order of humans says cats can not kill a bird in cage , because we fight against our animal nature .Sylvester is usually told by the old lady to watch the bird while she 's gone , and this is the parental authority installment , which could be transgressed while the parents are away , despite the known consequences when they will come back .The law is on the side of the victim , the natural order is on the side of the mighty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They only respond to agression with self - defense .In the natural order the prey can not attack / kill the predator , they just duck and escape .Predators follow their instincts , but we humans disaprove .Since they are personifications of human personality , the defending victim could kill a criminal because he 's wrong .Ok Bugs is perverse .But Tweety usually reminds Sylvester what 's wrong ( submiting to parental order ) and that these games might get him in trouble .Yes CK , this discussion is definitely proper to Looney Tunes , whiches are a very specific kind of cartoons .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What Disney cartoons are you thinking of for the \" wrong kind \" ?I think CK is onto something with his distinction between Looney Tunes ( which are at stake in Girish 's post ) and Disney films , which Adorno was more concerned with .We can add to Adorno not only Sontag ( who mentions Disney 's Fantasia as a supreme example of fascist art in the essay I 've already discussed above ) but also Walter Benjamin , who wrote about Mickey Mouse several times .It shows how comfortably fascism - in this realm too - can appropriate so - called ' revolutionary ' innovations . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Adorno specifically complains about Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck .I do n't recall much about Mickey cartoons , but the character of Donald Duck is supposed to be a stand - in for the average joe , where the plots revolve around Donald 's rapidly rising temper and of an unending sequence of escalating misfortunes and injuries .Usually , a minor misfortune makes him angry , he blows his top , and then the chaos and misery grow exponentially as a direct result of his attempts to fix the problem .This underlines the futility of any attempt to resist or transform misery , suggests that he deserves his misfortunes precisely because he has the gall to get angry about them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Looney Tunes cartoons , on the other hand , really do fit the \" escape from power \" picture of humor that Adorno values .They relish watching power fail miserably , time after time , to catch its victims .The most delictable joy of the roadrunner cartoons is watching the excruciatingly long and painstaking preparations that go into an overly intricate trap that 's doomed to complete failure .\" the baddie automatically makes sure to ultimately abort his own crime , because he knows it is wrong unconsciously and should be punished for desiring it .\" I had n't thought of the possibility that these cartoon predators are failing intentionally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It makes me wonder if the Looney Tunes cartoon model is so innocuous after all .Ultimately the war of the big guy against the little guy , of cat and mouse , comes off as a fun and innocent game that all participants enjoy , even the much pummelled predator -- and so a game that OUGHT to be continued .The predator purposely fails , in order to keep the game going , because it 's about the game , not the catch -- and for the prey , the pleasure is not in having escaped but in the game of escape .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Of the studio 's previous stars , only Porky and Elmer ever really seemed at home indoors , and even they usually worked better on adventures afield .Cartoons based on outdoor adventure were a natural during the wartime period , but as the troops came home and American interests turned more toward domesticity it made sense that the cartoons would follow .And as theatrical cartoon budgets began to shrink in the 1950s , indoor settings became increasingly in vogue as an alternative to limited animation : you could reduce costs because the backgrounds for indoor cartoons were often less elaborate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In the absence of a commentary track this interview segment gives us a decent glimpse into the deeper working process ( besides , anyone that 's ever heard a Burton commentary track will know that we are n't really missing anything ) .The twenty - minute feature is very amusing and far more informative than the usually press conference .Sweeney is Alive ' is a twenty - minute look at the Sweeney myth and its various incarnations .The general consensus seems to be that there was no real Sweeney Todd in London 's history , and that the story is an amalgamation of various factual killers and old wives tales .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The play version and an early film version are also covered here , though various B - horror versions ( like Andy Milligan 's Bloodthirsty Butchers ) are not mentioned .There is a feature length documentary in here somewhere .Musical Mayhem ' is a more specific look at Stephen Sondheim 's stage musical from which Burton 's film was adapted .Sondheim ( the man behind West Side Story , by the way ) himself is interviewed , along with various other members of the original and theatrical productions .This is a good place to pause and acknowledge the spectacular originality of a Grand Guignol horror musical .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have basically zero knowledge of the original Tony winning stage version of the killer barber tale , but internet research tells us that there was a lot of adaptation required to cram three plus hours of musical into two hours of movie .From what I 'm able to glean the biggest sacrifice was the relationship between Todd 's daughter and her would - be suitor , which I see as a good thing .Even as Burton and screenwriter John Logan leave it there 's a little too much of these rather bland characters .Sweeney 's London ' is a look at the history of London during the start of the Sweeny Todd legend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The narrator mixes the ' facts ' of the fictional Todd 's life and the facts of life on the bloody and polluted streets of early 19th century , and period appropriate art and maps are mixed with expert commentaries .I do n't see the purpose of separating this 16-minute featurette from ' Sweeney is Alive ' , but it 's still a nice dash of history lesson .The Making of Sweeney Todd ' starts as a total fluff piece , filled out with the usual ' all audience ' friendly clips , and back patting interviews ( \" He 's amazing \" , \" She 's amazing \" , etc . ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This bit likely played on HBO or something between full frame movies , and includes several bits from the longer and better featurettes .Grand Guignol : A Theatrical Tradition ' is a perfectly pleasant featurette all about the uber - graphic and ever popular play style that Burton 's film and Sondheim 's stage musical reference regularly .The piece briefly covers the basic history of the violent and often amoral stage productions , Sweeney Todd 's place within the tradition , and features a few minutes of recent Grand Guignol revivals ( pretty cheesy ) .Like the ' Sweeney is Alive ' featurette , this one feels like a mere taste of a bigger and better documentary , only running about nineteen minutes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The featurette is told with interviews ( subtitled to cover the accents ) , on - set footage , film footage and production artwork .There is some discussion of inspiration , but surprisingly no talk of Burton and company 's self - quotation .Bits of this nine - minute featurette can be seen in ' The Making of Sweeney Todd ' .A Bloody Business ' covers the film 's many juicy gore effects .The behind the scenes footage , narrated by the effects supervisor , is pretty thorough for another nine - minute runtime , covering the whole throat chopping process .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is a probably a good place to mention that my research tells me that Sweeney Todd was slightly cut for its American release .I 'm not sure on what specifically was cut , but I know this DVD is not the ' unrated ' version , which may be a reason to wait for the eventual Blu - ray release .Moviefone Unscripted ' is another fluff piece made to sell the film .Burton and Depp sort of interview each other while taking E - Mail questions from Moviefone web surfers .The participants are both charming as all hell , so what could 've been a totally lame bit is only kind of awkward .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
