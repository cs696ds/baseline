{"text": "J.G. \" Pat \" Patterson , Jr. , sometimes magician and friend of cult cinema legends H. G. Lewis and William Girdler , put together a little gore film in the early 1970s -- a take on the Frankenstein legend , but with prettier girls and bloodier parts .He assumed six different roles in the production -- director , producer , writer , actor , makeup , and special effects .Never before has one man given so much of himself to produce so little ... .Dr. Brandon ( Patterson , under his pseudonym of Don Brandon , America 's No . 1 Magician ) mourns the death of his wife , but then reminds himself that he 's a mad scientist and he can just resurrect her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He leaves the microwaves on too long , though , and the body just burns .Oh , well .Hunchbacked assistant Gregory ( Roy Mehaffey ) just drops the failure in the requisite vat of acid .Brandon begins anew , taking the best parts from different , fresher specimens .Oh boy ... .There needs to be a word stronger than incompetent , because sextuple - threat Patterson is just that -- a threat .Rarely does Doctor Gore ( originally titled The Body Shop ) make any sort of coherent narrative sense .Why are deliverymen bringing in a trunk with a dead girl in it ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Where does Brandon get his wide - eyed hypno - powers ?Why does he even have a laboratory expressly designed for reviving the dead ?Why does he have to convince Gregory to help him with his experiments after the poor guy 's already been doing it for twenty minutes ?These concerns do n't even begin to cover the ineptitude of the direction .Frankly , I 'm surprised that Patterson managed an entire 75 minutes out of the film .Even with the padded scenes ( some that deliver about 15 seconds worth of information can stretch five minutes ) , it 's obvious the man did n't know how to get good coverage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Patterson constantly smokes throughout the film , but he ca n't seem to maintain continuity on a single one of those cancer sticks .They just leap in and out of his mouth like bad magic .His performance plods with stilted monologues ( most of them extremely misogynistic ) , and he delivers dialogue both ridiculous and acceptable with zero conviction .I 'd hate to see this guy 's stage show ; I 'm sure he opens with his amazing sleeping audience trick .Not only that , but the script calls for him to attract young , nubile women with his charms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Perhaps not .In any case , Girdler 's signature song for the film is a bizarre brain - melter about little girls , what they 're made of , and what they do when they get older -- all set to a warped version of \" My Favorite Things .\" Patterson uses this song again and again in the movie , until you want to dig your eardrum out with a fork .If that 's not bad enough , there 's a country music song called \" A Heart Dies Every Minute , \" that 's played nearly as often and only pains the mind slightly less .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
