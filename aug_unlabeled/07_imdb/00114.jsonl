{"text": "Ironically , the half - dozen Three Stooges comedies Chase directed in the late-1930s ( Violent is the Word for Curly , Tassels in the Air ) are infinitely more accessible than any of Chase 's own starring films .Part Max Linder , part Lloyd \" Ham \" Hamilton , Chase 's screen persona emerged gradually and was n't refined until well after he went to work for Hal Roach in 1921 .He started there strictly as a director and gagman , helming the first Our Gang and Will Rogers comedies .Eventually though , Chase was lured back in front of the camera , though he directed or co - directed all his shorts , and continued supervising the shorts of other comedians until his untimely death .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Charley character was relatively handsome ( slicked - back hair , pencil mustache ) , dapper , and frequently well off .Like Harold Lloyd 's comedies , stories often revolved around Chase 's character falling in love , only to find himself in an embarrassing situation he nervously tries to wiggle out of .This Kino / Lobster Films compilation consists of six shorts , all one- and two - reelers , with a total running time of just under two hours , making this by far the shortest of the three \" Slapstick Symposium \" titles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The first three Charley Chase shorts are just okay , but the latter three are terrific , and come highly recommended .The Program .Mum 's the Word ( 1926 )This okay comedy casts Charley as the adult son of widow Virginia Pearson , who remarried into money but never told husband Anders Randolph about her son or previous marriage .To ease Charley into the new family , she orders Charlie to pretend to be her grumpy husband 's new valet , with expected results .The best thing about this short is the presence of pretty Martha Sleeper , who appeared in more than a dozen Chase comedies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Long Fliv the King ( 1926 ) Amusing short set mostly in the Kingdom of Thermosa .( Hey , where 's Harold Lloyd ?He became king of the same country in His Royal Slyness four years before . )After Princess Helga ( Martha Sleeper ) learns that her father has died , she must marry by midnight to ascend the throne and , given the circumstances , opts to we d death row inmate Charley , who to everyone 's surprise is pardoned .With Prime Minister Hamir of Uvocado ( Fred Malatesta ) wanting the throne for himself , he enlists the aid of henchman Oliver Hardy to discredit Charley .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "April Fool ( 1924 ) is fairly good , with Charley ( as Jimmy [ sic ] Jump ) a newspaperman who 's the victim of an endless stream of April Fool 's Day pranks .Charley 's cub reporter falls for the editor 's daughter in this unassuming comedy which offers a variation on the final gag in Helpmates ( 1932 ) , the classic Laurel & Hardy short .Mighty Like a Moose ( 1926 )One of Chase 's all - time best shorts is this classic two - reeler .Husband to wife Vivien Oakland , Charlie gets his enormous set of horse teeth fixed unbeknownst to Vivien , who does likewise with her giant Romanesque nose , which she has ground to a more appealing size .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The climax has Charley , in a marvelous bit of pantomime , pretending to be both the suave ladies man Vivien mistook her husband for and , using a duplicates set of false teeth , the outraged Charley .Crazy Like a Fox ( 1926 )This terrific short finds bachelor Charley preparing to meet for the first time his intended bride in an arranged marriage .Arriving at the station he instantly falls instead for Martha Sleeper , and like Hamlet pretends he 's insane hoping to get out of the marriage .In trying to convince everyone he 's nuts , Charley runs around dancing little jigs with wide - eyed mania , all quite funny .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( This begs the question of production dates : Was n't Hardy 's head shaved for the 1927 comedy The Second Hundred Years ?Which came first ? )Roach regulars Stanley \" Tiny \" Sandford , Charlie Hall , and Fred Kelsey ( playing -- what else ? -- a cop ) support this classic comedy .All Wet ( 1924 )This is a terrific one - reeler , really in the older , Mack Sennett style of slapstick than Chase 's best comedies for Roach , but funny and ingenious all the same .Charley , here in his Jimmie Jump character , is trying to meet a train at the station , but his Model T gets stuck in the muddy wastelands and empty lots that once were Culver City .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The IMDB lists Janet Gaynor as appearing in this short , but this reviewer did n't spot her .Video & Audio .Obvious care was taken with the presentation of these shorts , from the consideration to transfer them at the appropriate speed to the apparent effort to maximize the frame area ( see John Sinnott 's excellent review of the Stan Laurel shorts for more about this ) .In some cases , even a one- or two - shot snippet of film in good condition seems to have been inserted into less - pristine base elements .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The same holds true for April Fool which starts off in rough shape ( based on the size of the reel cues , it looks like a 16 mm print was sourced for part of this short ) but gets better as it goes along .As with the Lloyd shorts , there is no tinting or toning to the material , and each short has several chapter stops .The original music by Neil Brand is mostly good ; Mighty Like a Moose uses a score by Robert Israel .The names of the people responsible for these compilations are modestly shunted to the end of the last shorts , but warrant better billing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thanks ( presumably for assistance with obtaining film elements / images ) is given to Stan Taffel , David Shepard , Charles Vesce , Juan Vrijs , and Haghefilm Laboratories .Extra Features .The only extra , unfortunately , is a pretty good Photo Gallery .Background on individual films would have been a major plus .Parting Thoughts .The Charley Chase Collection is a good introduction to one of screendom 's lost comedians , a talented director - comic long overdue for broader recognition .One hopes this DVD will sell well and inspire the release of more silent shorts , as well as Chase 's often terrific sound comedies for Roach and Columbia , all deserving of compilations as good as this one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ridiculous that it 's taken this long to form an appreciation of this comic .For some reason I 'd found him a little bland before , but that was based on a few excerpts .Since some of Chase 's films have quite convoluted plots , they take more time to get going than the usual silent comedies , and there 's a slow - burn effect that does n't come across in clips .DOG SHY is another collaboration with Leo McCarey , whose farce plotting is comparable to PG Wodehouse .He would have been a great man to adapt \" Plum \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's a lot more to it than that , of course .Charley is trying to rescue a nice flapper from marriage to a dastardly Duke .But Charley is also deathly afraid of dogs .And the family dog is also called The Duke .The lady of the house instructs her new butler to give the Duke a bath .He 's a little surprised , but then , rich people are famously eccentric , are n't they ?She warns him that The Duke may offer resistance , and he should n't be afraid to use force .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His versatility as mime gets a good work - out here , and both the Duke 's incompehension and exasperation and Charley 's hilarity add immensely to the pleasures of the scene .Once he finally lures his prey into the bathroom , the ensuing struggle takes on some of the qualities of a homosexual rape , without , thankfully , any of the concomitant vulgarity .Of course , once the confusion is straightened out , Charley 's problem worsens , as the canine Duke ( played by \" Buddy \" ) , is much more intimidating and just as resistant to washing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even though this is a comedy , it 's easy to imagine such improbability cause irritation as much as amusement .As in MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE , Buddy gets the last laugh , offering a paw of congratulation to Charley upon his eventual triumph , then snapping at him when he attempts to accept it .We also watched ROUGH SEAS , a Chase talkie enlivened by Thelma Todd being cute as a French stowaway , and Napoleon the monkey being cute as a French monkey stowaway ( \" Remember how I found you on the battlefield ? \" asks doughboy Charley , and Josephine lies down and plays dead . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His voice and delivery seem to lower his social standing slightly , although some of that may just be the role he 's playing here .Rather than the middle - class man about town , he 's more of a blue - collar goof , and his \" Aw honey \" manner seems weirdly to be the inspiration for Bruce Campbell 's entire screen persona .Now that most all of Laurel & Hardy 's films are familiar to me , discovering Chase 's world seems like a new lease of life .A snippet of Charley Chase in MIGHTY LIKE A MOOSE .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'd seen a few CC films , even a few by Leo McCarey , but had n't been prepared for this film ( although I 'd been told it was excellent : I was n't sure whether to believe this ) .It has the silliest farce plot on record - .Charley is cursed with grotesque buck teeth .Children laugh at him in the street .His wife has a hideous great schnozz .But secretly , both have been saving for fix - ups .Charley sees the dentist in the same building his wife sees the rhinoplastician , and they meet on the way out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Charley has been invited to a wild party by his dentist ( even in the twenties , LA dentists apparently had a dodgy rep : they 're the guys with the legal cocaine , I guess ) so he invites his new sweetheart along .Standard farce near - misses in the marital home , including the dog bit above .But man and wife manage to avoid colliding , and reconvene as lovebirds on the street corner .But the party is raided by police - Charley and his sweetie flee , separate - and then he 's shocked to find her in his house !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anyhow , Charley figures out the truth before his wife does , and resolves to teach her a lesson , staging a knockdown fight between his husband self ( using the joke - shop teeth featured above ) and his lover self - lots of quick changes .It escalates in absurdity , and may actually be the equal of the mirror routine Leo McCarey borrowed from Max Linder and restaged to classic effect in DUCK SOUP .This is a familiar gag , also used by Linder , in fact , but again the impossibility is amped up to eleven .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
