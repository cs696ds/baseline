{"text": "Journey to Cinetopia .The energy of the inaugural Cinetopia International Film Festival was building to a high point at about 9 p.m. on Friday , June 1 , 2012 , as I listened to the final comments of Suzanne Lloyd , granddaughter of the famous silent film comedian Harold Lloyd .Inside the main auditorium of the Michigan Theater , Suzanne was finishing a slide show presentation about her grandfather 's life and career .You could hear a large crowd gathering in the Grand Foyer , waiting to see the 9:30 p.m. showing of Louder Than Love , a documentary about the rock scene in Detroit in the late 1960s and early 1970s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On that high note , the audience exited to the Grand Foyer , which was buzzing with anticipation for Louder Than Love .It was the kind of continuous energy that festival planners hoped for when they set up this four - day event .It started on Thursday , May 31 , and finishes on Sunday , June 3 , with screenings at the Michigan , the State Theater , and Angell Hall on the campus of the University of Michigan .Interestingly , my first encounter with Cinetopia was in a much quieter setting .The Michigan earlier hosted a 5 p.m. showing of the documentary Bestiaire , a quiet observation of animals and the people who interact with them in different ways .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You could quietly reflect on the simple lives of animals , and the patience and humility that they need to survive .I work at Domino 's Farm on the east side of Ann Arbor , where I enjoy observing the many animals on the grounds of that office complex and at the Domino 's Petting Farm .Those experiences added to my enjoyment of Bestiaire .Cinetopia builds on the relationship that the Michigan has developed in recent years with the Sundance Film Festival , which has used the Michigan to premiere movies that later played at Sundance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In that festival spirit , flags advertising Cinetopia lined the streets of Ann Arbor .It 's the kind of event that has many possibilities for growth and change , like other yearly Ann Arbor events , such as the summer art fairs and the Ann Arbor Film Festival .The festival name ( Cinetopia International Film Festival ) is unique enough to keep it from being confused with the Ann Arbor Film Festival , which is in March .The festival name also opens it up to expanding beyond Ann Arbor .Also , Cinetopia is presenting feature - length and story - based films in both English and foreign languages , while the Ann Arbor Film Festival includes shorter , more experimental movies than what Cinetopia is showing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And it also has the upbeat , dynamic atmosphere that has helped draw people to the AAFF .All of the Michigan staff members and volunteers that I saw at Cinetopia seemed to have a special level of energy and enthusiasm .A highlight of the weekend was a three - day tribute to Harold Lloyd that included feature films on Friday and Sunday , and several short comedies on Saturday .The tribute gave the Michigan the chance to show off two of its organists - Stephen Warner , who played the music for The Freshman ( 1925 ) on Friday , and Steven Ball , who accompanied the short films on Saturday and Safety Last !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I saw both of the features , but had to miss the short movies .As I watched It Happened One Night , listening to its witty dialogue that made full use of the soundtrack , I reminded myself that the silent The Freshman had been released less than 10 years before .It was a blessing of sorts that movies were silent long enough to produce the great work of Harold Lloyd and others , and then it was time for sound to come along and add new dimensions of expression .After The Freshman was shown , Michigan CEO and Executive Director Russ Collins sat down on stage with Harold Lloyd 's granddaughter Suzanne Lloyd for a discussion of her grandfather 's life and work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Safety Last ! featured leading lady Mildred Davis , whom Lloyd eventually married , and who was Suzanne 's grandmother .Suzanne also talked about the accident that had severely damaged Harold Lloyd 's right hand , and in Safety Last ! , you could see how well he had adapted to his handicap .His famous scene in Safety Last ! where he climbs the tall building and hangs from the broken clock was exciting enough , but was made even more impressive when you thought of what he had to overcome to perform the scene .Before the movie , organist Steven Ball asked the audience how many people were seeing their first silent film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "You 'll get to see the best , the worst , and the middle ground of my cinematic viewing year .Let 's see if you agree .Next thing is it will be posted on Filmstalker .Full details can be found right here on Filmstalker .Okay , so that 's all about your lists , let 's get back to mine and start with those five star films .Five Stars : Mission : Impossible - Ghost Protocol What an excellent film .The new Mission : Impossible delivers the best of the franchise and adds some superb additions , bringing a little more humour and reality to the characters and the events around them while ramping up the thriller side of the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However the strong thriller aspects of the franchise from the first film are back this is perhaps the best of the franchise to date .Could there be more ?Let 's hope so .Larry Crowne I know that quite a number of critics and reviewers did n't like this film but I loved the more realistic take on love and the superb comedy writing throughout and Julia Roberts character and performance .Whatever the reason Larry Crowne does actually deliver more than the usual Hollywood comedy and it had my wife and I laughing out loud throughout .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kristen Scott Thomas is fantastic and effortless as always but the real star is the story itself and just how powerful it becomes .It 's not just on the horrifying story of the events in Paris during the war , or Sarah 's amazing journey , or how the events affect her , but how that story spreads through generations and touches the lives of those looking back from the current day .A truly fantastic story filled with powerful performances .Apocalypse Now : Three Disc Blu - ray Three disc special , not just DVD discs but Blu - ray discs , think about how much content that means .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It certainly is that and the film really does stand up to time .Performances from the three key actors seem much better with time and with all the restored footage the story flows far deeper than it seemed to when I first saw it .I think more than anything I 've matured towards the film which is far ahead of its time .Add in all the extras and this is a stunning Blu - ray offering .However Paul did well to deliver both styles of comedy in one film and remain very funny for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Paul accomplished a lot for what it was sold as , and it delivers laughs and entertainment galore .Super 8 Super 8 promised a lot from the outset , J.J. Abrams directing a film that was executive produced by Steven Spielberg and promised to be a homage to the great Spielberg films , and it was .It was missing some of the finer relationship elements that really connected you to the characters however Spielberg did pour through the film and Abrams made a fantastic film that does a great job of capturing Spielberg 's magic and combining it with his own directing and storytelling talent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thor Thor really surprised me early on in production when Kenneth Branagh was chosen , and accepted , as the director .Suddenly the film was elevated up a level and was promising something more than I 'd been expecting , especially from a superhero that is down the popularity list as Thor .Oh I know he might be your favourite , but he is n't in the first few that the average person might tell you when you ask about the most popular superheroes .With the addition of Branagh it became something more epic , with much more grandeur and which matched the epic god - like characters in Thor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He gave us the superhero story , the action , and the epic nature of it all , and Thor suddenly became one of the top superheroes in film for me , and many others .Cell 211 What a film Cell 211 was .I saw it at the Glasgow Film Festival and it was one of these surprise films , one where you chose the film based on the blurb and some promise and it turns out to produce a great thriller for the audience .This is a great thriller which has an excellent premise and location and bags of tension which are layered on throughout the film as each section of the story is revealed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Here 's what I said in the original review : \" Even during the film three words started to come to me - beautiful , tender , and without sounding twee whatsoever , touching , immensely so .\" That sums it up perfectly especially followed with the line \" Every aspect of the film reflected those words for me , the script , the cinematography , and the performances , performances which are subtle , moving , and at times very powerful . \"Black Swan What an excellent film this turned out to be , although there was little doubt it was going to be amazing coming from Darren Aronofsky and carrying such a fantastic cast .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Once again it shows that Aronofsky is an amazing talent who just keeps producing stunning film after stunning film .In my review I mentioned that this was going to be one of the films of the year , despite the fact it was only January , and it turns out to be just the case .What 's more is that it 's a remake of a French thriller , and a remake from Hollywood , all of which usually spells disaster .However throw in Paul Haggis , a superb cast , and a script that delivers in parts where the original did n't , and we 're given a superb thriller .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Four Stars : The Thing Wow , did The Thing deliver .Of course there were problems and people compare this immediately to the John Carpenter film The Thing , which itself is held in a regard that is perhaps a little too high , still it 's a great film and the comparisons are hard to avoid .I enjoyed the film and thought it worked really well .Machine Gun Preacher It 's a shame that this film has been so overlooked as Gerard Butler gives a great performance and the film is a very powerful one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm not sure , but Butler 's performance is the draw here , that and the true story of the man he plays .It 's astounding to hear , and what surprised me is how much I was engaged by it .Manhunter The Blu - ray release of Manhunter was brilliant for fans of this Michael Mann film , and if you are n't a fan of the film you have to question why .Manhunter is a fantastic film as it is with brilliant pace and visuals and a cracking soundtrack to boot , and add in this new Blu - ray release and it brings a new lease of life to the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Warrior Two Rocky films for the price of one is what you could say about Warrior and yet you 'd be selling the film way too short .There 's an excellent performance to be had from Nick Nolte and strong performances from the rest of the cast in a stirring and tense film .I did enjoy the film , even if some of the closing turns were expected .Take Shelter I 'm not sure I 'm sold on the ending of the film , but Take Shelter has a superb script with the two leads of Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain delivering fantastic performances that are convincing and compelling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Julia 's Eyes ( Los ojos de Julia )A powerful thriller that really pulls you into the story and puts you in the place of the lead character , although there are some missed moments it has wonderful direction and cinematography and a great performance from the lead .The thriller will have you absorbed throughout .Cowboys & Aliens I think the studio head is a complete arse .There , I 've said it .Just imagine how all the people involved in this film feel now that he 's publicly ridiculed it .How would you like it if your boss told you your work for the last few years was rubbish and a waste of time , what would you think of him or her then ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film was a fun action adventure romp , and if you 're viewing it as anything else then perhaps you 've been sold the wrong film .Yes it was silly and there were flaws galore , but it was fun while it lasted .Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows : Part 2 I think I liked this so much more because it was n't the first film .Thankfully there was n't forty minutes of camping in great looking locations and looking at each other , and instead it got on and told the story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Oh how I wish they had spread it across films better .Night Music What a gem this was to find , a strongly scripted film that looked a lot bigger than it actually was , it felt more like a stage play than a film and it really engaged me in its tale of three people and their relationships .It concentrates on the characters , dialogue and performance and produces a stylish film that makes you think a lot more than most Hollywood films .An excellent little find that I 'd truly recommend .Hanna I only caught Hanna on DVD but I was glad I did because it is a great action thriller and it has an excellent style to it as well as some great performances from Saoirse Ronan and Cate Blanchett .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's an enjoyable action thriller with a rather unique character that perhaps deserves a sequel do n't you think ?It also shoes the interchangeable talents of Joe Wright .Animal Kingdom I think an excerpt from my review would be best suited here : \" ... some great writing and powerful performances .It 's a very bleak and at times disheartening film that smacks hard of the shocking truth of how actual events might play out , and they are n't the cinematic way that we 've been led to believe .Depressing at times , and downbeat , and all from the very beginning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" The Tunnel The Tunnel is special for a number of reasons ; the biggest one is that it 's free .I downloaded this and watched it without having to spend a penny as the film was funded during the production by the Internet audience , and you can still make donations should you enjoy the film .It could simply be described as Blair Witch in tunnels , and that does do it an injustice as it is a rather clever horror film that mixes a documentary interview style with hand held footage , and not the horrible Paranormal Activity style of forced hand held footage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well worth downloading and watching , it 's definitely in the top of the genre for the year .The franchise has certainly evolved and is suddenly looking as though it has another film in the bag , perhaps even more , without losing the audience it has gained and gaining more .Sucker Punch Some did n't like Sucker Punch and I 'm really not sure why .You know Snyder 's films are ones I really do want to own on Blu - ray and revisit , and when you see so many films as often as I do that 's rather rare .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Simon West directed the film well and Statham and Ben Foster worked well together and against each other .There 's a decent sense of a thriller in here too and I 'd like to revisit it .The Adjustment Bureau If I remember rightly The Adjustment Bureau is another film that did n't go down too well with reviewers and yet I liked .If I can remember back to why I think it was because a lot of people felt that they were a little too close to Bourne and expected something more akin to those films , that or they felt it did n't do Philip K. Dick justice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While the science fiction side could have had a little more weight in the latter part of the film , it did deliver well overall and I enjoyed it .Carancho This was another Glasgow Film Festival film that surprised me after not being certain what to expect from the festival blurb and reviews .It provided two strong performances from the lead and a well paced thriller that offers a lot of surprises .The Fighter The film was rather different to what I was expecting but in a really good way .It provides a strong characters and an engaging story that ranges from quirky to funny to exciting , and the fight scenes will deliver an emotional engagement which matches the rest of the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Immortals - Not yet reviewed A visual feast , as every Tarsem Singh film is , that had an exciting and engaging story to it .Is n't this was Clash of the Titans should have been ?Unfortunately it just lacked the power and impact that I hoped it would considering his previous films and the comparisons to 300 ( Filmstalker review ) .Still a very enjoyable and exciting film .Unfortunately it did n't quite deliver on the same level as the original but it certainly did deliver .This has more scope than the original , turning from the police and the drug gangs to the politicians and militias .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Still , it manages to be exciting , fascinating and scary at the same time .I Saw the Devil - Not yet reviewed Jee - woon Kim and Hoon - jung Park deliver a great thriller that will have you engaged in a battle between a government agent and a serial killer .Faster - Not yet reviewed I love a good action film , and I love Dwayne Johnson in full on Rock mode .However he 's been lost to the world of kids films something that all action stars seem to do in their career , but he came back with Faster and came back with his big guns flexing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Company Men - Not yet reviewed I loved the performances in this film from Ben Affleck , Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper .It 's a film that will resonate in many people 's minds especially if you have been made redundant at some point , and has a strong story to tell about our modern way of living and working .John Well 's story captured my emotions easily and I connected with the lead characters and their situations .A somewhat overlooked film that does n't deserve to be .Source Code - Not yet reviewed Ben Ripley should be given more credit for the screenplay for this , but it is clearly Duncan Jones ' vision that converts it to the big screen and gives it a great look and pace .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ink - Not yet reviewed Another smaller independent film that rises up the list here and for good reason , it 's a cleverly conceived idea with some startlingly good effects for such a small film .The story plays out well and is a nice cross between a dramatic thriller and a science fiction film , it builds well to an exciting conclusion and I 've seen it a few times now .One Star : Redacted Oh dear me , this was n't released during the year it was just that I saw it at this time and I have to tell you it 's really badly done and at the end it seems in rather poor taste .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Road I know I probably stand alone with this but I think the book and the film are two of the most overrated things I 've heard of or seen .Dull and uninteresting they provide no engagement .There are moments that are just left to slip through your fingers and I felt it was a waste of a potentially strong idea .Red Riding Hood - Not yet reviewed Looks nice , but it 's just dull and is more Twilight with a little more snarl .Gary Oldman was interesting to watch , and that 's about it really .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So those are Filmstalker Films of 2011 , the ones I 've reviewed or are awaiting reviewing anyway .There are a lot more films that I 've seen this year but they are n't all released in some form in 2011so I 've left the off the list .Any you disagree with ?Think a film should deserve a higher , or lower , rating than it did ?Well have your say below and correct me , or better yet submit your own Top List of the year .What of 2012 ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
