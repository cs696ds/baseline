{"text": "Quicklinks .Now that I 've had the opportunity to watch the film for myself , I found it a surprisingly tolerable if uneven comedy - and occasionally uproarious ; thankfully , the teenagers here are n't as obnoxious as in other films of its ilk .It also takes care to provide mild social commentary by having its characters stand up for a put - upon member of the Jewish community .Lots of Laughs .I 've been told that the Porky 's movies were films that portrayed Porky 's Hideaway in Ft .Lauderdale in the 50 's and 60 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It opened at 8PM and closed at 4AM and always had the best entertainment in South Florida .Porky Baines was nothing like the character playing him , but these films were great for lots of laughs .I have several of the Porky films and they are great entertainment .Enter the world of hilarity !This movie is the ultimate of comedy and sex .I 'm talking about Porky 's !This movie is incredibly raunchy as well as very funny at the same time .We have quite a few well known stars of today : Susan Clark & Alex Karras(Webster ) ; the vivacious Kim Cattrall(Mannequin and the ever popular \" Sex & The City ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The burly black guy was about to blow the whole thing , with his snickering and he later does his part with the machete at the horny little dogs .The second one was the sexual interaction with the two coaches when Cattrall 's character howls .I could n't stop laughing .You thought that was bad , the male organ was the tops of the laugh fest for me .My insides was about to go BOOM !After seeing it all , the entire movie was not boring at all .It was funny , it left me in stitches !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Rating 4 out of 5 stars !Ca n't find something to laugh out loud about ?You 're obviously dead .It 's completely adolescent in every way .It 's entirely rude and somewhat crude .It 's high - school , folk(s ) .Yet you will be compelled to laugh out loud .I 've seen this monster more than 5 times and I still get teary eyed .Interestingly the situations by themselves are only mildly funny , but the spin and nuance the actors / actresses apply to their characters transforms what could have been ever so much more lame into over - the - top hilarity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You feel it and sense the great fun the cast had doing it .This movie gels in every way .The same thing was attempted in ' Porky 's 2 ' and seemed forced - which translated into a rather lame follow - up .Not for the easily offended or naive .Ultimately the driving force for nearly everything in the plot is sex .Yes , there 's nudity but it does n't get past a high PG-13 or low R , IMO .Also of interest is there does n't seem to be an abundance of foul language .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm not going to even cite examples from this movie .It would take too long and you 're better off just going out and viewing it .Even if I told you what happens it would n't spoil a thing anyway - and that is what makes this an all - time classic .In fact , ' Porky 's ' is a lot like sex - if you do it once you 'll eventually do it again .Worth repeated viewings ! !Do it and do it again .Outrageous Fun .The Lads plot their revenge , and implement a plan to destroy the nightclub , but what happens to Pee Wee that 's his last chance , is n't it ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Everyone who has ever seen this movie seems to remember it in great detail .Chuck \" Porky \" Mitchell is an action figure that will always be remembered by the audience for his very real portrayal of a \" river entrepreneur \" .This is a movie you will NOT forget .It is a \" peoples movies \" , not for the faint of heart .It borders on being an \" Art Film \" .The photographic quality of this move alone sets it apart from most other films .It appears to have been shot on real locations , not in a studio lot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you are a ballet fan or a classical music fan , you will doubtless NOT want to view this film .If you are a \" Red Stater \" politically , you will find this movie to be a must see - several times at least .It embodies the spirit of the Television Series \" Happy Days \" , except with a bit more edge , especially regarding the moral climate in which \" shotgun weddings \" were in vogue .It is one of those \" FEEL GOOD \" movies that has a mostly happy ending and makes the viewer crave more .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A good way at losing your naivety ... ! ! !I first saw PORKY 'S at a time when my fellow school pupils seemed to be one up on me when it came to matters of nocturnal pleasure .I was a late developer , certainly when it came to girls as a whole and I have to admit that I probably would have been a lot like Pee Wee in being foolish around sex .As it stands , PORKY 'S is a great teen movie and one which clearly inspired the likes of AMERICAN PIE in terms of teen stupidity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "funniest movie I have ever seen .I thought Porky 's was the funniest movie I have ever seen .I liked it because they are all friends playing tricks on each other .I mean , who does n't do that .I have always played tricks on my friends .It made me laugh .That 's why I enjoyed it so much .Laughing is my most favorite thing to do .I 'm 28 and still playing tricks .I love to laugh .All the characters made me laugh .I like comedy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is funnier than American Pie .That 's only my opinion .I laughed throughout the whole movie .I still watch it .It 's fun to joke around with your friends .I loved this movie .It still makes me laugh and have a good time .My dad loves this movie .It 's just a bunch of teenagers playing tricks on each other .It 's the greatest !One of the worst movies ever made .Honestly , it is .I do n't have a problem with low - brow , gross - out humor , but I expect a movie to have at least one redeeming quality - a likable character , an unpredictable plot , good one - liners , or , at the very least , funny jokes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It may indeed be the ultimate teen sex comedy in that it adheres to every possible clich\u00e9 to the letter .If you want a hilarious comedy centered around horny young people doing dumb things and trying to get laid - compare and contrast Animal House , released only four years before .That 's a real comedy .Porky 's is real trash .Excellent .I first saw this film because my mum recommended it as funny .I watched it and thought i wish i d have been in that movie .It must have been so much fun to film the cast are all hillarious and the mischievous characters are amazing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
