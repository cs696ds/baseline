{"text": "Effects are decent , characters are charming and the action is gripping .Yet , the narrative is disjointed and all over the place .Clearly a real rookie for a director .Had this been given to a more experienced director , it would likely have at least been good , not excellent , but good .TL;DR A good bad action movie that is hardly taking itself seriously , while featuring one of the most prominent characters in American history .Abraham Lincoln stars as a normal man turned vampire slayer bent on revenge , until he discovers an even more insidious plot in America .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Abraham Lincoln stars as a normal man turned vampire slayer bent on revenge , until he discovers an even more insidious plot in America .The idea in itself would make perfectly fine sense in any other world but once you slap it in colonial America , its absurdly ridiculous .It does n't help that the action is so overly nonsensical at times that you ca n't help but laugh at how silly it is .There is no amazing dialogue here , and the delivery is subpar , but there will be moments that make you smile and laugh .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
