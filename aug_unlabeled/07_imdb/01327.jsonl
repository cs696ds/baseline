{"text": "I still think Fairuza Balk 's beautiful though .I only wanted to see it cuz she stars in it and because it was based on a story / song by Lou Reed called \" The Gift \" off the album White Light / White Heat .Great song .Lou Reed 's great .It 's not THAT bad ... .This is by no means a great film , but I do n't think that it 's nearly as bad as the other reviews posted about it .It 's a simple little movie with a couple of funny scenes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As always I enjoyed Jeffrey Jones and I really liked Noah Taylor who I do n't believe I 've seen before .I did feel that Tea Leoni was wasted though , she can be very funny and she should have had better scenes .I watched it last night and enjoyed it .It 's as simple as that .Well worth a rental .The story is not predictable , every time I thought they were going to resort to a cliche , the film zips off in another direction .Although neither the acting or plot are brilliant , it has does have a few laughs , and it held my interest until the very end .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well worth a rental .Life in the Fast Lane .Noah was very good in this also .He brings new life to whatever role he 's given , and although he usually plays the melancholy dramatic lover or boy next door , he enjoys playing some more lighthearted comedic roles .I think he 's fantastic in this , and was interested that he also joined up with Fairuza in Almost Famous .I adore him in this role , even though this movie sometimes left a little to be desired here .A little off the edge or over the top , it 's got some good qualities to it , and some good lines .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But as a Noah Taylor fan , I definitely enjoyed it .Fairuza Is The Only Good Thing .Life in the fast lane or there 's no fish food in heaven or whatever the hell you call it is about a frustrated artist Mona ( Fairuza Balk ) .She has this boyfriend Jeff ( Noah Taylor ) who she has known forever and she does n't really appreciate him .Suddenly Mona thinks she 's going crazy because whenever she draws something , her painting really comes true .Suddenly she starts seeing this stranger who she can not resist and has sex with him whenever she gets the chance too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When Mona tries to open the box , she accidently stabs Jeff in the head and kills him .Now the spirit of Jeff follows Mona around everywhere and wo n't leave her alone unless she can find his body again .This was n't really funny although it is considered a comedy , the only reason i even rented this movie was because of Fairuza Balk who I am in love with .I would give Life In The Fast Lane 5/10 .A dark romantic comedy that is n't very funny or romantic .Obviously the film is supposed to be a whimsical romantic comedy - with a dark edge to it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The plot moves along at a fairly slow pace .The main characters are not that interesting .It does n't really rise above the level of \" offbeat \" or \" quirky \" .The \" story arc \" is predictable after awhile .And , most importantly , It just was n't that romantic , funny , or original .I rented it ( under the title , \" Life in the Fast Lane \" ) mainly because Fairuza Balk is in it .I wish she had a better story and script to work with .The film is mediocre at best .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The IMDB plot summary erroneously makes it sound like it is Noah Taylor 's movie , when Fairuza Balk is the central character .It is unbelievable how such a cast of established actors could have been in such an amateurish , pointless , non - movie .Balk breaks up with Boyfriend Taylor , sleeps with the Devil ( I guess - played by Dempsey ) , and accidentally kills Taylor -- who follows her about for the rest of the movie as a ghost .May be the worst movie I have ever seen .Let the title be a warning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is an example of how the term \" filmmaker \" can be applied to any anxiously naive fool with some video equipment and enough capital to ( at least at the time ) pay for the film stock .Therefore , movies like this are a waste of both time and money .Movies like this help help bring ruination to an actor 's career or relegate them to second - class \" B \" status .Rather than even attempting to discuss the plot , I want to instead ( for whoever is reading ) relate an anecdote .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not a Blockbuster , but an actual video store , a Mom ' n Pop video store .Like all private businesses , you ca n't afford to keep up with the competition , and in order to carry a full inventory , we would supplement our selection with independent cinema , for better or worse .This movie was one of those titles .I remember thinking this was one of those quirky , meet - cute comedies that would be ridiculous , indeed , but somehow parasitically enjoyable .I watched about fourteen minutes of the film before I realized I had been had .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unable to resist , I asked her what she thought about the movie .The woman , a 40-something soccer mom , politely asked : \" Can I have my money back ?The other guy said this movie was hilarious .\" I was n't the manager , but I obliged her and gave her the $ 2.65 refund .I did this not because she rented the movie , but because she actually watched the whole thing .The young and hopeful aspirations of an entire filmmaking population could benefit from watching this film ( indeed , countless more like it ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "not too artsy .I do n't like movies where the girl leaves the guy who does n't do anything wrong within the relationship .That is just because I am insecure .Aside from that this is a pretty good movie .It is surreal at times , but does n't go to far and become pretentious art schlock .If you are looking for something weird and fun , think about this one .Apparently Hell was on my television .This flick , which is a.k.a . \"Life In the Fast Lane \" is easily one of the least entertaining movies I 've seen in a long time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The characters are all one - dimensional , even the lead .After she stabs her boyfriend in the head with some scissors , a cheap laugh is attempted ( and unsucceeds ) by sticking a cork in the boyfriend 's skull to stop the bleeding .Oh , clever !Patrick Dempsey ( whose movies are almost always a class act --sarcasm ) plays this \" devil \" who changes her life - but from what we 've seen , her life was this series of vignettes to begin with .No emotion , no laughs , no story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
