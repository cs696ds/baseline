{"text": "Luis Bu\u00f1uel .Often referred to as the father of cinematic surrealism , director Luis Bunuel was born February 22 , 1900 , in the Aragon region of Spain .While studying at the University of Madrid , he became friends with painter Salvador Dali , poet Federico Garcia Lorca and other Spanish artists .Bunuel entered the film world with a bang in 1929 with the 17-minute Un Chien Andalou , a collaboration with Dali that shocked audiences with its image of a woman 's sliced eyeball .Bunuel , a Jesuit - educated atheist , followed this with his first feature , L'Age D'Or , which many saw as a scathing attack on the Catholic Church .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Bunuel died July 29 , 1983 .Milos Stehlik looks at harsh living conditions for children .Perhaps the most influential film of all time is Vittorio de Sica 's Bicycle Thieves .This Italian neo - realist masterpiece is the story of a poor man and his two children who gets a job putting up posters .It 's a job he ca n't perform without a bicycle , and when his bicycle is stolen , his son Bruno and friends go in search of the bike through Rome .Four years after it was made , it was voted as the greatest film of all time by a poll of critics by the British film magazine Sight and Sound .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Pixote was a huge international success .After the making of the film , Babenco faced the moral dilemma of what to do with the boy - Fernando - whom he cast in the role by literally pulling him off the streets .Despite attempts to help him go to school , Fernando was accidentally shot and died on the streets of Sao Paolo at the age of 19 .Despite the often violent and brutal circumstances in which the child characters in Latin American films live , there is a marked shift from depicting as victims .Instead , it seems natural that kids are artificially and brutally forced into adult roles and decisions by the cruel circumstances of their lives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "For these children , life no longer has any meaning , and the pulling of a trigger is the most expedient means of survival .All these films owe much to Luis Bunuel 's great 1950 masterpiece Los Olvidados .Bunuel , the Spanish surrealist , creator of the legendary Un Chien Andalou and L'age D'or , went to Mexico after a stint in America spent dubbing Hollywood films into Spanish .In the low - low - budget world of 1950s Mexican cinema , Bunuel applied his sophisticated artistry to focus on a teenage gang in Mexico City .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His film is a search for evil which creates the brutal conditions in which criminality becomes the only outlet in urban society .Los Olvidados is as relevant to the conditions of some American cities today as it was to Mexico when it was made on a shoestring budget in 1950 .Yet the film 's timeless brilliance rests in the acuteness of its analysis : loneliness and alienation give reign to fear and terror .One boy in the gangr , Jaibo , kills an older boy , Julien in a rage and Jaibo seduces the mother of Pedro .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Believers flock around him , other holy men revere him , and Simon shares the lessons he 's learned with them all .As the film opens , a grateful patron is moving Simon from his simple pedestal to a fancier , taller tower that has been erected in his honor -- an earthly reward for his persistent pursuit of divinity .Perhaps it is the acceptance of this gift , or perhaps it 's the auspicious and evil number inlaid in the duration of Simon 's meditation , but the devil has now come to the desert to try to lure Simon down from his place of worship .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Satan also takes possession of a jealous priest to try to shake the people 's belief in Simon through lies .These efforts fail , only giving the target more strength : Simon makes his vigil tougher , swearing to stand on only one leg .For a notorious prankster who often had a laugh at the expense of organized faith , Bunuel portrays Simon 's spiritual mission with the utmost respect .He still ca n't resist having a go at the false worshippers and dishonest holy men , however , showing how the gathered take advantage of Simon 's miracles and how many priests are only coming to give tribute for the sake of appearances .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And we do see that Simon is authentic because we see his temptations and his renunciation of the same .This does n't just include the ones brought forth by Satan -- though those are brought to life with showmanship and rather good special effects -- but also the ones that creep into Simon 's mind via normal trains of thought .Like Scorsese 's portrait of Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ , Simon sees himself in more normal surroundings , accepting love and family as his own , but he banishes such thoughts from his mind in affirmation of his faith .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "\" You may have been right , \" he seems to say to Simon , \" but what good has it done you ?The other side won anyway . \" Video : This Criterion edition of Simon of the Desert is presented in a full frame 1.33:1 aspect ratio , picture boxed so that on widescreen televisions there will be black bars on all four sides of the image .The picture quality is excellent , with good black - and - white values and solid resolution .There is some grain that is indicative of the age of the material , and the occasional section that might have a little damage , but hardly anything worth noting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
