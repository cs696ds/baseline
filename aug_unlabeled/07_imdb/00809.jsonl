{"text": "Movie Recommendation of the Week : Running Scared .Ah yes , this is taking me back to when I was a kid .The movie Running Scared was on cable for at least 3 weeks during the month of September and I had to share it with you guys here .Those of you that are younger probably have n't seen this movie so I 'm recommending it to you today .I 've got two words for you \" Michael McDonald \" and \" Roller Skates .\" OK that 's not what the movie is about at all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They play two fairly young Chicago cops who want to get out of the racket and open a bar in Miami .Their last assignment is a drug dealer they though they 'd pinned a while back ( played by a young Jimmy Smits ) .It 's classic 80s action drama / comedy .And the dude who played Uncle Rico from Napolean Dynamite is in it !Haha .Seriously though , it 's a great movie and yes , it features Michael McDonald music as well as Crystal and Hines riding on 4 wheel old school roller skates .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "About The Author .I 'm into 80s movies like Rocky IV , video games like Double Dribble , and completely ignoring everything past the year 2000 .Batttmaan .i have seen this running scared , and the one in 06 with paul walker lol .James .Nice recommendation .This truly is an overlooked \" Buddy - Cop \" film .The on - screen chemistry between Hines and Crystal is great .You 're right , the music and clothes are funny .I recall going to the fair a couple of years after I saw this film ( back in the 80s ) and seeing M. McDonald playing his contributing track live .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
