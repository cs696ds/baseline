{"text": "The casting of a recently revitalized ( at the time ) John Travolta ( Pulp Fiction , Grease , Phenomenon ) as the film 's lead added Travolta 's charm to the role .All that was left was to surround him with a talented and versatile cast , and then sit back to enjoy the ride .The Evidence .Seemingly a bit separated from his other films , Sonnenfeld approached Get Shorty in largely the same manner he would handle later work .Assemble a great group of actors , take a strong script , then handle lightly and allow to rise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Since the money men call the shots , both are important reasons for the success of Sonnenfeld .The strengths of Get Shorty are the cast , which is quite up to the task of a Leonard story , and the biting celebrity satire liberally sprinkled throughout the script .While his stories can sometimes become entertainingly convoluted , Leonard always knows how to create interesting characters .With Get Shorty , the story revolves around a charming mob collector .Chili Palmer is a veteran mobster , easy going but very intent on his actions .Travolta provides Chili with a charming smile and an appealing energy that bring the character fully to life in a natural , easy manner .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even when forced to get physical , Chili is always cheerful , apologetic , helpful .Working out of Miami , Chili has a bit of a running feud with a rival mob figure , Ray \" Bones \" ; they do n't seem to get along very well .After the boss who Chili worked for dies of natural causes , Chili finds himself under Bones ' thumb .Bones takes delight in upbraiding Chili , and also assigns him to track down an elusive debtor who supposedly died in a plane crash .Chili ends up pretty quickly in California , certain the welcher is alive and living the life of a high roller on the money he owes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Zim certainly has no idea how things work in the real world when mob maneuverings come into the picture .Rather than rough Zim up , Chili decides to check out LA for a time , poke around a little in the movie business .Chili is a big old movie buff , especially the old classic films of yesteryear .Zim , of course , has bumbled himself into bigger problems than the book he does n't know Chili 's supposed to collect from him .And then things really start taking off .All Leonard stories tend to be difficult to summarize , and Get Shorty is more so than other of the Leonard screen work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sonnenfeld keeps the film moving , keeps it quirky and light , always with a new twist or odd bit of something to ensure you 're onboard .As the story plays out , you find yourself watching just to find out what happens to Chili , who is an eminently appealing character in the hands of Travolta .Yes , there are the inevitable Leonard twists .But this film is also something most other Leonard adaptations are n't ; extremely satiric .Much is said about \" Hollywood \" and \" The Movie Business , \" as the characters interact and move around .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There was also the matter of Superman 's origin story being sort of like Batman 's but involving a tornado and some very poor decisions , but I guess that worked too .It did feel on occasion that the amount of backstory early on and the amount of action later did n't leave much room for drama in the present .I think the movie might have been better had they done this , but at nearly 2 1/2 hours run time , I suspect it existed at one point and was cut .Here 's hoping it shows up on DVD .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've been playing John Williams ' Superman Theme from the old movies for my son and he 's barely even interested in Superman and it makes us both fly around the house making whooshing noises .I think Hans Zimmer 's score would have been just fine in any other movie franchise , but Superman deserves something that makes you want to stand with your chest out and elbows pointed to the side .I remember endlessly humming that music as a kid during countless backyard super - adventures .For me , a movie could be really good , but it never locks in my memory forever without a great theme .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'd heard a few reviews say Man of Steel was \" good , but not great \" .I 'm probably going to throw my hat into this ring as well , but it 's really good .I 'm happy that I did n't have much to complain about , but the pacing was a little weird and I would have liked a little more emotional tension between the characters ( even at the expense of a few buildings staying upright ) .And no iconic music .ARRRGH .All that said , I 'm comfortable saying this is probably the best big - budget Superman movie in existence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Warner Bros. is seeing dollar signs after Marvel 's massive success with Iron Man and The Avengers , and they have reportedly fast - tracked the sequel for 2014 - and a Justice League movie ( both with Cavill as Superman ) for 2015 .Insane timeframe aside , I seem to recall WB closing up shop on their Batman franchise just last year , and I 'll be impressed if each member of the JLA gets their own movie and it 's not unbelievably crappy .This is something that needs time to do right .I hope they do it , but I 'd bet money what we get next is Jack Black in a Mxyzptlk costume and Superman having to disguise himself as an old lady to infiltrate a sorority house .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As for theme music - has anyone really done theme music in a while ?It seems like even the King of Theme John Williams stopped doing real strong theme music quite a bit ago as well .I 'm a big fan of movie soundtracks , but it seems like it 's been forever since we had strong themes versus just atmospheric soundtracks .Good memorable themes like those in Star Wars , Superman , Indiana Jones , Jurassic Park , E.T. , Jaws , etc . just do n't seem to be around as much .Maybe some of the LotR stuff might qualify , or Inception 's slowed down music , but maybe as opening credits dissipated into nothing more than a title , iconic theme music disappeared with them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was the subtler moments that conveyed the awe of Superman 's world that worked for me ( and they are all moments I can easily see other people feeling nothing from ) .Little things like after the oil rig , zoning out and coming to with the whales drifting by just hit me with this \" he will experience things we never can \" vibe .Or the sappy feeling the sunlight and reaching for it moments and the 2 dad 's speeches , did it for me .But my only real issue agrees with what you said : \" I would have liked a little more emotional tension between the characters ( even at the expense of a few buildings staying upright ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've been debating whether to see it or not , and this has made up my mind for me that I will indeed go check it out .I feel like you really gave me a sense of what to expect without giving away too much - of course I did n't read the paragraph specifically dealing with plot .I was hesitant to see Man of Steel because I have been of the mindset of , \" Why another reboot ?It 's like the Hulk all over again .Or Spider - Man .\" -Still have n't brought myself to watch that last reboot- \" Can we please stop with all the recycled origin stories and MOVE ON with these franchises ? ! ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I adored the original ' 80s Superman pictures , but I also kind of liked the Routh / Spacey movie .Made me feel like a kid again .It was cheesy like those older ones , plus I saw it at a drive - in theater .Man of Steel looks like it wo n't provide the same fascination .Too much flash & pow and not enough substance .Same reason I still have n't seen the new Trek movie .It 's too busy compared with the old ones that I love so much .To me it 's not true to the originals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Going to the movies - especially action or sci - fi movies - is an exercise in audience overstimulation and the oversaturation of CG .Nothing is ever low - key or subtle anymore .Even the Great Gatsby was turned into a smack - you - in - the - face cacophony of chaos ( of course , I 'd expect no less from Baz Luhrmann ) .I do n't know .It 's like the audience does n't have to use its imagination and invest anything of themselves in the films anymore .That makes me nostalgic for simpler times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
