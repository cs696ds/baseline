{"text": "It is based on a book , and I suspect the book is far better than the movie .The problems with the film begin with poor pacing and an underdeveloped script .Were it not for Rachel McAdams , I would never have believed in the romance at all .Now , it is not surprising that sex scenes are the only way that Hollywood seems to know to \" show \" love , but , in real life people , have sex without love all the time .Bollywood develops romance without sex by developing characters and by displaying acts of sacrifice and commitment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "but I digress .The first half of the film seems to set the story , and the second half starts to become interesting , and yet I still felt incomplete .The potential for a great movie was there , but as it was filmed , it was a tedious plodding of time slipping and nude scenes with a poignant ending .As our hero slips in and out of time , he is supposed to look different ages , but only once did he really appear different to me .The rest of the time he looked the same age .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Only once did a smattering of gray hairs effect his appearance .For the Christian viewer , the movie poses several problems .The first is nudity .For some reason , the idea of traveling through time nude has become a science fiction cliche .Exactly why this is has never been explained .Nevertheless , each time he travels through time he appears naked and must steal clothes .In one case , he steals women 's clothes and gets into a fight with a \" homphobe . \"His wife also shows her behind in one scene , as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Politically , the movie is largely neutral , although there is a joke about marrying into a \" bad family .\" We are told , \" her father is a Republican ... AND a hunter ! \"Disgusted , they decide to be \" tolerant , \" but this foreshadows something that happens later in the film , which could easily be taken as a slap shot at hunters .Now this is by no means a bad film ... just an incomplete one .By that I mean that the movie feels incomplete to me .Rachel McAdams made me believe in the love story , but the script never did .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The rather poignant ending redeems the film to some degree , and I am sure that the film will find its niche among some fans , but I can not give it a thumbs up ... especially for Christian audiences .Far better , and more believable love stories ( I am not referring to the science fiction element , but the love story itself ) have been made over the years .Wait until DVD for this one .Negative -This movie is extremely depressing and unsettling .I thought that this movie would be an interesting romance / drama .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The premise of this movie is that a man , with a gene which causes him to time travel , comes in and out of the life of his true love .Unfortunately , the movie focuses on the miserable and unavoidable parts of the man 's life .It opens with the death of him mother , and closes with his own premature death .In between is a surprising amount of nudity , law breaking , and sexuality .Part of the problem with the main character 's time traveling is that he can not take his clothes with him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Though this is only shown from the rear , it still occurs over and over throughout the movie .Female rear nudity is also shown , along with foreplay leading to premarital sex .The main character repeatedly steals and breaks into buildings to provide himself with clothes during his time travels , and he teaches his young daughter ( also a time traveler ) the skills needed to steal .The movie seems to approve of the occurring sex and lawlessness , portraying it as necessary and right .All in all , the movie was a dark and deeply flawed drama that I could not recommend to any fellow Christian .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Positive -I was surprised to find the negative comments here .I think it 's a beautiful love story , and very nicely handled .All in all , though , I pack the hankies , it 's an emotional flick !( I still cry when he tells his mom that he met a girl )The nudity is barely noticeable - no \" private parts \" showing .It should be obvious that if one 's body travels the clothes get left behind .( Standard \" scientific \" principle ! )It adds a bit of comic relief to a serious condition .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I like the way storytellers make these things happen for a reason in peoples lives .His travels seem to take him to lessons he needs at that time .[ If we pay attention , God gives us lessons as we need them , too .] I did n't notice any big use of profanity .when he disappears at inopportune times , and MODIFIED use of the \" F\"-word ] There 's a lot of positive life - lessons here .I like this movie a lot .I have not read the book , but from what I 've heard , I think I 'll stick to the condensed movie version .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Positive -This movie was amazing !I ca n't believe how good it was !Although he travels without his clothes , there is only one moment where they show him nude , and it 's only from the back .There is no \" sex \" scene at all .They show them kissing and then the next seen is they wake up in bed together , and that 's it .Nothing more than that .He makes every decision based on what he believes is best for his wife , and puts her first .There are funny moments , and sad moments , but over all , amazing amazing movie !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My Ratings : Moral rating : Excellent ! / Moviemaking quality : 5 -Torie , age 20 ( USA ) .Positive -I thought the move was what most people expected it to be .no it was not the best , but it was a good movie despite some minor flaws .This next part mainly applies to Chris .I do n't know if you hunt at all , but things like getting shot / hit happen , and its a risk one takes while hunting or being in an area where hunting takes place , whether unintentional or not . chances are , it was not the knock you want to make it out to be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There was some unnecessary language .I 'll never understand why any film must include vulgarities .The English language is certainly vast enough to never need to resort to a curse word .I did not see any sex , although it was implied .Although I do not condone pre- or extra- sex , I was not \" offended \" .I appreciated not having to watch or hear a sexual act in progress .I saw where the reviewer commented on the traveler 's inability to take his clothes with him .Although time travel is the stuff of science fiction I could see the plausibility here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It would be a lot less scientific if his genetic gift extended to his clothing and jewelry .I enjoyed the movie very much .It was sad and happy at the same time and creative about the elements of the time travel .I highly recommend it to Time Travel aficionados .My Ratings : Moral rating : Average / Moviemaking quality : 5 -Jeff Mazza , age 55 ( USA ) .Neutral -I saw this movie with my girlfriend , and her family .Some of my Teen Sunday School class were also at the theatre .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The time travelers wife is a good movie showing the trials of the unexpected on a marriage .Without the Sci - Fi element , mental illness and cancer could have accomplished the same trials .The first half of the movie is confusing .I heard so many times : \" What ?How ?When ? \"Later the movie hits issues .like living for each other , miscarriages , effects of one - party decisions .This could have been a Sci - Fi \" Fireproof , \" but instead you get a garbled mess which does actually turn into a beautiful tale of marriage and family survival ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Negatives : here we go ! first 10 minutes of the movies we have naked behinds ; pre - marital sex on first date ; having to hide liquor bottles from his date .That does improve dramatically .( it would have to ! )Bad swearing , mostly when the time traveler is in trouble .no f - bombs .but my Savior 's name used in some very vulgar variations !For adults with strong Faith , a good date movie .But I wanted to duct tape my Youth kids ' eyes and ears shut !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "And it is true that when he time traveled , it 's his body and not the clothes on him , therefore when he arrived at the other end , he would be naked and hungry .As for Clare Abshire , she had known Henry since the age of six by stumbling upon him in one of his bout and watched him vanished before her very eyes , she had come to love him and devoted patience with his time traveling of coming and going .Some point in time , she can even tell if it was the young Henry of yesterday or the older and future Henry .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My Ratings : Moral rating : Average / Moviemaking quality : 1 -Mang Yang , age 37 ( USA ) .Neutral -Although the storyline seems exciting , I was left wanting .There were a few offensive scenes ; premarital sex , nudity , some foul language , the fighting of the \" homophobe \" and the constant stealing of clothing .Most of these were quick and minimal compared to a vast majority of films .I agree that without the acting of Rachel McAdams , I may have missed the allure of a love story .You never really got that connection from Eric Bana .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Though he confessed his devotion and did all that he could later on to make their relationship tranquil , it did n't quite reach the potential .The mental picture of the embryo time traveling out of the mother was very upsetting as well .Overall , tolerable , but not one to see twice .I believe the movie could have been executed differently .My Ratings : Moral rating : Offensive / Moviemaking quality : 2\u00bd -Jessica , age 30 ( USA ) .Neutral -I liked this film .I thought the idea of it was very neat - a man who is a time traveler , and the girl that he is in love with , who eventually becomes his wife .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some parts of this film are just confusing , and the only explanation as to why he travels through time is because it is a \" genetic disorder .\" I am sure that the book explains it better , as the novels usually do .The nudity did n't bother me , because he is a time traveler , and therefore , he can not bring clothes with him when he travels through time .Just a side note , for those Christians that may be offended by this .This is not the first time that stories have had a character who travels naked .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I did n't care for some of the language , and I also did n't care for the scenes of them together in bed .I 'm not sure why Hollywood has to throw in a sex scene in a movie .I think many of us know that when a husband and wife love each other , love - making happens , but I personally am not okay with seeing it in a movie .Overall , this is a very interesting movie .It 's obviously geared more towards ladies , as it is a chick flick that requires tissues .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Negative -My girlfriend and I are both Christians and are waiting until marriage before we consummate our relationship , which is biblical .She likes \" chick flicks , \" and she has seen two sci - fi movies with me thus far this summer so I promised I would go see this with her .As a Christian and an experienced moviegoer , I had a few problems with this film .Self explanatory .It gets a little annoying .Did anyone even consider that it might be just a \" little weird \" or even strange to have a grown man suddenly appear naked in front of a little girl ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There were times where he appeared curled up naked on the floor of their house in front of the whole family , including his daughter .The naked - time - travel - plot - device thing worked with Kyle Reese in \" Terminator \" for a specific reason , but it does n't apply here . duh .As Christians we are called to enter through the narrow gate , and that means putting Jesus first in our lives , not political parties .Anybody who did n't catch this sick joke is clearly not paying attention .Near the end of the film there is a scene where Harry 's daughter is with him and she is trying to teach him that He can learn to stop time traveling by singing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
