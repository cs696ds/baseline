{"text": "For children of the 90s , a lamb chop was more than just a tasty cut of meat .It ( well , she ) was also a fluffy little sheep puppet who , along with an afro - ed Shari Lewis and her delightful puppet barnyard peers , entertained us through the magic of once - worthwhile public television .A brief ( read : lazy ) investigation into Lamb Chop 's history reveals a frightening amount of spare time amongst pop - culture Wikipedia updaters .The \" Lamb Chop 's Play - Along \" entry actually links to a categorical page entitled \" fictional sheep \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fictional sheep .Our esteemed lamb puppet pal was obviously in good company .In case you were wondering ( which no doubt you were ! ) , the Wikipedia entry opens with the compelling phrase,\"this is a list of fictional sheep \" .It then goes on to list more than thirty fictional sheep .You may be saying to yourself , what is a person who diligently maintains a blog devoted to frivolous 90s novelties doing mocking a harmless list composed by loving devotees ?Certainly even she recognizes her hypocrisy .Other fictional sheep aside , the true star was Lamb Chop .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
