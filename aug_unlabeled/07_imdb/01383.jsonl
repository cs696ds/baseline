{"text": "Joan Fontaine plays the insecure woman with almost embarrassing humility , overhearing her parents and the locals dismiss her as a wallflower .The first act is a predictable Cinderella story in which she blooms from wearing tweed suits and librarian 's glasses to being the belle of the ball .Cary Grant 's so - called dramatic work as Johnnie requires him to continue his charming playboy act while the script casts doubts on his honesty and motivations .Most everything is seen from Lina 's POV , yet the contrived script forces her to behave like a prize dumb bunny , assuming the best about Johnnie despite evidence that would try anyone 's patience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lina gets a fancy house and a maid who does n't even seduce Johnnie .When the locals gossip about Johnnie 's dishonest ways , Lina weathers their veiled insults in good form - but she never calls Johnnie to account for himself .Feminists found plenty of ammunition in a story about a wife who does n't know the first thing about her catch - of - a - lifetime husband .Johnnie has no money and does n't intend to earn any .He pushes the two of them deep into debt , lies about his gambling , lies about being fired from his job for embezzlement and even lies about the source of the lavish gifts he rains down on Lina to silence her objections .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He 's probably the latter , for Suspicion repeatedly reinforces the notion that the wife is responsible for all problems in a marriage , even if her husband keeps his entire life outside the house secret from her and deceives her every step of the way .A good wife endures and understands .Or maybe Johnnie is just very good in bed ?Suspicion is a mystery thriller and the latter two - thirds of the movie dig a grave of bad plotting .Everything points to Johnnie being a lying killer , including his attitude toward his wife and the director 's insistent sinister touches , the most famous being the glowing glass of moo - juice he carries to her room , presumably to poison her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The problem is that Hitchcock has painted himself into an amateur 's corner , plot - wise .( spoilers from here to the end ) .If Cary / Johnnie is innocent , then the whole movie is an inconsequential cheat .It is Lina who must be deranged , fantasizing all of her husband 's sinister motives .He has problems , but is also basically good hearted , while Lina is a grade-A ninny .If Cary / Johnnie is guilty , then the story is a belabored exercise in the obvious .The likely killer turns out to be the real killer , surprise surprise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lina allows her husband to murder her , after which he unknowingly posts a ' he dunnit ' letter she has written to implicate him from beyond the grave .That 's the kind of stinger ending that Hitchcock would favor time and again in his 50s television show ; there are a stack of episodes about wives who think their husbands have murderous plans , only to find out they were mistaken .Hitchcock perhaps thought his ending would prevail , but if so did n't understand Hollywood 's labyrinthine production code .Lina ca n't allow herself to be poisoned , because that would be suicide , a no - no unless done for absurdly altruistic reasons .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At this time crooks had to be seen to be punished ; even Billy Wilder had to shoot a gas chamber scene for Double Indemnity , even though it turned out he did n't have to use it .And far worse was the fear that Cary Grant 's screen image would be tarnished .Glamourous psycho killers had n't been invented yet , and major stars just did n't play such roles .What would the fans think ?Hitchcock tries to have it both ways .Lina does n't let on to Johnnie that she knows / thinks he 's put poison in her milk .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Instead , there 's a feeble \" Mr. Toad 's Wild Ride \" scene that ends with both of them explaining away everything we 've been watching .Since to function the entire film has had to keep the married couple not talking for 90 minutes , this is a really miserable story windup .It even ends with some jolly ' hey , I 'm going to jail ' nonsense that 's supposed to make Cary seem like an okay guy after all .Naturally , Suspicion 's commercial aspects and star power saved the day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Deliver the right fantasy , and they will come .I have to think that many of the great ' auteur ' directors had the luxury of limping , failing and flopping a lot more than do modern film directors , who either consistently hit home runs or get sent to direct infomercials .Of course , the acting is fine .Sherlock Holmes fans enjoy Nigel Bruce 's contribution as Cary 's dotty pal .They have one interesting scene with a sadistic touch : Lina is at the brink of tears over her husband 's perfidy , and now he 's shown up with a bunch of gifts intended to deflect any inquiry into his shady money deals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's something unique and honest about that moment that stands out in a script composed mostly of stock situations .Warners ' DVD of Suspicion looks very good and seems to have been mastered from nicely maintained RKO elements .An inordinate number of matte shots recreate the English countryside without going any farther than Pacific Palisades .The polished B&W effects are a credit to RKO 's superior optical department ( was Linwood Dunn in charge yet ? )The sound is clear .There 's an okay trailer and a better - than - you'd - think docu that hits all the standard bases about the making of the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
