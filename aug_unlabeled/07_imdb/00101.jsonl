{"text": "Worcester Polytechnic Institute .Poe 's interest in ruins , evident in his review of J. L. Stephens ' Arahia Petraea and selected tales and poems , connects him to that Romantic tradition described by Thomas McFarland in Romanticism and the Forms of Ruin .( 1 ) As McFarland points out , behind the overt Romantic obsession with unity and oneness lay an uneasy sense of incompleteness and fragmentation .In Romantic prose and poetry , physical ruins served a more serious function than generating an atmosphere of melancholy .Rather , ruins were diasparactive forms that could produce subtle psychological or symbolic effects .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( 2 )For Poe in particular , ruins , in their mystery , silence , and desolation , served a prophetic function , offering premonitions , suggestions , and submerged meanings that resisted representation in ordinary language .Sometimes dismissed as an exercise in mutability rhetoric or as an uncharacteristic venture into blank verse \" The Coliseum \" represents Poe 's most direct poetic expression on the power of ruins .In providing an \" answer , \" the majestic structures participate in a dialogue , one of the hallmarks of the lieeraeure of ruin .Byron 's impact may have been so pervasive as to provide an immediate source for Poe , but \" The Coliseum \" derives from a long - standing poetic eradition ehae extends well back into the eighteenth century .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This contrast could often take the form of a dialogue , sometimes with two discrete speakers , as in the famous A Dialogue on Stowe ( 1751 ) .( 4 )More commonly , the dialectical interchange reflected two architectural styles , the classical , for example , played off against the gothic .Sometimes the contrast of silence and sound could induce a complex of mingled feelings in the observer , the melding of awe and melancholy [ column 2 : ] roughly consonant with the experience of sublimity .And Wordsworth 's \" Salisbury Plain , \" rather than presenting two separate corporeal speakers , offers instead a disembodied voice addressing the observer of ruins as the poet alludes to Dyer 's The Ruins of Rome .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In \" The Coliseum , \" the fragmentary nature of the ruined forms mirrors the partial character of expression offered by each speaker in the dialogue .Confirming Schlegel 's dictum that \" a dialogue is a chain or garland of fragments,\"(6 ) the exchange between Poe 's speaker and the Echoes does not constitute a simple statement and unequivocal answer but an independent voicing of discrete attieudes .Each side of the argument reveres to rhetorical flourishes that are really just fragments .Poe 's speaker lapses into \" lofty contemplation \" calling forth associations with the heroic past : \" Here , where a hero fell , a column falls ! / Here , where the mimic eagle glared in gold , / A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat ! \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While each grand property of the past finds its visual counterpart in a current , muted remnant of its former glory , an analogous auditory relationship develops in which awesome silence comes to suggest majestic sound .The ruins provoke the exclamations \" Vastness ! andAge ! \"and the Echoes that reply to the speaker claim that ruins still have the power to chasten and subdue .Poe 's contrast of observed ruin and unseen glory , awesome silence and suggested sound , surface desolation and submerged grandeur - all these pairings reflect his manner of allowing undercurrents of prophetic meaning to emerge from what appears to be dismal waste .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also like \" The Invocation \" of Volney 's Ruins , ( 8 ) \" The Coliseum \" consists of a dialogue between a speaker and an unseen but palpable presence .Poe 's pairing of the observed and unseen , the audible and unheard , despite his term \" Echoes , \" does not reflect a simple antiphonal pattern .The Echoes do not merely answer back and assert a superior role in the argument .They function , after all , not as a collective voice of response or repetition but more as a presence , a presiding spirit much like the Genius in Volney 's work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Through their paradoxical nature , the ruins allow Poe to include a degree of psychological penetration that transcends fragmentary rhetorical flourishes .As Richard Wilbur has pointed out , \" The Coliseum \" comments on all ruin by acknowledging man 's despotic nostalgia for the world 's past .The speaker of the poem also drinks within his soul the gloomy grandeur of fallen empires , but Poe includes two puns , the multiple meanings of which cause one to question the health of such a single - minded pursuit .The phrase \" At length - at length \" implies temporal duration and physical diseance , both required to reach the destination of crumbling ruin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Moreover , Poe insinuates that the \" altered \" speaker is prostrating himself before what has become , for him , an \" altar \" of crumbled stones .If one also entertains Volney 's theme - that greater ruin suggests the greater loss of prized civilization and , by implication , an intensification of human decline - \" The Coliseum \" becomes much more than an updating of Byronic rhetoric .As Monos says in \" The Colloquy of Monos and Una , \" \" But , for myself , the Earth 's records had taught me to look for widest ruin as the price of highest civilization \" ( Works , II , 611 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Less schematically than the review of Arabia Petraea \" The Coliseum \" shows how fascination with ruin can alter individual psychology .Poe 's systematic contrasts , deriving from the discrepancy between past grandeur and present waste , are reinforced by the dialectical quality of the poem .Moreover , these contrasts contribute to the mixed mood of exaltation and lassitude that characterizes his speaker .Because the speaker 's pronouncements represent only one side of an exchange , the reader must infer from a complex dialectic what prophetic meaning is suggested by the poem .Or to put the matter in different terms , Poe allows the fragmented remnants , the broken masses of ruin , to suggest significances that belie their pallid , broken appearance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In what appears to be a heretical touch , the speaker suggests that the Roman ruins possess \" spells more sure than e'er Judean king / Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane ! \"Here , another significant contrast is introduced , that between the historical depth of pagan Rome and Christ 's teachings .\" The Coliseum \" is \" Type of the antique Rome , \" center of spectacular bloodshed ; Poe 's allusion to Gethsemane thus suggests that the modern world has come under Rome 's violent but riveting \" spell \" rather than following the tender messages of Christ .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His prophetic meaning does emerge in partial , broken form through imagery and allusion .Tracing a course of empire that cuts a broader swath than that associated with one locality , his speaker , prostrate before an altar of crumbling waste , completes his pilgrimage to a decidedly fallen city rather than to the City of God . 1 - Romanticism and the Forms of Ruin : Wordsworth , Coleridge , and Modalities of Fragmentation ( Princeton : Princeton Univ .Press , 1981 ) ; see esp .\" Introduction : Fragmented Modalities and the Criteria of Romanticism , \" pp .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
