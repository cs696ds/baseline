{"text": "Film # 147 : BOOGIE NIGHTS .I can recall gendering at the beautiful one - sheet for Paul Thomas Anderson 's breakthrough movie months before it was released in the fall of 1997 .I marveled at its huge cast , and was excited about the subject matter -- a trip through the Los Angeles porn industry of the late 70s / early 80s .I did n't know who Anderson was at that time , having not seen his first feature , the small - time con film HARD EIGHT , but that would soon change .The BOOGIE NIGHTS poster , though , with its intricate photo collage of characters from the film , promised an epic portrayal unlike anything ever attempted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In it , we follow its na\u00efve central character , Eddie Adams ( Mark Wahlberg , in his first really notable lead role ) , as he 's ensnared into a makeshift family of porn mavens .As he 's performing tricks on the side at his busboy job at an L.A. nightspot , he 's spotted by the patriarchal porn auteur Jack Horner ( Burt Reynolds , in one of the best roles of his career ) .Impressed by his entire ... um ... package , Horner invites Eddie into the porn fold , and there his triumphs and troubles begin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I still find many moments in BOOGIE NIGHTS to be quite wonderful .Anderson 's writes dialogue for dumb people particularly brilliantly , so there 's always funny conversation ensuing .The period detail in the garish art direction ( by Bob Ziembicki ) and costume design ( by Mark Bridges , who 's gone on to do THE FIGHTER and THE ARTIST ) are spot - on .I love seeing Burt Reynolds tearing into a meaty role for possibly the last time , and Julianne Moore is beautifully histrionic here , as she would be in Anderson 's MAGNOLIA as well ( both she and Reynolds received supporting player Oscar nominations ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also , the film owes a bit too much to the GOODFELLAS style of soaring - then - crashing storytelling ( with the onslaught of the 80s being the rather too - obvious turning point , though thankfully the AIDS virus does n't even make a cameo appearance ) .Particularly memorable in this segment , too , is one of the great scenes in movie history , where a destitute Wahlberg , Reilly and ne'er - do - well Thomas Jane are stuck inside a free - basing coke - dealer 's house .The gun - toting dealer is played with a maniacal energy by Alfred Molina ; he 's so coked up , he has well - hidden suspicions that these three desperate guys are planning to rip him off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You 'll never hear these two songs in quite the same way again .It 's really a marvelously scary moment that puts you right there in this mess and gets your heart pounding like you 've been smoking crack alongside Molina .Most centrally , I like the film for its portrayal of adopted families ; I think this is how many with too - dyfunctional families now get along .I wish BOOGIE NIGHTS as a whole was as good as these individual elements , but it 's still certainly something worth checking out , most preferably on the big screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think the film is a bit more successful all over than you , though I would absolutely , one hundred percent agree with all your criticisms .What makes it hold together as an entire solid thing is Anderson 's inventive idea of taking The Celeb Bio Pic , telling the familiar story of a dreamy - eyed kid who is discovered at the drug - store , quickly rises to the peak of fame then promptly falls from grace .He sends the fantasy up by showing the tawdry underside of what a pathetic dream it is by setting it in a gross parallel porn world -- it 's funny too that this film should treat hetero porn as if the main attraction were the male stars !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And the scene where Cheadle gets the money to start his business with the lucky coincidence of the bakery 's robbery was to become the annoying structure of cosmic justice effected by the silly rain of frogs sequences in Magnolia .Because of Celeb bio quotation marks in Boogie Nights it works , but in Magnolia it 's simply sentimental on an absurd level .Clearly he 's stretching to find a great vision of the world , but what we 're seeing most of the time is just the stretching and not the world .Therefore Boogie Nights , in my opinion , is his most satisfying , most fully integrated work , a real classic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
