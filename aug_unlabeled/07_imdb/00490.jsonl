{"text": "August 26 , 2010 at 8:18 am .Back in the year 2000 , I started watching a TV show called The West Wing and loved it .That was the good .The bad ?I started watching from the second season premiere and we had no Hulu , no Netflix , and no BitTorrent for me to watch the first season .It was the dark times , younglings .Oh , dial - up . )So , what was a girl to do ?Well , she got on the interwebs and got a fan to send her ten VHS tapes containing copies of copies of the episodes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But now , now we have DVDs and Netflix streaming and life is good !Life is fantastic !Now entire seasons of television shows are available to watch in binge marathons on the weekends .It has transformed the way I watch TV , no longer parceled out in bite - size pieces every week , but watched as a detailed season - long story arc .You do n't want to read a chapter of a book every week .You want to read the whole book at once , and that 's what is possible now , which is what 's great .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( So says the book author who reminds you to love books and buy books , especially my books ! )A season of a television show gives you more time to meet the characters , tell the stories and flesh things out .When I compare Friday Night Lights the movie and Friday Night Lights the television show 's first season , the TV show wins .Both have excellent production values and great acting , but you can tell so much more story with umpteen hours of TV than you can in two hours of movie .And you can tell it 's good because I do not care an iota about football and still love that show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The quality of TV shows has gotten so good in the past few decades that they 're just as good if not better than many movies .You 've got accomplished actors of stage and screen appearing in shows , like Laura Linney in \" The C Word \" or Anna Paquin in the hit \" True Blood . \"And now with our smartphones and media players , it is becoming less important where you watch a show .You can watch it almost anywhere .I love good TV shows .I love that I can watch them in my house and not at a theatre with chatty couples and the distracting light of someone texting in the second row .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I love that the characters continue to change and grow more than they typically have space to do in films .I love talking about TV shows with my friends .I love TV !And I love that TV comes on DVD , so I do n't have to wait through commercials .I love that it 's available online , legally , so I do n't really have to pay for cable if I do n't want to .I particularly love it when I discover a great show after it 's been on the air for five years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So thank you DVD and the Internet .And thank you TV !You do n't need to and it probably means you actually interacted with human beings as a teenager .Related Entries .39 Comments .This happened to me too !I do n't like to invest the time into watching a story that ends after two hours ( i.e. a movie ) .I 'm in it for the long haul .It started with West Wing .Then it was Lost .Now it 's 24 .I love TV on DVD .I love TV too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And I 've found bringing boxsets of tvshows with me for laptop dvd watching when I 'm travelling for work has made journeys infinitely shorter and evenings less lonely .Sometimes I get quite afraid though when I calculate exactly how many hours of my life I have spent watching and rewatching the West Wing .While I love it , the impact I let it have on my life is sometimes a little unhealthy .I agree with you about the quality of Friday Night Lights .I know this statement is not true - but it really does seem that the critics ( and buyers of sponsored products ) do n't find the value of the really good shows .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I love television .I could watch TV all day .Love cable .Love it all .there is ALWAYS something on that I want to watch .Therefore , I busy myself with other things because there 's no such thing as just a little TV for me .That would be as absurd as the concept of \" one brownie .\" Whatev .Btw , I rcvd the 3 copies of your book yesterday from amazon !WOOT !Now to come up with the give - away !I have loved TV since I was a kid in the 1950 's !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "TV was still brand new .I remember watching Mrs. Francis ' Ding Dong School , Captain Kangeroo , Howdy Doody and Roy Rogers and Dale Evans and the ORIGINAL Mickey Mouse Club .Of course today , the quality of TV has vastly improved - West Wing and Friday Night Lights being two shining examples of what is RIGHT with TV today .We watch most of our TV via DVR now , fast forwarding through all commercials .What a great invention that was .I LOVE TV TOO !I love TV .I spent this summer vacation watching all 8 seasons of the West Wing !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Have you seen Mad Men ?I also love Breaking Bad , Big Love , and Weeds .I just started the Sopranos and they are OK - not mind blowing like I expected .I did Prison Break a while ago and spent last summer with Lost trying to catch up for the final season .24 is OK as well - not in my top 15 .I 'm a sucker for reality shows too - I love real Housewives and 16 & pregnant .( For the record - I work from home and need mindless background entertainment so I tend to watch gobs of TV , listen to tons of podcasts , and books on tape ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My newest addiction is that I have discovered The Closer .I 'm watching the new ones and going back and recording all of the old ones for marathon watching sessions on the weekend .I am also a Reality TV Junkie .I hate , hate , hate watching TV in real time because I ca n't fast forward through the commercials .I catch myself wanting to rewind something in real life though .... actual people and events .Something will happen and I 'll think ...I sure wish I could rewind and watch that again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Character development is very important to me , and you just ca n't beat a long - running TV series for that .I love watching TV on the comuter .I hated having to record things or be a slave to the TV set at 7 pm .Now I can watch what I want , when I want .SOOOO much better .We hardly watch anything on real time anymore .Great post !I 'm with you on \" The West Wing \" and \" Friday Night Lights , \" which I will be buying on DVD as soon as the complete series comes out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm so glad I 'm not the only tv junkie out there !I LOVE it for all the same reasons you do , and I get really sad when I watch seasons in a binge of a month or so and then the show is over .I actually MISS the characters as if I knew them personally .Sad , but true !Could n't agree more !I love the season - long story arc of a good tv show .AND the luxury of watching it all in one sitting !I honestly do n't even watch much tv that 's ON tv because I prefer getting my tv fix through Netflix or season boxed sets of shows .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm really into The Tudors right now .Good stuff !I can argue both sides of the marathon argument - I recently discovered House and am loving catching up in 4 - 5 episode mini marathons .I did n't start watching Damages on DVR until I had caught up on Seasons 1 - 2 on DVD .That show is best watched in big chunks .But I would not trade the last season of Lost in one week at a time segments for a DVD marathon .It was awesome to watch it weekly with the rest of the country , debate it online , listen to the podcasts from the producers , etc to really get more out of each episode .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I almost looked forward to reading the various online episode recaps as much as watching the program .The only , ( and I think it 's a big one ) problem with season long arcs is I 'm so afraid of getting really wrapped up in a show that is cancelled mid - season and I never find out what happened .There are shows I 've purposefully never watched because I was afraid of this emotional wrench .Now , of course , I could go back and watch them on DVD or whatever if they survive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Netflix is WONDERFUL ! ! ! ! @Dianalee - Oh , I hear you on that .And in an opposite sort of way , I tend to dislike shows that have a series - long arc that drags out forever and ever and ever .Like , did we ever find out what was the deal with all those aliens on \" The X - Files \" ?And is Clark Kent ever going to become Superman on \" Smallville \" ?Is that show even set in Smallville anymore ?When the first season of West Wing came out on DVD , I bought it , and a DVD player , and a new TV , because our old one was so old it did n't have the right inputs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When I started on this weightloss thing , I made a concious decision to allow myself to escape into as much crappy TV and other fiction as I wanted to , now that my favourite escape , Food , was no longer available .@Mom Taxi Julie - I do n't watch TV either , but what I do enjoy is hunting for old and obscure BBC series that I remember watching eons ago ... and then seeing them again on my laptop , all by myself .The House of Eliot is fabulous ! @Julie - Oh , I did a four - season binge of \" The Wire \" right before the fifth season came out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That is what I did with The Wire too .I love seeing the cast in new shows and projects .A bunch of the cast is now on HBO 's Treme .... which is incredible .And Idris Elba who played Stringer Bell is everywhere .He 's in upcoming episodes of The Big C. And Omar ! !I think he was my favorite of all .He 's going to be in Boardwalk Empire on HBO .I have n't watched TV in real - time in ... well , over a decade .We 've never had cable , in 18 years of marriage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's awesome .We 've seen all of The Office that way ( though we did watch this last season on Hulu because we HAD to see the wedding and the baby ) , my kids are addicted to Everybody Loves Raymond ( ALL seasons ) .I love The Sopranos , Weeds , Extras , Nurse Jackie , Big Love , Deadwood .I agree that The Wire is the best thing that 's ever been on TV , but I think Six Feet Under runs a close second and it is my favorite series of all time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Someday as a gift to myself I 'm going to buy all 5 seasons in the giant box that has artificial \" graveside \" turf on top .Many a weight loss experience has fizzled with a moaned \" Why ca n't I just get that old fire back ? \" as it 's death knell .Maybe we just need to accept that things will NEVER be like they were at first , and stop pining for the past and start living with the present .@CK - Funny .The only time I allow myself to watch Friday Night Lights is when I am on my treadmill .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Love that show .I was dragged kicking and screaming to watch a full episode ( I HATE football ) but I was hooked .It is so well produced and acted and no studio looking shots .Very REAL .Jennette Fulda tells stories to the Internet about her life as a smartass , writer , weight - loss inspiration , chronic headache sufferer , and overall nice person ( who is silently judging you ) .She does this at JenFul now , but you can still have fun perusing her past here .Disclaimer : I am not responsible for keyboards ruined by coffee spit - takes or forehead wrinkles caused by deep thought .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
