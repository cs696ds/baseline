{"text": "I got the starter pack for a 10 hour drive we did for our camping trip this last weekend , I had to laugh about the toilet poker too .It actually came with a handy suction cup I use for my \" pooper scooper \" that now hangs behind my toilet .I know that whatever crap is in the GDiapers is better than pampers , and I would much rather have other mama 's who \" just could n't do cloth \" turn for the Gdiapers than there normal sposie .Are they better than cloth ... NEVER !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Its a step in the right direction for some mama 's .Look , I completely admire and respect everyone for cloth diapering .I was cloth diapered as a babe and planned to do the same .( And finally now am at 11 mos ) .This is a familiar topic and if you are happy cloth diapering - power to you .I wish I had been able to do the same .But for those who might end up using disposables instead of cloth because they are alarmed by these GDiaper thrashing threads - here is my story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I used GDiapers ( despite reading all the negative reviews on this board ; ) because they felt better than disposables and because I simply was not up for dragging loads of cloth diapers to the laundromat or doing them all by hand at home .I was exhausted and in a lot of pain and I 'm so glad GDiapers was an option .When my babe was 10 weeks I moved across country and began an extremely competitive graduate program .I have simply been too overwhelmed to fulfill my cloth diapering ambitions ... until now .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Contrary to popular posting myth , they flush just fine ( at least in the old 1920 's bulidings I have lived in ) and I am amazed that anyone who does n't mind CD would mind dealing with a little poop during the flush part .The flushable is essentially a lot of toilet paper .Yes , there is some chemicals to make them more absorbant but the amount of waste / chem pales in comparison to disposables .The little synthetic thing that goes between the cover and the flushable keeps the cover clean .If some poop gets on it - you rinse it and it 's dry and ready in about 10 minutes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have started putting a pre - fold in the cover instead of the flushable - works great .Bottom line - cloth diapering wins , hands down but GDiapers are far far far better than disposables .hi everyone !i 'm new here . just stumbled across one day while shopping for my gDiapers online .although i respect everyone for cloth diapering in favor of the enviroment and our children , i have to say that not everything that is posted here about gDiapers is true .i read here that people think that cloth diapering is waaaayyyy better for the enviroment than gDiapers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "i believe it is slightly better .it will take the same amount of water to wash the gDiaper and inserts than it would to wash cloth diapers .a little trick that i have is that i wash the inserts and diapers with my baby 's laundry .i know your thinking how can i put it in there with all that poop ? !well i flush the poop down the toilet and wipe down the cloth insert with the wipe i used to clean the baby . not so that its squeaky clean but so its not heavily soiled . and while i 'm on the go i just toss everything into a eco - friendly biodegradable diaper sack that goes right in the trash .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "so eventhough gDiapers do go in the trash and down the toilet , it is made to decompose safely into the earth .i tried cloth diapering the old fashioned way and let me tell you from my experience ... gDiapers are soo much better .Personally , I am not in a position to use cloth diapers .It is something that I have wanted to at least try , but at the moment , am unable to commit to .Perhaps once we move , I can reconsider .When I came across the idea of gDiapers , I was ecstatic !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thank you to LittleGriff for your post ( as that 's the same position I 'm in ) .Good to read that someone else is taking the stance that I am .No , I wo n't be super Mom and using the CDs , but I will be contributing somewhat to bettering the environment using gDiapers .I find it odd that everyone is so adamant against them .Is it not a better option than going full on plastics ?You have to at least acknowledge that fact , no ? most of us have acknowledged that they are better the traditional sposies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is n't about who is a better mom for which diaper they use .I am so glad to see this thread !I have been telling people this for months .I had to hunt on their web site to find the info about the gel , but once I found it , I knew I could n't support that product .I mean , good for them that you can reuse the cover , but that 's the only advantage over disposables !I am so glad to see this thread !I have been telling people this for months .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I mean , good for them that you can reuse the cover , but that 's the only advantage over disposables !Is it the only advantage ?Lets put the gel thing aside because apparently there are differing opinions .But what i was thinking was this , YES you can reuse the cover , YES you still have to deal with a little poo .Seems like a way to exploit green people .it 's crazy that you will see so - called cloth diapers like gdiapers in parenting magazine articles on CD but not any of the CDs us real parents use .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "most of us have acknowledged that they are better the traditional sposies .This thread is about the marketing and what we feel are false claims .This is n't about who is a better mom for which diaper they use .I 'm clearly the BEST mom because MY son 's diapers have pictures of little cars on them .So there .I 'm having a really hard time wrapping my head around how Gdiapers are green .Reusable cover- green .Poop gets put in the toilet where it should be .BTW- if you read a package of disposables it says you are supposed to shake the poo into the toilet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then you have the SAP .The sodium polyacrylate- SAP- is most likely sourced directly from China- That fact alone makes me uneasy about the polymer .I did look up a manufacturer 's site ( product- LiquiBlock by Emerging Technologies Inc.I have no idea if they are related to diapers at all ) of SAP and they do list the polymer as being a respiratory , eye , and skin irritant .The manufacturer also recommends an 8 hr exposure limit of 0.05 mg / m3- a very small amount .And think of how long and often babies are exposed to it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Putting them in the trash even in a degradable trash liner does no good either- it all goes into a land fill where nothing has a chance to degrade .If and only if everyone used biodegradable trash liners and everyone recycled then they would degrade but what about the poo ?Not everyone shakes the poo out and not everyone is a vegetarian .I could see maybe using these on vacations / camping but not as a green alternative to disposables for everyday use .Cloth diapering is not that hard , it 's not like what it used to be in the old days .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And I also agree with azariahsmom , there needs to be more marketing for the awsome , easy to use cloth diaper options out there .There are so many ! ! !What 's up with Whole Foods selling gdiapers but not any real cds ?Just pfs and bummis would be nice .Next time I 'm at wf I 'm going to look at them .Their covers look cute and it says on the website you can use them with cds .I know I 'll be tempted but i do n't really want to support this company , I ca n't imagine they 'll be succesful anyway .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's actually where I got my first cloth diaper .And actually I got the start up kit of g - diapers at wegmans .I was n't going to use the inserts , just flat - folds or prefolds inside .Anyway , I 'm not happy with them .They leak all the time , so I end up having to wash the cover all the time anyway .I like my AIO 's better .I think g - diapers is just another big company taking advantage of the \" green \" demographic .They are n't honest in their advertising .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They are basically just like every other disposable diaper , just without the sticky plastic tabs in the front .The little cloth cover is cool , but its just there to hold on the disposable diaper \" insert \" that does n't have any tabs on it .So now not only are we using the resources and chemicals of traditional sposies , but we are also using water and energy to wash the cloth covers !Its like the worst of both worlds ! !Ok .I use g diapers , and they really are n't that bad .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The website gives several options other than flushing the pads .You can compost , or even throw them away and the degrade in a fraction of the time that disposables do .I chose not to use cloth diapers because of the amount of washing required .I use g diapers because they work rather well .I do n't flush the liners every time my little guy wets one .I have a bin next to the toilet that we fill with the wet ones ( the poopy ones get flushed right away ) , and every time my husband or I use the toilet , we flush a liner with our own flush .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are tabs at the corners that do n't get wet or poopy .They flush fine as long as you follow their directions in flushing .We have had only two get backed up , and it is because we did n't rip one open , and because I tried to flush three ( oops ) .The gel on the inside is the only downer .It does almost dissolve completely in the toilet when ripped open and it is made mostly of the tree pulp .But , I am aware of the controversial issues regarding the gel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I also know that I use much much less water than a cloth diaper user .You only have to wash the inner liners when they get poopy ( g diapers suggests washing then in the sink , but I throw them in the machine with the outer liners ) .And the cloth outer liners when they get wet or poopy , which is rare .I have 8 cloth outer liners and 12 inner liners , and I wash them all about once to twice a week .I really thought we were all open - minded here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are down sides to ALL diapering systems .I think the way I use g diapers , they are equally as green and \" non green \" as cloth diapers .BTW , I have a degree in Environmental Studies , and have taught about environmental issues for 10 years .I .I looked into them .For me it was n't worth it because of the bad ratings , and because I did n't have a whole lot of a start up cost so prefolds and flats are my CD of choice .I would n't knock a gdiaper user however .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think it 's a move in the right direction at the very least .Some people enjoy , or even need , the added convience for various reasons .A big pro that was touted on their website was that you could use the covers themselves multiple times before washing because the liners were supposed to work so well .( I later read various reviews that disputed that ) .For someone in my position of having no washer and dryer nearby this could come in very handy .I agree that they should n't falsely advertise , but I also thing this is the case for over ninety nine percent of manufacturers and advertisers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , and they say you can \" compost \" them ... \"but do n't compost poopy diapers \" .Ummmm -- we would n't be using the compost for vegtables , duh .I wish I could cd -- but I do n't have running water and I am not into doing my laundry every single freakin ' week at the overpriced local laundromat .So I will be doing g's -- but I do n't have a toilet .Yay compost !I 'm with you , Lizzy ( after spending too much time on line reading this entire discussion ! ) 1 ) G dipes are better than disposables ( which should be illegal ) because they biodegrade ( and even if the gels do n't decompose , at least we know that gels are already in the ground b / c people use potting soil ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Indeed .There is a really specific way you have to do it so that you do n't contiminate groundwater , ect .I think it involves sawdust ?I should add that doing your own composting of your waste ( assuming you know you have no contagious diseases ) would be the only exception to \" poop goes in the sewer \" I actually had forgotten about that option .I did see something about it on this episode of 30 days called \" off the grid .\" Right , only about 10 % of SAP(gel pellets ) is compostable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
