{"text": "And fuck me if they did n't manage in it !The album starts with a movie sample , and you 'll find these throughout the album , but thankfully not very often .They were clipped from the movies such as \" The Burning \" , \" Friday the 13th \" , \" New York Ripper \" .It 's those 1970's-80 's slasher movies what inspired this album .Midnight Murder Mania ' assails with rusty yet sharp blades swinging .Within these 11 songs , the band seamlessly surf between death metal , grindcore , punk and thrash ( Engorged guitarist Dean Stalkwell played on this album ) styles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's some occurrences of melodic leads , but they are kept scarce .Anyways , the riff is the king on this album , deservedly so .Well , except for that annoying nursery rhyme riff on ' The Ripper ' .The pace is 99 % fast with blastbeating or double kick drumming leading the way , so expect no mercy .The vocals are usual for the goregrind stuff : More or less low growling along with the shrieking growl , with various appearances by the sewer gurgle .All in all , despite all the influences , the band found the red thread , and kept it tightly in their hands .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The production is two - sided , sadly .The guitars sound dirty and the bass mauls , but the drums are weak , no thanks to the flapping kick drums and the toms , but the snare drum too is flat .Yeah , no fuckin ' triggers utilized , but still it 's a defect , this drum sound business , no matter how organic sound the band wanted to have here .Comic yet brutal artwork from Tales from Uranus artist perfectly fits for the album .The lyrics would have been nice , thank you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's like all those slasher movies ; it 's not scary for a seasoned freak , but it 's full of those moments where some poor bastard 's head gets thrusted through a coat hook , or someone 's eyes get goughed out .This is gore , not horror .Think of something like Haemorrhage mixed with Engorged - ish FUN , and you got Frightmare right about there .Pizza , beer and this , mmmmmmmmm .Horror bloody Horror - 95 % .Those crazy bastards that brought you ' Lord Gore ' , ' Engorged ' and ' Bloodfreak now have another extraordinary project by the name of ' Frightmare ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is an eeriness afoot when every beginning utilizes samples from the likes of ' Friday the 13th ' , ' Maniac ' and other famed slasher movies of said era .The music here is something to be appreciated .It has a very thrashy sound which reminds me of \" Autopsy Torment ' and ' Eaten Back to Life ' era ' Cannibal Corpse ' . 'Frightmare ' even utilizes solo 's which is unorthodox for grind metal .This is an instrumental paradise although the bass does get lost behind the rest of the band .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Though lyrical content and vocals are the norm for death / grind I find it refreshing to actually base the songs on something that we all might relate to .I have seen all the movies ' Frightmare ' sing about and get more into the music due to that reason .I enjoy the production as it is murky and dark which helps to give the music texture and a scary aura that is befitting an outfit of the likes of 80 's influenced death / grind .I hope that every listener has had the enjoyment that I have had while listening to ' Midnight Murder Mania ' and appreciates it for its musical attributes and dedication from its creators .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A new fav ... - 90 % .Maniac Neil is quickly becoming a goregrind genius in my book .This release by him and RazorbackRecords ( who also never disappoints ) is amazing .I ordered this online about a week ago because I ca n't find it anywhere else along with the other Frightmare album Bringing Back The Bloodshed and I finally got it the other day .With an amazing mix of styles and genres including death , grind and thrash Frightmare has created an awesome fucking album .There is so much diversity here that literally anyone can enjoy it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They sound so good and always fit well with the songs .Nothing ever sounds out of place .For instance in the song \" Be My Bloody Valentine \" the beginning sounds very grind / death and then goes right into a thrash riff .Sounds weird but it flows so well and sounds so good .Do n't get me wrong though they also have some great riffs and grooves that really give the album replay value .I could find myself going back to this album every now and then whenever I need a good goregrind fix and ca n't find any good bands .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The vocals are really good , but nothing new or different .Got your growls and screams and all that .Fits with the music well .What do you expect from a goregrind band ?The drums are good , lots of blasts and what not , good tempo , etc .Everything played on this album is really good but for my the guitars are the highlight for me .I could listen to it all day , it 's still stuck in my head .To sum up this album ...BUY IT !It is well worth your money .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They 're all about slasher flicks .That 's just good clean blood splattering fun .If you want a good listen , this is the right place to find it .I highly recommend this to anyone who just wants to hear some good music .There 's even a little treat at the end at the album , they do a cover of The Misfits ' Devilock .I do n't what else I can tell you to convince you that you should get this album , just get it !Standout songs : . \"Friday The 13th \" \" The Prowler \" \" Be My Bloody Valentine \" \" Frank Zito , The Maniac \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now , to understand the perspective on which I am taking for this review , you have to understand this .I am what some may consider a metal elitist ( and many people that utilize this site may consider themselves that as well . )For me to listen to a grind band and say they are \" decent \" is mostly unusual .I listened to this band , due to my friends amazement with gore - inspired grind bands such as Ghoul , Lord Gore , etc .Usually if I hear a song with a sample that starts it off , I will change the song and dismiss as being hardcore trash , but it was a tad - bit different with this album .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And yes , the vocals consist of monotonous growling .But still this is n't a bunch of garbage like I almost thought it was .The song that actually hooked me to this album was , \" Friday the 13th \" which is one of the songs that has a true melody , and is n't a bland assault of br00tality ( note the difference between ' brutality ' and ' br00tality ' ) .They actually utilize harmonious , melodic guitarring in this song , of course it eventually evolves into a relentless assault on the ears .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
