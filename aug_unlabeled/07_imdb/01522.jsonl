{"text": "I went into this movie almost completely blind , having not seen the trailer , reviews , or other media .It turned out to be a visually beautiful film with an engaging storyline and a refreshing pace ( there are n't explosions every 2 minutes ) .There is originality and creativity in Oblivion that is often missing in the standard blockbusters .I came away from the theater feeling that the two hours were solidly worth my time , even if there were a couple of plot holes .In the content department , there is a smattering of profanity and a single somewhat suggestive sensual scene to consider when taking younger family members to the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm not usually a sci - fi fan but this movie really surprised me .I really enjoyed the creativity and gadgetry involved in the scenes .I 'd say it was worth my time .For parents : Most violence is sci - fi and bloodless .There is one scene where sex is implied , which could have been easily taken out .Well , it 's hard to review this movie without indicating that we watched it in IMAX .I ca n't imagine NOT seeing it in IMAX having done so .The cinematography in this movie was awesome , as was the CGI , and visually it 's very stunning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But , the plot twist and reveal were pretty interesting .I had figured out some of the twist , but not all , and when it finally came to light , I was rather surprised .The acting is good , casting is well done ( though many of the actors were new to me ) , and overall it was a great movie .Nothing , in my opinion , that indicates that this is n't a true PG-13 .I 'd take my 13 year old to it , along with friends , and feel just fine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Oblivion is intriguing , original , and visually spectacular .The story draws you in and makes you feel like you are a part of it .There were several moments when I only remembered I was in a theater watching a movie because I shifted the way I was sitting .I have n't been to a movie in a long time that made me feel that engaged .I loved seeing this in the theater because the atmosphere ( seating , sound , lighting , etc . ) was prime for this time of movie .Right as the plot began to seem familiar something would happen that changed it just enough from what you expected to keep you involved .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is one notable f - word and one mature sensual scene that probably was more for the artsy filming style than anything else .A women 's bare buttocks is visible through water in that scene and sex is implied .I think most teenagers will enjoy this film but it 'll hit big with the sci - fi crowd .The pros of this movie heavily outweigh the cons .I was looking forward to seeing Oblivion and it did not disappoint .I found it entertaining , original , and unpredictable .It probably wo n't become anyone 's favorite movie , but it is entertaining enough to see on the big screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would n't say I absolutely loved it , but it was engaging and not totally predictable .I was actually surprised a bit by the way it ended .It 's not the typical happily ever after ending you see with most movies , but it was n't exactly a disappointing ending either .Part of what I did n't like is that I felt like there was virtually no explanation of who the aliens were and I felt like I still had unanswered questions in the end .I wish there was a little more story with the aliens , but overall it was still entertaining and worth my time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It might be a bit heavy for younger audience members .There is some lengthy shots of a female character 's fully nude backside silhouetted and then we see more of her nude backside in a swimming pool .There is also one very gratuitous \" F \" word at the end of the movie .I was pretty excited to see this movie and had heard some good things about it .Watched it with my friends and we soon found ourselves bored out of our minds .I love sci - fi movies but this one just did n't click with me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The cinematography in Oblivion is gorgeous , the scenes of the sky and the ruined world a visual treat .Fortunately , I am happy to report that there is an honest to goodness story behind the pretty CGI .Oblivion is more high concept sci - fi than action sci - fi , though the gradual revelation of mysteries and interesting reversals keep the more ponderous parts interesting between the action sequences .Recommended for any ClearPlayers who like a good sci - fi adventure ...See Full Review .This is a great movie that really went under the radar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are some scenes with adult content but nothing over the top .Has some unexpected twists that make it very interesting .I liked it !Best movie that I have seen all year .Was not expecting much because I though Superman , Star Trek and the other big movies would be the ones to see .However , this one is better than all of them .Very thoughtful story .Unusual soundtrack .The sounds the machines made gave them a life of their own .For an action film , Oblivion seemed a little too slow in pace .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is multiple occurrences of profanity .The action in the film is relatively tame by today 's standards .While exciting chase and battle sequences do exist , there is little blood .However , there are a couple of violent scenes that are slightly above our approval rating .In addition , the language is completely inappropriate and the near nudity is out of place .Its too bad that the filmmakers chose to pepper their movie with these unnecessary elements which serve to do nothing but distract the audience from an otherwise unique and interesting story ...", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While mature moviegoers may shrug off the amateur metaphysics of Karl Gajdusek 's script easily enough , taken together with its ethical complexities -- difficult to probe for fear of spoilers -- they make this convoluted dystopian drama wholly unsuitable for young or impressionable viewers ...See Full Review .It kept pulling me and pulling me in .Oblivion was a great boy meets girl , boy dies , girl meets another guy kind of movie .I liked how they showed the story of how the humans had originally been enslaved .The robots had a nice friendly feel to them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I saw Oblivion in DBOX .The DBOX motion was effectively used and made it all that much more entertaining .The movie is definitely a slow - starter ; they probably could have shortened or took out altogether about 20 minutes worth of set up , in the first 45 minutes .The SFX were fantastic looking .There are some twists in the last 45 minutes I did n't see coming ...but I generally am the type that gets lost in the movie and does n't see obscure or obvious things coming - in movies .The nudity is all from the back side .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
