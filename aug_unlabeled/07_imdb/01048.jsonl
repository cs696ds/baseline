{"text": "Dwayne and his family are caught up in a terrifying struggle for survival which pits them against a horde of brainwashed , bloodthirsty , \" creatures .\" Who will survive the night ?Awesome Review - O - Matic .Perkins 14 has a interesting premise but it seems it went about it the wrong way .It 's your typical kinetic alive brainwashed zombies attacking our brave hero cop and his family .What it should have been was a movie about each of the 14 people who were kidnapped and what Perkins did to them .How do you turn a normal kid into a bloody thirsty monster ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dwayne Hopper ( Patrick O'Kane ) is our hero cop and he has a wife ( Mihaela Mihut ) and daughter Daisy ( Shayla Beesley ) .Each of these characters has some arcs in the movie as Dwayne investigates Perkins , his wife seems to be having an affair and the daughter wants to fuck this musician .The movie starts up slow , with the first half teetering on character development .As Hopper interrogates Perkins , we finally get motive on why Perkins did what he did .But he is executed which to me did n't make sense .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He 's the main adversary .Seemed anti climactic to just bullet in the brain him .There 's always a super evil killer boss and his minions .The second half just had minions .That 's a major plot hiccup .But the second half of the movie picks up speed and we get some awesome carnage by both Hopper and the 14 .In one scene , an ocular trauma by Hopper 's wife Janine has her taking a piece of glass ans sticking it into the eye of of 1 of the 14 psychopaths .A few of the kill scenes are basic , nothing I 'm writing Fangoria about .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's really hard to watch darkness unless it 's on BluRay .I know , I know .... darkness adds the scary .But if you ca n't even see the scary , um it 's not gon na be scary .The movie goes editing crazy , with some quick cuts and dissolves and fades .It was an arsenal on the eyes and sort of took away from a more suspenseful approach .I was n't expecting the ending I got which was a downer .Downer endings are better endings in my book anyway .Perkins 14 was at best a grindhouse horror flick with the potential - ality to be something really good .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a first in our Web 2.0 world to make a horror movie this way and it 's a credit to all involved .Perkins 14 knocked on the door but did n't have the \" oooooomph \" to push it down .That 's too bad .Gore - ipedia ( if you want to be shocked do n't read ) .Ocular trauma Bullet in the brain Intenstinal munchies Finger nail scratching Slicing and dicing Random bloodletting and gore .The Jaded Viewer 's Final Prognosis .Do you want me to say go check out Perkins 14 this week ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I really do n't know .It 's a run of the mill horror movie , not PG-13 and has a few choice cuts of bloody goodness .If that 's good enough , see it .If it 's not , you got 7 others to choose from .Viking , monsters , space men and the guys who played Jesus and Hellboy ( and Hellboy 's dad ) ; not a bad pitch for a movie , is it ?And in most respects , The monster design for the Moorwen is badass , plain and simple .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And do n't worry , they do show the monster plenty ... when there are scenes that actually have something to do with it , which are far happened far too infrequently for my liking .Outlander 's most fatal flaw is that it just takes itself too seriously .There 's way too much going on to try and elicit sympathy from the audience for characters that its very difficult to form any kind of bond with .You really do n't care for any of these characters no matter how hard director McCain tries to make you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The other big drawback Outlander suffers from is pacing .It is way too long and goes all tonally over the place far too often .If it could 've pick and stick with one particular tone or pace it would 've helped immensely .Instead it just seemed like no one could stand to cut anything out of the film for fear of loosing or confusing the audience , so they just left everything in .I know it seems like I 'm being overly harsh to Outlander .I think that 's because the premise of it was so simplistically cool that I was disappointed with how overly complicated it became so early on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In terms of special features on the DVD there 's lots more useless stuff to be found except for the audio commentary which includes writer / director Howard McCain , writer / executive producer Dirk Blackman , and producers Chris Roberts and John Schimmel .That was pretty robust , but the rest ?Not so hot .Other than the extra audio track all we get are several useless deleted scenes , some animatics , and production galleries .A making - of would have been nice , but alas it was n't in the cards .Still I ca n't say Outlander is n't fun .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Really that 's all I want from a monster movie ; a good time .The best of them can give it and sneak some human drama or socially aware subtext into the story and not have it get bogged down .Outlander just is n't one of them .Special Features .Audio commentary with writer / director Howard McCain , writer / executive producer Dirk Blackman , and producers Chris Roberts and John Schimmel .This movie was about maybe two steps above a Sci - Fi movie of the week .It went on way longer than it should have .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was almost as goofy as an episode of Stargate SV-1 ( which is about the goofiest show on TV and I am constantly amazed at it viewership and survival ) .Dr Malachi Constant .Yeah , Sophia 's pretty hot .All bad - ass warrior chick in this , to boot .There 's just something about a fit redhead stabbing a giant fucking dragon with a spear ... .Although , probably the greatest thing about Outlander will be trying to describe it to your friends .\" Alright , so . alien Jesus and a bunch of extras from The Lord of the Rings fight this thing that looks like what would happen if Roland Emmerich 's Godzilla had sex with a Light Brite .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And , yeah , they could 've given us more Perlman .Every time he delivered a line , I kept wondering , ' does he even know what movie he 's in ? 'It 's almost like he 's the only one seriously acting while the rest of the cast seems content to just phone it in .Easily the best performance in the entire film .Best death scene , as well .DavidFullam .Maybe this film will come to town .It certainly does sound like it 's worth a look .DavidFullam .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
