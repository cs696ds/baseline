{"text": "All Rise ... .Editor 's Note .The Charge .\" You notice things if you pay attention . \"Opening Statement .Born in Shanghai in 1958 and raised in Hong Kong after 1962 , director Wong Kar - Wai has been active in the Hong Kong film industry since the mid-1980s .His initial efforts were in script - writing , but he soon turned to directing and has had considerable success during the past decade with such titles as Chungking Express ( 1994 ) and Happy Together ( 1997 ) .Two of his most often - used actors have been Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung and in 1998 , he began work on a film that would feature the pair almost exclusively .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The completed film was In the Mood for Love , released in 2000 to considerable international acclaim .In the Mood for Love has now been released in Canada on DVD by Seville Pictures in a very nice edition .Facts of the Case .Li - zhen has just rented a room in an apartment building in Hong Kong .She and her husband move in the same day that Chow and his wife move into their room in the apartment next door .Li - zhen 's husband is a representative for a Japanese company and is often away on business .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Li - zhen and Chow often find themselves thrown into each other 's company either at home as their landlords are good friends who often socialize with each other , or because they both frequent a near - by noodle stand .The two become good friends , but eventually they are forced to realize that their spouses are having an affair .The Evidence .In many films , the pleasure is in the unexpected .Here we have an exquisite love story in which the principals say little and barely touch , yet the attraction between them is so powerful that we are completely captivated by their relationship .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of the key characteristics of the film is its claustrophobic nature .Anyone unfamiliar with Hong Kong is probably at least aware of its reputation for being a city where space is at a premium .Wong Kar - Wai accentuates this characteristic in virtually every scene in the film .Couples live in small single rooms ; furniture is moved with difficulty up narrow staircases and through narrow hallways ; narrow alleys force people to push past each other ; and workers share small , crowded offices .Li - Zhen and Chow are already living in rooms in adjoining apartments before they even know each other , and every action they later take seems to cause them to run into each other .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film then becomes a struggle between the desire to release that sexual tension and the reticence of both characters to break with the confining social conventions of the time that demand faithfulness regardless of the actions of their respective spouses .So much of what Li - Zhen and Chow think and feel is internalized , that it places immense demands on the skill of the two principal actors to convey the nature of their characters ' relationship .Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung both deliver wonderful performances that are completely believable and true - to - life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The overall atmosphere created by the film is an important part of its allure .Careful attention has been paid to costume selection ( particularly Li - Zhen 's array of beautiful tight dresses known as cheongsams ) , food presentation , and musical accompaniment .The latter features a haunting theme plus several songs sung in Spanish by Nat King Cole , all of which punctuate the narrative repeatedly at key points of the story .Cinematography is mainly in the hands of Christopher Doyle ( with whom Wong Kar - Wai normally works ) and the result is a rich but confined - looking tableau of sights and sounds framed through windows , doorways , mirrors , and narrow hallways , staircases , and alleys .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Director Kar - Wai 's original framing was the international 1.66:1 aspect ratio .Seville has chosen to frame its image transfer at 1.78:1 , close to the North American theatrical release ratio of 1.85:1 .The image delivers a crisp , clear picture marred only by an occasional speckle .Colour fidelity is excellent , blacks are deep and glossy , and whites are clean .Shadow detail is generally very good except for a few darker scenes that appear a little murky .Edge enhancement is not an issue .The film 's sound is delivered by a Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo Surround mix that appears to do a fine job of conveying the mainly dialogue - driven film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Use of the surrounds is restricted to the music which sounds rich and enveloping .It 's a pleasure to hear the film 's theme music and Nat King Cole 's efforts so well presented .Overall , a very acceptable effort .The disc concludes with a nicely rounded array of supplements .Principal among them is a 20-minute featurette made by the director that provides interesting insight into the production process and the approaches of the director and actors to the material .On - screen comments by Wong Kar - Wai , Tony Leung , and Maggie Cheung are included .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Biographic and filmographic information is provided for the director and both leading actors .Included also is a listing of international awards and the film 's theatrical trailer plus trailers for three other films available from Seville ( The Chinese Box , Eat Drink Man Woman , and Three Seasons ) .Closing Statement .In the Mood for Love was one of the best films of 2000 and many people have been eagerly awaiting its appearance on DVD .Seville Pictures has now provided a worthy DVD release in Canada that is highly recommended .For those who may not have heard , Criterion has also announced a forthcoming DVD release of this film and will doubtless do a fine job with it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
