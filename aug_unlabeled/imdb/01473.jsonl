{"text": "Bad Hollywood movies and excellent walking octopuses .Michael Blowhard 's latest posting is one of his link fests , to video clips this time .He says he now prefers internet video bits to regular Hollywood movies .It saddens this longtime film buff to say it , but I 'm having a better time these days browsing video clips on the Web than I am watching most new movies .I know the feeling .I do not indulge in internet video clips , but I am finding the movies duller and duller as the years go by .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is just that I have learned all I want to from the movies , and I have seen all the stories .I know the formulae .I now actually tend to prefer clever movies from Europe with subtitles , because I do not know how they are going to end , and because the people in them now seem more interesting and more real .Time was when it was the subtitled movies that were dull and the Hollywood stuff that was exciting .So has Hollywood changed ?I doubt it .Have I changed ?That seems far more likely .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If so many other kinds of business rest on these platforms , all the more reason to do them well , surely .I tried a few of Michael 's links to video clips , although I fear that investigating the porny ones too enthusiastically would be to invite all kinds of nasty Dark Side forces to encamp themselves on my hard disc .My favourite one was the first one linked to , which features a most unusual species of octopus : .When walking , these octopuses use the outer halves of their two back arms like tank treads , alternately laying down a sucker edge and rolling it along the ground .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Apparently , this is a fairly recent discovery : . \" This behavior is very exciting , \" said Huffard , who first noted it five years ago in the coconut octopus but only recently was able to capture both types of octopuses on film .\" This is the first underwater bipedal locomotion I know of , and the first example of hydrostatic bipedal movement . \"Although , I have to say that one of the best things about this item was how little time it took to enjoy it , unlike a Hollywood movie like Miss Congeniality 2 , which is the one that Friedrich Blowhard was especially complaining about .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If Miss Congeniality 2 is boring tripe , no more amusing than being told the same joke all over again , this should be no particular surprise .The surprise is when Whatever It Is 2 is really good , like with Godfather 2 or Terminator 2 , or with James Bond number 2 .Why ?Because making a film good enough to have a sequel is very hard , and for the follow - up to be as good or better is a huge coincidence .I reckon Friedrich B was just particularly angry about MC2 and blamed all of Hollywood , instead of just the people who made MC2 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
