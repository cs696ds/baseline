{"text": "Costumes / Make - up : good .Summary : I would NOT recommend this Haunted House to ANYONE .I have never felt so harassed in my life .I was harrassed while waiting in line and even got blood on me from one of the characters .I felt so disgusting I did n't even want to go in to the haunted house at this point .When I did finally get in I had to deal with someone with a chainsaw hitting my legs so much that I was bruised and hurting .They would n't stop even with me saying OW .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Summary : All in all , This is a great haunted house .There are many features and styles inside that are a cut above the rest .I really enjoyed the buried alive experience .I admit that I was skeptical at first , but once I got in there I had a lot of fun with it .The room with the clowns was a blast .I especially liked how they had the room set on a suspension system so it moves as you shifted your weight .The vertigo tunnel was very effective .While have enjoyed many of the haunts in the area , I would have to say dungeon of doom is by far the best one yet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "they all were scaring people outside .there were different members inside . also i think that they should make more clowns and try to make the clown section of the house more terrifying then it already is .inside the waiting room they should have made three lines .one line for they people who need to buy tickets .another for they people who bought tickets already online .and one last one for the people who have VIP passes .it would make the line go faster .it would be a lot more efficient .Visibility / Location : They could use a sign or two on Sheridan Road .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do like the location itself and driving down some of those dark side streets just adds to the atmosphere .Wait Entertainment : They did have some concessions outside so that was a plus .The waiting area is inside so no need to worry about getting wet or cold .A few actors walking around and the waiting area is somewhat similar to the way it was set up at their old location .It was the first time for some of the people i was with and they were impressed by the wait area .Length of Event : I did not specifically time the event but if i had to take a guess i would say it is for sure upwards of 30minutes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Patron Flow Inside Attraction : While walking thru pathways and scenes we never ran into other groups until the wristband check points and Buried Alive .Appropriate Ages : I would follow their guidelines because they will deny you entry if you try and bring a little kid .Props / Special FX : All of the stationary and handheld props looked great , but some of the mechanical props appeared to be off timing or moving to slow to really surprise us .Special FX were great , I think the foam / snow section was the most tripped out for me and the first time i ever scene that in a haunted house .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like someone else stated there are very few people wearing masks and this just adds to the overall feeling and detail required to scare people .Summary : Overall I really enjoyed DoD and the new location .I would encourage anyone looking to spend more than average time ( 10 - 15 minutes ) in a haunt to visit the house .The acting was good , the costumes , props and fx were good , and the length of this event is well above average .SO it is kind of in the back of my head that i drove more than an hour away to miss some part of the attraction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Cracks me up every time .I personally felt this was the worst musical in recent years .I kept wishing it would end I I found myself chronically bored by \" Bohemia \" at the end of the movie , very dull , and dispite so many good actors , it seemed like a bad high school version put on film .Hated it .I never had high hopes for this film since I do n't usually like musicals ( the exceptions being Chicago , Grease , and well , Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory ) , but my sister rented it so I decided to give it a shot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I enjoyed every minute of it , and I thought the songs and acting were very well done .I felt a wierd sense of joy while watching this that I really ca n't explain .I 'm definately going to add this to my collection as soon as I get the chance .I hated this movie possibly more than any other movie in recent memory .I think part of my hate stems from the fact that my entire high school ended up becoming essentially infatuated with it .I actually had someone call me \" heartless \" because I hated the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The storyline is weak , and the songs are n't THAT great .The acting in the movie was mostly poor , and the ending ... don't get me started !THANK YOU JESUS ! ! ! !FINALLY A POSITIVE REVIEW ! ! ! ! !After Entertainment Weekly and the NY Times , there were practly NO glowing reviews I can think of .AWESOME REVIEW !Oh , and you 'd be surprised how much of the coreography was simmilary to the play .Much of Today For You , Light My Candle and La Vie Boheme was inspired or simply transplanted directly from the play , along with many others .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is brillant and the music is classic .I love the DVD that Sony has produced , there is so much stuff to it .I do have to agree that \" Rent \" is a very long movie and a choir to sit through .I suggest that you only view it if you know what you getting into .Some of the charecters are very intresting to say the least and I know of a few viewers who did not understand some of the charecters and their story archs .But if \" Rent \" is you thing , by all means , rent or even buy the DVD because , in my opinion its a great film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
