{"text": "PERSONAL EXPERIENCE I first encountered IMDB in my teens when I was looking for information about films online .It very soon became the go - to source of information used by both me and my friends whenever we were trying to decide what film we should rent or go see in the cinema .In my university days I did a module on the film business , and I was surprised that my tutor recommended IMDB as a source for our papers .I then gained additional respect for the web site .It does seem to be the core film industry web site .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "CONCLUSION IMDB is probably the single most comprehensiev and informative source of information on films and the people involved with them .It is constantly growing and is continually updated .It pretty much renders any other film websites useless .Comments .Definitely worth checking the website out !IMDb stands for Internet Movie Database and is a comprehensive collection of all the films and television series released since around the early 1900s .You can search for any film or episode to read an overview or an in depth summary of the entire plot .For each search you can find a full list of the actors and actresses that have acted in the production or participated as an extra , with the most featured , or first seen ( in the film ) at the top of the list .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In my opinion , IMDb is the best site as it gives you a whole host of information on nearly any film or television release that you are interested in from the past or a new / future issue in the cinema .When using IMDb to search , you are always able to find out a full synopsis with spoilers , written by people in that previously you did n't know about .I tend to use this site when I can not work out where I have seen an individual from one film and when I know that they have been in another that I have also seen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Using this search is easy with any actor / actress / director / film / TV program ( or anyone else involved with a program or film ) being typed in and a list of the most popular choices then being shown .Alternatively you can often just type it in using Google followed by ' imdb ' and hit \" I 'm feeling lucky \" , and it will lead you to the correct page .Once on the page you will be surrounded by all the information you could need .On a film 's page for example it will have a list of clickable links for all of the cast , still pictures , user comments and ratings , release date(s ) , genre , tagline and the plot protected by a spoiler alert .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This allows for all of the information to be available but avoids having the film / program spoiled for you ( there is nothing worse than someone ruining the end of a good film by telling you the ending ! )Actor 's and actresses pages are equally as informative with d.o.b , full names , awards history and full filmographies ( each one clickable , leading you to the film / program ) and showing you what their role was in each film .The ease of the site often leads you following link after link learning new things about actors and films and forgetting why you visited the site in the first place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
