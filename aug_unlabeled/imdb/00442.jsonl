{"text": "I hope .Indiewire has partnered with Time Warner Cable Movies On Demand to kick off Indie Film Month .Go HERE daily for movie reviews , interviews , and exclusive footage of the suggested TWC movie of the day and catch the best Indie titles on TWC Movies On Demand .I think the film critic Emanuel Levy sums up the criteria for what an independent film consists of rather well .One is based on the way indies are financed , the other focuses on their spirit or vision .According to the first view , any film financed outside Hollywood is independent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In his review of Smooth Talk , David Denby wrote , \" Everything in the movie is a bit off .Like many independent directors , Joyce Chopra dislikes the Hollywood convention of tight storytelling .She just lets things play , and with an actress like Laura Dern , that strategy can lead to revelations .\" Fox Searchlight 's Lindsay Law , claims that \" the most important thing when a filmmaker says he is an independent , is that somebody can not beat him into a pulp and force him to make a movie that the financier wants .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Strictly speaking , Spike Lee has made only two indies : She 's Got ta Have It ( 1986 ) , distributed by Island , and Gi rl 6 ( 1996 ) , released by Fox Searchlight .But where does Get on the Bus ( 1996 ) fit in ?It was independently financed by black patrons , then picked for distribution by a major studio , Columbia .To complicate matters further , some of Lee 's studio movies - Do the Ri ght Thi ng ( Columbia ) and Clocke rs ( Universal)-are more independent in spirit than Girl 6 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Krevoy also emphasizes the distribution issue : \" If there is distribution attached to a film before it 's made , I am not sure how independent it really is . \" The budget 's size is a criterion too .In the past , IFP / West , which confers the Spirit Awards , limited award consideration to films with low budgets .Those who care about the quality of indies are concerned with the current lack of radically political and avant - garde visions , which had characterized the earlier American independent cinema .Indies have become more and more conventional , more mainstream .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To what extent do indies challenge the status quo ?How far can indies go if they are produced and distributed within a profit - oriented system ?The media curator Bill Horrigan distinguishes between two notions of indies : those that are acceptable to Sundance and those whose contents and styles render them virtually unshowable .Horrigan 's point of reference is the work of a particular strand of independent filmmakers , from the 1940s through the early 1970s , that includes Maya Deren , Jonas Mekas , Stan Brakhage , Kenneth Anger , and Andy Warhol .The critic Peter Lunenfeld does not fault young directors for their desire to make large - budget productions- Hollywood has always relied on careerism for its vitality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Given the decline of radical film practice , the question of what should be celebrated in independent cinema remains a potent one .Historical , technological , and market conditions have always dictated the agenda of independent film .At the very least , one can suggest what American independent cinema is not : It 's not avant - garde , it 's not experimental , and it 's not underground .The first and most important force driving independent cinema is the need of young filmmakers , many of whom are outsiders , to express themselves artistically .These young artists create alternative films that are different , challenging the status quo with visions that have been suppressed or ignored by the more conservative mainstream .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Commerce has overwhelmed art , which is why Hollywood movies are n't as good as they used to be , \" observed former Disney chair Jeffrey Katzenberg .Indie films are \" the opposite of Hollywood , where they try and make pictures that fit a pre - existing audience , \" noted the filmmaker L. M. Kit Carson .\" Indie films are from the gut . \"In today 's Hollywood , Chris Hanley 's Muse Productions and James Robinson 's Morgan Creek are both considered independents .Hanley has never made a picture for more than $ 5 million , but has tried to make all his pictures edgy and controversial .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Two different conceptions of independent film can be found .One is based on the way indies are financed , the other focuses on their spirit or vision .The most important thing when a filmmaker says he is an independent , is that somebody can not beat him into a pulp and force him to make a movie that the financier wants .( Art over profit ) .If there is distribution attached to a film before it 's made , I am not sure how independent it really is .The budget 's size is a criterion too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Mean Streets was made on a $ 500,000 budget , and though it had distribution , it was not filmed in the studio by any means .When you receive financing from Hollywood , there are strings attached -- the filmmaker therefore must compromise with their true vision .This limits artistic creativity .Indies are just as much about spirit and the artistic technical methods used , as they are about the budget and distribution .Mean Streets was independent to the core .Scorsese had full artistic control , in contrast to his previous film dealing with the post - Depression era .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This lead to the creation of Mean Streets , whose characters were all based on Scorsese 's life events and ideas .Scorsese had the financing and distribution , but his Mean Streets masterpiece is one of the exceptions .He brought the Italian culture to the American mainstream , something Hollywood was afraid to do .Charlie Coppa is literally named after his parents , while a majority of the script was written while Scorsese was driving around in a car .A lot of the dialogue was improv between the actors .Further , the film was shot with an 8 mm lens in the 70s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This stuff simply does not happen on a studio set .This is why Scorsese is considered to be one of the most influential filmmakers of all time ; his bold vision was motivated by self - expression .Hollywood wants to top box charts , and in order to do this , they must appeal to the general audience .Independence has nothing to do with a film 's plot , lighting , ending , use of music or anything involved with the storytelling - that 's bunk .Fairly laughable to lump independent movies as all lacking something in the storytelling or the essential \" look \" of a movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
