{"text": "Written by : Michel Hazanavicius .You never know when the next great movie is going to arrive .Sometimes , a simple story told exceedingly well can do it .Other times , a gripping and deeply profound documentary or insightful dramatic film can get you buzzing .But as I learned when seeing Michel Hazanavicius ' incredible The Artist , even with an absence of words , the motion picture can again be glorious , affirming , and affecting .An homage to the end of one era and the advent of another , The Artist is a silent film , circa 2011 , shot in black and white , and exhibited as a film made in the late 1920s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hazanavicius is a studied and well - read fan of the silent era of motion pictures and has a flair for directing over - the - top comedies ( his French spy spoof OSS 117 films for example ) .He has a confident hand in knowing how to make this concept , this \" gimmick \" as some have called it , soar magically .Front and center is a story which is familiar , tragic , and prescient of the movie industry as it exists today ; where big name talents are few and the road to glory is a treacherous ride to endure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He is a song - and - dance - man , loved by everyone , with anything he wants simply a snap of the fingers away .He is kind - hearted , handsome , dazzles and seduces audiences , and entertains effortlessly .George , however , just keeps on working and at the premiere of his latest blockbuster , \" A Russian Affair \" , he stumbles quite literally into the woman who will change his life forever , Peppy Miller ( B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo ) .Miller is a fan of Valentin and the movies and has desires to work in the pictures someday .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Valentin poses for pictures with the young woman and instantly people want to know more and more about her .With George contracted to Kinograph Studios , the young actress is brought in by the head of the studio , Al Zimmer ( John Goodman ) , who casts her as an extra in Valentin 's next film .The connection is immediate between George and Peppy and with Doris on her way out the door , George and Peppy begin to fall for one another .Soon , Peppy is not a mere extra but she is more prominently featured in movie after movie and rather quickly she is taking supporting roles in movies with and without George Valentin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kinograph Films are ceasing operations in silent film productions and investing their money in the \" talkies .\" Valentin is distraught , worried , and begins to wonder what the future holds for him .Meanwhile , Peppy Miller has been signed to take part in one of Kinograph 's first \" talkies \" and her name is quickly enveloping Hollywood 's billboards and marquees .The thing that I am most excited about when it comes to talking about and sharing my thoughts on The Artist is simply how easily you become immersed with it .For today 's audiences , the realization of \" Wait , there really is n't any talking in this ... like at all ? \" will be a hurdle to overcome , but a small one I hope .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hazanavicius , who also wrote the screenplay , adroitly surprises with things you certainly do not expect when watching a silent film , but unlike most novelties , gimmicks , or cleverly faddish ideas , The Artist is genuine through and through .Jean Dujardin is perfection as George Valentin .No other actor on the planet could have pulled off this performance or been as believable in the role .Dujardin is , for only another few minutes or so , largely unknown in America .If you ever have the time to seek out his OSS 117 films made with Hazanavicius , the timing , the talent , and the comedic sensibilities Dujardin brings to this role are not at all surprising .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Embodying early cinematic glamour and looking every bit the part is B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo as Peppy Miller .Bejo , the wife of Hazanavicius and co - star of one of Dujardin 's OSS 117 films , is a breathtaking beauty who the camera simply adores .She has a passion and playful charm all her own .Without the benefit of dialogue , she radiates emotion effortlessly and the chemistry she generates with Dujardin is memorable .I love this film .I love the scope , the idea , the intent .I love the audacity of creating something like this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Michel Hazanavicius and his cast have succeeded in that regard and I , for one , am most appreciative .The inevitable backlash may be beginning because , as of the time of this writing , The Artist has started to rack up countless critics ' prizes and nominations from the most influential of film award organizations .As a result , it is expected to be at or near the top of the list for the most nominations with the upcoming Academy Awards nomination announcement in January 2012 .Every ounce of success and accolade levied upon The Artist is deserved in my opinion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I proudly give it my highest rating and recommendation .Should I See It ?YES .Exquisitely created and brilliantly conceived from start to finish , The Artist is a revelation which satisfies on every level .There has been no more enjoyable or satisfying film I have seen in 2011 .I loved every single moment of the film and never stopped smiling .Jean Dujardin .Also , co - star B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo is quite impressive as Dujardin 's love interest and matches him scene for scene , generating palpable chemistry , all without uttering one line of dialogue .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Artist is a film I want to share with everyone I know .NO .If ever a film was custom - made to be dismissed by hipsters , purists , and contrarians , here you go .Have at it .Call it a gimmick .Call it pointless .Go bang your head into the wall , while the rest of us are having a fantastic time .The use of title cards will cause some people to recoil , although in all honesty , if you are angry that this film is what it is , I can not help you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
