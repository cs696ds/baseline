{"text": "Quite decent cinematography and well directed by Sam Mendes .This I say , relatively obviously .I feel its the best bond movie made and having Javier Bardem play a sinister villain added to the whole offering .The plot is a no brainer like the entire franchise but they did make the flow interesting for me to at least pay attention during the entire movie .It 's definitely worth a watch on the big screen if you have nothing else better to do .Would rate it 7/10 .On the one hand this is incredibly retarded , but on the other , I admire its devotion to balls - out , throat - ripping , pants - wetting horror , and it has a lot more going on than any Paranormal Activity movie , for whatever that 's worth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This is a brilliant romantic comedy film , but a poor horror film .For character development and acting , I would give this a much higher score , but I think this was really trying its hand at being a horror film , which it fails at .But the horror elements , involving a ghostly mistress haunting the halls , are not well done at all , feeling forced in , lazily written and overall pretty weakly done .At the end of the movie I was just scratching my head , because it did n't really make any sense .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
