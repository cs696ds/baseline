{"text": "The first Star Wars film was released on May 25 , 1977 .Some who were around back then remember it as vividly as if it were yesterday .Lucasfilm is throwing a five - day party for the anniversary in Los Angeles , where fans are awaiting the rumored announcement of a new film .Wanna celebrate ?For starters , you can bake an anniversary cake .Or catch up with the original cast members .Or just remember the first time you saw Star Wars .Those of you who were not yet born in 1977 have no idea what an experience it was to see this movie , without knowing what to expect .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In 1977 , most theaters did n't have multiple screens , and new movies did n't go to every small town on opening weekend .So it was later in the summer when Star Wars became available in my area .I was working at a tourist trap near a state park for the summer .The guy I was seeing and his roommate wanted to see this new science fiction film I had never heard of .We had a few daiquiris before driving about 40 miles to the nearest theater , where it was opening night locally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Its all a bit fuzzy now , but I fell asleep in the theater and missed most of the film .I awoke as the medal ceremony was showing .All the way back , the two guys were raving about how great the movie was , and I felt a bit cheated .But it did n't take much to talk them into seeing it again a few days later , when I was properly impressed .Each time I 've seen a new Star Wars movie since then , I get a little flashback of that summer when I see the opening crawl .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In 1977 I was roaming the unfinished apartments near my own , racing my bike through lake - sized parking lot puddles and drawing tits on the walls .I was grumbly and glum , besieged by some haunting guilt , living in a part of the world ill defined and gripped by a sadness and horror from a war that had overstayed its welcome and killed the children to boot .People were alcoholic , poor as fuck , pissed off , unemployed , and waiting for some kind of leadership .Nixon had let us down , fucked up no matter whom you asked .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "White House fundraisers with a cash bar and peanuts ?Was he insane ?Then Star Wars came out .Fucking hell .You want to know why that thing exploded ?Actually , my most vivid memory of Star Wars is that of the previews , not the film itself .You should have heard the cheers in the theater when the first Imperial Cruiser appeared onscreen in that preview , signifying , for the first time ever , that dazzling special effects had finally arrived in a science - fiction film .( Never mind the fact that you should not have been able to hear all those sounds in the vacuum of space . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My next - vivid memory is how crowded the theater was when I did finally see the film that summer of 1977 - there was not an empty seat in the house - and how noisy the crowd was .I missed a good deal of dialogue and had to see it several more times to catch everything .Hmmm - maybe that was their plan all along .Today , however , I find the film painful to watch .Dialogue is corny , acting is hammy , scripting is , well , Lucasesque at best , and one is left wondering why hordes of Imperial Stormtroopers are such bad shots relative to a princess who should have never even held a blaster before using one the first time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The first time I saw Star Wars was the week after it opened , at the Loew 's 86thStreet Theatre , which was one of the last grand movie houses in New York City , with newly - installed Dolby stereo , and a wide - screen .For months afterwards , I styled my hair like Luke Skywalker-- yes , I even had hair , and it was blonde , dammit !-- I was so blown away by the movie .The scenes I remember best are when Luke is standing on top of a mound at sunset , pondering his fate of being stuck on a desert planet , the first hyperspace scene ( boy , were n't we all blown away by that ! ) , and practically crying when Artoo Detoo comes out all shiny and fixed in the medal awards ceremony . .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Since I was only a little over 3 feet tall at the time , my parents would n't let me go outside until the walk was shoveled .Instead , my Dad suggested we watch \" Star Wars \" which was debuting that morning on HBO .To a 4 year old , this sounded like a horrible alternative to cartoons or a day in the snow .Not surprisingly , from the opening sequence we were glued to the set .By the end of the movie , my brother and I were jumping off of furniture , fighting with broomstick light sabers , and causing so much trouble that our parents threw us out of the house and let us take our chances in the snow .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's really been 30 years ?I was only ..... ?I first saw Star Wars from the \" stiff - neck \" seats - you know , the ones where you get whiplash and crossed - eyes from trying to follow the action on a screen that feels as if it were an appendage surgically attached to the tip of your nose !I was stunned , mystified and delighted at the incredible special effects and that stirring score by John Williams .( The only other movie even close to giving me that kind of reaction was \" Raiders of the Lost Ark. \" )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A science fiction fan since my youth , I had found and seen the Holy Grail !Bar none , it was the best and most exhilarating movie experience ever !By the time I was 12 years old , I was already a science fiction fanatic , busily working my way through the oeuvre of Robert A. Heinlein , with side excursions into the works of Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov .So you might imagine that , when a movie called \" Star Wars \" came out , I would find a way to see it , and I managed to wrangle a trip to the movies with my neighbor , Mike .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But I still wet my pants a little when James Earl Jones says \" This ... is CNN .\" But I did go see the movie shortly after its release , and was blown away .From the opening crawl of words , \" A long time ago in a galaxy far , far away ... \" growing smaller as they moved up the screen , this was unlike any movie I 'd ever seen .The detail was simply phenomenal .The sound filled the theater in a way none of us movie - goers had ever experienced .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You have to understand , that up until this , movie sound did n't travel from side to side with what you saw on the screen .It was mind - blowing .I loved the mystical aspects of the storytelling .Me and everyone else walked out truly believing in \" the force \" .Of course I did already , I just did n't have a name for it - LOL .Thanks for the opportunity to share these memories !May the force be with you ( Yoou know I could n't resist - LOL ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
