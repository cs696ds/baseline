{"text": "This piece details the Count Basie vs. Chick Webb big band music Battle Of Swing held at Harlem 's Savoy Ballroom in January of 1938 .Tommy Dorsey was born the second son of Irishman Thomas Francis Dorsey , Sr . , a music teacher and band director in Shenandoah , Pennsylvania 21 months after his , also famous , brother Jimmy .After receiving music instruction from his father , Tommy played both trumpet and trombone in his early years .While still in his teens he played in local bands along with his brother Jimmy .The Dorsey Brothers played in a series of bands in the 1920s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The brothers later settled in New York as session musicians for the radio studios .Tommy and Jimmy waxed their first records as The Dorsey Brothers Orchestra using a pick - up band for the Okeh label in 1927 .In 1934 they organized a full time band and signed with Decca Records .Big success had been following both brothers since 1928 when they broke into the charts with a recording of Coquette .By 1935 they had one of the hottest bands in the country and may well have been the band that ushered in the Swing era instead of Benny Goodman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After a bitter disagreement on the bandstand in May of 1935 ( some say a fist fight )Tommy left the band for good .While Jimmy continued to lead the band , Tommy took over the remnants of an orchestra led by Joe Haymes leading it under his own name by the fall of 1935 .By the end of 1935 TD had four hits peak in the top ten of the charts .In January of 1936 he had his first # 1 hit on a song called The Music Goes Round And Round that featured a vocal by Edythe Wright .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "See the article below for details on Tommy Dorsey during this phenomenal period .In 1945 the band began to change again with the addition of trumpeter Charlie Shavers .Soon more modern and still swinging recordings spotlighting musicians like clarinetist Buddy De Franco , drummer Louie Bellson and arranger Bill Finnegan were being laid down .Inevitably , in the mid 1940s the Dorsey Brothers began to patch up their differences occasionally performing and recording together .In 1953 Jimmy joined up with Tommy permanently , billing the band once again as The Dorsey Brothers Orchestra .Television specials followed and their program called Stage Show ran regularly once a week during the 1955 - 1956 season .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sedated by sleeping pills and following a heavy meal , Tommy Dorsey accidentally choked to death in his sleep on November 26th , 1956 at the age of 51 .His brother led his band briefly afterward , but Jimmy Dorsey died in 1957 .Below you will find more colorful and detailed musings about Tommy Dorsey , his recordings and his bands by Swing era authority John Cooper .Mr. Cooper has authored liner notes for a number of CDs .TOMMY DORSEY : THE KING OF SWING / DANCE BANDS by John Cooper .Tommy Dorsey has been overlooked lately for reasons not totally clear to me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And in front if it all , Mr. Tommy Dorsey himself , standing tall in a gleaming white suit with that shining trombone ready to go and looking after the needs of dancers and listeners 24/7 .He could be a rugged guy offstage or to work for , but on stage , he was THERE for the paying customers ... and for the kids .Just one HELL of a band !Way past its due recognition from the current crop of Swing dancers and listeners .Some random thoughts on Tommy Dorsey .Well , Git It !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Great sidemen with great solos .Sy Oliver : the man behind Lunceford and Tommy Dorsey !You must hear the other choice Dorsey swing stuff from the 1940 - 1942 era .Powerful and swinging .... even the pop tunes kick along .Buddy Rich did for Dorsey exactly what he had done for Artie Shaw ; More Power ! ! !3 HUGE egos ( at least ) in one band : Dorsey , Rich , and Sinatra with a big rivalry between Rich and Sinatra .I 've read that if the band was playing a ballad that Sinatra was singing and that Rich thought was too slow , he would sit up there with his arms folded and not even play his drums !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , they were both young and talented and Rich could also sing and dance very well .I guess they grew up a bit as the years went by ( or when they did n't have to work with each other ) .There 's another story of either Rich or Sinatra throwing a full glass pitcher of ice water at the other one 's head and it smashed up against a pillar .Wow ! Danger !Blues In the Night with Dorsey and Jo Stafford .Yes , that 's a smoky one !It 's one of the few versions of Blues In The Night that I like almost all the way through .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Tommy Dorsey / Jo Stafford comes the very closest .Did you know that that recording was never originally released on a 78 rpm Victor disc ?I think it 's still available on CD from Reader 's Digest .If not , the LP sets turn up all the time , fairly cheaply .I was watching film clips tonight of the Tommy Dorsey band and Buddy Rich is always up there swinging away with this cocky look on his face , even when he 's wearing that Louis the XVI wig in \" Du Barry Was a Lady \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That was a kick ass band .Tommy was always punching someone out .His famous nightclub brawl with actor Jon Hall made all the newspapers .It takes that kind of extra edge and aggressiveness to make a really great and memorable band .And , essentially , all these men made their initial mark on Swing history in the space of just a few years .My favorite Tommy Dorsey band on record is the band from 1940 - 1942 .I think it is Tommy Dorsey at his peak with great sidemen , great singers and great arrangements , great songs , great specialties , great spirit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Their \" Complete Tommy Dorsey \" series on Bluebird LPs made it all the way to 1939 ... and then died !Collectors were groaning ! ! !\"A fair amount of the material has made it out , but much has not .Naturally , all the Sinatra / Tommy Dorsey sides were issued in that big box set and all the Pied Pipers sides with Tommy Dorsey came out recently on a 2 CD set , but that still leaves all the hot numbers scattered here and there .All those barnburners featuring all his \" ride \" men like Buddy Rich , Ziggy Elman , Don Lodice , Chuck Peterson , Heinie Beau and those raging Sy Oliver arrangements ... sooooooooooo roaring and with such an edge and bite to them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "ANOTHER ONE OF THEM THINGS SERENADE TO THE SPOT WELL , GIT IT !SWINGTIME UP IN HARLEM BLUE SKIES QUIET , PLEASE NOT SO QUIET , PLEASE DEEP RIVER and lots more .Also , the pop tunes are extremely good and very few of them go by without a good solo or two and some real kick from the band .Bottom line is , due to RCA 's lapse of reissues of his best stuff , TD is falling into the ' legend ' category ; remembered for his name and a few hits , but forgotten for many other things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The man had a 17 piece band , six singers and when he added that string section and a harp , he had it all .He was also in more Hollywood movies than any other bandleader with the possible exception of Harry James .I think that Tommy Dorsey made better use of his string section than any other big name and was a pre - war pioneer in that area , along with Harry James and Artie Shaw .After the war , quite a few bands had string sections , but by that time Tommy Dorsey , Harry James and Artie Shaw had dropped theirs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His band of that period is beginning to turn into what Basie was to become in the 50s and 60s , a very smooth and skillful sounding studio band .Tommy 's 1950s recordings are about the same , but more so .The ballads are very mellow , but more like \" easy listening \" music .The swinging charts are still well played , but with what I feel is a lack of inner fire .Heck , he even got one of those college guy flat top hair cuts in the fifties in order to stay current and all it did was to make him look older than he was .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There was still fine music from Mr. Dorsey , but he had to know it was over .Battle of the Bands .I was having a discussion about bands and was about to state who I thought had the best ' all around ' dance band of the Swing era .My friend thought I was going to cite Glenn Miller , but I named Tommy Dorsey as my number one choice in the \" sweet / swing \" category ( as Metronome Magazine used to term it ) .I do n't think any other band handled both styles of music , sweet and Swing , as well as Tommy Dorsey 's band did .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His sweet numbers were the height of taste and musicality and his Swing numbers rocked the house .By the time he hit his peak in the years of 1940 - 1945 , he had been on top so long , that money was no object .He hired the best in every category ; instrumentalists , vocalists , arrangers , songwriters .Music was his life .He owned one of the first hi - fi sets in the country and one of the best bands in America .Dorsey in the 30s vs Dorsey in the 40s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This was a daring move as it required him to let go two very popular vocalists and any number of sidemen and taking on a new principal arranger ( Sy Oliver ) and six ( ! ) new vocalists : Frank Sinatra and Connie Haines ( both out of Harry James ' band ) and Jo Stafford plus the three man vocal group , the Pied Pipers .His sweet style went from the most sophisticated sounds of the 30s to a bit more robust sound suited to the times .Many Dorsey ballads of the 1940 - 1945 period have a kick to them in the first chorus or final chorus .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The 30s Dorsey swing / jazz had been fine and exciting , with the best of it at the top of its form .Sy Oliver brought it into the 1940s .With the new personnel and attitudes and arrangements , the entire band took on a new edge and excitement .The Dorsey pop tunes took on a new type of pulse with lots of Swing touches and the pure Swing charts are completely hot as hell , almost manic at times .They wail , they blast ; they just knock you over or make you dance with a fever .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
