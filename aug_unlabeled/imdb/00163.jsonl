{"text": "share : .Johnny Weissmuller - 8/3 .As a public figure , Johnny Weissmuller is remembered today for two separate achievements , and each is impressive in its own right .He was one of the greatest swimmers of the 20th century , winning several Olympic gold medals and smashing world records .He was also the most famous actor to have played Edgar Rice Burroughs ' classic character Tarzan in the movies .The writer William Janz wrote in 1980 , \" When we say Tarzan , we mean Weissmuller . \"Although today , Johnny Weissmuller the actor may not be as familiar to younger audiences as he once was , Johnny Weissmuller the Olympic champion still inspires young swimmers , like nine - time world champion marathon swimmer Petar Stoychev of Bulgaria .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" The wax figure of Johnny Weissmuller was the first thing I saw .He was swimming with his head above the water all the time and he still swam 100 m freestyle [ in ] less than a minute .\" Who was Johnny Weissmuller ?It has been suggested that he claimed to be born in the United States so that he would qualify for the US Olympic team .Wherever he was born and whatever his real name may have been , what is known is that he grew up on the mean streets of Chicago .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hoods were real big in those days , back there in Chicago .And I was always what was the most regular thing to be . \" In his later years , he would debunk the stories of his childhood created by Howard Strickling , head of the MGM publicity machine . \"He had me taking up swimming to get over a childhood illness that left me skinny and underweight .Bull !I do n't think I was ever sick a day when I was a kid and as for being underweight , I bet my folks wished I had of been .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And Howard also told everybody I went to the University of Chicago , too .Well , I did .To use their swimming tank , you know .Later .But as for being a student there - they tell me you got to graduate at least from grade school to do that .And I never did .\" Weissmuller frequently ditched school to go to Lake Michigan and swim .At 15 , he was spotted in that lake by Bill Bachrach , a swimming coach at the Illinois Athletic Club , who later told an interviewer that Weissmuller did a few laps while Bachrach timed him . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also the stroke he used was the oddest thing I think I ever saw - no form , nothing .But the stopwatch told it all ; nearly record time , and the kid was n't even trying . \"He was soon under Bachrach 's coaching and in 1922 , he won the national 50 and 200 yard championships .Bachrach said that until he retired from swimming , \" Johnny never lost a race .Never ! \" When asked what he was most proud of , Weissmuller named the 67 swimming records he held .50 of those records remained on the books for almost twenty years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the 1928 Amsterdam Olympics , Weissmuller won the 100 meters again , which he called his most exciting moment in sports .During that race , he did what he 'd always feared , swallowing a mouthful of water while swimming .\" I knew the lights would go out and I wondered what in the hell I 'd do if it ever happened to me .Sure enough , it happened as I made the turn , the only turn , of course , in the race .I dipped down and came up with a lungful of water .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I felt like blacking out .I swallowed the stuff , and lost two valuable yards .Those other guys were really churning .Lucky for me , we still had 40 yards to go .If we 'd have had only 10 I 'd never had made it .\" Weissmuller won the race and also served as anchorman for the US Relay Team that won the Gold Medal .After his swimming career was over , he became a model for BVD underwear for $ 500 a week , with a five year contract , but in 1931 , only two years into his contract , he went to Hollywood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Soon after he arrived , the writer Cyril Hume spotted him in a swimming pool and suggested he try out for a film he was working on , Tarzan the Ape Man ( 1932 ) .Weissmuller said later , \" I laughed at him .I knew I could n't act . \"Hume approached him again the next day and asked him to reconsider .The screen test was made , in which Weissmuller was asked to take off his shirt .The director looked him up and down , \" much like a horse doctor examines a sick animal and then he said , ' This is the man we have been looking for , ' and that is how I came to be in the movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Weissmuller said of the experience , \" I went to the back lot at MGM , they gave me a G - string and said , ' Can you climb a tree ?Can you pick up that girl ? 'I could do all that , and I did all my own swinging because I was a YMCA champion on the gymnastic rings .\" Apart from the physical feats , Tarzan was most famous for his yell , which the MGM special effects department created from the recorded sounds of a camel , a dog , a hyena , a violin G - string , and Weissmuller yodeling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Originally , Tarzan was an English lord and well - spoken , but the Tarzan of MGM spoke haltingly and seemed , for all his physical feats , to be childlike .The public did n't care - Tarzan the Ape Man was a smash .For a time , it was also surprisingly modern .In the days before the Hollywood censors cracked down on sex in the movies , Tarzan and His Mate ( 1934 ) featured a nude underwater swimming scene of Maureen O'Sullivan ( actually a double ) with Weissmuller .O'Sullivan later claimed that she had to leave town for a while until the scandal blew over .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Throughout the series , Maureen O'Sullivan was often pregnant with one of her seven children , and according to Weissmuller , had to be filmed \" carrying baskets of fruit in front of her . \"Tarzan and Jane also became parents in the series , adopting a child , Boy ( Johnny Sheffield ) , in Tarzan Finds a Son !Sheffield remembered Weissmuller fondly , saying . \"He was like a father to me .He was always looking out for me .We worked with a lot of live animals , and a lot of times , when they got tired , the animals would get feisty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But Big John stuck his leg between me and the chimp , and he was the one who was bitten .Looking back on his time as Tarzan , Weissmuller admitted , \" It was like stealing .There was swimming in it , and I did n't have much to say .How can a guy climb trees , say ' Me Tarzan , you Jane , ' and make a million ? \"But he did .What he did n't get were residuals when the films aired on television or a percentage of the profits - until late in his career .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" I really wanted to say a line or two , and besides , somebody had finally gotten some basic fact about income tax through my thick head .I did n't own a bit of the Tarzan shows - I just had a salary - so I went looking for something else .\" When his contract with MGM was over , Weissmuller moved over to RKO studios for the Jungle Jim series in 1948 and Sheffield came with him ( Maureen O'Sullivan left the Tarzan series after Tarzan 's New York Adventure in 1942 ) .Of course , Weissmuller had tried to escape the Tarzan character by appearing in Swamp Fire in 1946 but it did n't bring better acting opportunities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I took one look [ at it ] and went back to the jungle . \"His last Tarzan film , Tarzan and the Mermaids had been released in 1948 , and now , for the first time in 16 years , he was no longer associated with the Tarzan franchise .Weissmuller began the Jungle Jim series for Columbia that same year , which he described as \" Tarzan wearing a shirt , but they were making money for me , so I did n't mind too much .Kind of missed Tarzan , though . \"Jungle Jim would become a television series for the 1955 - 56 season with Weissmuller in the title role .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He then moved to Florida in the 1960s to serve as Director at the Swimming Hall of Fame .In 1973 , he became a greeter for a Las Vegas hotel until a fall broke his leg .During his hospitalization , he suffered the first of a series of heart attacks and strokes .These caused him a long stay in the hospital , before being transferred to the Motion Picture Country Hospital in Woodland Hills , California .There , he is reported to have frequently done his \" Tarzan yell \" in the middle of the night , which disturbed the other residents .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
