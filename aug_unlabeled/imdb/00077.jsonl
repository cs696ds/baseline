{"text": "The Conversations : Terrence Malick Part II : The Tree of Life .The Conversations is a House feature in which Jason Bellamy and Ed Howard discuss a wide range of cinematic subjects : critical analyses of films , filmmaker overviews , and more .Readers should expect to encounter spoilers .Jason Bellamy : Terrence Malick 's fifth film had n't crawled beyond Cannes , New York or Los Angeles before speculation intensified about the director 's future projects .Malick will turn 68 this November , but barring any health problems it seems safe to assume we have n't seen the last of him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's epic , daring and almost painfully heartfelt .It 's ambiguous and overt .It deals in spirituality and science .It 's the summation of all that Malick seemed to be and a doorway to something beyond that .It 's an unmistakably personal film - a conclusion I reached long before I learned that it 's quasi - autobiographical , too .It 's the kind of film you might expect from a director who worries that he might never make another one - a pull - out - all - the - stops , bounce - the - check - to - the - undertaker , this - time - for - sure purging of the soul .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's his most challenging film , and perhaps his messiest , too .But when I watch The Tree of Life I 'm overwhelmed by the sense that I 'm witnessing the work of a filmmaker who feels he has run out of time for holding back .Ed Howard :It 's such a daring film , totally .That is not a complaint that could be applied to most of The Tree of Life , but strangely enough , not because Malick has gone fully in one direction or another .Instead , I think he 's just reached a more assured balance between those two impulses - at least for part of the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is , I think , quite simply the best thing Malick has ever made , and it perfectly addresses my earlier criticisms about the unsatisfying narrative currents in his most recent films .That childhood sequence is a total masterpiece .The Tree of Life as a whole is not , I do n't think , but it 's certainly a very interesting film and , yes , a messy one , and also a very personal one .Parts of it are amazing .Parts of it are overblown and silly .Parts of it are overblown and silly and amazing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And then there 's the ending , which very nearly extinguished the good feelings I had about the hour leading up to this nauseatingly new agey coda .That this film contains some of Malick 's most remarkable work and , as we 've both already hinted , some of his worst , suggests that The Tree of Life is indeed an ambitious film , a film that takes bold risks that do n't always pay off .As always , I admire Malick for that willingness to take risks , even as I wince at the moments where his results fall short of his ambitions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "JB : Absolutely .The \" coda , \" by which I mean everything that happens after the O'Briens drive away from their Waco home , has to be the most awkward sequence in Malick 's filmography - cheesy , clich\u00e9d and feeble .I can argue in favor of what it tries to do but not what it is .The sequence succeeds in demonstrating Jack 's emotional catharsis , in a mathematical or architectural way , but it fails to actually conjure that emotion , to resonate .Critic at large Steven Boone , who shares our disappointment with this sequence , argued that its inelegance is a direct result of its heavy - handed fabrication .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( Malick 's films are twice found , really . )In this coda , however , Malick seems to be directing the action , creating a scenario to meet a specific vision rather than letting the action come to him .EH :Yeah , the problems with the ending are legion , but the biggest one is how schematic it feels .In terms of style and approach , it 's the complete opposite of the material that preceds it .The childhood scenes are so rich in character nuance and observational detail .It 's all so specific ; this story is apparently autobiographical for Malick , and it shows .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This story is thematically resonant , but the ideas being expressed through these characters - typically Malickian musings on elemental human attributes like love , control , ambition , loss , guilt , maturation - don't feel forced or preachy .Instead , these ideas arise naturally from the characters ' interactions , and from the evocative , elliptical style that Malick uses to tell the story .Why does Malick feel this need to literalize , at the last moment , the spiritual , abstract concepts that are expressed so movingly through the more grounded narrative sections ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I feel similarly about the mother 's acceptance of her child 's death , which is a fine idea but an awful scene .She 's bathed in white light , flanked by a pair of anonymous young women ( angels I guess ? ) and repeatedly making the gesture of lifting her hands towards the sky and opening them , as though releasing something to fly up into the clouds .Not only is the idea hammered home with a complete lack of subtlety , but the visual sensibility of it is so lame and clich\u00e9d , an unthinking regurgitation of the most turgid form of religious imagery .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "JB : I think you 've cut to the heart of it :Although there are fundamental challenges to conjuring catharsis through Penn 's scowling cipher , the scene 's biggest failure is its ordinariness .Malick , love him or loath him , has never been ordinary .He 's the guy who gives us extreme closeups of insects , who gives us stories that unfold during the magic hour and who gazes at forest canopies with the awe of someone taking in the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel .He 's the guy who makes curtains blowing in the wind seem profound ( mileage may vary ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Most significant of all , he 's the guy who for five films now has found religion , spirituality and seemingly even God himself in the natural world that most of us take for granted .Put all of that together and it 's utterly shocking that when Malick finally gets around to depicting heaven off earth - after spending his career stunning us with his depictions of heaven on earth - it would seem so uninspiring , so bland , so hackneyed .Malick aspires , as he always does , for heartfelt magnificence , but while the earnestness of the emotions and the lushness of the images are stamped with his trademark , the unimaginativeness of it all makes the profound prosaic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Or perhaps this is what Malick figured The Beyond looked like to Penn 's Jack .To which I say , fair enough .But the problem is n't that the beach scene ca n't be defended .The problem is that it fails to live up not only to the gracefulness of the Waco scenes before it but also to Malick 's entire oeuvre .Emotionally speaking , that scene needed to tower above almost any other scene in his career .And it does n't .Not even close .It feels small .I never watched Lost , but based on the chatter I 've heard about the show 's disappointing finale , that might be the most apt comparison .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" If I seem particularly critical of the coda , I suppose it 's because I feel the final moments of his previous two films are absolutely magnificent .Both The Thin Red Line and The New World end on emotional high points created from climaxing scores that quickly give way to the tranquil ambient noise of secluded nature .They end swiftly , even suddenly .But the coda of The Tree of Life drags on , and all the while the incredible power of the previous chapter escapes like air out of leaky balloon .And now that he has ...", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Then Malick leaps ahead in time to the parents learning of the death of one of their sons .Soon after , there 's a shot that absolutely slays me : the shadows of the children , projected upside - down on the concrete , running back and forth as they play .This shot will be echoed later in the film when young Jack runs down the front steps of the O'Brien house and then back up in reverse , his shadow stretched out behind him on the steps .But it 's the earlier shot that I find really haunting and unforgettable , a ghostly image that somehow crystallizes all the loss and grief of this family .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As you said earlier , this is the work of a filmmaker who 's not holding back in the least .And all of that is in many ways only setting the stage for the jaw - dropping childhood section of the film .JB : If the beach coda is the most maligned portion of The Tree of Life -I've yet to find someone who goes so far as to praise it - the creation sequence is the most controversial .There are those who are all - in , those who are all - out , and then quite a few who seem to find the sequence awesome as a set piece but disjointed or even foolish in its application .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In every way , the creation sequence is thrillingly limitless .From our partners .On LOST too ?A few things : I find it disheartening the lack of real academically substantial interest in Malick 's filmography ; this dialogue and Mark 's writings have been positive , but I feel Malick is an unfortunately overlooked filmmaker .Perhaps this is due to his sparse filmography , or his odd behavior , or even the fact that his films are unlike anything else in American cinema today .Either way , the result is a hesitation towards truly exploring the more difficult films in his canon ( as opposed to say Bergman , whose greater filmography and demand of critical attention helped to elucidate his own challenging films ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In Days , the evocation of God is by no means subtle ; we see several images taken straight from the Bible , and their appearance in the film suggest that God himself enters the action to prevent Bill from escaping the Farmer 's retribution .The film is structured to reveal a story of moral cause and effect and free will vs. the will of God , very Old Testament ideas .The wrathful , hellish fire belongs to this concept of God , whereas it would not find a home in The Tree of Life .In Tree , Malick 's approach to God is much more New Testament , where the divine is all about grace and love of all things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The final scenes do evoke heaven or some higher place ; the upward camera moves , the light , they all convey a sense of spiritual transcendence .Whether it really be heaven or not I agree is inconsequential ; however , the readiness with which the sequence is dismissed is troubling .Instead of being considered with the rest of the film which has been deemed \" masterpiece , \" this sequence is subjected to generalized criticisms , many of which do n't seem to hold water whatsoever .To call this ending ' cliched ' makes me wonder when this has become common imagery for \" heaven ? \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It 's already enlarged my enjoyment of Malick 's latest masterpiece , as your past conversations have done with Malick 's earlier work .I , too , found the \" heaven \" sequence a tad puerile and cliched , both in its visual tropes and how it appeared to be resolving everything for so many characters : God !Forgiveness !Letting go !Grace !But I think I really love Matt 's interpretation that , instead , the sequence is the hero 's coming to terms with his fraught past .If ultimately convincing , this reading of the coda , for me , moves the film from \" messy , qualified masterpiece \" to \" masterpiece . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I agree Matt , that the ending represents the reconciling the irreconcilable .It 's all in Jack 's mind so it 's rather self - serving to what he wishes for , not necessarily the culmination of where the film is leading to .The last moment of that sequence is Jack 's mother finally coming to terms with giving her son over to God -- something illustrated in the beginning of the film as something she could n't conceive of .She wished for death just so she could see R.L. again .The death of R.L. was essentially her fall from grace .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And because the moment of his mother finding grace again is what ends Jack 's internal thoughts , sending us back into his present world and seeing Jack looking like he just overcame something , I believe it 's key to what the film is about .Jack is n't just grieving for the loss of his brother that day but grieving what the death did to his mother .Many argue that the Sean Penn sequences are the weakest aspect of the film , and some argue that Malick could have simply cut these parts out .But without the sequences you do n't have any context for what surrounds it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wondered why Malick would have Jack going to work on a day when it 's the anniversary of his brother 's death , and he is still preoccupied with grief .Many pointed to the idea that Jack was cut off from the world -- or nature -- that surrounded him but I did n't buy that .There 's that shot of Jack 's wife bringing in branches from outside for their centerpiece at home -- obviously nature is something that 's important to Jack .The mystery stuck with me until the end when Jack 's father gets moved to a job he does n't care for , uprooting his family from their home .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I mean , it MIGHT be that , but given how obliquely Malick has come at spiritual matters in every other movie , I tend to doubt it .If the latter , why ?I read it more as the main character reconciling all the parts of himself , and his experience , that he thought were irreconcilable .There is no reason to think all of those people , the hero included , are dead in that sequence .And there are a lot of characters in there who had a tiny presence in the movie , or not presence ( cutting room floor casualties ? ) and whom the hero could not possibly classify as dead or alive , because how would he know ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Or something .In other words , yes , you can imprint your own reading on it , and Malick invites it , but at the same time , the structure of the movie intentionally frustrates attempts to impose such a reading .It is , as you gentleman have said , Proustian ... we are watching what is in one man 's mind ( Jack 's or Malick 's ) .So it 's all figurative , in a way .I think even the parts of the film that Jack could not have been present to see are Jack 's hypothetical imagining of those events , not a \" documentary \" record ....", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I picked up O brother , where art thou ? as a blind buy when it was first released on DVD .I was instantly hooked .When questioned about my choice of favorite films O brother is among my top twenty .The Coen 's describe this film as The Three Stooges on an epic scale combined with Homer 's Odyssey .I am not so sure about that but the writing is brilliant and features a plethora of wonderfully drawn characters set to a sort of hayseed themed road trip narrative that just works .I will admit that the bumbling antics and simpleton like behavior occasionally borders on slapstick but it 's the superbly crafted banter and its pitch perfect execution that I enjoy most .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I find that each set of circumstances / characters is given the opportunity to shine and does thanks to a well chosen cast of supporting actors .This includes Charles Durning 's Pappy O'Daniel ( and his entourage ) , Frank Collison 's Cousin Wash , Stephen Root 's blind Radio Station Man ( perhaps my favorite outside of the principles ) , and last but not least John Goodman 's Big Dan Teague .The remaining character that is equally deserving of recognition is the film 's music which is incredibly entertaining and integral to the proceedings .From beginning to end O brother , where art thou ? is filled with playfully rewarding moments , off beat comedy , and cleverly infused references / characters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The result is a purposefully dry , dustbowl overlay that works surprisingly well as a thematic conveyance .I recall that it took a little getting used to the first time I saw it .This presentation sports re - timed color elements that in my opinion make for a marked improvement over the original DVD .While the original baseline is retained there is a deeper gradational emphasis that delineates certain chromatic elements which makes them appear a bit more natural and probably closer to what was originally intended .Comparing this directly to the DVD makes the difference quite obvious ( in a good way ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
