{"text": "Many sign languages have evolved around schools that are for deaf students .Generally every language across the world has a sign language counterpart , largely due to the fact many deaf members in a linguistic population will generate a sign language .In the same way that a geographical or cultural force can isolate populations which leads to the generation of a different language , this same principle operated within sign language .International Sign is the sign language used as international Deaf events such as the Deaflympics and meetings of the World Federation of the Deaf .Sign Language Linguistics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
