{"text": "But when an unexpected witness interferes , the plan quickly unravels and all bets are off . \" \" Armored \" is rated PG-13 for sequences of intense violence , some disturbing images and brief strong language . \" Armored \" offers a fairly simple premise about armed guards trying to rob their own truck of millions of dollars , and how things go horribly wrong , as these things often do .Working from a screenplay by newcomer James Simpson , this crime thriller opens with a tight 20 minutes of character introductions and plot set - up , as we meet Columbus Short 's Ty Hackett , and watch him learning the ropes as a armed truck guard .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Once the actual heist goes into effect , most of the movie takes place within a spacious warehouse environment , seemingly moving forward in real time .Director Nimr\u00f3d Antal , who found new ways to explore the slasher genre with \" Vacancy \" does an equally good job creating a claustrophobic environment that would help elevate the tension between the men with so much money at stake .Driven by the character interaction , it 's a bit like the little - seen indie thriller \" Unknown \" involving a similar game of \" last man standing \" as the guys try to resolve their situation before getting busted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That joke is directed at Fishburne 's character , who is always waving a large shotgun around , and his performance is the only one that comes close to the scenery - chewing we 've seen too many times in these movies .Character actors such a Jean Reno , Skeet Ulrich and Amaury Nolasco do a more than competent job filling the archetypes necessary for the genre .On the other hand , Columbus Short has come quite a way in very little time , delivering an exceptional performance as the film 's protagonist .It 's probably one of the best things we 've seen from the relatively new actor , even if some of the earlier characters moments involving him and Andre Kinney as his younger brother Jimmy tend to drag .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( As you watch the heist take place , you wonder why the security company does n't have any sort of GPS tracking on their trucks , which would have immediately given away the crew 's plan . )The big problem is that the movie is very predictable , not just due to a genre which only allows certain outcomes in any situation , but also because the trailers and commercial have given away so much of how things play out .The audience for this type of crime - thriller will probably already have seen a lot of this type of movie , so there are only a few aspects of it that will feel new , although there are still at least a few surprises along the way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
