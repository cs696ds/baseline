{"text": "Quicklinks .Review from 2005 TIFF .Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer , Everything Is Illuminated is the directorial debut of actor Liev Schreiber .Schreiber also wrote the screenplay .In the movie , Jonathan ( Elijah Wood ) obsessively collects items from his family , from toothbrushes to retainers to scraps of paper which he then seals in ziploc bags and pins to a wall in his house to record his family history .But the space for his grandfather is conspicuously bare .All Jonathan really has of him is a piece of jewelry and an old photo of him with a woman who hid him from the Nazis during the Second World War .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The screenplay effectively combines both humour and drama as the three characters travel through the countryside looking for Jonathan 's grandfather 's town , driving deeper and deeper into the memories of the past .The best performance probably comes from Eugene Hutz , playing Alex Jr. , who starts the movie as a tracksuit - wearing , break dancing slacker just out to have fun but evolves into something more as not only Jonathan , but all the characters gain their own illumination .Liev Schreiber , Elijah Wood , and Eugene Hutz attended the screening and did a very humorous Q&A after the film : . - Schreiber was very close to his grandfather , who was a Ukranian immigrant , and who died in 1993 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The older woman , living in the isolated place , is the missing link of the story .She is able to put things into the right perspective .But here is where the story changes its emphasis from Jonathan , who clearly has come to the land of his ancestors , to the old man .We watch as this older man starts remembering things about himself .This , in turn , changes the dynamic of the film as we discover how connected Jonathan and his guides have been all the time .Some criticism in these pages have expressed opinions about the accuracy of the story , which after all , it 's a work of fiction and liberties have been taken .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There , they find their own respective destinies and will be forever changed by what they learn .This film feels like it was directed by someone who knew how to get the most from his actors .At times , the film is spoken in Russian and seems like a foreign film .The title itself is a play on self discovery .This is a thoughtful trek of one man into his past , and his past ironically involves his companions ; Jonathan 's obsessive journey becomes an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By the end of the film , these characters have all experienced life altering events that will permanently intertwine their lives .It proves that memories can be powerful in traumatizing and also cleansing the soul .It 's also about one 's legacy and how others view an event or a person in the past .Alex eventually sees his grandfather in a completely different light .Even our perception of these individuals will have changed by film 's end which is a tribute to a story that is well told .The story is deceptively simple .It functions as a road trip movie ( like The Straight Story ) combined with an interesting mystery story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The ending is a bit surreal with its d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu feeling .Elijah Wood ( Sin City , The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ) ) has chosen a wide range of roles ever since his splash in The Lord of the Rings trilogy .Here , he does a fine job with what is essentially a minimalist role with not much to show .Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin fare better as Alex and his grandfather respectively .Even the grandfather 's dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. ( that 's right ) is funny as a fiercely loyal companion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The editing is effective as imagery from past and present are linked and transitioned effortlessly .The cinematography by Matthew Libatique ( Gothika , Requiem for a Dream ) is appropriately stark and lifeless with some impressive images of war and its aftermath .The coincidences that emerge during the last half of the film make for good drama but are a little too coincidental .We never fully understand the whole background story of Alex 's grandfather and what his motivations are .Likewise , Jonathan 's blank stares and lack of apparent substance and depth do not give us much more than a sketch of a quirky man .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But these are minor criticisms of what is a good , introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of remembrance and closure .That Schreiber not only directed but adapted the screenplay to this worthwhile slice of history is a tribute to his talents and promising potential in the future .A Sentimental Road Trip ThroughThe Impact of Eastern European History .\" Everything is Illuminated \" is a simplified interpretation of something more than half of the Jonathan Safran Foer novel .This version is more about changes in Eastern Europe from World War II through post - Cold War and how the younger generation relates to that history as a family memory .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As funny as his opening scenes are when he establishes his cheeky bravura , we later feel his fish - out - of - waterness in his own country when he tries to ask directions of local yokels .Shreiber uses Elijah Wood , as the American tourist , as an up tight cog in a visual panoply , as his character is less verbal than as one of the narrators in the book .He and Hutz play off each other well until the conclusion that becomes more sentimental in this streamlined plot .Once the grandfather 's story takes over in the last quarter of the film , marvelously and unpredictably enacted by Boris Leskin , the younger generation does not seem to undergo any catharsis , as they just tidy up the closure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of his consultants in the credits is Professor Yaffa Eliach and her style of remembering pre - Holocaust shtetl life through artifacts clearly inspired the look and it is very powerful and effective .The Czech Republic stands in for the Ukraine and the production design staff were able to find memorable symbols of change in the cities , towns and countryside , as this is now primarily a road movie , and the long driving scenes do drag a bit .Schreiber retains some of the symbolism from the book , particularly of the moon and river , but having cut out the portions of the book that explain those , they just look pretty or ominous for atmosphere and no longer represent time and fate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In general , Schreiber does go for more poignancy than the book .It is irresistibly touching , especially for those who have n't read the book , but less morally and emotionally messy .The film is enormously uplifted by its marvelous soundtrack , which ranges from songs and instrumentals from Hutz 's gypsy band to traditional tunes to contemporary tracks to Paul Cantelon 's klezmer fusion score .All in all a 10 !What an original piece of work .I 've always enjoyed Liev Schreiber the \" actor \" , but now one must appreciate the man on a multi - dimensional level .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
