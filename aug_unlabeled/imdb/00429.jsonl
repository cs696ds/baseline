{"text": "Some quick thoughts on the second episode of \" The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien \" coming up just as soon as I admire that asteroid ... .Much better .Much better .Again , it 's not that Conan had a bad debut show , but there were some nerves , and it did n't feel like he led with his strongest comedy material , especially after having so many months to prepare .But night two was Conan firing on all thrusters , whether with brief , surreal gags like the small Asian woman turning into Max , or with longer pieces like his shopping trip to Rodeo Rd .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Leno 's been told he has to restructure to be less guest dependent and that he has to close with a comedy bit each night .I assume that just means he 'll do monologue - guest - guest - band - comedy , rather than his traditional monologue - comedy - guest - guest - band structure .( And I use \" comedy \" in a descriptive , not a normative , sense . )I ca n't stand Julia Roberts on Letterman .Or Julia Roberts in any interview , non - filmed appearance , as she seems so full of herself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
