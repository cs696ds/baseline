{"text": "Stephanie , you make it sound simple \" \" Weather men want to admit to it or not cheating starts in the heart \" \" but it is decidedly not that cut and dry .Many wives have no interest in satisfying their husbands needs .These men are being cheated out of sex and they are responding in the only way he can .Many wives use sex as a means of controlling their husbands .So yes , wives get upset when porn threatens to take away her source of control .This of course is not the case in every situation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would further propose that porn or romance novels or any other distraction is not the source of the problem .If you dig deep enough you would find that there were other underlying issues , the porn is just a symptom of what the real problem is .That may be true in many cases .Although it is hard for me to relate to because I would enjoy having sex everyday at least once if not more .After all who does n't love sex ?How would a woman be able to use it control her man ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But in many cases I feel it creates the problem .I will admit that my desire to have sex with my husband reduced greatly once I became aware that he was getting off on other women .I 'm sure it would have waned anyways due to the lack of trust and intimacy that his secret habit created .We all have issues and insecurities to deal with .A strong sex drive is one of the main ways to inspire men and women to face these issues and work through them together .This creates a strong bond trust and intimacy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At some point a couples sex drive should balance out for a healthy medium between the two of them .If one person uses sex as a drug there is no way one person can satisfy them .Lust is a sin .It 's like a disease that grows until it eventually consumes any love that there was .Lust always want 's what it ca n't have .It 's been my personal experience that no amount of sex can cure a person who has the issue .First the person has to decide to rid himself of his lusts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "@stephanie .Your situation is tragic , yet different than most couples .In most couples , the male sex drive is higher than the female 's .The wife can easily use sex then as a tool to use as a way of getting what she wants .\" oh honey , I just have so much housework to do , I just can not find the time for sex , If only we had a maid \" .\"oh not now honey , let 's do it tomorrow \" .This is basic human nature .If I have something you want very badly and you have no other place to get it but from me , then I have lots of power and control over you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So the sex starved husband who gets sick and tired of being turned down for sex by his wife ends up using porn .Porn did not cause this situation .It is just a symptom .In your case , where you want sex and he does not , or maybe wants it but is substituting porn for you is common but is not the majority .The majority case is where the wife has no desire for sex and the husband does .I completely agree that you are being cheated on by your husband using porn .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But it is simply not the case that all men are cheating on their innocent wives with porn .You are also assuming that all people have gone into marriage with the desire to work together with the partner to grow in happiness .On the contrary , there are scads of people out there who are selfish and have no desire to try to meet the needs of their partner .I have no idea why these people get married in the first place , but they do .And the sucker who marries them is a victim .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
