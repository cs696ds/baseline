{"text": "Halloween 2 came out in the summer , if I recall correctly , completely missing the opportunity to compete with the Saw franchise and make sure that people actually had a good scary movie to see .I use the term \" good \" loosely for the sake of the release date .From what I 've heard , the studio was scared to release this film head to head with Saw VI and therefore pulled it out early , to mediocre fan fare and disappointing box office returns .Halloween 2 has some key elements going for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The throwback style is impressive , and you 'll swear at times that you 're watching an Argento movie , as the hospital scenes use light and shadow mixed with vivid colors to muted scales at times , in order to present a creepy state of mind and being .There are also long shots shown , edited together with close shots , and mind numbing circular shots that are really well done , and if you 're not paying attention , you 'll miss them .Maybe that honor goes to the DP instead .The first half of this film is brutal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The brutality in this film is bar none , and rivals many other films and overpasses a majority of high end films in the way it features the brtuality .I 'm reminded of \" Irreversible \" at one point when a man 's face is stomped into hamburger .It 's really a sight for sore eyes , considering pg-13 films are not nearly as brutal .This is where Rob Zombie really shined in making this second edition of Halloween .The pacing also thrives , as this film runs on rails into a rollercoaster style ride with lots of thrills , shocks , and bumps leading to slow down thoughts that really seem to come out of left field .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This film really falls apart with the story .There are several tying stories going through the film all based on the first film , then there is some supernatural elements and weird \" mother \" ghost story told that really frustrates the hell out of me .The way they made it work seemed like a music video concept for a Rob Zombie song ( Living Dead Girl ) or something of that nature , not a Halloween film .It was so bad that when I mentioned this film to friends , they completely trashed it .I do n't think this film deserves a complete thrashing , but it 's definitely lacking in the story department , and that 's where this falls out of favor with me and most of the audience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Is it believable ?It could be , I really let belief be suspended for the sake of this film because these sequences were just unnatural to say the least .They offered such a scary notion .Another scary point was when our victim leaves the hospital to find a rainy desolate parking lot .That to me is also scary , the point of being alone , after escaping certain doom , and not having a plan , wow , that just is something you ca n't really take for granted in horror .In the end , Halloween 2 does not offer enough good story to back it 's brutality up front .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The first film the couple sees is called \" The Pick Up \" , which follows a \" john \" and a woman to a seedy motel , in what seems to be hell .This story is ok , nothing too crazy happens , but the attention fetish is definitely a plus .The mild mannered business man is a freak , and is waiting to enjoy a night with a woman of the evening .As the scenes progress , things get a tad more strange , as this place seems to be on the edge of hell somewhere .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The editing does n't help at all .The movie is just odd , and while it has some solid interesting points , the overall film is dry and boring .There seems to be a throwback to \" Psycho \" as a voyeur is shown looking at our \" couple \" .The movie goes into overdrive as the two start enjoying themselves together , the lights go out and the prostitute really goes nuts , in a way that you 'll never believe .The gore effects get a major shout out here , with some nice REAL effects , no CG to be seen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For that , I liked the film , creating a mood of sexiness and making it completely sickening .The second film is \" Damnation \" and it 's interesting in a lot of ways .The movie showcases a young woman and her plight of being arrested and drugged , then thrown into a court of sorts , where she is tortured .The second film is a bit slower , and focuses more on \" torture \" and prison as a selling point .It 's not half bad , but it 's really just a throwback to the 70 's and 80 's \" women in chains \" exploitation style films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It 's just so obvious that the budget was small on this one .I can certainly deal with low budget , but this one seems to be ridiculous .For whatever reasons it got cult status when the trailer hit the eb and people were fighting over pre - order copies of this thing .The movie is terrible .It 's got a few funny moments , but the effects and the acting are so bad .The effects and monster themselves make absolutely no sense , and is nonsensical to the point where I wanted to pluck my eyes out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are some good points , mainly in the transition visuals .They have some decent flybys of the city , that rival The Dark Knight , but not many .You really have to reach and watch for them .The plot is ridiculous , and does n't even make a shred of sense .This movie is boring .Sure it has some appeal with the outlandish ideas and plot , but it 's pacing is miserable .The music sucks , and it 's not at all scary .You really have to want to sit through this whole thing , it 's not good ... it 's not even funny .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is n't the worst film I 've ever seen , but it 's in the running .I do n't necessarily recommend viewing Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus , but if you must , go for it . 1 opinions that matter : .Clive Barker 's Book of Blood Review .Clive Barker gets no major respect from the mainstream , yet he consistently puts out some insane story arcs and moments in the horror genre .While he has n't scored a huge mainstream success since the 1980 's , Clive Barker continues to forge ahead with some sick and twisted moments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Book of Blood was scheduled for a major movie release , much like Midnight Meat Train was , but somehow along the lines it was derailed and it never got the release it should 've gotten .But now it 's on dvd , and it 's going to gain Clive Barker some major notice , if only more people would pick up this film .This is the seventh story from Barker to get a full movie release .Since 1986 he has had a steady string of b - movies come out as adaptations most of them getting only a whimper of attention , and cult status as the years progressed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film is simple .The plot being about a young man who finds himself investigating a haunting of sorts , only to find out that his skepticism is his biggest downfall as ghosts manifest themselves into reality , causing quite the violent sequences ; which are done with attention to gore .The gore in this film pops up in some sick moments .I found myself surprised that the CG work done on these death sequences was n't terrible .If you recall \" The Midnight Meat Train \" you 'll remember that there was a lot of CG blood added in after the fact , creating a mess of what would normally be a good sequence of bludgeoning action .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It happens fast , but you see how it all turns out , and you do n't want to see it continue , that 's for sure .The manifestations of the spirits creates quite the effects when writing begins to be carved into the skin of our victims .It 's really a surprising effect , done quite generously well , all things considered .The attention to minor details is somewhat surprising , with lighting , sound , and other small pieces put into their exact locations , creating quite the ambient surrounding to what otherwise should be a mindless horror film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No .This film does n't scare me and probably wo n't scare many people .For some reason the appearances of \" ghosts \" and things along those lines are n't that scary any more .The build up to the invisible in this film is really only made evident with the skepticism possessed by a metaphysics professor .Showcasing an unnatural and uneven balance between what is real and what is fake within the context of this film is too much for one viewer to try and understand .That being said , this movie has a deep underlying issue that is much more cerebral than other films in the horror genre .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's just too many nuances that ca n't be expressed with visual and music .There is a mix bag of different things that can create a good scary feeling , if you 're not an avid fan of horror .These set ups , loud noises , and gore effects are somewhat after the fact , because by the time you piece together the social settings in contrast to the slayings , you 'll most likely be tired .I know I was tired of this film , even though I kept giving the thing chances .It 's not just a slow paced film , it 's just got so many layers that do n't need to be there for such a story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Clive Barker 's Book of Blood is an interesting horror film , on a visual level .But story and execution it 's just not that great .I do n't recommend this one for everyone , but I think that many people will find this film either boring or simply trying too hard to gain a foot hold into the genre .Barker has done better writing than getting his film work into the hands of horror fans , and I guess I see why this did n't get a wider release in theaters .It 's just not fitting , it has its moments but nothing that you 're going to have your jaw drop over or anything that is going to stick with you for a long time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Josh Brolin is one of my favorite actors and his work in No Country For Old Men is second to none .Somehow however he went from delivering command performances to starring in mediocre comic book movie adaptations .JONAH HEX is a great piece of source material but unfortunately the film is flat at best , crap at worst .The film co - stars Megan Fox which is probably part of the problem since I have never found her to be overly talented but admittedly she is nice eye candy .Jonah Hex is all bad in every way the only highlight might be watching Megan Fox play a whore and dress the part .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Did I miss a painfully obvious movie ?Give me your 2 cents .There are other more deserving movies that belong here before Blade Trinity .Writer / Director David Goyer wrote all three blade movies , but the third had studio interference and budget cuts .The original script was more epic in scope and I do n't even think Dracula was part of it ( that sounds more like some studio jagoff 's idea ) .Snipes was also being uncooperative and Goyer had to rewrite scenes on the day to accommodate Wesley 's diva behavior .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Blade : Trinity was an absolute disaster !Snipes was not being \" uncooperative \" .He was PISSED and with good reason .While none of the Blade Films were great movies ( objectively speaking ) , the third film came off like a PG-13 generic vehicle for Jessica Biel 's ass and chest and whatshisname 's comic - action stylings .Goyer is not a good writer and an even worse director .Forcing these two ' Blade sidekicks ' into the movie resulted in a buddy action comedy right up there with ' Tango and Cash ' or ' Cop Out ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Honestly , Nicholas Cage as Ghost Rider was a correct choice for the character and is even a big Ghost Rider fan himself , the problem is that the writing on both of those movies was complete trash .There are several examples where Cage had given a grand performance but it was the writing that allowed him to shine .When you walk into a Cage movie if have to expect that if the writing is bad so will his performance .Please , writer , do us a favor .First , learn 6th grade punctuation and writing skills .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Also , any of The Punisher films - the land that chronology forgot .And does no one else remember the Generation X movie ?No matter how bad The Last Stand was , it will never be this bad ; .What 's truly scary , is that Barb Wire is just a rehash of ...Casablanca .Others have pointed out , Howard the Duck ( which should have been a bellwether about what was coming with the SW prequels ) , Judge Dredd and Spider Man 3 .I 'd put them here ahead of others - including Barb Wire .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Really ?FF , DD , GRSV and Blade 3 ?Those are all mostly likable films .I 'm a huge GR fan and enjoyed the 2nd film a lot .I loved the FF films , but they were n't great .DD was fine and deserved a sequel , Blade 3 was good , with better action then the first two and some laughs ....This is an awful list .I enjoyed the spirit a lot as well , though it was n't really like the book at all , I thought it was a ton of fun .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think George Clooney has plenty of experience being in bad films before .Some of his earlier films were Return to Horror High ( 1987 ) and Return of the Killer Tomatoes !Those movie were terrible .If he learned any lesson , it was to read a script better because the dialogue is so unintentionally funny in Batman & Robin that that should 've been warning enough to stay away from that steaming pile of bat guano with the Bat symbol stamped on it !I actually liked Blade Trinity better than the second film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm surprised Ang Lee 's Hulk was n't on this list .Umm , Batman & Robin would have been terrible if George Clooney had played Batman with no sidekicks .Though the true atrocities of this film were the villians , Dr. Freeze ( Arnie ) and Poison Ivy ( Thurman ) , which you somehow failed to mention .Plus the fact there was a piss weak script ... .LOL actually i ONLY saw Barb wire \" do n't all me babe ' on video at a friend 's house .everyone was stoned and doing bong hits every time she said that line .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "maybe that 's why they enjoyed it ?I must be the only person who actually loves Catwoman ; I actually watch it at least 2x / month .I also LOVE Spirit and , while it was def not my fave , Blade Trinity is watched pretty frequently , as well ...It 's always interesting to see how many things on a \" Worst of \" list I enjoy ; it 's often quite a bit .Blade Trinity was a good movie it probably just did not satisfy the comic book nerds out there .Steel is obviously the worst movie on this list followed closely by Catwomen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The one thing a good comic book movie needs is a good plot and this movies all lacked that .Also superman returns was horrible .It wrecked one persons career and it made you question Kevin Spacey 's acting ability .How that does n't make this list and blade trinity does makes me question you as a writer sir .How does anyone like this garbage ?All comic book movies are terrible and lame .What are we , five years old ?What happened to movies with complex characters and interesting plots .I do n't care to see a movie that is nothing but some geek playing around with special effects .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
