{"text": "Watching \" Bully \" was one of the more agonizing , repulsive experiences of my time as an avid film - goer .Right from the unasked - for pornographic vulgarism of its opening few seconds , I detested every single tasteless , offensive moment of it .When it was all over , and I had n't enjoyed or been fascinated or involved or interested or liked a single moment of it , it sunk right down onto my list of the ten worst movies I 've ever seen .But what astonished me the most was when I discovered that the brilliant and insightful critic Roger Ebert , whom I admired and I still admire greatly to this day , awarded it his highest honor of four stars and called it a bizarre masterpiece .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But what was more astonishing to learn was that a vast array of other people - other people with taste and culture - liked this movie an awful lot .But you know what ?That most certainly does not make it pass for a good movie . \" Bully \" is crammed end - to - end with repulsive images and dialogue , right from the beginning where our protagonist tells somebody on the phone to make oral contact with his genitals .What follows after this are many vulgar , sickening moments of bad dialogue , and countless moments where adolescents strip naked and sweat the sheets before our very eyes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have always been of the opinion that sex scenes are a complete waste of time in movies and \" Bully \" , if I may say so , rectifies my statement .What 's worse , moments like these do n't seem to stand up for the director 's supposed intentions , as they will , in my opinion , turn on the audience instead of warning them .What will also do so is the movie 's awful methods of making young women seem subhuman by treating them more as sex objects .This seems more encouraging to the concupiscent members of the audience than foreboding .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "During its scenes of gratuitous sex and drug use , it ignores and throws away the fact that these kids want to murder Bobby , and as a result , the movie does not have any kind of primitive purpose .Was that because we were supposed to get in the shoes of the weed - smoking characters ?That 's not a good idea to begin with and I did not follow them at all .Nor did I learn anything except how vile and ugly an exploitation film can be if done wrong .Very wrong .And what 's more depressing is that \" Bully \" is not even a very good movie on a technical level .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And then there is that terrible , terrible moment when the camera spins like a top several times in the middle of a circle of characters .It 's rare when the 180-degree camera rule is broken where it works , and here it is broken several times and never works .Were we supposed to feel like we were high on drugs like the characters ?Gee , what a tactful and goodhearted decision .And then there is the movie 's climax , which is edited so badly and shot so badly that it looks like a couple of kids shot it with a home video camcorder and edited it by shooting in sequence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Everybody in this movie is vulgar and stupid and reprehensible and I could not get involved in any kind of way , not even to a certain degree , as hating them as villains .And I feel sorry , truly sorry for Rachel Miner and the other cast members who were stripped naked and had their bodies exploited by the camera over and over and over again .The bar was lowered long before \" Bully \" was made with exploitation films , but it pushes the bar even lower , I say , because it has no real goal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's just one unendurable minute after another .It 's just treacherous , bad film - making .It 's fair to say that I hated this movie as much as I 've hated any bad movie I 've ever seen .Just because it 's based on real events and tries to say something does not make it a good picture .Seldom before have I ever wished a movie would just stop with a dead - end and finish its running time with a blank , noiseless screen .You want to see a movie that looks similar , but is brilliant ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
