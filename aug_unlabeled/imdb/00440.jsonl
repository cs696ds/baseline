{"text": "The plot is very basic , but then you would n't want anything too complicated to come into play .Director Robert Luketic cleverly seems to recognise that this is a good chick flick but not an Oscar winner , and so just makes sure that things are done within the realistic confines of the film 's genre and plot .The filming is done very well using bright colours in some scenes , and some good indoor lighting to affect the mood of each scene as necessary .I enjoyed this element of the film - subtle yet effective .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Charlie and Kevin have n't long been together but whilst meeting his mother for the first time he proposes and then wonders why his mother nearly has a seizure .I just think this is unbelievable , even though his mother Viola turns out to be a bit wacky ; most parents would be shocked at a proposal the first time they met your partner .It 's difficult to sympathise with Charlie 's situation because her personality seems to change depending on the scene she is in .At the beginning she is free spirited and would n't hurt a fly but then she becomes obsessive and hurtful just because of her boyfriends mother .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Most of the humour in this film comes from cheap laughs and not clever humour .The mentality of Charlie has a peanut allergy so let 's fill her up before the wedding so she swells up like a balloon comes straight from an American college type movie script which is sad .The storyline could have lent itself to a really clever script but instead the writer has just gone for obvious titbits .There are some funny moments though , my favourite being when over the hill Viola is told she is being replaced for a younger model on her talk show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Although the script is largely to blame , Lopez seems weak when working opposite Fonda and her girl next door cuteness does n't make up for the fact that she puts in a second rate performance here .Michael Vartan is okay as Kevin but his screen time is limited and he accepts that he is the tertiary character in the film and settles into the background , not making any effort to give a strong performance .Wanda Sykes starts of by bringing a bit of pizzazz to proceedings as Violas assistant Ruby , but after a promising start her scathing attacks just become harsh instead of witty and end up being personal attacks which just is n't funny .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
