{"text": "Paper shuffling in the background , and the loud breathing of the narrator is very distracting .However the major downfall of this recording is the narrator who is frequently tripping over his own tongue and whose style is often out of tune with the context and content .It is n't as obvious in the sample clip , but after 15 minutes or more the narrator 's breathing - in before ever passage becomes very annoying , and some of his character voices are also unbearable .I bought another version of this audiobook ( here , on Audible ) narrated by David Stifel that is MUCH better !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But even the gripes of collaborators whose careers were tarnished by the Golan - Globus touch ca n't dim the film 's abiding affection for the nonpareil schlockmeisters .Its largely disposable slate of horror , sex , cheap sci - fi and derivative action makes Cannon an obvious source of fascination for director Mark Hartley .This entry completes the trash - tastic trilogy that the Australian exploitation aficionado began with his survey of homegrown genre flicks of the 1970s and ' 80s , Not Quite Hollywood , and continued by celebrating Filipino grindhouse grist in Machete Maidens Unleashed !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Electric Boogaloo takes in a similarly diverse genre panorama with the same rollicking approach .But while the countless clips sampled are often hilariously bad , the sheer tackiness of all but a relatively small handful of them becomes repetitive .One of the more amusing talking heads , music supervisor Richard Kraft , likens the Cannon product pipeline to bowel movements dumped onto the international market with scant concern for quality or plot coherence : \" You flush it .You make another one .\" The relentlessness of that cycle makes one wish Hartley had spent less time geeking out in a haze of fanboy enthusiasm and more time shaping the story of the Golan - Globus Hollywood odyssey .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That shameless tendency to pillage popular material intensified once Golan , the creative dreamer , teamed with his younger cousin Globus , the shrewd businessman , and the pair descended on Hollywood .Even before that , however , they discovered the commercial rewards of sensationalizing current events as screen fodder , via the Entebbe hostage crisis thriller Operation Thunderbolt ; and depicting the sexploits of horny teens in Lemon Popsicle , which they later reworked stateside as The Last American Virgin .Some of the funniest excerpts detail Golan 's penchant for creating Frankenstein 's monster - type amalgams .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But the company 's forays into artier waters with names like Robert Altman , John Cassavetes , Franco Zeffirelli , Norman Mailer and even Jean - Luc Godard are n't explored with enough depth to reveal whether it was a genuine bid for legitimacy or an occasional delusion .More attention is given to the business model of selling off foreign rights via trade ads , posters or insta - pitches for thinly conceived movies , many of them never to be made .Golan and Globus were masters of this strategy , making them the kings of Cannes for a time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hartley gets around the absence of both Golan and Globus as active participants in the film by dipping heavily into archival interviews , most of them from a BBC special , The Last Moguls , and from a 60 Minutes segment .There are plenty of colorful anecdotes .Golan reportedly had asked for \" that Stone woman , \" meaning Kathleen Turner , hot off Romancing the Stone .Perhaps the best tidbit is an account of Golan pitching a project directly to Clyde , the orangutan from Every Which Way But Loose .Hartley 's film is consistently entertaining , if somewhat one - note .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
