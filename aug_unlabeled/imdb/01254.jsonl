{"text": "For those of you who DON'T or DIDN'T understand \" Southland Tales \" , I did a breakdown of it so that people CAN understand it and I figured I 'd post it here in case anyone 's curious and maybe help some of you all out .Sorry if this is posted in the wrong location .The text below was the script to the video I did , which you can find on Youtube , just search for Ugo Strange .Anyways I HOPE this helps .This looks like a fun site , ENJOY ! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Since no one else is going to do this , I suppose I 'm gon na have to ! \"Southland Tales \" is Richard Kelly 's follow up to his hit cult film \" Donnie Darko \" .A lot of people have seen \" Southland Tales \" and the reactions have been either they really loved it , or absolutely hated it , aside from the polarizing reactions , the common reaction among fans and haters is that not many understand it .So as a courtesy to fans and haters alike I will provide a breakdown of the film and HOPEFULLY by watching this video you 'll understand this movie . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Personally I feel that if you know the ending of the movie ahead of time it 'll make much more sense .This movie is filled with references to The Bible , Robert Frost , T.S. Elliot , Karl Marx and metafictional reality .Ultimately it 's a movie full of ideas BUT before I go on , I need to see that this movie is NOT meant to be taken seriously .This movie is essentially a parody of it 's self .In order to understand this movie you need to be privy to a few things in the Science Fiction realm .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many people who 've seen this movie said that the characters are crazy , the story makes no sense and everything seems REALLY senseless ...BUT there IS a very valid reason why everything in this movie appears to make no sense .If you 're a comic book fan , and specifically a fan of DC Comics and have read \" Final Crisis\" ... you can consider \" Southland Tales \" to be it 's movie equivalent .Both are metafictional stories that can ONLY be made sense of by those who take the time to sit down and actually analyze the material , which are few and far in between .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anyways back to the topic .For starters the entire movie is basically summed up in this ONE scene : .The scene I 'm talking about is when The Rock ( Boxer Santaros ) pitches his movie \" The Power \" to Seann Williams Scott 's character ( Roland Taverner ) .For those of you paying attention and NOT asking \" What ? \"\" Huh \" the concept is very simple .But before I go on , I have to address a few thing in the movie .The Rock plays a character named Boxter Santaros .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He along with porn star Kystra Now played by Sarah Michelle Gellar wrote a screenplay titled \" The Power \" .\" The Power \" tells the story of a man named Jericho Cane ... this a reference to the 1999 film \" End Of Days \" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger .In \" The Power \" , Jericho Cane is a renegade L.A. police officer in a world gone mad .Remember that , that 's VERY important information .Boxer and Roland get lunch at a restaurant and they reveal that on some strange level they know each other .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Roland reveals that he has n't had a bowel movement in 6 days ... which in retrospect makes sense and I 'll explain that later .Shockingly enough , That 's the entire movie summed up .Boxer takes on the role of Jericho Cane and Starla , a USIDent employee has taken on the role of Dr. Fox ... because she read \" The Power \" and is in love with Boxer .In \" Southlande Tales \" the Earth 's rotation IS actually slowing down BECAUSE of an inter - dimensional rift above Lake Meade .Because of this rift the world is essentially going mad ... remember when I said there 's a reason why everything seems so crazy in this movie ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So what 's causing the Earth to slow down ?That would be Fluid Karma .What is Fluid Karma ?Fluid Karma is an alternative fuel source that Baron Von Westphlan ( essentially the villain of the film ) discovered while drilling off the coast of Israel .From my understanding Fluid Karma is an energy substance that is tied somehow to the Earth 's gravity as well as the tide ... essentially it 's kind of like the Earth 's life force if you will .Fluid Karma is a perpetual energy source , which makes Baron Von Westphlan a VERY rich man and Fluid Karma the most sought after substance in the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When Fluid Karma is used as a drug , the user will develops psychic abilities , most notably telepathy , and the ability to see the past and the future ( remember this because this is important ) .Fluid Karma was used as a drug in experiments on soldiers in Iraq , most notably Roland Taverner and Pilot Abilene ( this is important information also ) .So with all that set up , what exactly is going on in \" Southland Tales \" , well Boxer Santaros gets a call from Starla posing as Dr. Fox who tells him that \" The Power \" is true and everything Krysta and Boxer wrote is actually happening .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Boxer is also the husband of Madeline Frost , the daughter of Senator Bobby Frost , an ambitious Senator running for President with heavy endorsements from The Treer Company , which is owned by Baron Von Westphlan .Bobby Frost 's wife , Nana Mae Frost is the head of US - IDent .US - IDent is an Orwellian form of the Patriot Act .At the very beginning of the film an atomic bomb goes off in Texas , which essentially causes World War III .Because of this ALL communications are routed through US - IDent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Their first attempt to do this was to involve Boxer Santaros in a staged murder of a husband and wife by Roland Taverner .This plan of course goes arry ... but that 's not the point .Eventually Boxer meets Baron Von Westphlan 's people who have also read \" The Power \" and encourage him to get aboard The Mega Zepplin .Boxer makes it on board the Mega Zepplin and meets Simon Theory .Simon Theory is one of Baron Von Westphlan 's lead Scientists who reveals to Boxer that once again everything in \" The Power \" is the absolute truth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Who did he send ?Boxer and Roland Taverner .Boxer is then put face to face with himself .As it turns out the rift above Lake Meade is a space time continuum rift that sent Boxer and Roland 69 minutes into the past ... therefore making clones of them both , however the clone of Boxer died in a car explosion for reason unexpressed in the movie .When Boxer discovers this , he finally makes the connection that Roland and Ronald are NOT twin brother but rather they 're the SAME PERSON .Remember when I said Roland has n't produced a bowel movement in 6 days , well that might be a side effect of inter - dimensional travel , but Boxer traveled through the rift as well ... so ... that theory falls apart ... but it 's out there at least .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Through out the movie Roland has been looking for Ronald and at the end they finally do meet up and interlock hands .When they do this , the space time continuity of the universe begins to breakdown .Roland and Ronald Taverner because self generators of Fluid Karma .Remember when I said Fluid Karma is somehow linked to The Earth 's gravity ?Yes well that explains why The Ice Cream Truck starts to float .Because Roland has been treated with Fluid Karma in the drug trials and is essentially generating Fluid Karma himself , he is able to link to the mind of all those who 've been treated with Fluid Karma and Roland links to the mind of Pilot Abilene .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So at the end of the movie Pilot , speaking through Ronald is telling Roland that he forgives him .It 's not entirely expressed BUT we 're lead to believe that this causes The End of The World .I can only assume that because Roland and Ronald are generating Fluid Karma which is counter acting Space Time and Gravity and Energy it 's self , the world is about to collapse on it 's self .Thus ending the movie .Whether you loved or hated \" Southland Tales \" I HOPE this breakdown has given you some ability to understand what it was you just watched OR what you will be watching .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many people found this hard to understand and I 'll admit , I had to watching 3 or 4 times myself before I actually got it , BUT I enjoy movies like this that only become more clear in multiple viewings . \"Donnie Darko \" is also one of those movies that ca n't be fully appreciated in a single viewing .I wo n't deny that \" Southland Tales \" is a VERY convoluted movie , but as I said before it 's that way for a reason .We 're essentially being driven mad along with the world of \" Southland Tales \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite my love for this movie I wo n't defend it against people who hate this movie because I can certainly understand why and I do n't blame them .With that being said I hope this helps you and I hope you enjoyed this video .Thanks .And I agree , although The Rock is ANYTHING automatically cracks me up .I love that .Oh wait one scene DID make me laugh and that 's when Baron Westphlan had dude 's hand chopped off .His line after that KILLS ME every time .Wow .Thank you for this ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I liked it due to the massively convoluted plot and the way everything kept weaving together .At the same time , it actually angered me the first time I saw it because it made no sense whatsoever to me .Once I watched it a second time , it made a little more sense and I liked it even more , but so much of it still confused me .That 's what made me look up an explanation and once I read yours , basically the whole movie came together in my head .It was brilliantly written and the characters did very well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Why do they collect fingers and cut off his hand ?I thought it was because of the I - dent thing , but the Baron has nothing to do with that ... right ?Other than that , fantastic write up and a HUGE thank you for it .UgoStrange ....I recently saw this movie and have never subscribed to a forum before ...but i was so impressed with the synopsis that I just had to .... mainly because the explanation answered all of my questions but one .... it goes as follows : .The way I see it , there would only be clones for 69 minutes , as Boxer and Ronald / Roland 's future selves appeared 69 minutes prior to them being sent into the rift .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only way for that to happen is if , once he saw the clone of himself , then decided not to go through the rift .Much like in the Back to the Future movies , MJ Fox only see 's his past self for a short period , and soon after he see 's himself disappearing in the Delorian .... hence looping himself back in time .Can you or anyone else help to explain how the clone can still appear in the current time after being sent back through time ?Just to add a little clarity to my question .... how if once driven through the time rift they are shot back 69 minutes , how can they both simultaneously appear after they drove through the time rift ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Actually watching this movie right now on netflix for like the 6th time .This explanation helped clear up a few of the questions I had .I did notice one thing though ...It 's explained when Boxer is talking to Bai Ling on the MegaZepplin that after they crossed through the rift , Bai Ling activated the self destruct button in the SUV .Future Boxer and Future Roland appear 69 minutes before they cross , and then the SUV gets blown up killing past Boxer .I 'm guessing they were trying to kill both Boxers to see what happened but only got one of them in the explosion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Least that s how I took it after watching it several times .Rich .... i 'm right there with ya ... she did say she blew up the SUV ... but was it definitely blown up before they passed through the rift ?If so ... and it was blown up before they passed through , how did their clones pop up 69 minutes prior ?I would think they 'd have to pass through in order to be sent back 69 minutes ... right ?I 'm not too sure about the physics of it all but here 's my guess .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They become two separate entities essentially and are not tied to whether Past Boxer and Past Roland make it through the rift .They just .... for a lack of a better phrase ... are .( if that makes any sense ) .Sorry for the necro , but what exactly does the US - Ident card look like ?I 'm a member of another forum , and there is a thread where we post random ' whatever ' and I wanted to post an img of US - Ident just to see if anyone would recognize it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't seem to understand the problems people have following the plot .This is a wonderfully told story in a mildly surreal world .Try watching Kafka 's The Trial by Orson Welles and tell me this highly praised film is less confusing .I am a huge Kafka fan but The Trial will make you brain ooze out of your ears , but do n't get me wrong I love The Trial .The modern day film critic is n't worth anyone 's time of day .They do n't seem to be able to dig deep enough in the intellectual world to understand the psychology in Southland tales .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are not enough films that make you think , or stretch your imagination in this fashion like \" Oh What A Lovely War \" or one of my favorites \" The Saddest Music In The World \" .Personally , when Taverner \" A \" keeps saying \" I forgive you \" to Taverner \" B \" , it 's my belief that he is actually forgiving HIMSELF for injuring Pilot during the Gulf War ( I , II or III ? ) because Pilots ' narration says Taverner could \" never forgive himself \" for causing the injury .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That would explain the lapses in logic about Boxer & Taverner meeting themselves & what would happen if they did .Basically , when they drove through the rift , something went very wrong causing the \" future / past \" selves to be able to contact each other , thus collapsing the rift & destroying the universe ... which would have created yet another universe .Badmovies.org is owned and operated by Andrew Borntreger .All original content is \u00a9 1998 - 2014 by its respective author(s ) .Image , video , and audio files are used in accordance with the Fair Use Law , and are property of the film copyright holders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
