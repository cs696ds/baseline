{"text": "I did n't like it at first , but once you hear it it takes root in your head and you 'll be humming it for months .Good Hit .I view this as a filler ; it 's not bad and it 's not something that I tend to skip , but there 's nothing here that hooks me in .It 's a empty pop / r&b driven song , with uninspired lyrics about how hot she is , so do n't you wish that she was yours ?I 've listened to it many times to review and I still ca n't think of anything worth adding to this description , it 's just meaningless noise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lil Wayne ] .Apparently Lil Wayne is Jennifer 's favourite male rapper , so she asked him to feature on this Taio Cruz written track .The song is n't too complicated or anything ; Jennifer 's lines are mainly about being into the attraction of her partner , whilst Lil Wayne mostly hangs in the background and just adds nudge nudge , wink wink quips .This is another track that I was n't keen on at first , but the music once again seems happy and summery , which coupled with repetitive vocals means it will grow on you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "[ Appeared the soundtrack to The Backup Plan ] .This was one of the first songs to leak a few years ago and I still love it .The song is about not knowing what love is and the writers say that they drew inspiration from tales from women with \" no fathers , families , abusive boyfriends and husbands ...no parental support , they feel alone \" .Now I 'm not classing Jennifer Lopez in with these tough survivors , but she does channel the emotions of loneliness and quiet sadness in the lyrics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Run The World .This comes very close to being a filler ; bland lyrics telling someone that Jennifer will always be by their side .Music - wise it reminds me of a pop / r&b J.Lo era song [ with a touch of Rebirth 's Hold You Down thrown in ] and it 's annoying me that I ca n't remember which one .The rapper is Rick Ross .Does n't mean anything to me , but it might to other people .He does n't actually do much here , so he does n't earn a ' featuring ' tag .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Placing this track next to another bland track was a mistake as this is another ho - hum track , which again lyrically tells us about how great she is [ a super lady].Yeah ; hearing the title I was expecting a attitude laden track attacking the tabloids , but instead it 's papi as in the slang term for a hot guy .But the music comes to the rescue and makes up for the empty lyrics ; it 's another summery r&b / pop / Latin upbeat number , so it could do well as a single .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The lyrics of this ballad reminds me slightly of Ai n't It Funny [ obviously the original version , not the Murder Inc remix ] and Alive , plus it is also reminiscent of ( What Is ) Love ?Basically Jennifer 's through with being hurt in love , but just when she 's thrown in the towel along comes her knight in shining armour .There 's no doubt that Jennifer 's vocals have grown , but she just is n't vocally suited to ballads ; you can hear the strain as she gamely attempts the high notes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One Love .This is very similar to ( What Is ) Love ; this track is telling us about Jennifer 's search for love .I get the references to P Diddy , Ben Affleck and Marc Anthony , but all I can think is what about hubbies one and two ( or maybe he is ' round two ' ) ?It 's another snooze fest musically - part Run The World , part ( What Is ) Love , but not as good as either - and remember that I do n't love Run The World .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Invading My Mind .This is a Lady GaGa / RedOne track , so has dancier electro beats .I naturally wanted to love it , but it is just a weaker version of Just Dance .The listener is one more reminded that Jennifer is hot , but for a change we hear about how great some one she meets is and how much the sparks fly between them .Sadly this is another track that I ca n't think of anything valid to add .Villain .This is another favourite of mine ; Jennifer sings about being the one to end a relationship that was n't working and so being made out to be a cold villain because of it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The lyrics may seem heartfelt , but the music is electro / r&b , to keep the track upbeat and being all ' poor me , I 'm the real victim ' .Starting Over .This is another heartfelt vocal .Jennifer says that she is in love with her partner , but deep down she knows the relationship is n't working , yet she is scared to end it and being back to square one .Not bad , but it 's really just a mishmash of other album tracks .It is lyrically a ballad , but I do n't think the music is slow enough and it had an annoying synth beat that drowns out the piano and strings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Another Lady GaGa / RedOne track , another track that I wanted to love - but do n't .Musically the electro pop / dance beat is stronger than Invading My Mind , but lyrically I 'm still not sure what exactly it 's about , ; dancing in a club , whilst the men all drool over her I think .The music just about saves the track from being labelled as a filler , but I once again wanted / expected more from this track , considering the writers / producers .On the plus side : LOVE ? mixes R&B , dance and pop , with a ballad thrown in , so there is variety in music styles and there will be something on LOVE ? to appeal to most pop music lovers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "How well you think everything all comes together ultimately on LOVE ? depends on how big of a Jennifer Lopez fan you are - the more casual fan will ultimately be a little disappointed by how heavily she has borrowed from past albums and topped up the albums running time with limp , lifeless tracks .Bigger fans will doubtlessly love the retro feel to the tracks and hail LOVE ? a successful return to form for her .Although LOVE ?Several tracks are bland and uninspired and everything feels dated , even the new tracks .Quicklinks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Strong performances are marred by weak CGI and a lack of a central villain .Will Smith .That 's all you 've got to say , and you 're guaranteed a big opening at the box office .Well , from the looks of it , Smith also guarantees you at least a mildly entertaining film , which is what we get in his latest movie , Hancock .In the hands of any other leading star , Hancock would probably end up being a below average film .It 's Smith 's charisma , charm , and unwavering likability that ultimately save the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hancock is not the generic superhero film and is probably one of the more ingenious ideas to come across a producer 's desk in quite some time .The writers ' plan to solve this problem is to throw in a totally unnecessary and badly handled plot twist to keep the audience guessing .The lack of a central villain also hurts the movie a lot .The character that serves as Hancock 's enemy in the finale is n't even well acted .The person is laughable .This is an action movie , so it should come as no surprise to see well done and original action in the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The camera is also quite crampy .I also have problems with the film 's score , as it does not add an epic feeling to the film like it should have .I felt like something was missing in the climax of the film ( which is not the end ) .The action scenes , while entertaining and original , were not long enough to engage the audience like say , The Incredible Hulk , nor were they as jaw dropping as those in Wanted .The film 's strength rides on its three stars .Action veterans Will Smith and Charlize Theron both deliver winning performances as usual , and that should come as no surprise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Theron is always a sight to behold ( except in Monster , lol ) , and this film is no different .I enjoyed her performance the most , especially in the second act and the beginning of the third .Jason Bateman , who seems to be the bridge connecting the performances of Smith and Theron , is great as usual , and likable , marking a change from his recent turn in \" Juno \" .There really is n't another performance to note , and part of Hancock 's weakness is that there are really only three main engaging characters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hancock is the classic case of great idea , and mediocre execution .I can see this idea being remade years from now , and pulled off even better .It 's not a fault of Peter Berg , the film 's director , as the real weakness is in the screenplay , which falters after an excellent and wonderful opening act .It 's not a bad film by any means , nor is it great .It 's in between \" okay \" and \" good \" .Not your typical \" superhero \" movie , but still good .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't understand all of the criticism this movie is receiving .Everyone take a second and realize this is not a Marvel or DC comic book superhero movie .Now think about that again .It is a different story entirely and has some very unique elements .Hancock is n't action packed .It does n't have a Superhero vs. Supervillan plot .I would probably describe it as a character study of the superhero .I think this movie does a better job of addressing some of the issues ( and vices ) a superhero probably would have if they existed today .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think much of the criticism I have read about is motivated by expectations that were not met , which is n't fair at all .If you watch Hancock with only the expectation of being entertained , you will leave happy .Its a good movie , do n't jump on the bandwagon of not liking it just because you can .Give it a chance and take it for what it is , a July 4th action / comedy .I guess some people just ca n't take a switch in tone .I 've read a lot of the reviews here complaining about the film flagging in its final act .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hancock is most definitely DIFFERENT in it 's last half - it drops off the comedy significantly and introduces some fascinating superhero mythology that is almost like an ancient Greek myth in its context .It also introduces some pretty tense and violent moments that really made me wonder if they should be marketing it as the kid - friendly summer blockbuster that they are .However , both halves have their own merits - the first being the humour , and the second being the ( almost tragic ) origin mythos .I suspect if you are prepared for the switch in tone , rather than shocked when it arrives , you might enjoy Hancock as much as I did .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lots of people , including the critics , are ragging on this film .Seriously , what did they expect ?It 's a Hollywood blockbuster with Wil Smith in .Get over it , turn your brain off , and sit back and enjoy the ride .For what it was , I thought it pretty good .It was entertaining , took a unique take on the superhero thing , and did n't have an overt number of huge gaping plot holes or completely blithe dialog .If you 're feeling like a Wil Smith movie , go for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "About a superhuman who is just very human .Author : from United States 5 July 2008 .Hancock was a pretty interesting as well as entertaining movie .It definitely was n't your typical superhero movie ; and it was n't originally a DC or Marvel comic .It 's more about what would happen if someone with superheroes was around in modern times , and that is what makes it interesting .If there 's some property damage done while catching criminals , people will be angry ; if a vigilante has a bad attitude , people will be angry .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I liked the media attention and the use of sunglasses as a \" mask \" of sorts .I really liked how Hancock progresses as a character , and I liked the other characters as well .Usually little kids in movies annoy me , but the son of the supporting character was pretty cute and endearing .This is n't really a hero movie where there is a superhero and a super villain ; I think it 's more about what it means to be a human and relate to other people , to do good things and the desire to be accepted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was a lot of fun .Fix the final Act PLEASE ! ! !I also was at the test screening in Peoria AZ .The film was spot on for the first hour .Jokes were hitting left and right , Smith and Bateman displayed good chemistry , and the special effects , though not always finished , were eye popping nonetheless .Without giving it away , the final half hour was flat , straying from the comical nature that had preceded it and instead tried to get philosophical and introduce a week paint'by'numbers villain .I spoke with director Peter Berg after the film and he seemed fully aware of the issues relating to the final act .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the form I saw it ; it still has a ways to go .Excellent hour and fifteen minutes ( the movie is probably 100 minutes in length if I had to estimate the pacing in that time period was spot on ) .Even though there were n't as many action sequences as expected they all were pretty memorable especially a fight between Hancock and another superhero ( I wo n't spoil it ) .A really good twist that I did n't see coming at all ( when you see it you 'll understand ) .Cons : The villain was n't fleshed out at all in any way ( they really did n't need to have one in the first place and could have changed a few of the last scenes ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "If you are going because you like the cast and are ready to be entertained for 1 hour and 20 minutes out of your life , then it is definitely worth the price of admission .Surprisingly Good .The latest Will Smith effort is much different from the average big budget flashy superhero movies that have dominated the box office the last few years .Do n't go to Hancock thinking you are seeing another Superman , Fantastic 4 , Ironman or Hulk .The superhero angle is treated much differently here .I think part of the perception problem with this film is from the silly trailers we have seen for the last 6 months .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sure , there are laughs in this movie , but it 's Will Smith !He 's FUNNY !Go see Hancock because it 's DIFFERENT from the mega - budget movies that come straight from the comic book pages complete with a witty Stan Lee cameo .Do n't get me wrong , I loved Ironman and The Hulk .But Hancock is not a movie that will have comic book geeks arguing on message boards about how the movie left so much out and the character was nothing like the comic .It is a film with a story that happens to be about a guy with super powers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "How can you go wrong ?Will Smith Delivers another Summertime Movie Treat .I caught a preview showing of Hancock tonight .I enjoyed it for what it was which is a fun , mostly fast - paced popcorn flick .The writers of the film also tossed in a nice plot twist that I did n't see coming but it turned out to work just fine .This is n't Shakespeare so I do n't demand a lot of deep thought just some escapist fun .Will Smith does an excellent job of playing the disinterested superhero with an existential crisis .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This means I am not so young myself anymore .Jae Head did n't overact nor did the script writers push the \" cute \" button to the point of being saccharine .It will be interesting to see how this movie performs to see if Smith wants to do a sequel .So I am more than happy to recommend Hancock to fans of the \" Summer Blockbuster \" and those who enjoy Will Smith .It 's hard to imagine Japanese cinema without Takashi Miike .All sarcasm aside , the man has become synonymous with the ever - growing new wave of Japanese films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It 's certainly flawed , however , Sean Penn gives a bravura performance and the film has ample nostalgic charm and humor to entertain .The film ultimately , despite being relatable , does n't accomplish a whole lot .LOL funny but not terribly memorable .I find young Jennifer Jason Leigh 's moonface utterly forgettable ( unlike her adult jagged little pill face ) , but she does well when she tells Damone , \" No .Take that back , \" after he accuses her of wanting sex more than he did .My favorite character would have to be Brad , played by the Honorable Judge Reinhold .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Know it .Live it . \" Spicoli is great and some of the scenes are funny , yet I found it difficult to get into this film .Maybe it 's because it lacks a story .Instead it studies the life of high school kids , and for that it 's entertaining .It 's similar to \" Dazed and Confused \" , just a different era .One of the key teen comedies of the 80 's is a definite must see for fans of 80 's cinema .Although not as knee slapping hilarious as other teen comedy films , this film is still a terrific comedic gem of the 1980 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's some good gags on - screen , the cast is terrific and though at time the film shows its imperfections , for the most part it succeeds at being an entertaining film .Although not as memorable as many John Hughes comedies , this is nonetheless a very good film that has some very funny moments .Sure the film is n't perfect , but it manages to be funny , dramatic and lot of fun that its faults are minimal .The film is lots of fun from start to finish and is one of those timeless teen comedies that still stands the test of time after all these years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fast Times At Ridgemont High is a classic film that is among the best teen oriented comedy films of the 1980 's .A very enjoyable film that is pure fun and a must see for fans of classic 80 's teen comedies .This film helms one of the highest reputations in teen film history .It is the spark of many of it 's actors careers .From stoned surfers , to sex crazed teenagers , to love , \" Fast Times At Ridgemont High \" is one great big teen flick that I will always have the fun pleasure of watching .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You actually feel like you have the same emotions all of these characters do and by the end of the film , you just hope everything turns out the way they want it to .I mean , the plot is very thin , going on not much of story , but rather creating an atmosphere of high school life .I had so much fun watching this film and I would gladly watch it many more times .It 's nothing very original , but oddly , it is quite memorable .\" Fast Times At Ridgemont High \" definitely gets in the laughs within it 's short 90 minute span and the Hard R - rating definitely shows in the final product .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Very fun movie !Good fun movie .An 80 's classic with all the typical high school happenings .In this film you cann see a whole lot of young hollywood stars which made it big and other who did n't .Even Nicholas Cage made a cameo in this film when he still went as his original birth name Nicholas Coppola , he later changed his name so he can grow in the acting business and not be overlook in the Coppola family business .Follows a group of high school students growing up in southern California , based on the real - life adventures chronicled by Cameron Crowe .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The center of the film is held by Jeff Spicoli , a perpetually stoned surfer dude who faces off with the resolute Mr. Hand , who is convinced that everyone is on dope .This film has quite a reputation , but you know what ?It 's pretty overrated .Oh yeah , it 's entertaining , but I always thought there was more to this movie than there really is , and that it was far more epic or something .Instead , it is funny and entertaining , but underwhelming .I think the style is to blame .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's got a very loose episodic feel to it , and , even though I like that sort of thing occasionally , it did n't really work for me here .The film feels a little too jumbled and sporadic .Maybe it should have been more clear with the passage of time ot more tightly focused or something .I think they could have just followed one of these characters more , then restricted the rest to less focus .That could have been better .Instead , the film tries to do a bit much , but given the running time , everything becomes rushed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Part of the time .There are some dips into serious territroy , and I think they do work for the most part .I 'm not like Ebert who called this film mysoginistic and a scuzz pit ( or something ) .The film does sport a ( now ) very very notable cast , and the performances are really good , especially from scene stealers Sean Penn and Ray Walston .Cates , Leigh , and Reinhold all do quite well also .I was a bit disappointed that this film did n't quite live up to all the hype , but it does capture the times pretty decently , and there are some good moments and laughs , plus I was never bored , so yeah .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Honest , raunchy and hilarious , but more essentially , one of the best high school comedies ever made .I do n't think I 've ever seen so many great characters in one and the same comedy .The dialogue is superb , the acting spot - on and it 's incredibly fun to see actors like Sean Penn , Nicolas Cage and Forest Whitaker at such a young and rebellious age .Not to mention Jennifer Jason Leigh , who really stole my heart in this one .A true 80 's classic !Spicoli : \" What Jefferson was saying was , Hey !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Get it ? \" Fast Times At Ridgemont High is the best teen comedy ever made and one of the best comedies period .Sean Penn really shines in an early role as Spicoli .He is hilarious , especially when he 's on screen with Mr. Hand(Ray Walston ) .The scene where Spicoli orders pizza is one of the best .The rest of the cast does really well also .Judge Reinhold and Jennifer Jason Leigh are very good as a brother sister combo .Robert Romanus is good as the jackass that every school has .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie also features a great soundtrack .Of all the teenage 80 's high school romps , this is one of the best examples of commercialism within the trends of high schoolers , frivolity of sex and their consequences , and the views of adolescents during a political crisis .Put that all aside and all anyone remembers are the multitude of women 's breasts .Full of iconic moments in film history , Fast Times exceeds at developing full fledged characters , with somewhat unrealistic qualities , and yet enjoyable and entertaining antics .From Spicoli vs. Mr. Hand , to Stacy 's romantic escapades , to the breakdown of Brad being a free man , I was never disenchanted by these vulnerable youth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is a great step back into the 80s .Gives a real cool feel for life before internet access , mobile phones , and all the problems that go with .This is what movies were for , communication amongst peers .The music and list of actors and actresses are great .When I see movies like this I just step into a dream world where all my problems are dissolved .The story is woven between several smaller stories that all include students from the same year .Each actor and actress brings something different to the screen and its all pretty educational too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then give this a go .Its great fun .10/11/2010 ( TELEVISION)Old - school flick that I caught on TV the other night .I do say though that it beats the teen flicks they make today !A fun , often hilarious take on high school life in the 80 's and how several different teenagers struggle to cope with sexuality , friendship , and classes together .While it does feature its fair share of corny acting , this movie is definitely carried by Sean Penn 's legendary stoner - slacker performance which is just absolutely side - splitting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Without a doubt a re - watchable movie thanks to its tight running time , good feel for 80 's culture , and iconic lead character .Definitely had its good moments .I really liked Judge Reinhold , his character and his acting .And Sean Penn was quite good ; the interactions with him and the teacher , made me wish I had more gusto in high school .However I found it REALLY over dramatized .So much sex to the point of trashy , really .A must see teen film .It shows us all how teens act in high school .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I also thought Brad & Rat were soooo cute & Damone was a asshole .Do n't make the mistake I did & never watch this again because some parts could come off as too raunchy give it another shot & you 'll love it & the music that was featured !Thank god for On Demand lol :) I really enjoyed this 80s classic & you will too ! \"In Ridgemont ?We ca n't even get cable TV here , Stacy , and you want romance .\" I have a budding appreciation for the 80 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But all the teen movies that I 've seen have led me to believe it was an awesome and corny time to be an adolescent .Fast Times at Ridgemont High is one of the iconic movies from that era , and that reputation is richly deserved .It still holds up very well today .It starred younger versions of a bevy of today 's biggest stars , like Forest Whitaker and Sean Penn , alongside some of the names that were synonymous with the 80 's , like Jennifer Jason Leigh and Phoebe Cates .It 's very much an ensemble movie , with a collection of characters and scenarios that range from light - hearted ( Penn ) to more dramatic ( Leigh ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As a result , this was n't a simple sex romp or teen comedy .Sure , it was pretty funny in parts , but it also dealt with the sometimes heavy issues that teens were wrestling with back then ( and are still tackling today ) .The twists and turns of teenage relationships , unplanned pregnancies , jobs , abortions , and the like , are touched on in a genuine ( if simplified ) manner .Even so , this movie is a lot more evenly split between comedy and social commentary than The Breakfast Club was , for example .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's not a bad idea to give it a viewing if you missed it the first time around .I 'm glad that I did .How can you not absolutely love this ?It does for the 80s what American Graffiti did for the 60s , only I feel it 's even better .The multiple story lines are perfect and actually have a relevance to each other .It 's also one of the best shot teen movies , making it even more of a time capsule classic .Then there 's all the wonderful performances from Sean Penn , Jennifer Jason Leigh and Judge Reinhold .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
