{"text": "Let 's be real - $ had to factor in somewhere , but if memory serves , a big part of the reason novelist Elmore Leonard decided to write a follow - up to Get Shorty was John Travolta 's superb performance as Chili Palmer .In Be Cool , Mr. Leonard places Chili , who is always looking for new challenges , squarely in the middle of the high stakes pop music world after his involvement in some unsuccessful and unnecessary sequels ( just like this one ! ) kills his enthusiasm for the movie business .Mr. Palmer 's transition into this new environment proves to be a pretty easy one though , as the folks that run the music scene seem to be every bit as crooked and violent as those in the film biz , if not more so .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am reluctant to reveal any more details , for to do so would be to spoil what little fun there is to be found in Be Cool .As such , I think it is time to move along and discuss aspects of this film other than the story .I will begin by opining that while this motion picture is funny on occasion , Peter Steinfeld 's script is weak overall , and proves to be incapable of capturing the spirit of Elmore Leonard 's book as magically as Scott Frank 's playful screenplay for Get Shorty did .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hell , they even managed to suck almost all the life out of John Travolta , who was magnificent in the first film , where he completely lost himself in the role of a tough but fair mobster with a passion for movies and moviemaking .To me , the way the Chili Palmer character was watered down in this film is probably the biggest tragedy .To his credit , Travolta gives a very noble effort in reprising what I think is his signature role , but his formerly charismatic shylock Chili Palmer falls victim to the script , and is not as amusing or charming the second time around .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The lack of creativity on display in this film was also quite troubling .This is a bit strange , since much of Aerosmith 's audience probably would n't care for Moon 's tunes very much .Even worse , Gray and company rely too much on Vince Vaughn 's wannabe \" playa \" , who will no doubt annoy most viewers with his barrage of slang within 15 minutes , and far too many in - jokes and cameos for humor .For instance , the wrestling fans among you may notice The Rock lift his trademarked eyebrow , as he has done in so many of his tirade - filled wrestling interviews , but it becomes tedious after the first few times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately for Be Cool , precious few of the in - jokes , cameos , and tributes do anything to advance the story , generate laughs , or infuse life into the film .Rather , such things only serve to exemplify how lazy and uninspired the filmmakers were .Fortunately , in addition to John Travolta 's brave attempt to get Be Cool off the ground , the film does have one supporting player capable of generating some laughter - professional wrestler / actor The Rock ( a.k.a .Dwayne Johnson ) .Here , he plays Raji 's gay bodyguard Elliot , who is also an aspiring entertainer desperate to break into show business , but in all of the wrong ways .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately , if Travolta can not save this sinking ship , than neither can The Rock , who has much less screen time .Outside of the Rock and Travolta , the majority of the performances seem to be phoned in , and very few of the characters are as interesting as those in Get Shorty were .Shockingly , even Uma Thurman was unable to generate any heat between her and co - star John Travolta !To be sure , most of the characters are as odd as those in Get Shorty , but they are not nearly as much fun to watch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Indeed , where its predecessor , Barry Sonnenfeld 's Get Shorty , was hip , witty , and inspired , this film is surprisingly disjointed , dull and unimaginative , not to mention poorly written .As I mentioned , I did laugh a little bit , especially when The Rock was onscreen , but as Delroy Lindo said in Get Shorty , \" I 've seen better film on teeth . \" SO , HOW DOES IT LOOK ?Though it has been cropped a bit for the PSP 's screen ( from 1.85:1 to 1.78:1 ) , MGM 's Be Cool looks very nice on UMD !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In particular , the wide array of colors , from Vince Vaughn 's vibrant attire , to Travolta 's dark , classic clothing , looks fabulous , and exhibits no noticeable bleed or other defects .The same holds for flesh tones , which are pleasantly natural in their appearance throughout the film , and make the gradations between the actors ' skin readily apparent .Fine detail and image clarity are also very good , in both close - ups and shots where the characters are a distance from the camera , so the texture of people and objects was almost palpable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie may be lame , but at least MGM 's transfer is cool , so if your opinion of the film differs from mine , you will find this portable version of the film rather easy on the eyes !WHAT IS THAT NOISE ?As far as presentation goes , MGM bats 1.000 on this UMD , as they have endowed Be Cool with a great sounding stereo mix that really serves the film 's action sequences and music well .In particular , frequency response is nice and even , and the soundstage is spacious for a UMD , particularly whenever music is playing ( which is often ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Finally , the characters ' speech and singing , from Raji 's annoying barrage of street lingo to Linda Moon 's R&B crooning , comes through cleanly , without any problems , such as distortion or sibilance .Indeed , it is never a chore to figure out what is being said , with the exception of Vince Vaughn perhaps , which is good , since there is so much exposition in this film .All in all , this soundtrack really does its job well , and is a worthy compliment to the good - looking image transfer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "THE LAST WORD Watching Be Cool is kind of like watching me dance , as the film has no rhythm , which it is really hard to \" be cool \" without .To be fair , there are a few funny moments sprinkled throughout , but those moments are certainly not sprinkled around liberally enough to make me overlook the unimaginative gags and hokey storyline that comprise the bulk of this film .If you enjoyed Get Shorty , I expect that you will be just as disappointed as I was in this film .It is unfortunate that no extras are included , but most current UMDs do not have any on board either .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
