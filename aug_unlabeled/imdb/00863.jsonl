{"text": "This is one of the best Horrormovies ever and it is very unfair to put it in one bag with pointless movies like \" Hell House \" .Buy it , and maybe you will agree !Top critical review .3.0 out of 5 stars Choppy adaptation of Peter Straub 's novel but still worth a look .By DC on February 28 , 2015 .I 've seen bits and pieces of Ghost Story on television over the years and finally decided to purchase the dvd .I also decided to read the Peter Straub novel in which this movie is based right before watching this film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What a shame though in all things considered .That being said however , the film is technically well made by director John Irvin and production crew .The film is rich with creepy atmosphere in regards to production design and cinematography .Telling these stories as we later discover is their own therapeutic way of blocking out an incident that happened in their lives fifty years ago .Things do not go as planned as something has come back after all these years to exact revenge on these men one by one unless something can be done about it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "She is seductive , cold and calculating and her voice , along with that accent , makes her rather unpleasant character kind of irresistible .She was indeed perfectly cast and it looks like she had a great time playing the elusive ghost tormenting the cowardly men of The Chowder Society .The cinematography is also excellent here and the overall look and feel of the film is effective and at times , chilling .We get some beautiful , eerie shots of the sleepy , quaint village covered in ice and blankets of snow adding much needed tension and fear , a frozen lake , a dark crumbling house with leaking , crumbling walls and colourful period costumes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although I have never read Straub 's original novel , it has been stated that , not surprisingly , it is superior and very different to the film since several important elements were removed .Apparently Eva / Alma is a shape - shifter , a Manitou and this is not the direction the film went which is a shame as these otherworldly transformations would have raised the fright factor in the movie .With that said , the make up effects are very good .The vindictive spook appears in various stages of decomposition throughout unfortunately she appears for only a couple of seconds of screen time and the viewer has to wait another 30 minutes or so before the nasty corpse is briefly shown again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Movies revolve around characters and actions , and Straub 's fiction really plays on a much higher level .Frankly , I 'm surprised that anyone would even attempt to adapt Straub for the big screen .Robbed of its atmospheric build - up , Ghost Story ( the film ) proves quite incapable of immersing you in the dark shadows haunting the Chowder Club Society meetings .Unable to take on a life of its own onscreen , Ghost Story feels to me like an old made - for - TV movie .The four elderly , distinguished gentlemen who make up the The Chowder Society have been trading ghost tales and scary stories for decades .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Moving at a preternaturally slow pace , the film will surely turn off a lot of younger fans expecting a lot of in - your - face action from start to finish .It 's hard to assign much blame for the ordinariness of this movie , though , as it really comes down to the fact that Peter Straub 's fiction just does n't lend itself to theatrical adaptation .There was a problem loading comments right now .Please try again later .When I first saw GHOST STORY on its initial release , I found it to be an entertaining , if not faithful , adaptation of Peter Straub 's frightening novel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
