{"text": "Recent Updates .Reviews .Emanuelle in America .Credits .A common misconception about film is that the \" sequel boom \" began in the 1980 's with such titles as Friday the 13th , Rocky , and Back to the Future .In fact , large and small studios had been churning out sequels to popular titles for almost twenty years before Rocky fought the big Russian .During the much looser restrictions of the 60 's and 70 's many movies were n't even remotely related to the film to which they were supposedly based on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Emmanuelle character is basically a sexual adventurer .All of the films are allegedly based on a 1973 French film starring porn star Sylvia Kristel , Emmanuelle ( spelled with 2 m 's ) based on the autobiography of actress Emmanuelle Arson ( The Sand Pebbles ) .The film was a huge hit internationally , making over $ 100 million , and spawning many legitimate sequels .Much more numerous however were the dozens of titles which just borrowed the Emmanuelle character and the varying degrees of hard or soft - core sex , depending on which film you watch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A considerable amount of the Emmanuelle films are unrelated foregn sex films , where the female lead 's name was changed to Emmanuelle when the film was dubbed into English .However during the mid to late 70 's a few of the Emanuelle ( with 1 m ) films began to be about more than just mindless sex scenes spliced together .The beginning of this turn for the better was the introduction to a new actress to the role of Emanuelle : Laura Gemser .A dark - skinned , exotic beauty from the island of Java , Gemser was not only more attractive than the previous and subsequent Emmanuelles , she was also a much better actress .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The series of films where Gemser is paired with Italian director Joe D'Amato ( Porno Holocaust , Anthrophagus , etc ) transcend the boundaries of the standard 70 's nudie movie .The half - dozen Emanuelle films that he made ( in a two year period ! ) are true exploitation classics and could serve as a perfect primer for an exploitation neophyte .Lets examine what I feel to be the best of these films : Emanuelle in America .The film begins in America ( of course ) , specifically New York City where Emanuelle is both an erotic photographer and a freelance investigative journalist for an unnamed newspaper .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\"Emanuelle of course escapes using her sexuality .Now that everyone is caught up , the plot begins .Emanuelle gets a tip from a source that something is amiss in California .Wealthy industrialist Eric Van Darren is buying a harem , with each girl corresponding to a Zodiac sign .Immediately Emanuelle fakes her passport to become a Virgo and heads of to join in the fun .Thus begins one of the most intricate plots in the history of exploitation films .Freaky things are certainly afoot at the Van Darren compound ( basically just lots of sex ) , including one of the harem girls masturbating a horse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Emanuelle escapes the compound to break the story to the world with the help of a handsome Italian aristocrat who invites her to visit him in Italy .This first episode serves as a blueprint for the rest of the film in two ways .Firstly , the action is divided up by the stories that Emanuelle writes for the paper .She returns to New York to turn in the story and pitch her next idea inbetween each adventure .Secondly , during each adventure she meets someone or sees something that leads her to the next adventure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is also an effective way of developing the plot .The viewer never knows more than Emanuelle herself which leads to a small but welcome aspect of suspense .Emanuelle does visit the Italian nobleman at his estate in Venice .There she finds that his intent was less than honorable ( imagine that ) and he is really a part of group of wealthy sexual deviants ( story # 2 ) .During this incident she meets an old and ugly rich woman with a young handsome boyfriend .With some snooping she finds out there is a small island in the Carribean where wealthy women can buy themselves a young stud , and of course try them out first ( story # 3 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This episode serves as a juxtaposition to the harem from the beginning ; the filmmaker 's subtle attempt to show that women can be just as immoral as men .It is on this island where the true meat of the story is revealed .In this place where the customers can afford anything they desire and there are no laws to restrain them , Emanuelle stumbles on the one sexual taboo that makes even her squeamish : torture / snuff films ( story # 4 ) .Emanuelle , being a good reporter , is curious to whether or not the film is real , and if so , who is responsible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This was both a swipe at the United States by the Italian filmmakers and a type of socio - political commentary .We see the timeless theme of \" absolute power corrupting absolutely \" and the standard 70 's antiestablishmentarianism .In a nod to Pasolini 's Salo : or the 120 Days of Sodom , those who have the desire to rule over people view them as a commodity , not as humans .I never like to spoil endings , so I 'll just say that there are some more snuff films , some LSD , but Emanuelle is O.K. and has a happy ending .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Somehow D'Amato 's sick and twisted tendencies shown in the majority of his films were reigned in to a reasonable level and do n't overwhelm the message .During D'Amato 's run at the helm of the series , Emanuelle became a quasi - feminist heroine .The original film had Emmanuelle the epitome of male desires and she behaved like a stereotypical male fantasy brought to life .In this and the other Gemser / D'Amato films , the power lies with Emanuelle and is more about her exploring her own sexual freedom as opposed to pleasing others .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To put this film in context of other exploitation films reviewed here at NotComing in has less sex than Caligula and less violence than I Spit On Your Grave .It is still more than some people can handle though , so do n't expect to sit down and watch this with your parents or clergyman .While it has both explicit hardcore sex and graphic violence , I 've seen this film lambasted on other internet film sites for being too \" tame .\" I wo n't get on my soapbox , but many , many people watch these films for less academic reasons , and Emanuelle in America does n't have enough sex for the perverts or enough violence for the gore - hounds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A \" List Acting Talent On paper , Olive was a dynamite part : intelligent , funny , observant , surprisingly tough and heartbreakingly vulnerable .The big question for the filmmakers , then , was who could make this vital role come alive on screen .The success of the project depended on the perfect casting for Olive .A lot of people and characters that are really smart who know everything and talk like adults are so annoying that you want to punch them in the face .This is a girl who is smart like a whip , but does n't know she 's smart , and if anything , she 's embarrassed by the fact that she 's smart .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I got calls from what seemed like every actress between the ages of 16 and 28 .As soon as I heard that Emma Stone wanted to do it , I was very excited .We met really quickly , and she had no problem auditioning for me .A lot of this movie takes place with Olive speaking into her computer 's web cam .After her audition , Emma went home , did a scene into her webcam and emailed it to me .I took the disc with that scene to the head of the studio and said \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThis is the girl .

{"text": "Olive uses all these big words and makes silly puns , and she 's well aware that what she 's doing is kind of dumb , but she ca n't stop herself from doing it .I do the same thing .There were so many things that made me feel a kinship with the character , that I felt that whether or not it was me , she deserved whoever it was that played her be willing to understand her .In her first meeting with Will Gluck , Stone found that the two of them were very much in synch about the character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I understood that there was no becoming this girl .You either were or were n't Olive .With Stone in place as Olive , the filmmakers began the process of finding the actors who would surround her .When they were done , they found themselves almost overwhelmed at the level of talent who eagerly agreed to be a part of the project .Co- stars Aly Michalka and Amanda Bynes , who play Rhiannon and Marianne , respectively , readily admit that the differences between their characters in Easy A and their past work are a big part of what drew them to their roles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She is definitely very foulmouthed and will say anything that 's on her mind , which can sometimes be either offensive or abrasive , but she always means well .She just does n't really have any sort of a filter .Known primarily to younger audiences for her work on the Disney Channel sitcom Phil of the Future and as a platinum selling recording artist with her sister as the pop - music duo , Aly and A.J. , Michalka enjoyed pushing the envelope with Rhiannon .\" I love that she 's a strong character .She 's similar to me in that she 's a great friend , and very loyal , but we 're definitely very different in the way we speak and handle ourselves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When it came to the tightly wound , evangelical Marianne Bryant , Amanda Bynes found inspiration in a character very different than the kind of young woman she typically plays . \" Bynes says that although Marianne 's actions are kind of questionable , there was still something likeable and relatable about her . \"In directing the actresses , Will Gluck found it easy to forget his talented cast were n't simply wonderful actors , but stars to the world outside a film set . \"Two other actors with big fan bases were also more than happy to take on new character challenges with their roles in Easy A. .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The second and third time you meet him , he 's in a woodchuck costume .The sixth time you meet him , he 's wearing a lobster hat .Ideally , for most of the film , you do n't really know what my character is doing in the movie , but it all makes perfect sense at the end .I had a lot of fun being the strange , irreverent guy who does these seemingly inconsequential things throughout the movie , but what made me really want to play the role , was the substance and importance of the character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
