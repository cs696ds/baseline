{"text": "But the thing is that by that point we are left with a bunch of cardboard cut out personalities and no one really to bond to .Demons is obviously heavily inspired by Wes Craven 's Scream and includes a multitude of references .Many of them reach beyond the realms of just ' inspiration ' in to flagrant cut , copy and paste territory .For a genre that has survived on its ability to self reference , this is all acceptable if it 's handled correctly .Rose 's script lacks charm however and the wit to accompany its lack of authenticity and energy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As slasher movies are not renowned for their strengths in dramatics , complexity in plotting or philosophical messages , they can only really aim for two emotions .The first and most obvious is fear - everybody loves a good scare .The only other option is to make the film as camp as possible and give the audience something to enjoy in a more humorous way .Demons however gets lost in its attempt to convey a message that a ) we do n't understand and b ) we do n't give a damn about and takes itself far too seriously to be fun .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The characters are also laughably developed to the point of being infuriating .Each one is conceited , shallow and it does n't help that they are given dialogue that seems to have been written by a rebellious fourteen year - old .There 's a lot of vulgar swear words and talk about ' ass kicking ' and gags that only the aforementioned teenager would find amusing .The killer reminds me of the nut job from Honeymoon Horror in terms of his appearance , but even that forgettable entry from the early eighties would wipe the floor in terms of entertainment levels with this half - hearted throwaway .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One thing that is totally unforgivable however is that Sawblade feels like its been pushed together and rushed out the door with minimal effort from those involved and it does n't even make an attempt to cover up the fact .Towards the end of the runtime there 's not just one , but two silly twists and although the first is totally predictable , the second is mind boggling and laughable .The killer works his was through a large number of victims , but the obvious lack of budget means that the effects are expectedly cruddy .On the plus side , things move along quite quickly and you 'll never get bored .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
