{"text": "Someone at Alliance needs to be fired for changing long tested packaging that has worked for the last few decades .In addition , many episodes are edited from the original broadcast version .6 of 9 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .1 of 2 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .A lot of the episodes seems to be clich\u00e9 but if you enjoy sci - FY , this series is something you might enjoy ; I sure did .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I enjoyed the show , even though it 's kind of hokey now .The plot and acting pretty much was over the top for this season .The actors tried , but you can only do so much with the material .At least I sure hope the Ativas folks were trying for campy in their acting , because that was the result .Well , sad the series is over and a bit disappointed in the ending .There was a loose end with Sandoval and Liam Kincaid that I would have liked to have seen before the series finished .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Over all , though , I still liked the show .Even from the first seconds of season 5 , the new spoken intro by Jayne Heitmeyer ( which sounded like Vogon poetry ) signified that something was very askew .Completely off the rails , this was one of the most bizarre final seasons of any program ever ; it should have just been renamed as a spinoff serial .The introduction of the Atavus ( despicably ridiculous replacement villains ) was solely for the sake of someone 's perception that alien antagonists were a requirement for the show to go on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If not for Jayne Heitmeyer and Melinda Deines being easy on the eyes , I likely would have given up on it altogether .Even so , Heitmeyer presented with the aura of an actor suffering from personal problems .Insomnia ?Cocaine ?Perhaps she was the victim of a deplorable makeup artist who , combined with bad lighting , unintentionally made her look like a drug addict ?Only the most dedicated fans will make it to the end of the season .At least it can be said that rather than going out with a whimper instead of a bang , it went out with a WTF ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you were a fan of Gene Roddenberry , most likely you were an EFC fan as well .Season five wrapped up the series and in some ways , the writers seemed to loose their way some .While still entertaining , the story - lines seemed to get off track from the original theme .I guess when series writers are notified that they will be out of a job soon , they turn into slackers who just write whatever to fulfill their contracts and end the series .Anyhoo , I have the entire EFC series on DVD and enjoy watching it from time to time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
