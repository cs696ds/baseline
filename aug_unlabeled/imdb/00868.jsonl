{"text": "Best of all , though , is Heche , who has the most difficult role .Removed from the ' 60s context of doing anything to get married , Marion 's impulsive , plainly ruinous actions seem really nutty , and many of her lines come across as curiously over - ornate .Yet the actress is remarkably believable , overcoming the period gap , notably when chatting with Norman in his parlor .Van Sant has reportedly wanted to take a stab at Psycho for at least a decade , and the publicity machine at Universal , which owns the property , has dutifully played up the resistance that he encountered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Hitchcock 's Norman derives from other sources , while keeping the psychopathology from the novel .The most immediate source of Hitchcock 's depiction of Norman is Hitch 's belief that evil should look and act mundane .There are outlines of this idea in Shadow of a Doubt , and Hitchcock toys with it intermittently throughout his career , but he never really got it perfectly right until Psycho .Norman -- even his name is shockingly normal -- is completely non - threatening .The other source for Hitchcock 's Norman Bates is writer Cornell Woolrich .Woolrich 's crime and suspense stories from the 1930s and 40s are one of the underpinnings of film noir and of the Hitchcockian thriller itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
