{"text": "In the beginning the jury men decided they wanted to start with a verdict - driven style of orientation .In other words , they just wanted to take a vote and not talk .They wanted to \" get it over with , \" and be done with the trial .It later turns into a nasty evidence - driven style where all of the men are yelling at one another and trying to persuade one another to \" see \" their side .They wanted everyone to vote the same way .So they talked about the evidence that was given in the trial and thought of scenarios where the eyewitness ' testimonies could be wrong .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As the movie continued and the men debated whether or not the eyewitnesses were recalling true facts and if their testimonies were reliable , I could not help but think back to our class .I kept telling myself , \" They are n't reliable !Why do n't you guys understand this !Eyewitnesses are rarely one hundred percent accurate when recalling events , even ones with 20/20 vision ! \"But this also told me how a jury perceives eyewitness accounts .As we have learned , eyewitness testimonies are some of the most convincing evidence in the court of law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We watched as the open conflict unfolded .At first , there was juror number seven who was trying to use normative influence to either sway juror number eight to his side , or to keep the other jurors with him .He just wanted to get the deliberation process over with because he was more concerned with making it to his baseball game on time than he was with the trial .Juror number eight , the only juror who voted \" not guilty , \" was trying to use informational influence to understand how the murder took place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Juror eight was the only member who thought that it was possible for the boy to be innocent , and he was the one who did not want to sentence this boy to death if there was a reasonable doubt , which he had .This movie shows social psychology in action .Social psychology is the scientific study of how people 's thoughts , feelings , and behaviors are influenced by the actual , imagined , or implied presence of other .Social psychology explains how different group dynamics work , and this movie showed different representations of them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For example juror number twelve was a follower .He basically went where everyone else did .He did not take much of a stand for himself .He was a people pleaser in the group of jurors .They began to define themselves by the group they were a part of .Their social identity became the order in which they sat their juror number .Another part of social psychology explains the relations in a group , or the patterns of liking within the group and differences in status .For example , in \" 12 Angry Men \" juror nine was the first juror to change his vote and befriend juror number eight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Another thing I found interesting was the fact the men were locked in such a rundown room , and were forced to be hot and uncomfortable .I do n't feel like this would be the case nowadays , at least I hope not !12 Angry men related to law and psychology in a number of ways .Each of the men had a different personality and different outlook when it came to whether they thought the kid was guilty or not guilty .The old man juror , I believe he was juror # 3 definitely showed the personality trait of authoritarianism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The old man also seemed to believe in a just world , because he did n't show any sympathy for the kid .He believed that if the kid killed his father , then he should be punished to the worst extent .Another psychological attribute I found was with the similarity - leniency hypothesis .I feel that the Hispanic man , Juror # 11 , also identified with the defendant because they both were of the same race .The whole movie was based on jury deliberation and the process of it .The first phase , orientation , was shown when the jurors picked Juror # 1 to be their foreperson , and then they immediately took a vote to see where everyone stood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The one old man who voted not guilty seemed to be the only one that wanted to discuss the evidence and discuss their differing views .Everyone else just wanted to pick a verdict and get it over with .I felt that the three men that changed their vote because of normative influence , meaning they did n't really change their view on the verdict , but they gave in to group pressure .I felt that the stubborn old man , juror 3 , gave in because he was the last one standing .The last person I felt changed his mind because of normative influence was Juror # 12- the ad salesman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The find phase , reconciliation , was shown after the jurors had come to a final verdict and were leaving to go to the courtroom .This idea was really shown between the angry old man , juror # 3 , and the nice old man ( I 'm not sure which juror # he was ) .The nice old man brought juror # 3 his jacket and tried to console him because he was really upset after having to change his verdict .There were many aspects of psychology that could be noted in the different men .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I found psychology used when the Juror # 3 put off his past experiences about his own son and used them when judging and coming to a verdict with the boy in question .I was surprised that this 2 hour movie consisted only of the men in the jury room , and I could feel how tense it was between them for the many hours they were put together .It gave me an almost negative view of being a juror , I do n't think I would ever want to have to deal with that kind of situation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "First of all , I think we need to change the name of the 1997 version of this movie to 11 Angry Men and an Adorable Old Man .Seriously , though .Or maybe , Two Seriously Angry Men , Some That Get Angry Sometimes , and Others Who Like to Get Loud .I read this play in high school , so I knew what to expect out of it , but the anger issues were alarming .I mean , I know they did n't want to be there and that it was hot , but their deliberation only took two hours .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Geez .I got so angry at some of the characters throughout the movie that I would have fit right in ( except for the being a man part ) .In the opening scene of the movie , the judge is delivering her instructions to the jury .She tells them that they are to separate the facts and interpret the law as it pertains to this case .Since it is a capital murder case , she calls for a unanimous decision from the jury .She also advises that they deliberate thoroughly since one man is already dead and the life another is at stake .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When we first see the jury , we see that they are mostly older gentlemen .Eight of the twelve jurors are white , one is hispanic , and three are African American .Demographics are an important aspect of jury composition as they play a large role in biases .At one point in the deliberation , a few of the older jurors are outraged by the behavior of \" kids these days .\" We see these kinds of biases that come from age and generational gaps often , yet older citizens and homemakers are over represented on juries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Juror 10 gets very worked up about the defendant , who is hispanic .He ( verbally ) attacks the hispanic juror saying that all of \" his kind \" are the same .The question of race can play a large part in the decisions juries make .Despite what we want to believe of each others , our society can be very prejudicial of race and ethnicity .Juror 10 's racial tirade sets him apart from the others more than his temperament had already done , but his bias towards other races is not uncommon .As their discussion continues , the impact of normative and informational influence becomes more apparent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This demonstrates an informational influence .A normative influence is demonstrated by the jurors trying to pressure Juror 8 into changing his vote in the beginning of deliberation or toward the end , when the jury tries to sway Jurors 3 and 10 to vote with the group .The pressure of conforming to the group notions plays a large role in jury decision making .Though we hold our own opinions , standing out is undesirable .Group behaviour is an interesting concept and it is especially relevant to juries .The question of witness reliability comes up frequently in the discussion of the jury .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The answer , unfortunately , is quite often .The jury discussed the accuracy of the different witnesses several times throughout the movie .They question whether or not he was capable of actually seeing the defendant flee from the apartment building or hear him scream at his father .They do not believe that he is intentionally lying , but consider his process of encoding the information .The jury also deliberates on the ability of the woman across the street to see the crime take place .Most of their concerns are a matter of perception that have affected the memory of different witnesses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie also raises discussion on how long is long enough for a suitable amount of deliberation before announcing that they are a hung jury .If a jury feels that they are not going to reach a unanimous decision , even after a short amount of time , should they be allowed to say that they are hung ?Are hung juries really at an impasse , or are they simply tired of dealing with the case and ready to hand it over to someone else ?It is an interesting thing to consider .Also , should it be considered odd or unfair counsel if the jury reaches a decision too quickly ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I had never thought to consider the time it would take to pass fair judgement and make a verdict .There are so many concepts present in this movie that were relevant to our discussions in class and readings in the book .I find juries to be incredibly interesting and I have actually enjoyed learning more about them .They are a part of the trial process that I had overlooked frequently before this semester .It almost makes me want to participate in jury selection myself just for the experience and to see all of these factors and biases at work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the movie 12 Angry Men I noticed many things that related to our discussion of jury selection .I do not think that the attorney 's did a very good job of throwing out the jurors that had biases toward the trial .It was obvious to see that one specific juror was biased against all people that grew up in the slums .He kept referring to them as those people .He lumped them all together and stereotyped them as trouble makers .This juror thought that this boy killed his father just based on the fact that the defendant was from the slums because \" those kids are just raised that way \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I thought that this juror should have been thrown out because he brought his own baggage to the trial .You could see that he was taking his anger that he help against his own son on this boy on trial .He let his own personal experiences interfere with his judgment .If these jurors had been thrown out , the defendant may have had a more unbiased jury .The jury was also made up of 12 middle aged , middle class white males .This is not an impartial jury .The jury did not consist of any women , young people , or minorities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The defendant was a poor 18 year old boy .His jury was not a good representation of the community which could result in unfair biases in the trial .At the start of the jury meeting they took a vote to see who thought that the defendant was guilty and who thought that he was innocent .They did this by a show of hands .I noticed that when the head juror asked who thought the defendant was guilty about seven hands went up and fours hand slowly followed .This made me think that those four hands that went up last did not really know what they thought and were just following the crowd because they were scared to go against the flow .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The eighth juror was the only one to vote not guilty in the first round of votes .He questioned the eyewitnesses ' memories .He brought up the time frame that the elderly male witness said it took him to get to the door to see the defendant run down the apartment stares .As humans , we are really bad a judging time .We think that things happen a lot slower , or faster than they really do , especially in a high stress situation .It reality it took the witness closer to 45 seconds to get to the door , in court he said that it only took in 15 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He also questioned the women that said she saw the defendant kill his father from a window across the street , through a passing train 's windows .The eighth juror stated that it would be hard to make a clear assessment on the identity of someone from 60 feet away at night through a passing train 's windows .He also was the only one to notice that this witness wore glasses and since she was in bed at the time of the murder she would not be wearing them .So her eyesight could not be trusted in this case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He never said that they defendant was not the one who committed the murder .He just said that they could not consider the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt .In order to convict someone of a crime they have to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt .This particular juror pointed out all the flaws in the testimony that gave the jurors a reasonable doubt , so they could not convict him in the end .The defendant 's attorney was court appointed which brought up many problems .The jury pointed out that there were many points in the case that they thought the defense could have down a better job when questioning witnesses , such as pointing out that the female witness wore glasses but was not wearing them at the time of the crime .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The eighth juror said \" he could have been tired , or had a lot going on , or was not getting paid enough , or just thought the case was a lost cause \" .All these things could have skewed the trail in the prosecutions favor .When they pointed this out it surprised me because when someone 's life is on the line you think that their attorney would do everything possible to keep them from being convicted .The defendants alibi was that he was at the movies when the murder of his father occurred , but when police questioned him he could not name the movie of the actors in the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He even asked another juror questions about a movie that he had seen earlier that week and he could not remember .Memory is fragile and such things as stress can mess with it .Terms : jury , defense , prosecution , eyewitness memory , appointed attorney , reasonable doubt , bias , impartial , stereotypes .The movie 12 Angry Men , was a very interesting film that accurately reflects what we have been learning in the psychology and law class , specifically the information from chapter 13 about juries and judges as decision - makers .In this movie it focused on the jury , and the decision they had to make .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There was also no chance to change the sentencing .The defendant was facing the death penalty so that could not be changed .He would either have to be acquitted or found guilty .The movie showed a lot of different aspects of things we have read about in chapter 13 of the text book .For instance , I believe the jury model was a story model .The jury seemed to use all of the evidence to build up a story of what happened , then they used the story they created to make sense of all of the evidence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One man held his ground , and expressed his beliefs that he thought it could have been a possibility that the defendants story was the truth .He used his assumptions of what could have happened to create reasonable doubt in the other 11 jurors until finally the verdict was found to be unanimous for acquittal .The movie showed how the majority of the jury just wanted to get the verdict over with so they could leave .I thought it was strange that they were cooped up in a small room on the hottest day of the year without anyway to cool themselves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They first decided whether or not to vote before they started talking about the evidence but they decided to vote to see where everyone stood .The next thing that occurred in the deliberation process was the stage of open conflict , where the jurors talked about their thoughts and ideas about the case , and why they thought the man was guilty , or innocent .This causes coalitions to form among people with similar beliefs , such as between the grumpy men that were clearly in favor of guilty the whole time , and focused a lot of their belief on the defendants background .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There was both informational influence and normative influence .The informational influence appeared to be the stronger and more common of the two types .The man that initially voted for acquittal began explaining why he had reasonable doubt .This started with how he bought an almost identical knife that the boy had supposedly stabbed his father with .The knife was supposed to be rare and hard to find , making strong evidence that the boy had done it because no one else could have had the same knife , but that point quickly was dismissed do to the second knife .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The normative influence appeared to be present with the juror that had tickets to the baseball game and just wanted to end the deliberation .He changed his vote from guilty , but did not really provide a reason for this choice , making it seem more of a normative influence .The observation that the eye - witness that supposedly saw the defendant stab his father seemed to be a large piece of evidence in the case .I think this would have been hard for anyone to go against , because someone watching the murder happen would obviously be a hard piece of evidence to discredit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although the book says that there usually is not an influence on the verdict based on the wealth , social status , and gender of the defendant , I believe that in this case it did originally make a difference .A couple of the men were originally all in favor of voting guilty because they believed based on where he was from and how he was brought up that he was a violent person easily capable of this crime .They made it sound like because he was from the \" slums \" he was less of a human and was more likely to commit a violent crime .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although this type of jury deliberation most likely does not happen often , I think it was a good example of juries should respond to cases .They should look at the evidence and assume that it could be flawed , instead of trying to find something that makes the man innocent , they should be looking for the reason that makes the man guilty .The jurors even explained that the defense attorney appeared to believe his client was guilty , because he did not offer very good cross examinations to back his client .It seemed that right from the get go , this man was doomed to fail .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was glad to be able to connect most of the information from the readings to events that took place in the movie .The movie made it easier to understand some of the materials because it gave examples of what the book was explaining .Terms : story model , defendant characteristics , deliberation , verdict - driven style , open conflict , informational influence , normative influence , unanimous , hung jury , attorney , jury , guilty , acquittal , and eye - witness .Twelve Angry Men is about a group of twelve male jurors involved in a murder case , and deciding on a verdict .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After the jury was chosen , all of the jurors got into a room .After getting into the room , all of the jurors made small talk .Then , they decided to do an initial vote to see where they stood as a group , or in other words they used a verdict - driven style of orientation .Many of the jurors were already sure in their minds that the boy was guilty .After the first vote left the group hanging with an eleven to one vote , they started to debate with the one not guilty vote .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They went and examined the boy , and the case , and looked at all the facts of what happened , which made them evidence - driven .They boy was abused by his father and had a tough childhood , which caused him to get into trouble as a kid .His criminal record was piled with juvenile misdemeanors .This led some of the jurors to believe that this background information , especially the abuse , led to a motive for a murder , and some felt like this made him seem prime suspect , and was chosen too quickly initially .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They also said that kid had claimed he went to the movies during the time of the crime , but he was unable to recall what movies he saw .His story did not add up , which made him appear guilty .The prime witness was a female neighbor across the street who claimed to have seen the boy stick a knife into his father .She claimed that she just happened to look into the house and see him kill her at the exact moment that the kid stabbed his father .Even though the prosecutor tried to make evidence showing how it is possible and her story is true , how could anyone be sure that her story was true ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The women herself might have thought she had seen murder , and not have actually seen it .It was also debated that she was not wearing her eye glasses , and could not even have seen the crime , especially since eyewitnesses rarely ever are able to see the crime .If she was questioned by police and then came forth with that information , she could have had a false memory , because the police would have planted it into her mind .This insignificant evidence was not enough to lead to a conviction .The knife was the biggest piece of evidence in the trial .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of the jurors however argued that it was a possible coincidence that the boy could have lost his knife and a similar one had been purchased .Ironically , one of the jurors had bought a knife two blocks away from where the boy lived , making the other jurors see that it was a possible coincidence .The old men that ran to the door after hearing the boy yell at his father and a gunshot , claimed to have seen the boy run .However , they discovered that there was no way the old man could have gotten to the door fast enough to see the boy run , because he was crippled .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is rather rare in many court cases , because now days people of different ethnicities and backgrounds are selected , and it depends more on who the defense choses to be on the jury .Another interesting thing that occurred between the jurors was when one juror said how because the kid was from the slum , he was an automatically guilty .After that comment , another juror who was from the slums became offended , and made some of the other jurors see that just because you are from a bad area , does not make you a bad person .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It made them see that it was very possible that the boy did not mean it when he told his father that .Much social psychology was also shown in this movie , especially by the group dynamics .For instance , the men continued to go around the table and share their thoughts .After that they gave whoever wanted to speak the freedom to , and then would vote again .During breaks , men would outbreak into individual discussions .However , after every voting more people started to vote for not guilty , and would spark more debates .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The boy appeared to have been framed , and did not have a good defense .The boy had a younger lawyer who was not as advanced , and made it easier for him to appear guilty .All of this led to the conclusion that the boy was innocent , which seemed very logical and evidence based .There was no unreasonable doubt to make him guilty .All in all , this was a pretty entertaining movie to watch .It showed me a real life example of a jury .Even though I had previously seen this movie in high school , watching it again showed me the flaws and good things in the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I watched the older version of this film and was a little skeptical because I 'm not a huge fan of black and white films .However , this movie was actually pretty good and kept me entertained for the hour and a half it ran .It was interesting to see a jury deliberation ( even though it was a movie ) .I have never served on a jury so this gave me a good idea and illustration of what most likely goes on during deliberations .This movie clearly portrays important aspects covered in chapter 13 of our textbook .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many of these jurors want to convict this boy simply because of where he is from : the slums .The boy is looked down upon as a \" non - contributor \" to society .A lot of the jurors basically think of him as being worthless .Where the boy comes from is a prime reason why some want to convict him , but it is also a prime reason for some that want to acquit him .The man that used to live the life that the boy is living now defended the boy by bringing up his own upbringing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We see right off the bat that juror number one is the \" foreman .\"He is shown sitting at the head of the table ; he is depicted in the film as the one running the entire session , taking notes , calculating votes , etc .He also begins by attempting to organize the discussion and goes around the table , calling on each of the other eleven jurors and asking their opinions .The book states that the individual elected as foreperson does n't exert a lot of influence on the decision of the jury .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He definitely did n't seem to be much of an influence on the ultimate decision .Within this same section of our textbook , the \" strong juror \" is discussed .We can relate this to Henry Fonda 's character .The book 's discussion says that strong jurors tend to be well - educated , articulate , and have a high occupational status .We can see this is clear when Fonda 's character tells another juror that he is an architect .We can also tell he is well - educated just by his word usage and his analysis of the testimonies and evidence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also relevant to the movie are the stages in the deliberation process discussed in the textbook .The first stage , orientation , is where the jurors select their foreperson and raise general issues on the case .We see this right away when the jurors are filing into the deliberation room .The foreperson has already been elected and then the jurors take a vote .While most of the jurors think this is an \" open and shut \" case , Henry Fonda 's character disagrees .This raises \" general issues \" on the case and leads into discussion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This often leads to disagreements among members of the jury and we see obvious conflict among the twelve men in the film .Although most of the conflict stems from only a couple hot - tempered jurors , it is obvious that the discussion gets very heated at times .We can also see the concepts of normative and informational influence in the movie .Informational influence was the one most obvious .After bouts of discussion and reconsideration in terms of testimonies and evidence , many jurors change their votes based on information .However , we see one instance of normative influence when the man who is in a hurry to get to his ball game votes not guilty just to speed the process along .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thus , he changed his vote based on \" group pressure \" instead of reconsideration of the evidence and testimonies .Finally , the jurors reached the third stage : reconciliation .This happens at the end of the film when one juror stands alone in wanting to convict .The man has a temporary \" break - down \" and changes his vote from guilty to not guilty .We see Henry Fonda 's character mildly \" soothing \" this man as everyone else leaves the room .Besides what is relevant to the textbook , I noticed a few other things relevant to psychology .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The entire movie is based off of one man 's attempt to persuade the eleven other jurors to his side .In addition , the broader topic of social influence is the main theme running throughout the movie .I also noticed a hint of cognitive psychology .What one pays attention do differs from individual to individual .We see that the old man juror pays great attention to the witnesses when they 're put on the stand .For example , he was the juror that brought up the issue of the woman with the glasses .He had noticed the marks on the sides of her nose that most likely came from glasses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This highly discredits the woman 's testimony .Moreover , another juror paid attention to the old man who had a slight limp and put this together with his testimony to conclude that he could not possibly have made it to the door in time to see the boy run down the stairs .Terms : jury deliberation , acquit , strong juror , informational influence , normative influence , social psychology , cognitive psychology , testimony , foreperson , open conflict , reconciliation , orientation , defendant characteristics , evidence .The 1957 film Twelve Angry Men was amazing and deserved all of the recognition it got when it was released and the recognition it gets to this day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie begins with an overview of a courtroom , which looks similar to how they are laid out today .The judge is talking to the members of the jury , discussing the trial , and giving instructions .He tells the jurors that it is a capital case and that they must have a unanimous , either way they decide .The judge reminds them that they are undertaking a grave responsibility .When discussed in class there are special types of juries put together when there is a capital case in place , because they have to be willing to put the defendant to death .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The defendant is a young , white male .The jury is made up of all white , older gentlemen .This is not necessarily a jury of his peers , since they are all older and are all basically the same \" type \" of person .Today , as we have learned through the book , this jury may have had some younger people , some women , and maybe some people of different races .It is fair to assume , as we have learned , that if the defendant was black he may have been convicted much easier , especially in the 1950s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The book discusses this , when jurors group together as the more outspoken or the quieter they are .As the first phase of deliberation starts , the foreperson is selected , which is usually the first thing to happen in all jury deliberations .In more of a verdict - driven style the jurors decide to vote first about how they would decide the case , guilty or not guilty .The second phase of deliberation , the longest phase of the movie , is open conflict .When the preliminary voting takes place eleven of the twelve jurors state that they would vote guilty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Most of the men believe that you can \" always suppose someone is wrong , we do n't owe him anything .\" This is when a majority may bully other jurors into siding with them when a unanimous verdict must be given .As learned some of these people will stand up for themselves and not budge , resulting in a hung jury .A hung jury is a suggestion that was given during the movie and that they should just be done with the deliberation .As one juror stated it does not matter if they do that anyways because the defendant will get another trial and surely be convicted by those other men .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Henry Fonda takes his turn go over the facts and the evidence they were presented during the trial .He does not believe that the witnesses were very credible .He also refers to one man saying that the defendant 's attorney knew he was guilty and therefore did n't try very hard ; Fonda 's character says this happened because he was probably an appointed attorney .Appointed attorneys may resent getting really difficult cases , may not be paid a lot , or may be over - worked , which all affect how they deal with their case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The other jurors discuss the rare knife the boy had , and then Fonda 's character pulled one out just like it - discrediting their beliefs .Slowly the other jurors begin to question their decision of guilty , and some change to not guilty during a blind vote .Doing this blind vote during deliberation helped them see where people stood without showing who voted it , although they reveal it in the movie moments later .The weight of the eyewitness testimonials weighed very heavily on some jurors , as we learned can happen .Even if it is not good evidence , something being said in court can really weigh on some juror 's minds more than other evidence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The most authoritarianism - oriented men are the ones attacking the character of the other jurors and struggling with changing their vote .The one juror in particular , the last to change his vote , was definitely the most authoritarianistic .He based his vote of guilty only on his stereotypical views of people living in the \" slums , \" and , even as all evidence for conviction lost credibility , he was still adamant that the boy was guilty .On the other hand , we also have learned about strong jurors , meaning jury members who have a larger than normal influence on the deliberation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The textbook 's discussion on this style of deliberation says that when jurors take an initial vote like they did in the movie , the members focus less on extensive , open discussion about the evidence , but instead , focus on defending their vote .We can see this initially in 12 Angry Men as they take a vote of guilty or not guilty .Going further , I also believed normative influence occurred here , because some of the jurors seemed timid and merely voted the way the group voted to avoid conflict .But as the movie progresses , each juror becomes more open to talking about evidence and disregarding their initial vote .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Overall a very good film that i m sure most law students and psych students should see atleast once .The entire movie focuses on the deliberation process .The conditions that these jurors were put in were horrible .In a way this affected the initial verdict that most men took .Most of them decided guilty quickly as a way to get them out of the hot , stuffy and rundown room they were placed in .In a way this situation relates back to the field of industrial and organizational psychology .This field is concerned with making sure environments are comfortable enough so that employees are able to do a good job .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The main thing that this film focused on that we have discussed and read about in class is obviously the jury and the importance of their deliberation and decision .The film opens up with the judge explaining to the jury before they go in for deliberation that their decision is what determines if the boy on trial lives or dies and that the responsibility they are faced with is huge .He also explains to them that if they come up with any reasonable doubt , then he expects a \" not guilty \" verdict to be returned .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I think that this film was a pretty accurate depiction of what really goes on behind the doors of a jury deliberation , even though we can never be sure unless we get the opportunity .There is more than likely always a juror ( or more than one ) that does n't agree with the others or who is n't quite convinced enough to say the defendant is guilty .These jurors who make a strong stand one way or another are considered the strong jurors , and I think that this film had 2 very strong jurors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I also think that the 3 phases of the deliberation process were represented nicely in the film .The open conflict phase was focused on the most with the discussions that took place , but the process was depicted in its entirety at some point or another throughout the film .Also , chapter 13 of our book discusses that even the strongest critic of juries would not be able to argue that they use the evidence to heavily influence their verdict .In the film , the knife that was used to commit the murder was talked about for quite some time and this discussion was one of many that started leading some of the jurors to start having reasonable doubt about the case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While we did n't actually get to see the jury selection take place , it becomes clear during the deliberation what the prosecution and defense were trying to do when picking the men that they did .There were a few men on the jury that had strong biases towards people living in the slums .These men were obviously choices by the prosecution because they would hopefully be able to convince the rest of the jury of their opinion .There were also a few men lived in or around the slums and knew what it was really like .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "A persuasive eyewitness testimony may be so heavily weighted that the meter becomes \" frozen \" and further evidence does little to shift the juror 's overall judgment .This seemed to be the case with most of the jurors .They heard two persuasive eyewitness testimonies , their mental meters swung to the \" guilty \" side , and no other evidence ( or lack of evidence ) had any impact at all for them .One juror , Davis , seemed to use a story model as opposed to the mathematical model .This model includes creating a story , or causal chain of events , to make sense of evidence presented at the trial .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He used this story approach to convince the other jurors to think twice about their verdicts .For example , he provided an answer to why the boy could n't remember the movie that he saw the night of the murder , using the story approach .He explained that the boy came home from the movie , saw his father was dead , and was questioned while still very close to his father 's dead body .The boy must have been under great emotional stress when he was asked to recall the facts about the movie he had seen earlier , which made it hard for him to recall .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Another example of the story approach being helpful is seen when Davis is talking about the old man that claimed he saw the boy run down the stairs of the apartment .Instead of just accepting this man 's testimony , Davis thought carefully in terms of a story , or causal chain of events .He first described how the old man had seen the father hit the boy earlier in the night .When he heard commotion and a body hit the floor , he assumed it was the boy who killed his father because of his earlier witness of their interaction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Davis was smart to use this story approach .Eyewitness testimonies can be extremely crucial to a case - such as the one in 12 Angry Men .With two eyewitness 's claiming to have seen the boy commit the crime , it was difficult for the majority of the jury to see any way the boy could be innocent .The eyewitness 's were definitely the most compelling pieces of the evidence ; the last juror to change his vote to \" not guilty \" was solely basing his vote on the eyewitnesses .During the entire deliberation , many of the jurors had the belief that eyewitnesses could neither make a mistake nor lie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In most cases that an eyewitness is not telling the truth , they are not intentionally lying .They actually believe the story they are telling , and become more and more confident as time goes on .The oldest juror hit it right on the money when he said , \" He did n't intentionally lie , but rather made himself believe he heard those words and recognized the boy 's face .\" Our memories are imperfect and very vulnerable to revision and corruption .The old man knew that the boy and his father had been fighting earlier .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When he saw someone running down the stairs , he was predisposed to the idea that it was the boy .Since he did not see the face and therefore had no information to contradict his idea , it was confirmed even more .He suddenly was confident of his belief , and eager to be \" noticed \" and listened to in court .Terms : jury , judge , verdict , impartial , trial , first degree murder , bias , evidence , mathematical models , eyewitness testimony , story model .If I had n't just read a chapter on juries and judges I would have probably found this movie a little boring .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There were several things that corresponded with the chapter when I was watching this movie .The most obvious aspect I saw that correlated with out chapter was the jury using the story model .The jurors used the evidence they saw and created a story of their own out of it .They used their story to decide whether or not the boy was guilty or innocent .Their story changed throughout the movie even though the evidence never did .This goes to show that you can take anything and put a twist on it with little information .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There was one man who believes that the kid was innocent , it was one against eleven .He was n't going to let another persons ' life get pushed under the rug for any reason .He was n't letting them go until they at least heard what he had to say .It 's not that he thought the kid was innocent , he just was n't sure .He merely wanted to look at the evidence and talk about the evidence .Also , the jury used a verdict drive style in deliberation .They decided to cote first before reviewing the evidence just to see who stood where on the verdict .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Another thing I noticed was something we discussed in class , here say .In the movie one of the men said \" He heard the boy say \" I 'm gon na kill you !\" There was a witness who claims to have heard the boy say that to his father .I think that this would count as here say .When we discussed this in class we said that it was a witness saying that he / she said this .I believe this would count as here say , now I do n't remember when this term was brought into the legal system but I feel as though the defense could have gotten it stricken from the record .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Another thing I noticed was when the men were discussing the witness who claims to have seen the boy running down the stairs , through the windows of the L train .They discussed it as if there was n't anything wrong with it .I do n't know if it was just because it was a different time and they do n't do it like we do today but I feel as though that would be a very weak witness on the prosecutions side .We also discussed in class about vision .Dr. MacLin stated that in court if you 're a witness the defense will ask you about how well your vision is , if you wear glasses or contacts , how up to date you keep them , and if you were wearing them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Without the findings of this , the boy may have gotten the death penalty for something he did n't do .All because the defense was n't doing his job well enough .I also do n't think that either of the lawyers did a good job when it came to jury selection .One man was so wrapped up that he was willing to change his vote to the popular vote just to catch a game on TV .The defense should have gotten rid of him .Also , the man who fought till the end of the boy being guilty all because he wanted to use this as if it were his own son getting punished instead of the actual boy who was on trial .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
