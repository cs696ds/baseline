{"text": "This is my second post focusing on the work of a particular Indian director - I did one on Hrishikesh Mukherjee a while back .I think the words I 've used above describe different elements of Ram Gopal Varma 's work ...I 've seen only three RGV movies - ' Rangeela ' , ' Company ' and ' Shiva ' ( that 's also the order in which I viewed them ) .The first one is lighter , romantic , typical Bollywood ' masala ' fare - the latter two are edgier , darker , harder - hitting crime movies - the kind of work which has resulted in RGV being called India 's Tarantino .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of the three RGV movies I 've seen , ' Company ' is probably my favourite .Starring Vivek Oberoi , Ajay Devgan and Manisha Koirala , it 's the story of an underworld kingpin ( played by Devgan ) who takes a young ambitious hustler ( played by Oberoi ) under his wing .At first , things go swimmingly - the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 does his boss 's bidding and it 's all gravy for the gang , but then the dynamic of the relationship changes and it all goes awry .There is a fabulous rawness to the film , a grittiness and a realness - but there 's also a softness , a sweetness and a simplicity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I also like the restrained , conflicted - but - too - tired - to - care moll played by Manisha - at first I thought she was just wooden and boring but later I got it .Other stand - out performances are by two actresses - the fantastic Seema Biswas ( playing Vivek 's mother ) and newbie Antara Mali as ' Kannu ' , Vivek 's love interest ( a very , very good performance ) .That 's another thing I love about RGV 's films : I love the fact that RGV really allows women to take centre - stage in his movies , and he 's not afraid to use strong female characters in his stories - that 's pretty damned hot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ajay is a very close second , though .Hmm ... my second fave RGV film is ' Rangeela ' .This will probably seem a bit heretical to many who regard ' Rangeela ' as a classic slice of Bollywood , but I far prefer ' Company ' .Anyway , the best thing about ' Rangeela ' for me is Aamir Khan - definitely one of my favourite Aamir performances .He is so sweet and so believable and natural in this film , and I just love the way he said ' Arre Milli ' .Urmila Matondkar 's performance as the heroine is also lovely - she is bright , sparky , fun and adds depth to what could have easily been a shallow character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is also a lot of colour and style to the movie ; and it 's a fresh , light - hearted take on the tired ' young female with big sapnay becomes big famous movie star ' story .For me it 's just ok , not great .Shiva ' is my least fave RGV movie so far - not because I do n't like it though - I really do , I like it a lot - it 's just that the other ones had an edge for one reason or the other .The story is interesting and dramatic , there are lessons to be learnt , the relationships between the characters are beautifully explored , and what 's hinted at is even more interesting than what 's explained .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a bit silly in some parts , though .The ' little monkey man with a curved knife thing ' was dumb - I mean , come on !He obviously was no good with a knife if he could n't put a single nick on our hero 's body in all that time he had .It was good comic relief though .Some of the acting was bad - especially the guy who played the villain .I did not ' feel ' his ' evil - ness ' at all - he was just dead boring .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I really like that kind of adventurousness and experimentalism in a director .7 comments : .Saw ' Rangeela ' in Bombay when it first came out .Paid Rs.300 ( black market ) to get balcony seats & eagerly anticipating the special ' intermission laser show ' .After getting samosas we settled in and got to see a bright light shone on a spinning disco ball with the ' Spirit of Rangeela ' playing on the speakers - classic !Great movie - Aamir at his most vulnerable and ca n't ever forget him in his yellow suit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's what makes movies magical .Maybe my lack of enthusiasm about ' Rangeela ' stems from the fact that I watched the DVD on my laptop on a very boring day .We were visiting family ( under compulsion ) and we were grumpy about having nothing to do and nowhere to go .My sister ( who watched it with me ) liked it better than I did , though .I think I need to watch it again ... .Why have n't i seen these movies ? ? ?I need to see them :) I quite like Vivek Oberoi , he definately has that cute puppydog cuteness :) I really like how you reviewed the director instead of just focusing on the actors ... very different and refreshing for me !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "@amy : Yes , Vivek is very very cute ... glad you liked the review .I definitely think ' Company ' is worth a watch if you like crime movies ( although it 's more than just another crime movie ) , and ' Rangeela ' is worth a watch just for Aamir 's performance .Umm no .he did not remake the old one , the old one had a different story .The new one , was made because he was not happy with the way his ' assisstant ' handled ' James ' , so he wanted to remake ' James ' , in order to ' better utilize ' Mohit Ahlawat .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
