{"text": "combat passages rank with the most exciting written about any branch of the service .\"The Saturday Review called the book \" a classic , \" and many reviewers compared its author to such greats as C.S. Forester and Erich Remarque .Today these accolades still ring true for Edward L. Beach 's gripping first novel of American submariners confronting a formidable Japanese navy in a vicious battle to control the Pacific .But long after the details of this famous novel fade from memory , what remains with us is a startling realization of the way it was , really was , in the silent service during World War II .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Well known \" is the perfect description of the movie because it was absolutely horrid compared to this book .Really , I think all Hollywood did was take an existing submarine movie script and use some of the character 's names from the book and the book 's title .That 's about it .The book goes into a lot of details about what is involved in getting a torpedo into an enemy ship , but does so in a very entertaining way so as not to bore the reader .This , along with \" The Flying Tigers \" and \" Thunderbolt \" , is one of my three favorite WWII books of all time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was great then and it is great now .I consider this book my main reason for joining the navy , and going into submarines .The other books in this series are also great reads .From the moment I picked this book up , I really could n't put it down .I even got the movie out on video .The movie however , does not do justice to the book and although interesting itself , it strays considerably from the original story .I am currently reading the sequel ' Cold Is The Sea ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Considered to be one of the monuments of naval literature , this fictitious account of a captain 's quest for vengence against a Japanese destroyer in WW2 became a classic tale of high seas adventure .After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , the US Navy was severely crippled and the strength of the fleet lay in a handful of destroyers , the aircraft carriers , and a thin line of submarines scattered throughout the Pacific .The American subs were given one major task during these dark days - sink any and all Japanese shipping without being sunk yourself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
