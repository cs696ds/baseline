{"text": "It was natural that the movies would take up their legends , and it could be argued that the popular fascination with these figures ( and the do - gooding lawmen who pursued them ) played a major role in the popularization of the fledgling movie industry .Just think of the number of silent serials and early talky features were Westerns , and you can easily see what I mean .You might be aware that Australian history boasts an analogous folk hero figure , the Bushranger , whose popularity was similarly influential in the development of that country 's cinema .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The most famous bushranger was undoubtedly Ned Kelly , who has been the subject of dozens of films , including The Story of the Kelly Gang ( 1906 ) , which at 70 mins .long was in fact the first feature - length film ever made in any country .Only slightly less famous than Kelly in bushranger lore was Dan \" Mad Dog \" Morgan , whose heavy drinking , violent temper , and brutal crimes did little to stem the spread of his reputation as a folk hero in 1860s Australia .In 1976 director Philippe Mora ( whose subsequent work includes horror outings The Beast Within [ 1982 ] and The Howling II & III ) directed a version of Morgan 's life story with iconic American movie madman Dennis Hopper in the lead role .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film starts with Morgan working in a gold camp during the Australian Gold Rush of the mid 1800s , already raising hell and picking fights with musclebound Germans in Prussian military helmets .Morgan escapes the camp with his life , turning to a life of crime to support himself .It 's not long before his robbing ways lead him to a prison cell in New South Wales , where he is tortured , branded , and raped by a gang of Ozzie rugby players by way of initiation .Whether through fear or PTSD this makes Morgan mind his manners for the next six years , after which he 's paroled .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Together they rob ranchers , engage in gunfights with police , hole up with sympathizers and other outlaws , and generally wreak episodic havoc for the rest of the movie 's running time .Along the way Morgan grows a series of impressive beards ( the first to emulate American President Abraham Lincoln --not because he admires his politics , but because he thinks , quite simply , \" That 's a fine lookin ' man ! \" ) , matches wits with and thwarts a series of NSW police officers , and drinks amazing amounts of liquor .When the authorities in Victoria boast that should Morgan cross the border into their territory he will be \" relentlessly and mercilessly cut down , \" he takes it as a challenge , leading to a tense and bloody conclusion to his rum - soaked and bloody career .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This might seem quaint to the modern viewer , since the gore is relatively understated ( with the exception of the stand - out EXPLODING HEAD early on in the opium den ) , and the rape scene is hardly explicit ( not that this is necessarily a bad thing ) .Also , the episodic nature of the film makes it feel repetitive after a while , with Morgan robbing / shooting someone , running from police , fighting / outsmarting them , and then starting the whole process again .There 's some stuff thrown in here and there about Darwin 's theories of evolution and whether Morgan is a man or an animal , whether nature or nurture has made him the beast he is , but I really did n't see it going anywhere .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A few of the supporting characters turn in good performances , most notably Gulpilil as Morgan 's Aboriginal partner and bald baddie Frank Thring as Superintendent Cobham of the Victoria territory , who invests every line with a snakelike intensity and menace .But of course the real reason to watch the movie is for Dennis Hopper 's performance as Morgan .Hopper is clearly inebriated throughout his performance , which in an interview on the disc he shrugs off as part of his \" method \" acting , since Morgan was notoriously alcoholic .( The beards serve a storytelling purpose -- their length and style denotes the passage of time . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , Troma Team makes up for it with an impressive number of extras , including several interviews , all of which eventually drift away from the movie and into recollections of Hopper 's legendary drunken misadventures .Best of all is a long interview / conversation with director Mora and Dennis Hopper himself , looking much cleaner and more in - control , who has a surprising amount of recall considering his altered state during the filming .( I 'm honestly surprised Hopper remembers ANYTHING before 1980 . )Tales of Hopper 's antics include his visiting the real Dan Morgan 's grave , chug - a - lugging a fifth of rum , and then trying to tear up the graveyard , only to be arrested and expelled from Victoria , ostensibly for life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
