{"text": "Quicklinks .Overall , not a BAD movie .Okay , this movie tried to be a cross between a light - hearted comedy and a gross - out film in the tradition of Animal House and American Pie .Sadly , it could not achieve a satisfactory balance .The light - heartedness for the most part was good , however , the gross - out factor was for the most part gratuitous .As a point , there is one scene in the movie ( you 'll know which one if you watch it ) where the sole purpose was to gross the audience out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They could have achieved the same affect in under a minute , however the scene lasted what felt like at least five minutes .Note : do NOT eat before watching this film , you will regret it .Ryan Reynolds played his part quite well .This type of comedy , he excels at .It is a shame that the plot 's turning point uses almost no logic .The WORST part of this movie was Gwen , as played by Tara Reid .Apparently , she is under the misguided belief that being a good actress means staring intensely in every scene .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In conclusion , watching it on VHS / DVD is probably your best bet .That way you can fast forward through the more disgusting scenes and most of Tara 's performance .One Word : Crap .There is really nothing redeemable to even mention in this horror of film making .Ryan Reynolds is appealing , and so is Tara Reid but the movie itself is one long bad joke whap up in a blanket of recycle bad jokes of bad movies of the past .Please , walk away from this one .Utter Crap .Someone at National Lampoon seems to think they can recreate the success of their legendary college comedy Animal House .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Terrible from start to finish .One of the worst movies I have ever seen , and I have seen many many movies .Very predictable plot with no originality .The plot points seem to come straight from the mind of an uneducated 15 year old with no inkling of comedic dialog or situations .Although the lead actor was supposed to appear as a hero to his fellow students , he never supported that in anyway with his behavior on the screen .I guess we are just supposed to assume that he is ' all that ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maybe the young teenage crowd would find this entertaining for the crude humor and flowery language , but anyone over the age of 17 should pass on this one .Should go down in history as the first \" gay college comedy \" .This film , so far , is a genre all it 's own .The genre it wants you to believe it fits into , would be the college comedy , the T&A , gross - out , bodily function type of film , minus the T&A , it has all that , but with a twist , a big gay twist .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In my belief there are certain ingredients present to one degree or another in these types of films , and one you ca n't get away from is female nudity .See Road Trip to see this formula at it 's modern ( okay ...90 's ) apex , Amy Smart goes topless , while in Van Wilder Tara Reid , decided not to show what many who watched assumed they 'd see .Now nudity , male or female wo n't make an unfunny movie funny , or worth sitting through , but at least it might feel like a reward for sitting through something at horrible , and unfunny as this movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Born in Canada in 1920 , Ann Rutherford got her start in Hollywood as a teenager , acting in weekly serials .She made her feature - length screen debut in 1935 's Waterfront Lady .She also appeared as the Ghost of Christmas Past in the popular 1938 version of A Christmas Carol , opposite Reginald Owen .Rutherford was cast as Andy Hardy 's longtime on - and - off girlfriend , Polly Benedict , in the second film of that long - running series , You 're Only Young Once , in 1937 .Rutherford would go on to play the part in 11 other Andy Hardy movies , culminating in her final appearance in the series in Andy Hardy 's Double Life in 1942 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite the limitations of the relatively minor role , Rutherford does a lovely job in the film , bringing a sweet girlishness to the role of Carreen ( contrasting nicely with Evelyn Keyes ' bratty Suellen ) which makes the character 's relative naivete appealing rather than cloying .In her later years , Rutherford was a true champion for Gone With the Wind , promoting it to new audiences and appearing at GWTW - related events and screenings with other surviving cast members to discuss the making of the classic epic .By the end of the decade , she had effectively retired from the silver screen , though she would appear in a couple of films in the 1970s and in sporadic roles on television , including a short stint on The Bob Newhart Show as Bob 's mother - in - law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
