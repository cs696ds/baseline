{"text": "The song originally called \" Smack Into You \" was written for Jon McLaughlins sophomore album \" Ok Now \" by Tricky Stewart and The - Dream .Though , the song was later scrapped from the album , Jon did perform the song live on his summer / fall tour .Not letting an amazing song go to waste , it was presented to Beyonce and changed to \" Smash Into You \" .That s the part Beyonce must have \" written \" in order to receive that coveted writing credit because the two versions are practially identical lyrically otherwise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "i love jon but beyonce is my fave ever do you have something against her ? ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! !he did n't even write it so it is n't his and she did n't steal it . if he wanted it that bad then he would have got the song DUH !I have seen several interviews that she did , and later I see another interview that makes everything she said false .Beyonce is also a liar who takes credit for songs she did n't write .She did n't even write Irreplacable , but she took credit for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think perez is saying she stole writing credits for the song .When you only change one word on the song it seems deceptive to take writing credits .We all know people write songs for other artists then sell them to another if the artist they originally wrote the song for decides not to use it .It 's just most artists are more upfront then Beyonce seems to be .I love Beyonce but Jon 's version is better .Just like bc jean 's version of If I Were A Boy is better . stupid sreggin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I hate her more now than ever before ... especially since my favorite ARTIST has has now become linked to a fake WANNABE artist like her .you DO realize that this is standard protocol for anyone who uses songwriters , right ? jon mclaughlin did n't write this either ! tricky stewart and the - dream did ! then , when jon and/or his record label scrapped the song , they as the songwriters have the right to give it to whoever they damn well please . stop talking shit , perez .you usually just end up looking like an idiot in the end .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ca n't the bitch be original ?Oh well , his version is way more better than hers .Maybe its a good thing people know so they go over and by his instead .oh and the girls name is bj jean .Practically identical ? ?They 're completely identical .She changed smack to smash which is better because it does n't sound like domestic violence .But if she claimed to be the songwriter that 's pretty f'd up .Tsk tsk tsk Beyonce .wow jon 's version is amazing ! ! !I do n't mind if Beyonce uses the song , hello people , it 's called a COVER , but what pisses me off is if she puts her own writing credit on it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I never liked her anyway .Anyone can write this stupid whining song .She does nt steal , if any thing that was really the guy 's song then is her record company stole the song .Same goes to Britney they do nt steal songs , the stupid writers think they could be famous giving them the right to listen to them at the first place was their own fault .IT IS STEALING ! ! !PEOPLE RECORD SONGS WRITTEN BY OTHERS ALL THE TIME ...
