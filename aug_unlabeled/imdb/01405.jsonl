{"text": "this guy does n't seem like the kind of guy who can grasp the whole twilight feel the movies should have .Catherine had that enthusiasm that was totally needed for twilight .I just think this guy would give the movies completely different feels .So basically they chose a director who lacks any sort of experience with directing the kind of film they have before them .AWESOME !It 's nice that because he 's a \" super good friend \" of the President of Production , he could possibly be jeopardizing the quality of what could be a HUGE franchise if done properly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "replase the writter for the love of god .twilight was only good because of catherine 's choices in acting .the script was b.s .i loved the movie , but hated the writing and the way they added the fishing / boat scene .the book is so easy to write into a script and that beotch is making it into buffy , ick ! bring catherine back and get rid of the writter , pleaseeeee !All I can say is that New Moon is going to be a hard movie to perfect .I hope he does a fantastic job , if he gets the job .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Time will tell .Catherine was a good director for Twilight .Not the best , but good , They should n't just throw together New Moon like they did Twilight .New Moon is a huge part of the series .A lot of events happen that ca n't be cut out of the film .you can just LOOK @ this guy & know he 's fucking up new moon . another director bites the dust .ca n't they just find someone that CAN make the book to movie transition ? !i mean , really .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Also since he is a close friend he could get more money out of Summit which the Twilight saga needs that 's the first plus and secondly he is a screenwriter as well so fire Mellisa I do nt want no one who wrote Step Up to write New Moon .I just starting to like the twilight series and now that this guy is going to come and fuck up twilight .do you think to see New moon will be worth seeing now .Like I saw the Golden Compass and it sucked !Narnia looked better than that movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "the golden compass was n't that great of a movie ! ! ! ! just because Summit wants the movie out soo soon they decided to get such a CRAPPY director because he is good friends with some high authority at Summit ! ! !this just blows .If Summit thinks that getting New Moon out in theaters faster would make us the fans happy there wrong ! ! !what would make us more happy is if the movie will / would be down RIGHT ! ! ! ! cause that is what is important to us I would think ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Golden Compass looked pretty and About a Boy was pretty damn good .Hi FANS !I 've been going through a lot of forums and it seems that some fans have a united front on picking a good director .So far there are two directors that a lot of fans agree about .A COLLABORATION OF LEN WISEMAN ( Underworld and Underworld Evolution ) AND JOSS WHEDON ( Buffy and Angel Series ) ! ! ! ! !They both have had experiences with creating love stories with action .They 've both have made hit movies or TV series .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
