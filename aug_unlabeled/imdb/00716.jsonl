{"text": "A Bogart double bill : ' Dead End ' and ' Angels With Dirty Faces ' .If there is anyplace to watch Bogart , it is the Heights Theater .It is , after all , a sumptuous old Beaux Arts cinema , a single - box theater that was the sort you would originally have seen a Humphrey Bogart movie in , but do n't much exist anymore .Sure , there 's the Parkway , but , despite dating back to 1931 , it looks very mid - century - a giant bug film from the ' 50s would be just right there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So it 's The Heights for Bogie , thanks to Take - Up Productions , which is offering a series called \" Hard - Boiled Bogart Noir .\" They started last week with \" The Maltese Falcon , \" which may be the definitive Bogie noir .But tonight they 're offering a really interesting pairing of films , \" Dead End \" from 1937 and \" Angels With Dirty Faces \" from 1938 , which feel as though they should always be shown one after the other .This group , especially led by the pug - faced Leo Gorcey and the lean and hangdog Huntz Hall , would go on to do an astonishing 89 films and three serials together .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But here we are at their start - sort of .By the time Samuel Goldwyn brought the kids out to Hollywood , they were two - year - long veterans of Broadway , having appeared in the original stage production of \" Dead End , \" written by Group Theatre veteran Sidney Kingsley , for an astonishing 684 performances .\" Dead End \" is a great piece of theater , set on New York 's 53rd Street where the street meets the East River .It is the story of the kids that the play , and the film , primarily concern themselves with , and it was the Dead End Kids who played them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Both Kingsley 's play and the screenplay , by Lillian Hellman , offer a study in contrasting wealth , with poverty presented as embarrassing and deplorable .Joel McCrea , a handsome actor who tended to play lightly comic crabapples , is especially strong .He paid his own way through six years of college to become an architect , but , in the waning years of the Depression , instead paints signs for pocket change .It 's humiliating for him , and his humiliation turns violent when a childhood friend , played by Bogart , comes back to town .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And this was close to Bogart 's actual upbringing , which included an Upper West Side apartment and modeling , as a baby , for a famous advertising campaign for Mellins Baby Food .But in 1934 , Hollywood figured out that Bogart made a superlative tough guy , and it was off to the races .And so Bogie 's character in \" Dead End \" is a hood named \" Baby Face \" Martin , whose baby face , thanks to plastic surgery , has been converted into Bogart 's trademark snarl .He has returned to his childhood home for a series of disappointments - his mother savagely rebuffs him , and his childhood sweetheart is a prostitute in the late stages of syphilis .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As youth - in - jeapody films go , this is one of the best .I mentioned that playwright Sidney Kingsley was a product of the Group Theatre , which specialized in realistic and naturalistic plays that often focused on social issues , and screenwriter Lillian Hellman was likewise known as a playwright who created tough , unusually intelligent scripts .While \" Dead End \" ends on a vaguely positive note , it 's an enormously ambivalent one , bought through blood and undoubtedly short - lived .The specter of poverty still looms over everybody , and , for the kids , the likelihood that they will end up a brutal murderer , like Bogart .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "An embarrassed but noble failure like McCrea ? \"Angels With Dirty Faces \" is awfully similar , except that James Cagney plays the returning gangster and the action takes place in Hell 's Kitchen .And there is a hopefulness in the film that is nonexistent in \" Dead End , \" in that the Catholic Church offers an alternative to the world of crime that Cagney represents .The play has an ingenious set - up , telling of two boys who rob a railroad car .One is caught and grows up to be Cagney ; the other escapes and grows up to be Pat O'Brien , playing a role he would return to again and again : a street - smart but enormously compassionate priest .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But Cagney 's underworld connections , especially represented by Bogie as a crooked lawyer , come back to haunt him .It 's pure Hollywood melodrama , replacing \" Dead End 's \" cautious naturalism with an overwrought moralism , but it 's also a showcase for Cagney .He was at least as good a tough guy as Bogie , and he practically dances through every scene in this film , bouncing on his toes and rattling off his dialogue like a machine gun in what may be the definitive New York Irish accent .He also has the appealing habit of slapping the Dead End Kids whenever they get lippy with him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
