{"text": "I did n't watch wb this morning because it was a repeat .I have no clue what they mean because they already air the anime on Saturdays .And BTW , you need to get your sig changed because that little animation is slowing things down badly .That means Pokemon will no longer be on weekdays .They 're moving it completely to Saturdays , no more weekdays hence why I watch Pokemon only on the computer via downloading or dvd now , channels are just unreliable these days .WHAT ? !HOW AM I GOING TO RELAX AFTER HIGHSCHOOL WHEN WB MOVES THE ' TOONS TO SATURDAY ? !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "THIS IS OUTRAGUS !THIS MEANS WAR ! !Ok , I 'm calm now .Why would they move the cartoons to Saturday only ?How am I going to watch Transformers Cybertron ?( What ?Ca n't a teen like Transformers ? )What are they going to replace the ' toons with ?Well , on my affiliate they are going to be doing ER and 8 Simple Rules .Guess it 's going to be syndicated sitcoms on some stations .Also , Toonami \" had \" Cybertron in the summer , and YTV also has Cybertron now .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You can buy the boxsets from the seasons you want .Then you can watch them whenever the heck you want If a boxset of Kanto is what you 're looking for , I can help you with that because I know where and how to get one .When I first heard about this , I was very furious , so I understand your problems .Still , if you want to watch Pokemon , then GET THE DVDs , and give VIZ MEDIA the money for it ! ! !If not , then Miguzi starts an hour earlier with One Piece , Yu - Gi - Oh GX , Code : Lyoko , and Codename : Kids Next Door !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I like watching pokemon and Transformers during the week .Since i do nt have cable that goes up the channel 32 ( Cartoon Network for me ) I ca nt watch that stuff .Not everyone has cable you know or the money to buy the dvds .I sure do nt have money to spend on dvds , though i would like them .I m surprised they are doing this but i was bound to happen i guess .Fox only shows cartoons / anime on the weekend too as do most channels except for the ones that are only cartoons / anime obviously .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I know i wo nt be watching ER or 8 simple rules .This is the final week of the Aftertoons Show .Next Week is Daytime WB , with E.R. and 8 Simple Rules .If you want some good weekday afternoon programming , I suggest you get DVDs !Especially since none of you ca n't afford Cable , even though it 's easy to siphon off of !I heard about this just this Saturday and I was so sad for a good part of the afternoon .When I get home from my high school , like other people here , I look foreword to watching Pokemon before I have to do my homework .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many people here did bring up a good point about the DVDs .I should have already started a collection of them a couple of years ago so that I would n't want to buy a lot of DVDs from all of the 7 seasons .Oh well .At least I can save up and I already have one volume and a few tapes .I do n't know why some people have said this was old news because WB did n't start talking about this until last Saturday .Despite that this could be solved by getting the DVDs , it does extremely bite .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Especially since that means I ca n't watch episodes that I have missed .Buying DVDs is out of question since I doubt my mom will allow me since she thinks I 'm too old for Pokemon .Daytime WB is the name for the new block of shows for older people , featuring E.R. and 8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter .Eventually , they 'll end up eliminating all of the Saturday Morning blocks , and establish channels on Digital Cable & Satellite .Then we 'll have to pay a whole lot of money for all that crap !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "i some times go to tennessee on the weekeneds , and i sometiems miss a new epy , iand they show the rerun on firday .now i wo nt get to see the epy until they realse it on dvd ; - ; this sucks !now i have nothing to be looking forward to after school ; - ; is this gon na be premently ? or just for a few weeks or months ?I just learned that TransFormers : Cybertron IS gon na be back on Cartoon Network , next week .But it 's gon na be on Monday thru Thursdays at 6:00 AM .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That show was powered by Jetix , but it 's now on Cartoon Network , and it looks most likely that Cartoon Network would end up the network that will air the next season , Battle B - Daman : Fire Spirits !With the exception for Pokemon , KidsWB weekdays were n't worth watching .As for me , I have the entire collection on tape .Pokemon on cable ( Cartoon Network ) is somewhat hard to come by .And as for Saturday morning Cartoons , I 'm sorry to say this , but recently , it has n't been worth waking up at 7 am for .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "So do n't tape the 9 am show .You 'll get a wrong show .Normally it 's 10 am eastern/9 am central and pacific .I believe it is now 11 am eastern/10 am central and pacific .Just double check KTLA .Ok , TV has officially gone to hell now .I remember , three - four years ago , TV was still ok , but now it is damned .Honetly , people do n't know what to watch these days .I agree with what everyone has said here .This bites and I do hope that WB 's ratings go way down as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Most channels have stupid dramas or horrible reality shows .There usually not very many educational shows or programs going on , except at a during a hoilday .Anyway , I 'm glad that I can get the DVDs of Pokemon , but it is still so bad that they kicked it off for ER , an old drama show , and 8 Simple Rules , which is a weird , but sometimes funny sitcom .Still , Pokemon is better than both of those shows .Ok well first off , I hate to complain but THIS SUCKS .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Whoopdifreakindoo .Why do n't they cancel the crappy shows like Johnny Test , Coconut Fred , and Xiaolin Showdown .( Sorry to any fans of these shows)That way they can show more Pokemon on Saturdays .Oh and the PAB DVDs wo n't be out for months from now and CN hardly ever airs Pokemon .Entertainment is indeed going to heck , just like with what Disney Channel , Fox , and Nick .For the love of , this is the modern age , not all teens are interested in this drama crud !Sheesh .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Johnny Test is nothing but a Dexter 's Lab wannabe , watching it disgusts me .And Coconut whatever his name is ....I do n't know what the heck are they thinking , they 're wasting space , man !I hope The Batman wo n't ended up like Jackie Chan Adventure , god , I hate that Jade , it 's Jackie Chan Adventure not Jade Chan Adventure , what the heck are they thinking ?Loonatics Unleashed , no comment .Yu - Gi - Oh will pretty soon end .I definently do n't like this idea !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Years ago , malls were literaly the epicenter of almost every cvommunity for kids and teens to hang out .OR just watch a DVD of a show that 's meant for today 's audience , like Family Guy , which has loads of Old TV stuff , like the Snorks , G.I. Joe , He - Man , and other old TV shows .Already done that .And I did n't have to pay anything for it , wink - wink .OR just go to College , learn Japanese as a language , move there , and you can watch the Anime there in their purest , uncut form !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
