{"text": "Ca n't wait to find out !Re: Chicago Fire .I did n't get that impression at all Echo .That scene was priceless . . .omg , the tears !I thought the Mom was a wee bit strange when she came in the first time ( when she talked to Herrmann ) and I wondered what she was up too .I was n't over crying it out from all those \" feels \" before they killed off Hallie .Now , I must admit , I never really did care for her , but Casey is my favorite ( far and away , no question ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "How many times can this guy lose his love ?Thought it was interesting ( and spoke a lot about character ) when it was Mills who went to comfort Casey .When you consider : . he should have been the last one to offer a shoulder to cry on .YES , YES , YES , a thousand times this .You expressed exactly what I was thinking about this entire episode very nicely .Thank you , very much ; now I do n't have to write it all down .I DID think the mom who spoke to Herman was a bit ' off ' at first but never saw that coming with the abandoned girl .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Good job !I enjoyed seeing a bit more of Chris Eigenberg ( Hermann ) this epi .Felt bad for Hallie , but more so for Casey 's feelings .And yep , very ironic that Mills was the one to stride down that hallway to comfort Casey .I totally lost it right there .Re : Chicago Fire .Loved the episode last night !I am on board with the Mills love too .What a great character he is .Dawson would be a fool to leave him .Glad that Severeid 's troubles are behind him now too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Drugs maybe ?Re: Chicago Fire .And you remember Hallie started to look at a file and the other woman kind of snatched it away from her ?I bet that figures in as well .But I agree , the guy from the clinic , as soon as they focused on him I was suspicious -- he certainly did n't look sick .He looked angry .I swear I 've seen him before , but maybe just the actor .I know Casey and Hallie had to reunite for this to have impact , but as I recall they broke up over the issue of having kids .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "What more does he expect from her ?Great episode last night .Herrmann almost made me cry at the start and then he made me laugh in the middle with the Yakov Smirnoff comment and his eyes bugging out at The Stanley Cup !Casey had me on the edge of my seat while he was chasing the bad guy - unarmed ! !Then he made me cry at the end talking about Hallie and how he knew he had a ' keeper ' .Jesse Spencer has moved me to tears more times than I can count !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
