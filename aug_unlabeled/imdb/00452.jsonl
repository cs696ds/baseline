{"text": "LOVEFiLM By Post .Richie ( Rik Mayall ) and Eddie ( Adrian Edmondson ) are the owners of Guest House Paradiso , a squalid and empty B ? located next to a nuclear power plant .Business is n't exactly booming for the pair of them , but things improve when the Nice family move in - or at least they do until Richie is caught pilfering through their underwear .Meanwhile , fading Italian actress Gina ( H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Mahieu ) books into the hotel to escape her boyfriend Gino ( Vincent Cassel ) .Her presence arouses the lust of Richie and Eddie , but they also have the problems of radioactive fish to contend with .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Firstly , I would like to point out that I am a major Bottom ( the series ) fan .Secondly , as someone else pointed out , this has all the ingredients to make a great film , but it has something lacking .Having said that , there are some great moments , and true Bottom fans should not be too disappointed .Although the films ending once again descends into the excessively crude behaviour which spoils the whole affair . 1 Comment 9 of 10 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The image on the front of the DVD says it all .It 's mindless , silly , slapstick stupidity and I love it .I 've always been a fan of Bottom .Rik Mayall is a brilliant actor and I genuinely like him , but as Ritchie he is an absolute slimeball who gives me the heebies .But , that 's how the character is supposed to appear .Ritchie is rude , obnoxious , sweaty , overbearing and has serious anger issues but that 's what we love about him .Our of him and Eddie however , he is the schemer and seems to have a little more intelligence than Eddie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ritchie 's short temper and Eddie 's clueless bumbling is a frequent flashpoint for the violence Bottom / Guest House Paradiso is well known for .The fight scenes are so completely over the top they are n't believable but to someone as immauture as me , I love them .Especially during GHP when Eddie stops Ritchie in his tracks with a pair of nut crackers .Keep an eye out for cameos in this movie from Simon Pegg and Bill Nighy who play the unsatisfied guests in the Guest House Paradiso .Do n't expect anything more than you get from Bottom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You may find yourself like me , laughing politely at a weak joke someone 's just told but in my head I can hear Ritchie sarcastically going \" Ahha ha .Ah ha ha ha !AH HAHAHAHAHA !Mary Celeste .I must write than one down .....AH HAAAAAA ! \"Also keep an eye out for Ritchie 's face during the \" goodmorninggoodmorninggoodmorning \" scene when the Nice Family arrive .The glide down the stairs made it for me .Comment 1 of 1 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I own this movie on DVD and I have watched it about 10 times and it 's still funny .The jokes will never get boring and I often burst out laughing at inappropriate times just thinking about them .The premise is that Richard and Eddie of Bottom fame own the cheapest hotel in Britain next to a nuclear power plant .They are desperately in need of cash and when a film star in hiding comes to stay their luck just might be in .To watch this movie and not become utterly bored or disgusted you first need to like the humour .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But overall it 's a great movie .Comment 15 of 17 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .well I thought that having a Italian film star coming to a dreary hotel where you have thong removals with a oxyacetelyne torch and meat hooks up your nose would be very unlikely but it happened to Richie and Eddie . its the hotel that everyone knows that 's next to a nuclear power plant , the hotel that everyone eats contaminated fish , the hotel where Gino Guiseppe is violently sick .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Comment 7 of 8 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I could n't stop laughing .The slapstick is constant and the violence between Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmonson is extremely sick but funny .True , the story is weak , but the humour more than compensates for this .I loved it .Comment 7 of 8 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .The idea for Guest House Paradiso came about when Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmonson were touring around the country with Bottom Live .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Near the end of the writing Rik Mayall had his quad bike incident , an accident that had all Rik and Ade fans extremely worried , leaving Adrian Edmonson to finish off writing and to take up the role of Director .Rik and Ade 's writing has always been about being ridiculous , from The Dangerous Brothers , The Comic Strip Presents ...Mr Jolly Lives Nextdoor , to Guest House Paradiso .They have simply extended that into a full length film .Complicated plots or quality of acting is not the priority for a film like this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As for the latter , Rik and Ade have excelled throughout the years for the realism in their comedy fight routines , either live or on tv .You will not be disappointed in the kitchen scene at the beginning of the film .If slapstick violence is your thing then this scene will have you in tears .No matter how many times you watch it .Another extremely funny moment is when Simon Pegg , ( from Big Train , Spaced , Shaun Of The Dead ) is hoisted by his nipple up to the ceiling by Rich and Eddie using a fishing rod / hook .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
