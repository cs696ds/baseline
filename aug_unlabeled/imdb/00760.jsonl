{"text": "The sympathy is with Shylock in this bold but lopsided ' Merchant of Venice ' .Published 10:00 pm , Thursday , January 20 , 2005 .Technically , \" The Merchant of Venice \" is categorized as one of Shakespeare 's comedies , in that it has several pairs of scheming lovers , women pulling off some rather unlikely gender masquerades and a stock villain in Shylock , the evil Jewish moneylender .But the Bard wrote some very human qualities into Shylock , and ever since Charles Macklin gave a radical performance in 1741 that emphasized those qualities , it has been regarded as one of the great Shakespearean roles , and widely open to interpretation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Most of the characters are proudly anti - Semitic , some of the dialogue makes us wince and Hollywood has consistently passed on the project ( though it 's been done often for TV ) .So this new big - screen version -- the first in America since 1914 -- is a brave undertaking , and , happily , a class act , with authentic Venetian locations , lavish production values and a boldly sympathetic performance by Al Pacino as Shylock .On the other hand , the pain Pacino makes us feel for the character is so powerful that it works against the good feelings Shakespeare wants us to have for the other stories , and the film does n't come together with any shattering , satisfying unity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Shylock makes the deal , but with the stipulation that if Antonio has to forfeit , it will be with a ( lethal ) pound of his own flesh .When Antonio 's expected ship does not come in , Shylock insists on the bond and the Gentiles have to find a way to outmaneuver him in court .Like all Shakespeare movies , this one condenses the text and makes such bows toward modernity as eliminating the clunky comic relief , inventing a few bare - breasted brothel scenes and giving Antonio 's love for Bassanio a decidedly homosexual emphasis .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Director / adaptor Michael Radford ( \" White Mischief , \" \" Il Postino \" ) also has opened up the play , spread it around the city landmarks , dressed his scenes in late - Renaissance splendor and strived for a less theatrical , more naturalist tone .The film definitely works as a showcase of fine acting .The performances are all strong , and , for the most part , sparkle with the kind of originality and assurance that only comes when a director allows his players an unusual free rein .Irons , for instance , plays Antonio as loathsomely weak and self - centered , Fiennes makes a slyly opportunistic Bassanio and newcomer Collins brings off Portia 's famous \" quality of mercy \" speech with a confidence that borders on arrogance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
