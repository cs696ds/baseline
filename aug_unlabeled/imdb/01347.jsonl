{"text": "Jim Varney 's creation of characters like Ernest and the myriad others he pulled out of seeming thin air , in my opinion speak volumes of his talent and creativity .Sometimes it 's enough just to be entertained with belly laughs and not stop and analyze every single line of dialog .If you 're the intellectual type , do n't bother with this movie , it 'll go way over your head , or under your radar screen one .When Halloween was fun and Ernest made us scared stupid .One of the movies I remember watching like crazy when I was a kid during Halloween was Ernest Scared Stupid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I always loved this movie , even though I liked the more intense films like Jaws and The Exorcist , Ernest Scared Stupid was something special to me .I think because I always liked the mix of horror and comedy .Jim Varney went from doing Mello Yello commercials to creating Ernest , one of the silliest but funniest characters of all time .He saved Christmas , went to prison and now he 's being scared stupid .Now does the film still hold up after all these years ?I think so , it 's a reminder of a time when Halloween was fun and about the scares .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The acting may be bad , but it 's a kid 's movie for goodness sake .The kid actors do as average of a job as most actors .Ernest was hilarious though , I just love when he reunites with Rimshot at the end and is taken down by his kisses .I thought the costumes / impressions by Jim were great and just a fun laugh .This may be a silly movie , but I think people just need to let go .After all , when it comes down to it , every holiday takes us back to the time when we were kids with all those good memories .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This was the first \" Ernest \" movie , I think , that I watched and I was surprised that it was n't as stupid as I thought it was or the title convinced me it would be .It really was n't \" stupid \" until the last 20 minutes , but a lot of movies get really dumb in the last half hour .For most of the movie , it was nice , lighthearted fun that - clich\u00e9 aside - is fun for the \" whole family .\" There is nary a bad one word in this movie and it 's old - fashioned slapstick fun and about as innocent as it gets .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The late Jim Varney stars as Ernest as he tries to stop an evil Troll from killing all of town 's children .The movie begins with a montage of classic horror film clips , some of which I recognized to be FRANKENSTEIN and the 1922 classic NOSFERATU .There are some scenes that might not be suitable for children , but otherwise this hilariously funny romp is surely a movie that everyone should watch .This film is a must - see for anyone who loves stupidly funny comedies !Ernest is the godfather of comedy .... or something like that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Our lovable bumbling idiot has to save the day this time from a bunch of trolls .Sounds like a cheap horror flick plot , but once you factor in Ernest ...... its non stop side splitting Ernest P. Worrell action .I mean , it even has his faithful dog Rimshot in it .You ca n't go wrong with that . pure ernest .Okay , I 'll be the first to admit that the Ernest films are n't exactly Oscar - caliber movies ...okay , they are n't even good movies by most peoples standards .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ernest Scared Stupid is my favorite of these movies .It may be just because I used to watch it all the time when I was like 12 years old , but either way , I still like it .Right from the credits you can tell it is going to be hilarious .The troll makeup and costumes are very well done for an Ernest movie , and it keeps you entertained all the way through .I 'm 20 years old and I can still watch this one until the very end .The real question is , when is somebody going to get off of their ass and put the late , great Jim Varney 's entire Ernest collection out on DVD ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Know what I mean ?This is hands down the BEST \" Ernest \" film ever !In the movie lovable , idiot Ernest P. Worrell accidently wakes up a troll who begins to abduct kids , and turn them into wooden dolls for his evil plan .Of course in this kind of case , our lovable dimwit has to stop the evil troll , and get him back to where he belongs !Of course , in the process , there will be loads of mayhem , and shear laugh riot scenes as well .As I said before , this was the best \" Ernest \" film ever made ( It even beat out \" Ernest Goes To Jail \" which is my 2nd favorite \" Ernest \" film . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This film combines the slapstick and subtle humor typical of any Ernest film , and it brings in the element of horror .The film is downright frightening for children , but it is not THAT frightening because of the reassurance that it is only a film .It 's just made for children , after all .In this film , a troll breaks free from a curse and starts capturing children and turning them into dolls .It is up to Ernest to save the day and bring Halloween back -- without frightening trolls .I was amazed at how entertaining this film was ; I saw it when I was about 11 , and it was my first proper ' movie ' I saw at the cinema , not counting classic Disney animated films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
