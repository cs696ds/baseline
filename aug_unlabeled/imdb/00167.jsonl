{"text": "With the rare exception of , say , the early \" Rocky \" sequels , they seem to lack that all - crucial element of surprise that makes a film worth seeing .So it was not with great expectations that I ventured to see \" Ocean 's Twelve , \" nor was I surprised when it did not live up to its predecessor .I just did n't expect it to be so confusing .Three years after Danny Ocean ( George Clooney ) and his gang robbed the supposedly impenetrable Bellagio Casino in Vegas , Mafia boss Terry Benedict ( Andy Garcia ) has found them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Eh , a man 's got ta do what a man 's got ta do , capice ?Too bad everyone has either spent their take or lost it in bad investments , because they now have two weeks to come up with the cash - or they 'll swim with the fishes .So the crew heads off to Amsterdam , where Rusty Ryan ( Brad Pitt ) , Danny 's right - hand man , has a high - paying gig - not to mention an old flame , Eurpol Chief Isabel Lahiri ( Catherine Zeta - Jones ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Once there , they pull off the heist by ingeniously raising a house from its waterlogged pylons , only to discover that another thief has arrived before them .\" The Night Fox , \" as he is called , is one of the best in the world , but Francois Toulour ( Vincent Cassel ) is jealous of Danny .Apparently his boss , a thief by the name of \" Le Marque , \" made an approving comment about Danny 's abilities .So Toulour offers Danny a deal : they go after the same target - a Faberg\u00e9 egg .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But if Ocean gets the egg , then Toulour will pay off his entire debt , $ 198 million , to Benedict .Danny agrees , but the beautiful Isabel is right behind them , following their every move .May the best thief win .The plot takes a long time to get rolling , with Benedict tracking down and threatening each of the gang members in turn .When they finally get to Europe , the various heists unfold with disorienting flashbacks .Unfortunately , they 're also somewhat inconsistent , with the same frustrating outcome that is only overcome in the final scene .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Instead of letting the audience in on the twist , allowing them to look back and see what they overlooked in an \" aha ! \" moment , it makes us feel cheated .Another problem is the characters .Those who were so engaging and indispensable the first time around are now straw men , and many of them barely even have a line .Rusty , who was always eating in \" Ocean 's Eleven , \" seems to be on a diet .He and Danny share some of their characteristic repartee , but not nearly enough .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are too many characters to sort through , which is probably why they all end up in jail , leaving Tess ( Julia Roberts ) to come to their rescue .About to celebrate her second third - year anniversary with Danny , she is none too thrilled to be dragged into the mess , especially when she discovers she must pretend to be a movie star .It 's an interesting scene to see Julia Roberts playing Tess playing Julia Roberts , who talks to the real Julia Roberts on the phone , at the request of Bruce Willis ( as himself ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And what a drag that the real Roberts had to give birth a few weeks before the film came out , which makes the unpregnant Julia playing Tess playing the pregnant Julia , complete with a pillow , completely redundant .To add to the melee , we also get a few more cameos - from Topher Grace , Peter Fonda , Robbie Coltrane and British comedian Eddie Izzard .It 's all a bit much , but maybe that 's what happens when you adapt a recycled script ( by George Nolfi , whose only other credit is 2003 's \" Timeline \" ) that was never made for or about these characters to begin with .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At least it 's a film that does n't take itself too seriously .Director Steven Soderbergh ( \" Full Frontal , \" \" Erin Brockovich \" ) who 's usually top notch , seems a bit off key here .His scenes are jumbled and tend to be confusing , although his grey - toned cinematography and dimly - lit indoor scenes give the film a realistic edge .All the actors do a good job , too .They 're just given too little to work with and too few distinguishing traits , which means we not only do n't connect , but do n't always understand what is going on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In this case , less would definitely have been more .Because the first film was so enjoyable , it 's hard not to be disappointed with this one .If , that is , you can figure it all out - something I 'm still working on .AUDIENCE : Adults only .OBJECTIONABLE CONTENT .Drugs / Alcohol Content : Average .Various characters smoke cigarettes and cigars ; one scene where dozens of empty alcohol bottles cover several tables ; various scenes in bars and restaurants with background drinking and/or where character takes a sip of alcohol .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "About a dozen obscenities ( including multiple f - words that are \" blipped out \" by a censor machine , in a recording studio ) and a half - dozen profanities .Sexual Content / Nudity : Mild .One scene with unmarried couple in bed ( no nudity ) .Violence : Mild .Thieves commit multiple crimes but never use violence ; police chase after thieves and arrest them , sometimes with guns , but no violence .DVDActive uses cookies to remember your actions , such as your answer in the poll .Cookies are also used by third - parties for statistics , social media and advertising .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Steven Soderbergh is on fire .Fresh from his box - office triumphs , Erin Brockovich and Traffic , the 39 year - old Director has shifted his focus to a film that is just plain fun .And he picked his mark impeccably well .The 1960 version of Ocean 's Eleven was merely an excuse for the Rat Pack to belt out some tunes and party hard after filming was done for the day .If Sinatra , Martin , Davis et al poured as much energy into the production as they did their after - dark performances the film would 've been a massive hit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Enter Steven Soderbergh in 2001 to give us the film that should 've been made in the first place .The star power is retained , but this time there 's a killer story and some seriously slick production values to go along with it .George Clooney was the key .With so many characters involved in the story there needed to be a talented ensemble to pull it off properly .So our boy George slashed his pay cheque so that others could be paid to jump on board .Ironically he and Soderbergh went about recruiting members of the cast in much the same way as Danny Ocean enlists his fellow crooks during the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And the rest is casting history .Big name stars got on the Ocean 's Eleven bandwagon , most with a reputedly smaller pay packet than their market value demanded .All to be able to make the film they wanted to make .Now that 's what movies are all about .Steven Soderbergh has an incredible eye for telling the story with some complicated shots .There are quite a few instances where he takes in several characters and several situations in one continuous movement .The need to fit in eleven men into the scene at the one time was n't a burden for him , merely a chance to make the film look even more slick by moving the camera around and showing all of the personalities in action .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Clooney and Soderbergh were n't the only ones pulling strings to bring out the best in the story .Veteran producer Jerry Weintraub was using his Vegas connections to good effect , securing unparalleled access to the big casinos that feature in the film .What we see is the result of Jerry 's early involvement in the Las Vegas casino scene .He secured the Bellagio for filming and probably did more publicity for the place with this film than any marketing campaign ever could .Ironically , Weintraub was around when Sinatra and the like were lighting up Vegas in the 60 's so it was fitting for him to play the fatherly role behind the scene of this film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Con - man Danny Ocean ( played by George Clooney , of course ) has been released from jail on parole but he 's got another plan up his sleeve .Millionaire casino boss Terry Benedict ( Andy Garcia ) is now dating his ex - wife , so Danny decides to exact more than just a little revenge .He plans to rob three of Benedict 's casinos on a fight night , netting around $ 150 million in cold , hard , casino cash .This is n't a one - man job so his first port of call is old friend Rusty Ryan ( Brad Pitt ) , now consigned to teaching young Hollywood starlets how to play poker .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And Rusty 's a hungry boy too , seen feeding his face in most of his scenes .Together these two look through their little black books of crooks and find the best men available for the task required .Here 's where the fun begins .Danny ropes in Linus Caldwell ( Matt Damon ) , a gifted yet nervous young pickpocket who blindly agrees to the job almost on the spot , which is apparently how Soderbergh and Clooney signed Damon to play the part in the first place .Linus is joined by cockney explosives expert Basher ( Don Cheadle ) , tough old man Saul Bloom ( Carl Reiner ) and disgruntled ex - casino boss Reuben ( Elliott Gould ) as the financier .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Throw in circus performer and human rubber band Yen ( Shaobo Qin ) , nerdy technology guru Livingston Dell ( Edward Jemison ) , childish drivers Virgil and Turk ( Casey Affleck and Scott Caan ) and Frank Catton ( Bernie Mack ) , the croupier and inside man .Together these guys have just enough criminal nous to pull off the greatest casino heist in history .What ensues is one of the slickest , coolest and most entertaining heist films in history .The dialogue is absolutely spot on and the delivery ca n't be faulted .Clooney and Pitt give an effortless touch to their quick - witted banter , while the performance of Matt Damon is brilliantly self - restrained to give the character of Linus Caldwell just the right amount of vulnerability .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Those two must have been ecstatic when they heard who had joined them in the flick .Reiner and Gould are perfectly cast , with Reiner proving he 's still got the ability to pull off a difficult character .Bernie Mack and Eddie Jemison are great and even Shaobo Qin fits in with the A - list cast , even though he 's more of an acrobat than an actor .Andy Garcia is an inspired choice as Terry Benedict , becoming the perfect villain we love to hate .Watch closely as he uses his eyes more than his words to show us that Benedict is as sly as they come .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She 's got a small role but still manages to deliver her sharp - edged retorts to Danny Ocean with aplomb .This is the cast that dreams are made of .They 've got charisma , panache , flair , screen presence , nous and any other cool - sounding adjective you can throw at this talented bunch .There 's something about a film with a bunch of characters teaming up that really perks up my interest .Everything from Sneakers to Gone In 60 Seconds has that sense of being able to witness a conglomeration of personalities working together for a goal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like the Rat Pack before them , you can tell that the cast is having a ball .This time , however , they have managed to channel that enthusiasm into bringing us good , clean fun that has been seriously lacking in films of late .Let this movie shift the focus back to providing audiences with simple enjoyment rather than trying to shock or depress them into appreciating the story .Everything Steven Soderbergh touches turns to gold .Think of Ocean 's Eleven as the biggest cinematic nugget of fun man has ever seen .The first thing you notice about the look of the film is that it is incredibly slick , much like the way the production turned out on the whole .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a little on the soft side at times , but this is due more to the choices made by the cinematographers ( and Soderbergh , who was again the principal cameraman on his film ) .The print is quite dark yet the colours are extremely vibrant , giving it the after - dark Vegas look that was obviously what was needed .There are only a couple of minor imperfections , namely Danny 's shirt as he travels up the escalator and some of the bright lights of the Vegas scenes which were always going to be difficult to get exactly right .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Top stuff .Audio .The best thing about this soundtrack is the awesome work by David Holmes on the background music .There 's a bass guitar - driven music track that runs throughout the film and is quite incredible in its effectiveness .It gives off the clean , jazzy feel that is spot on with what the film is trying to achieve .The story is moved along at a great pace due in part to one of the simplest and most effective music tracks going around .And with the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix in full swing it 's a pleasure to hear the deep bass coming out of the speakers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's not a great deal of surround use save for the bells and whistles of a thousand poker machines in the Bellagio but the dialogue is always very clear and easy to understand .A great listen if only for the brilliant choice of music by David Holmes who , incidentally , worked on the previous Clooney hit Out Of Sight .Extras .Roadshow have put together a decent extras package without going over the top , all of which are top notch in quality .First up is the commentary track with Brad Pitt , Matt Damon and Andy Garcia which , if nothing else , gives us an insight into exactly how much fun these guys had shooting the flick .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He then magically re - enters some time later , laughing at Bernie Mack calling Linus a \" cracker \" .There are a few quiet moments and a lot of the time is spent talking about how much they admire so - and - so , but these guys are still a joy to listen to .Damon 's impression of producer Jerry Weintraub is very amusing , as are Pitt 's constant jibes at George Clooney .The second commentary is from Director Steven Soderbergh and Writer Ted Griffin , who give more of a technical view of the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These guys are good to listen to and have a decent rapport so it 's well worth a listen .Also included on the disc are two documentaries about the making of the film .The first is a featurette called The Look Of The Con which takes a look at the costumes and personalities of the characters .Conducted mainly through an interview with costume designer Jeffrey Kurland this piece is almost as slickly produced as the film itself .While Kurland is talking we can see early development sketches of the characters ' costumes as well as the finished product taken from clips of the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The other featurette is a standard sort of documentary entitled , oddly enough , The Making Of Ocean 's Eleven .This one is also pretty slickly produced , using a split - screen technique like in the actual film for the majority of the time .There are interviews with all the key cast and crew and it 's a pretty good watch .There 's not all that much information given to us that is new but there 's some good behind the scenes footage mixed in with clips from the movie .Rounding off the disc are the theatrical trailer which is very effective and two teasers , the first of which makes the film out to be much more of a comedy than it really is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Usually the computer stuff on most discs is n't all that flash ( pardon the pun ) but this one is a pearler .You go through a series of stages involving answering questions , cracking codes and picking locks .It 's a bit of a challenge until you get the hang of it so the game wo n't be over in five minutes .A really good addition to the disc and a lot of fun .Overall this is a pretty good package of quality extras .Soderbergh hinted in the commentary that there were very few deleted scenes of any significance mainly because they were so tight with what they were shooting and that the script was extremely solid so they did n't need to cut too much out during the editing stage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Overall .I ca n't recommend this DVD enough .The film is one of the most enjoyable I 've seen in a long time and really makes for a great night 's entertainment .Watching all those A - list stars on screen is absolute candy for the eye and it 's clear that they were enjoying themselves just as much .Soderbergh 's talent is undeniable and it 's very pleasing to see him hone these qualities into a film that aims at pure fun .Couple that with great video and audio and a quality extras package and you 've got yourself a must - have for any DVD collection .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There have been A LOT of letdown sequels out there , I would not go so far as saying this one was a letdown .Eleven was 5 stars ........ this one is four , for simply being a fun film as long as you can sit back and not start making Ocean 's Eleven comparisons .Sure it bears the namesake , but it is NOT the same film .And honestly , it does a great job showing just how clever Terry Benedict can be as the villain .One of Andy Garcia 's best roles , albeit short lived .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In a way , this movie reminded me of the recent \" Ladykillers \" remake , in that it has comically inept criminals doing things that they rally can not do .But \" Ocean 's 12 \" is less of a caper comedy like its predesecsor was , and more of an action caper .There are no amazing shootouts or daring car chases / races / or crashes , but there is a large amount of heists , some that are involved in mechanics or outrageous stunts .So , that said , I think that \" Ocean 's 12 \" , while funny and quite entertaining , could have been shortened by 15 or 20 minutes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Comment 7 of 8 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .The first thing that strikes the audience in Ocean 's Twelve is the star studded cast .Besides the obvious actors such as Brad Pitt , George Clooney , Matt Damon , Catherine Zeta - Jones , and Julie Roberts the film has great depth of supporting actors with minor parts .Several of these small parts have actors that already have established themselves with major parts in other prestigious films .For example , Johan Wideberg , a Swedish actor known from Oscar nominated All Things Fair ( 1995 ) , Eddie Izzard and Robbie Coltrane all appear at some point in the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite this enormous talent pool Ocean 's Twelve does not succeed in creating a sublime cinematic experience , which will awestruck the audience .Instead , the viewers get to experience a half - empty drama with good chemistry while the actors carry out an overtly planned design .The story begins within Terry Benedict ( Andy Garcia ) who Danny Ocean ( George Clooney ) and his group ripped of in the predecessor , Ocean 's Eleven .Benedict demands that Ocean and his cohorts return all the money that was stolen from him with interest .Initially , this idea for the sequel provides an interesting angle , but the interest quickly eradicates itself by trying to do too much on the screen without detail or feeling for the atmosphere .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "My point : So What ?THere 's absolutely no story in this movie .The ones of you frowning while reading this please note that its nothing but a plot to prove how clever some film makers can be .All in all it falls flat on its face .The ever so gorgerous , Catherine Zeta Jones in this film looks like she does nt even belong to it .The time she 's playing Miss Clever Detective made me sink in my seat in the theater .Brad Pitt , sadly in this movie is all about expressions , running around beautiful cities and getting arrested .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
