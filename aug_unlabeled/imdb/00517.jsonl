{"text": "His confused , googly eyes are just too freaking funny for words .The rest of the cast does n't do much better , and the Tarantino by way of eleventh grade creative writing dialogue does n't help .Shyamalan also consistently breaks the first rule of screenwriting - show , do n't tell - by making his characters gracelessly explain the plot over and over again .If Shyamalan could 've come out after the film 's bad reception and claimed it was a comedy I would 've believed him 100 % , because there is nothing shocking about the telegraphed sequences of people doing themselves in in a particularly Monty Python - esque manner .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "You are aware that this is a DVD news and reviews website , where we critically evaluate material submitted to us by movie studios , are n't you ?The best thing about this terrible movie is that Marky Mark is essentially playing his brilliant character from ' I Heart Huckabees ' beyond that this is like feels like someone trying to do an M Night movie and failing to grasp what he does so well .Shame the person doing it is actually M Night !I want to hear this movie , mostly interested in the score .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Everyone ca n't say , \" O my , this movie was awesome .\" No , we have to hear the bad things too , that 's how it works .And when a movie that 's really bad comes along , of course it 's going to get slaughtered .That said , I thought this movie was a joke .I totally agree with you Gabe about thinking Wahlberg was acting in a spoof .Every time he uttered something , I was thinking \" Is this a joke ?\" It really seemed like everyone was acting extremely sarcastic and that it was a sketch show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But yeah , I would n't say I absolutely hated this movie , I just thought it was one of the worst big - budget studio movies to come out in recent memory , literally .Jesus Christ .If you have nothing nice to say do n't say it at all .At least say \" well I did n't like it \" .Instead of \" I HATED IT ! ! ! ! !\"Honestly it 's a film .Give or take .M.
