{"text": "I would have known this if I had simply gone to IMDB , where the movie is summarized thusly : . \" Cult horror director John Specht 's low - budget feature , \" Electric Zombies , \" neatly cobbles together two disparate genres : the conspiracy thriller and the horror / slasher movie .It also comments sardonically on the post-9/11 fear of the U.S. government - gone - haywire , as it recounts the tale of a misguided federal project to brainwash \" enemies of the state \" via cell - phone signals .The signals inadvertently grow in power and become redirected to the U.S. , turning unsuspecting civilians into super - obedient zombies whenever their cell phones are answered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Moral of the story ?NEVER buy stadium food until the end of the first quarter .You 'd think , right ?I got nailed with a sneaky bread charge once .We went to an Italian place that had two versions of garlic bread : the free kind , and a \" deluxe \" version for which you pay extra .This was my first visit to the place , so I was n't familiar with the menu and did n't catch on to the two - kinds - of - garlic - bread thing .The waiters asks \" would you like for me to bring out some garlic bread for your table \" ( without explaining there are two options ) , and I said \" sure \" ( thinking it was the standard free kind ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "( I do n't drink soda . )Even with the cost of keeping the ice cold they 're making a pretty big profit on that .I manage a restaurant and our bev costs average 18 to 19.5 % every month ... so my charging $ 2.09 for soda costs me on average $ 0.40 or so .And remember staff drink whatever they want for free so that gets absorbed in the cost too .Coffee , for instance , is almost exclusively drank by morning staff and opening management ... .Unless this is a restaurant that sells very little soda , the margin is a LOT better than 50 % .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Intriguing hypothesis ... considering that if it 's an Ice - Chest - style ice machine , the interior of the machine warms up by approximately 15 degrees each time the door is opened .So the fewer trips to the ice machine they can make , the less time the refrigeration compressor is running , and the less electricity is used to make ice .The cost to make X amount of ice for a drink is probably often more than the cost of an equivalent volume of mix .However , ice makers do n't work on a demand basis - they keep churning out ice whether it 's used or not , so it 's a fixed cost .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One handled the volume of ice needed during the week and cow smaller banquets ( 200 people or less ) but during the height of the weeding season where we were hosting close to 4000 guests in a weekend we would turn on the second ice maker .Occasionally we would run out to the local convenience store and pick up a couple hundred pounds of ice if the machines were unable to keep up with demand .Before I stopped eating fast food , everywhere I went would just CLOG the effing cup with so much ice that I 'd have about 8 ounces of drink in a 20 ounce cup .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I no longer go to them , so I 'm not sure if that 's still the practice .Order your drink sans ice ( as most soda fountains dispense drinks already at and acceptably cold level ) , and a separate cup full of just ice .That way , you get your money 's worth of product ( the drink not being displaced by ice ) but you still also screw over the restaurant for that profit sucking ice .I believe it .I usually have to ask for extra ice at fast food places or make the drink myself whenever possible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
