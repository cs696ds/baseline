{"text": "For example , I can tell you right now that , no surprise , one of the top S&A items of the year was Zoe Saldana starring as Nina Simone in the upcoming film loosely - based on Nina 's life .There was n't just a single post on the subject , but several , and each was heavily commented on , shared on Facebook , tweeted , and generated lots of pageviews .So instead of singling out one post , I 'm combining them all , and just saying that Zoe Saldana as Nina Simone was a hot , top topic on the site , this year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even tomorrow , X - mas day , as well as New Year 's Day , will see entries in the series posted .But without further ado , here is number 10 on the list - Cybel Martin 's piece : A Cinematographer 's Plea to the Budding Film Auteur : Move Your Camera .It got a nice boost thanks to Roger Ebert retweeting it to his 770,000 + followers , which helped raise awareness for it ; so we certainly thank Ebert for that !Obviously , he really dug Cybel 's article .If you missed it , it 's all below for you to read ( or re - read , if you already read it ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I went to a recent screening of \" Letter From an Unknown Woman \" at MOMA with a friend and fellow Max Ophuls devotee .As always , I was delighted and swept away by Ophuls ' complex love stories and equally complex camera moves .Of the film elements filed under cinematography , I believe camera movement is the strongest indicator of my director 's voice .Certainly lighting plays an important factor in storytelling , but it 's the nuances of the camera that , for me , give me a glimpse into the genius of a director : An Altman zoom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Varda tracking .Tarkovsky slow pan .Spielberg combo push in / tilt up .A challenge in film school is wanting to please teachers , especially ones you admire and respect , especially if their opinion of your films affects your scholarships .We were taught the basics of conventional coverage , which I think is extremely important .However , I now see it is imperative that all filmmakers watch a lot ( A LOT ) of films on their own and stock up on visual alternatives .I tell my students at City College that whatever I say is strictly my opinion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What if you dodged film school and heroically jumped right into directing your own films ?There are other \" authority figures \" to contend with .Sometimes the DP , 1st AD , Editor and Producer need to take a back seat .I applaud directors who are firm in their vision .If you have a camera move that seems unique , unwarranted , labor intensive or whatever but is clearly in line with your intentions for the film ?It must be shot .Usually , we have the director and the film 's best interest in mind .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , our vision can be myopic .Only the director can envision the bigger picture .If the shot is vital , express that in pre - production and rely on our experience and expertise to make it happen .If I dislike my director 's choice for a camera set - up , I employ my \" Three Times \" rule .First of all , I wo n't say anything unless I can conceive of an alternative shot that still creates the desired effect .If I can think of an alternative , I will mention it up to three times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's never brought up again .Part of my job is trusting my director 's vision and aesthetic .I ca n't be so arrogant as to believe I always know what 's best for their film .Directors continue to amaze and delight me with their ideas .And that 's the whole darn point and joy of collaboration .Simply Not Knowing or Noticing .Some directors , especially those with strong theater , acting or screenwriting backgrounds , are extremely focused on the story and their actors .They 've not taken the time to learn all of the ways the camera can support their vision .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On what word does the camera dolly ?At what moment does the camera boom up ?Listening to the director 's commentary on a dvd can be a great way to learn about camera movement .Three books that I recommend are Setting Up Your Shots by Jeremy Vineyard , Setting Up Your Scenes By Richard Pepperman and Master Shots Vol 1 : 100 Advanced Camera Techniques to Get an Expensive Look on Your Low - Budget Movie , by Christopher Kenworthy .Hand Held : What a glorious opportunity for lazy camera work .I think everything should be done with intention .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I ask you to raise your expectations on how handheld can communicate and strongly support your narrative .Entrust your camera operator / DP with the same guidelines you would give if the camera were on a dolly .Direction such as when the camera will rest , when it will edge someone out of frame or drift away from a conflict .One of the best contemporary films I 've seen with inspiring handheld is \" The Messenger \" .The best example I could find online begins around the 1:20 mark but I encourage you to see the film in its entirety .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The director , Oren Moverman , also did \" Rampart \" , another film with really thoughtful and deliberate camera movement .No conversation about exquisite handheld operating would be complete without an example from Wong Kar Wai and his longtime DP collaborator , Chris Doyle .The combination of color , lights , small practical locations and movement in \" Chungking Express \" is hypnotizing .There are a ton of Chris Doyle interviews on YouTube to find inspiration .One of my favorite science fiction films happens to have a reported budget of $ 7k and was shot on Super 16 mm film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you 're not familiar with Primer and the story behind it , it might prove inspirational .Rigorous pre - production will balance out your limited finances , the inexperienced crew and tight shooting schedule .Shoot the rehearsals with your actors and try out different camera ideas .If you 're blessed with an experienced crew , remember they are more than just technicians .Tell your DP the mood you 'd like to create and ask what camera move they 'd suggest to accomplish it .If you 're a DP , definitely collaborate with your Dolly Grip , Camera Operator and Steadicam Operator in the same way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
