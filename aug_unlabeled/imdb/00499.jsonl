{"text": "Review : Paul W.S. Anderson 's ' Pompeii ' Starring Kit Harington & Emily Browning .With a reported budget somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 80 to $ 100 million dollars , there is no doubt where the money went in \" Pompeii , \" the ancient Italian city laid to no uncertain waste in Paul W.S. Anderson 's film .When you plunk down your $ 12 , you will get the destruction you promised .Lots of things burn in \" Pompeii , \" but nothing resembling drama , tension , excitement or entertainment .With a reported budget somewhere in the neighborhood of $ 80 to $ 100 million dollars , there is no doubt where the money went in \" Pompeii , \" with the ancient Italian city laid to no uncertain waste in Paul W.S.

{"text": "Lots of things burn in \" Pompeii , \" but nothing resembling drama , tension , excitement or entertainment .Attempting to forge the doomed romance of \" Titanic \" with the buff bods and wacky accents of \" Gladiator , \" \" Pompeii \" probably has the strangest meet - cute you 'll see on the big screen all year .Reluctantly unchained by his jailor to assist Cassia , he humanely kills the horse with his bare hands to ease its suffering , sending a flush through Cassia .\" I ca n't believe he had the strength to do that , \" Cassia breathily tells her best pal Ariadne ( Jessica Lucas ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The heart certainly works in mysterious ways .For the next little while , \" Pompeii \" dully gets the creaky plot into place .Corvus agrees but has had his eye on Cassia ever since Rome , and essentially forces her hand in marriage by dangling the lives of her parents and the plans her father in front of her like a cat with a mouse .Meanwhile , Milo and the rest of slaves are preparing to fight in a big gladiator showdown , where he 'll square off against Atticus ( Adewale Akinnuoye - Agbaje ) , who is one fight away from being becoming a free man , according to Roman law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Will Milo cross paths with Cassia again ?Will Corvus get his comeuppance ?Will Mount Vesuvius explode ?Have you ever seen a movie ?So no surprise \" Pompeii \" roars to life once the big gladiator main event begins , all while a volcano is on the edge of erupting in the distance .Priorities , people .And in writing , that all sounds like a perfectly decent B - movie popcorn experience .And perhaps it could be , but not with Anderson behind the camera .A filmmaker who is never quite aware of the campiness of his own films , he approaches \" Pompeii \" with a solemnity not befitting either the hammy script or the video game cut - screen special effects .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you do watch \" Pompeii , \" bring an iPod , because you wo n't be missing much and at least you 'll be spared the strident score by Clinton Shorter .But your eyes wo n't deceive you that yes , you are watching a filmmaker crudely put together a movie with all the grace of a preschooler using their pudgy fists to awkwardly fit square pegs in the square holes .\" Pompeii \" is less film and more a coloring book , where Anderson stays in the lines and maxes them out with lots of CGI .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
