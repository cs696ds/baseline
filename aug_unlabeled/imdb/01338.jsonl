{"text": "Leopold Stokowski , the most famous conductor , and Disney , the most famous filmmaker , teamed up to make a film literally from the ground up .The boldness of the project so incredible that the film literally opens with Deems Taylor announcing the concept as though we are about to witness the first man on the moon .Hell , even Salvador Dali was involved in the ongoing Fantasia project .Check out the result here .I recently had the opportunity to see the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam .In its own way , Disney accomplished the mission of the Rijksmuseum in Fantasia : an art museum translated to film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fantasia is an art museum , the highest point of one of the most ambitious artists to ever live , and a seriously fantastic film .As a fan of both animation and classical music , I could n't be happier with this as our first selection .Now , I have n't seen Fantasia since I was a very , very small child and even then I only remember making it to The Sorcerer 's Apprentice segment .I just have to say after viewing this film that it is mindblowing that something like this came out in 1940 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Going into Fantasia , one has to have the mindset that this is going to be a sensory experience .The narrator at the beginning is pretty upfront about that and warns the audience that there is only one segment ( the aforementioned Sorcerer 's Apprentice ) that follows a traditional narrative .It is n't surprising that Fantasia was released as a roadshow , because it seems more akin to a concert experience than a movie to be watched in a traditional movie theater .That is n't a bad thing at all .It 's what sets Fantasia apart and makes it so different than any other animated film today .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Animation can express elegant visuals of Earth 's creation or complement a ballet piece with a cast of animals typically known to be clumsy , heavy , or non - agile .Where else could you have seen a costumed hippopotamus making graceful ballet movements in 1940 ?Fantasia really is a classic Disney film that relies on body language and visual cues to communicate its stories .Not one word is spoken nor is there a single word of dialogue that appears onscreen .It 's unfortunate that the American perception is that animation is \" only for kids \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would encourage those who think animation is for children to take a look at Fantasia .I think that Fantasia , more than any other American animated film , captures animation as an art form .Fantasia is probably my favorite Disney film .I love the animation , which is some of the best animation has ever been .It is the precursor to the music video , surround sound ( Fantasound ) , and introduces classical music to many people who would never experience it otherwise .It was a concept ahead of its time .I think it was a shame it was removed from the AFI Top 100 when they updated it in 2007 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
