{"text": "December 23 , 2006 .\"Rocky Balboa \" Shocks The World . \"Rocky Balboa \" opened Wednesday with over $ 6 million at the box office .No one really expected it to do over $ 2 million .Sly said that fans made \" an old lion roar proud \" in an e - mail to Harry at Ai n't It Cool News [ where Sly just completed a marathon question and answer session with fans].What 's even more important is that \" Rocky Balboa \" is receiving rave reviews from nearly everyone !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I know that I will !-Craig Zablo .Rocky Balboa is a true gift to the world , tu us fans and to Sly himself .It 's a true masterpiece that comes at a time in the world when it 's needed as the original well did .Thanks again ...You served your purpose in this world , and very few men can say that .for my birthday I shared going to see rocky Balboa with my two children - I was speechless ! !It moved me several times , I pumped my fists even more in support of Rocky .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The ttimes Rocky fights back in dialog were inspirational .\" Paulie \" Burt Young , oh ... delivered the goods ! !God bless you Sylvester , and thank you for a wonder birthday gift , having the passion of a tiger and a good heart to deliver compassion .Wednesday night I went to the opening of Rocky Balboa at the AMC 14 on Van Ness in San Francisco .Thirty years ago , at the age of sixteen , I convinced one of my older friends to drive from Randolph , New Jersey to Monclair , New Jersey to see this little unknown boxing film at a small theater off Bloomfield Avenue .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I still remember that day because never in my life have I ever experienced such a zealous movie audience .By the end of the movie , every single person in the audience was yelling at the top of their lungs for Rocky to kill Apollo Creed .Now , this reaction could be for a number of reasons , that being the people of New Jersey hold little back , love simple films or it was just a great film .It went on to get nominated for 10 academy awards in 1976 and actually won the best picture .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many have expressed reservation to me about moving back and it is something so small as the reaction of a movie audience to know why we feel a compulsion to be back east .The movie to me was almost as excellent as the first and perhaps if the audience was filled with a bunch of big fat goobas from Jersey it would have been Rocky I all over again ; however , the California audience was unsurprisingly reserved .Also , as most of us are getting older , one must be curious about the fate of our peers whether fictional or real .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , for my friends from the old country , if you have nothing to do over this holiday , sit back have fun and enjoy this wonderful simple film .I want to thank Stallone for making this picture despite all the jokes that were once made about it .There was plenty adversity he had to face , with media , studios and even the public .I was going to love this film even if it was embarrassing .That 's just the type of fan I am of Rocky .However , what I witnessed was so much more that I could have ever imagine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm so proud to have been able to see a Rocky movie in theaters .I 'm 22 years old but I feel the message of time and lonlieness holds true to me and everyone .I will see this movie again on Christmas day , and whether this movie makes 50 million or 1 million dollars , Sly should be very proud of this work .The once cynical reviewers love it and so do I. .HOLA ! !FELICITACIONES A SLY POR ESTE SUCESO , QUE BIEN LO MERECE.HE LEIDO NUMEROSOS COMENTARIOS Y TODOS CONCUERDAN EN EL REGRESO TRIUNFAL DE ROCKY , DE LA MANO DE UN FENOMENO COMO LO ES SLY .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "CRAIG , UN CRACK COMO SIEMPRE , Y ENHORABUENA !SALUDOS , RICARDO , A FAN FROM URUGUAY .I must say I did n't have high expectations of this movie and I was quite surprised !The critics are finally giving credit where it 's due .This was a fantastic movie and I will go see it again .Stallone knows how to keep it down to earth with the right blend of sattire and enough drama that makes you think , \" what would I do ?\" I would also like to add that Stallone is NOT the worst actor of the century .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have always admired Sly 's work with the Rocky franchise and with this final chapter I remain inspired and awestruck as before !It is thanks to wonderful films such as ROCKY BALBOA that we all are reminded to NEVER GIVE UP on ourselves and to life our LIVE to the fullest with no regrets !I can not express enough my thanks to everyone who helped create this and all of the other ROCKY films .But I do know I will never forget the Rockys ' messages of hope , as well as the vast emotions of inspiration , wonder , remorse , regret , love , devotion , redemption , and triumph ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All the best .Cheers !Rocky Balboa marked the end of an era for this 37 yr old Mom .The movie was fantastic .I wept on and off thru the entire film .I missed Adrien as Rocky did .Paulie was great .I thought he was sober until he got his lay off .Rocky was my first movie at age 7 .I will take my boys , 4 & 6 to see this as it is the last .Bittersweet but what a great Christmas present .Thank you Sly , Belle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "the movie has it all .Feelings , Action , great dialogs .All of my expectations were fulfilled .I was stunned by Sylvester 's performance ! !The older he gets the better we becomes ! !This was really the ending Rocky deserved , although it is a sad one without Adrian .Hello , Slylvester Stallone 's fans , my dear !My nickname is Eddy Nice , I 'm from Brazil , South America .America , Could I borrow a little your happiness ?Save some for me .My English is not perfect , but , I need to tell you MERRY CHRISTMANS for you all and your family - for the alone too ( and fans America outside , like me ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sorry my bad English , please .Thank you very much !Happy Holydays !Hugs and kisses for you !Good Bye !Eddy Nice .The USERS voted it 3 1/2 .I LOVE Rocky and I LOVED the new movie , but I do n't want it to seem as if the facts need to be twisted in order to prove how good it is .The movie can stand on it 's own two legs just fine .Ciao sono un ragazzo di Napoli , ho 20 anni , vedo i film di rocky da quando avevo 6 o 7 anni .... oggi continuo a vedere imperterrito quei film e vi posso dire che le emozioni provocate in me sono le stesse di una volta ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "What happened to that ? 2 ) Anyone know if there 's an actual soundtrack coming out for this movie ?The new recordings of all the old music were phenomenal and I loved the new version of \" Gon na Fly Now .\" I enjoyed watching Rocky Balboa with my mom and brother and friends .we watched them all together and it was a beautiful ending to a great franchise .Although to be a personage of century 20 , Rocky continues being success in this century 21 , is the test that Rocky was not and will not be forgotten throughout the time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Its a historical event to see a Rocky movie in theaters(its been 16 long years ) it was well worth the wait !I am proud to be a Stallone fan .He 's such a great writer .All his movies have heart .Again thank you Mr. Stallone .Overall the movie was excellent .However , there are a few things that I would have enjoyed seeing more of being this is the last Rocky .I would of loved if there was more referencing or flashing back to past experiences with Mick & Apollo .You know , the scenes that tug at the heart strings ( your gon na eat lightning and crap thunder , what s a matter with you , Rock , etc . etc . etc . ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I realize Sly is 60 but he looks unbelievable .I really enjoyed the movie .I am a huge Rocky fan .Great job Sly .I will see this film many more times .this movie has touched my life in a way that no other movie , book , piece of art or therapist has ever been able to do .To find out that Sly created Rocky and that the character Rocky is a mirror image of Sly 's heart , ambition , dream , challenge , dedication and spirit , makes this movie even more special .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So many people are eager and ready to shoot down your dreams , try and make you feel bad about yourself by point out past mistakes and faults .This movie showed me that truly , it does not matter what people think , and I can not allow , no longer allow others thoughts control how I think and feel .To do so would be to give them power over me and my dreams and aspirations .God bless you Sly for this movie , for your heart , for your determination to get it the original Rocky made in the first place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "God bless you again , you gave me what I lost , hope and determination .Rocky 's speach to his son was the best speach I have ever heard , I have seen the movie twice , will continue to see it till I can memorize that speach .God bless , Nina .It 's hard for me to describe what this series of movies has meant to me ( as crazy as that sounds ) .Rocky has been my hero since I was 3 .Rocky 's work - ethic , the way he treats others , and his drive have served as examples and motivation not only for me but for so many other men I know of around my age .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've been lucky in that most of my dreams have come true .Strangely enough , I credit this character with a portion of that success .I cried like a baby when I got back to my car .A hero and a friend are gone forever .Thanks for everything , Rock .Next time you go to see Adrian , say a prayer for me for Father Carmine .What can I say .From a movie standpoint , it brought everything full circle .An elegant and powerful ending if ever there was one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I imagine that will continue to be the case .Rocky is unique and a true classic in that you could watch is 50 times and get something different out of it every time .Ultimately , it boils down to having the courage to live , to win to lose and to keep on living with dignity and without excuses no matter what happens .I 'm not unique in saying that Rocky was like a surrogate father to me .My own was n't much good for the brief time he was around and in the end I was happy to be rid of him but Rocky was always there - always encouraging , never condescending , always sincere .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't think I 've participated in a challenging sport , or a triathlon , or a lifting tournament or done anything really challenging without looking to Rocky at one point or another for inspiration .Hell , you got me through two top university programs on scholarships - I could say that I did it myself - but in my heart it was Rocky .The devotion he felt for Adrian - I felt it for my lady too .So I guess we will never be together again - even though I 'd sell my soul for her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I still see her every night .I never thought things would be this tough because I always thought we would be in each other 's corners - I know that ever since we 've been apart , neither of us has been right inside .I 'd like us both to be right inside but it is beyond me at this point so I will appeal to a higher power .Rocky - if you are out there - ask Father Carmine to throw down a blessing for both of us .Perhaps the new lesson is , I should just find my little Marie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've been a die - hard fan since I was 3 - 4 years old .I remember watching Rocky and Rocky 2 by myself When I was a just a little kid and getting goose bumps from watching the movies .To this day , I still get the same goose bumps and adrenaline from Those movies .I hope that 'll never change because that will mean that I 'm freakin ' dead inside .Rocky is all heart and will always be a role model to me .Yo Rock , you 'll always be the champ !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His final Rocky Balboa was by far one of the best and a great way to end this incredible run of Rocky .What a strange concept .I have just returned from watching the film , it was the opening night and for the first time my wife and I were crying whist watching the film .Its not that it 's a sad tear jerker , it 's the fact that we have watched them all and watching the Adrian scenes was like reliving our own life .this is the best film i have seen in the last 10years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I hate to see the series end now that it 's started up again after all these years .I saw recently Rocky Balboa , I found this movie brilliant and it became my favorite film .I think that Sylvester Stallone is the best actor of the World and I appreciate all that he makes .In more I made myself of the boxing during some years and it is very surprising to see Rocky in full action , I am in complete admiration !Thus Sylvester if you read to me , knows that your film is sublime and does not change .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
