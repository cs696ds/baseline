{"text": "W.H. Press Secretary Ca n't Explain How Regulations Will Stop Mass Shootings .President Obama has done everything in his power to restrict gun ownership throughout his time in the White House .And for the most part , he has utterly failed over and over again .He has n't had any trouble expanding our government in countless other ways , but try as he might , his administration ca n't seem to make a dent in the edifice of America 's gun culture .Which is why he has given up on changing the rules through any proper channel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He 's even working with state governors to get them to issue their own executive orders .Like a true tyrant , he is simply ignoring what the people and their elected representatives want ( however flawed those representatives may be ) , because he thinks we are just children that need to be told how to live .Also like a true tyrant , he does n't have a good explanation for why our rights need to be discarded , or how that might benefit us in any way .On Thursday , White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked about the Obama Administration 's gun policies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Here 's the answer Josh Earnest gave ( or I should say , the answer he did n't give because he completely dodges the question ) .The powers - that - be used wait until something bad happened , so they could use that event as an excuse to take away our rights .At first glance , that 's what the President 's latest anti - gun crusade sounds like , but it 's not .Josh Earnest just suggested that we tighten background checks for what might happen .What they 're really doing is taking our rights preemptively , before anything could possibly justify it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No judge , no jury , no crime .All it takes is a little suspicion or an accusation , and you lose your right to travel .Soon you 'll lose your right to defend yourself as well .And that 's not all .If Josh Earnest is truly the face of the Obama Administration , then it 's safe to assume that the President is completely clueless about why Americans have been buying so many guns ( or he just does n't care ) .President Obama 's spokesman said Thursday that the record number of Americans seeking to buy guns in recent weeks is \" a tragedy \" that the White House is at a loss to explain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" That is both ironic and tragic .\"The FBI conducted 185,345 firearms background checks on Black Friday , the most ever during a single day .The record number of gun sales came two weeks after the Islamic State 's terrorist attacks in Paris , but before the terrorist massacre in San Bernardino , California .Asked why he thinks so many Americans are buying guns , Mr. Earnest replied , \" I do n't know , I really do n't . \"\" In some cases these are individuals who believe that they need to buy a gun so that they can better protect themselves , \" he said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm just pointing out that there are already an astonishing number of guns on the streets of America and far too many innocent Americans who are being killed by them . \" Yes , it does n't make sense that more guns have been sold during a presidency that has seen more mass shootings than any before it , and it 's just inexplicable that so many guns would be sold during the most anti - gun presidency in American history .It 's a real thinker is n't it ?Joshua Krause is a reporter , writer and researcher at The Daily Sheeple .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You can follow Joshua 's reports at Facebook or on his personal Twitter .Joshua 's website is Strange Danger .Always interesting that the \" drug war \" and mental health are never mentioned , but that 's the root cause of most shootings .The US does n't have a mental health treatment plan .Families ask for help and are told nothing can happen until something really bad happens .It 's the same with aging parents .The main reason Obama does n't want to talk about the mental health problem is that his political party is the cause , Back in the 60s , the \" progressives \" changed all of the laws about committing people with mental health issues .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
