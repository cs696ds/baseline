{"text": "Today , I had the pleasure of sitting in on Larry Ferlazzo 's ( Mr. Ferlazzo to his students )Theory of Knowledge class which is part of the IB ( International Baccalaureate ) program at Luther Burbank High School .Background : .Last year , in February , I observed him teaching the same class , with a different group of students .This class is much larger , as the school is allowing for open enrollment in the class ( students who are not in the IB program or seeking that certificate can still take the class ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The students required more \" work \" from Mr. Ferlazzo , which is a good thing , as we would not want him to get a \" spare tire \" from sitting at his desk .That said , I was still impressed with how bright and insightful the students were .The Lesson : .Students had been looking at the issue of bias in the study and practice of history .To finish things up , they were assigned homework to watch a film depicting a historic event that they had done some minimal research on .They were reporting back what they had seen in the class .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The students then answered a series of questions about their movie ; .They had to pick out the best answer from their group to share .Here are the questions : .Overall , it seemed a little rough , and some of the kids seemed to miss out on the last task , but did report out something when called upon by Mr. Ferlazzo .My favorite comments : One student on Gandhi discussed how they are creating a character because it makes people want to see the movie which is the goal and that is not the same as writing history .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Common themes , movies helps us get emotion , the personalities .Others see it as a way to get details and facts .Next , students were regrouped by Mr. Ferlazzo by moving some students , and putting them in dyads and triads ( twos and threes ) .Once this was done , he had them come up with a list of 10 items to put in a time capsule , with no video , or voice recordings allowed .They were then shown a photo of a toilet seat , that is mis - interpreted as a \" head - dress \" and asked to look at another group 's 10 items , and misinterpret them . ; Skeleton is a weapon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Finally , for assessment , Mr. Ferlazzo had the students do a poster with what they had learned how they would apply this in their lives .This where things came together , and the early work students had done paid off .Just coming into the classroom on one day , it was n't always clear what they learned until then .I was impressed with a lot of the work .Here is a slideshow of those posters : .To my adult readers , Mr. Ferlazzo 's will be looking at this post , and responding to the questions below tomorrow : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Did the romance in Titanic add \" realism \" ( a real feeling ) even though it was n't real ?Or What is more important in a historic film , the history or telling a \" story \" ?Does having a point of view or opinion have a place in history ?There was a recent public opinion poll done that said most people in he U.S. believe in \" American Exceptionalism \" that the U.S. is a special place and \" blessed \" by God .Many want to see this reflected in history books .Is there a place for this ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "One thing that struck me about the method of instruction was the high level of thought required by the students .Kids were working in groups , discussing , writing , making posters , and thinking deeply about the concepts .This is an example of excellent instruction .Did the romance in Titanic add \" realism \" ( a real feeling ) even though it was n't real ?The romance in Titanic added realism to the plot of the story .I thought that it was really good , how they made romance in the film .The romance brought out a situation that could have really occured and that can really help people realize how it could have been at the moment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What opinions do you already have about history ?Having a point of view in history does have a place in history .I believe that history is based on person or one whole side 's perpsective .Each person sees history differently , based upon what they think and what they see in through their perpective .History can not be accurate because for some people , one maybe a hero and for another , they can be the worse person ever .So history is not totally accurate , and history is very bias .Not everyone 's perspective has been told in history .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Why or why not ?I do find that he is an effective teacher because he knows how to communicate with us .He also understands his students and he knows how to help them .He allows us to share our knowledge and see what other students think .I like his method of teaching , because it helps me learn new things and it also helps me get a sense of what other students in my class thinks .When I got home , I had to work with my son on a 5 paragraph essay as his end of unit assessment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "No technichally it would nt be accurate for the simple fact that history is mainly based on perspectives and opinions , however some things are emphasized and in a way form our opinions , like hitler 's story .Yes , the eaching techniques and group projects are very effective .In a way yes , for the simple fact that it gets our brain thinking but the only negative thing is that there is not allways enough time to put all the information that we found on the paper in time .This is an overall good report .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Or What is more important in a historic film , the history or telling a \" story \" ?I think the romance in Titanic took over the movie and its historical content .It made it less real .I think that the anser to part two depends on who they are .If it is made by a person who wants to make money then it will be more focused on a story not the historical accuracy to attract a bigger audience and thus make more money .Did the romance in Titanic add \" realism \" ( a real feeling ) even though it was n't real ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Then it 'll be your opinion whether they are bad or not .It also depend on who views it .Some people may think that Hitler was a great hero and some will think he is a evil man .I believe that history is written to tell us to not make the mistakes again and to learn why or how that event happened .Do you find the Mr. Ferlazzo an effective teacher ?Why or why not ?Yes , Mr Ferlazzo is an effective teacher .He 's good at explaining things when the class does not understand it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "yes a point of view or an opinion have a part in history because it shows how they think and feel . that s is a part of history .Not only that it shows us their good action and bad actions .Mr .Ferlazzo is an effective teacher because he makes us think and not only that but he rushes our thinking which make us think even faster .yes the poster was an effective and accurate end of the unit assessment because what we wrote were important things that we learn so if he write about it in his essay than he is writing important things and he have the reasons to why its important .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "What opinions do you already have about history ?A : History can be biased and determine who is \" bad \" and \" good \" .For example actions that Hitler and Gandhi both did are completely opposite from each other but that gave them their image .That is how people judge , and it can lead to diferent things because everyone may have a different perception .Do you find the Mr. Ferlazzo an effective teacher ?Why or why not ?A : Defining effective , Mr. Ferlazzo is an effective teacher eventhough \" we make him sad \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
