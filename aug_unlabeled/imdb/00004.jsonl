{"text": "Present day , South Korea , a young girl is returning home from a stay in a mental hospital but strange things happen when she and her sister are reunited in their old home with their cruel stepmother and distant father .Pigeon holing this movie as Asian horror is by no means a disservice as this genre has come to be the standard by which all modern horror is judged .The film begins with Su - Mi , a teenage girl being quizzed by a doctor in a mental hospital about her family and what she can remember about before being admitted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is obvious from the outset that Su - Mi and her younger sister Su - Yeon do not like their new stepmother as they try to avoid any contact with her , preferring the solitude of the pier that overlooks a lake on their secluded estate .Added to the mix however is the fact that the house is seemingly haunted by a troubled spirit .This could be put down to her fragile mind state seeing as she has just been released from hospital or even just a dream , after all , she is in bed but things become more sinister when they are visited by Uncle and his wife .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Is the house haunted or are tensions between the female leads causing people to imagine things .When Su - Mi quizzes him as to why these bad things are happening to her and her sister , he tells her that Su - Yeon is dead and that she should learn to deal with it .A Tale of Two Sisters is a superbly written story excellently acted giving it a very real atmosphere .It is this realism that makes it work so well as a horror , no cheap gore porn , no gross out humour just strong characters and clever story telling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
