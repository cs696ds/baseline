{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .When I saw that there was a movie called Black Scorpion 2 I knew that I would have to watch it right away as my wife and I had so enjoyed the first movie .Joan Severance returns as Darcy Walker , policewoman by day and crime fighter by night .Although her partner has been recast , almost all of the faces from the first movie have returned , including Garret Morris as Argyle .The film opens with Darcy tracking down the Gangster Prankster ( sort of a cross between the Joker and Two - Face ) and then busting him as Black Scorpion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately the Mayor enjoys the federal relief funds that quakes bring in so he sabotages her machine .The result is that it amplifies the quake and the scientist takes on the identity of Aftershock .It is up to Black Scorpion to make the streets safe again .While not quite up to the level of the first film ( the fight scenes are almost comical ) it was still a fun film and I would recommend it to anyone who has seen the first Black Scorpion film .I definitely recommend these films to those who like the comic book film genre , although this is not intended for kids ( ther is nudity and violence ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Good fun !Comment 6 of 6 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I love this movie !Black Scorpion battles the earth quake causing Aftershock !It 's a cheesy comic book romp with Joan Severance in bondage gear so how can ya beat that !Yes Ms Severance does keep her clothes on ( so do the women on the tv show , but they are hot too ) , but she 's beautiful and sexy and looks great especially when being seductive and smokin that cigar !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This a lot of fun and if you like this sort of thing you 'll love the box set of the series which continues the storyline of the two films and brings back Breathtaker , Aftershock , and the Gangster Prankster for more campy chaos !Comment 5 of 5 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Black Scorpion II is a great B movie comic book .Joan Severance is beautiful and wears bondage gear and is just so alluring .If you grew up on cheesy comic books and are in touch with your ' inner 13 year old ' how can ya not love this ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Comment 4 of 4 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Some say these type of movies are \" bad \" and sure they wo n't win an Oscar , but the Black Scorpion sure will entertain .The Black Scorpion is every cool superhero cliche wrapped up in one beautiful package .Um .Make that TWO beautiful packages .Joan Severance and Michelle Lintel have both played the role .Severance played the Scorpion in the original Black Scorpion movie , and in this sequel , and Lintel took over for the tv show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Who cares !I like em both .A LOT !How could any red blooded male decide when you can enjoy em both over and over thanks to Roger Corman and DVD technology ?Enjoy !Comment 3 of 3 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .The Black Scorpion movies and series are very funny and sexy and they are n't to be taken seriously , but are great escapism .The villans from this one return for the series which is now available on DVD and had Adam West and Frank Gorshin too !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Comment 3 of 3 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .The character Black Scorpion is born of comic book roots and it certainly shows in this movie .If you were expecting serious crime drama then you 're looking in the wrong place .This is definitely not Black Knight Rises , but if your willing to sit back , grab some popcorn and enjoy some fun action including a great looking super hero , a great looking techno - whiz of a car and some fast - paced action you ARE in the right place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
