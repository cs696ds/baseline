{"text": "On April 8 , 1994 , one of the dominant forces in 1990s youth subculture put a shotgun in his mouth and pulled the trigger .Kurt Cobain , lead singer and guitarist for the punk / grunge band Nirvana , thereby ended not only his own seemingly successful career and life , but also one of the great rock and roll anti - movements of the century .Certainly , Cobain was not the first overwrought rock star to take his own life .However , nearly three years after the act , his death ( as well as his life ) is still a topic at the heart of youth subculture .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His musical career was a cry of anguish ; his suicide stands as an exclamation point .Four albums worth of new material and two sets of rereleases does not guarantee a place in the rock and roll canon ; however , Cobain has claimed a place , all the while having claimed that he did n't really want it .This tension , between his words and his acts , may lie at or near the heart of his suicide at age 27 .Popular music critics and social pundits certainly seem to think so .I think , however , that there may be more to it than that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Those interplays between Cobain 's scenes make naming them difficult .There was the Generation X youth subculture , much of whose lore emanates from Seattle in the early 1990s .There was the world of popular music , which Nirvana made a huge mark on with the success of their 1991 release \" Nevermind .\" There was the mass culture of the early 1990s , which paid Cobain and his band , as well as his troubled family , a great deal of attention .Finally , there was the man himself , struggling with his fame and his goals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nirvana was the first of a new generation of \" punk \" or alternative bands to achieve mass commercial success .Nirvana 's short stint in the spotlight of popular music and youth culture was filled with fame , money , drugs , anger and resentment .Cobain 's impact on Generation X is undeniable .In the wake of Nirvana 's first major - label release , \" Nevermind , \" in 1991 , several bands began waving the \" grunge \" banner .Bands like Pearl Jam , Alice in Chains , Soundgarden , Mudhoney , Seaweed , Tad ( the list goes on and on ) began playing dissonant , angry rock music with lyrics filled with self - hate and disempowerment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact , the Seattle scene became such a focusing point for the subculture that it began sucking people into it .Bands and punk kids from all across America were moving to the Emerald City , hoping to meet the right people and get their piece of the action .With some measure of fame and influence in his pocket , Cobain 's suicide appears especially bizarre .In the months after Cobain took his life , psychoanalysts , music writers and social critics worked overtime to explain his final act , but their explanations all seem incomplete .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Certainly he was a sick man , both physically and mentally ; certainly the demands of his fame conflicted with his artistic instincts .There seems , however , to be much more to the situation than any of these thumbnail sketches .One way of unlocking the depth of Cobain 's motives for suicide is to look at his life and death through the dramatistic pentad .Burke 's theory , rooted in the concepts that all rhetoric is action and that all acts are rhetorical , lets us consider Cobain 's band , his music , his style , his scene and his impact as aspects of his motivation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Applying Burke 's pentad and circumference models to Kurt Cobain 's suicide may help explain the event and its significance in a way that both scholars and students can find useful .For scholars , applying an academic method to a mainstream culture artifact helps us connect with the larger society we work in , as well as with our students .For students , this kind of project shows them that their teachers are human beings as well , and , more importantly , that their experiences are valuable in the academy .Beyond that , both teachers and students can learn more productive ways to be critical of their cultures .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I find two ratios especially interesting to look at : scene - agent and scene - agency .Ultimately , I believe , the motives for Cobain 's suicide come down to a question of whether the Seattle / alternative / punk / pop - music / mass culture scene in which he existed subsumed his agency .If so , then we might say that he was no longer an agent when he made music , since what he did was , at least to some degree , unwilling .As a starting point , I would begin by assigning details of Cobain 's suicide to places on the pentad .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He killed himself in his house in Seattle ; the house , then , is the most immediate scene ; a long look at the notion of circumference will complicate that idea a little later in the paper .Cobain is the actor , although there are conspiracy theorists out there who suggest that his death might be a murder ( they argue that he could n't possibly have held the rifle and shot it at himself as their key piece of evidence ) .Purpose is a difficult term .His suicide note , which we 'll look at in some detail , claims that he felt his usefulness had come to an end .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Therefore , we might say that his purpose in suicide was to fix what was broken about his life - everything .Agency is another complicated term .For Burke , agency is the power / authority by which the agent commits the act .In the most immediate sense , the agency of Cobain 's suicide is the rifle .This sense , however , does n't really help us understand the event .All we know from this sense of agency is that the gun was powerful enough to kill him - not a very revealing insight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To explain the usefulness of these different looks , Burke has developed the term \" circumference . \"In keeping with Burke 's unwillingness to define terms clearly , there is no explicit description of the term in his work .The concept seems to be centered around this idea : .The word [ circumference ] reminds us that , when ' defining by location , ' one may place the object of one 's definition in contexts of varying scope .And our remarks on the scene - act ratio , for instance , suggest that the choice of circumference for the scene in terms of which a given act is to be located will have a corresponding effect upon the interpretation of the act itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In other words , any discussion of scenes , acts or other parts of the pentad will be imbedded within a certain circumference .Changing the circumference changes the ratios of pentadic elements , thus affecting our readings by changing our terministic screens .Our terministic screens provide us ways of reading events ; however , they also preclude our reading events in certain ways : .Even if any given terminology is a reflection of reality , by its very nature as a terminology it must be a selection of reality ; and to this extent it must function also as a deflection of reality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Herein lies my complaint with most attempts at explaining Kurt Cobain 's life and death .Too many writers have not looked through other terministic screens , i.e. , not looked outside their circumferences , for motives .The point , to paraphrase the adage , is that when you have a hammer in your hand , everything looks like a nail .We are doing a disservice to the life and work of Kurt Cobain to write him off as just another psychotic freak who could play a guitar .We are doing a similar disservice to include him in the long list of celebrities who could n't handle the pressures of stardom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For this group of kids and young adults , Cobain may be the most influential figure of the decade .I want to start my analysis by establishing some personality traits of Cobain - as - agent .Writers who covered the troubled musician during and after his career probably were not surprised by his suicide .After all , some two months earlier , Cobain had been hospitalized in Rome , Italy ; he had been discovered in the bathtub of his hotel room , in a coma apparently brought on by mixing heroin , barbiturates and champagne .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only comment Cobain made came out as soon as he came out of the coma .He looked around at the crowd of press and fans in his hospital room and said , \" What am I doing here ?Get these fucking tubes out of my nose \" ( Handy ) .After his recovery from the Rome incident , the short remainder of Cobain 's life appeared to be going well .In his last interview , he claimed to have kicked his heroin habit , stopped drinking and cured himself of chronic stomach pains that had troubled him for years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( \" The Riot Grrls \" are feminist punk rockers . )The couple had been plagued by drug abuse and purported physical and verbal abuse ( going both ways ) throughout their two - year marriage , which hit rock bottom when a Seattle social - worker took their daughter Frances Bean away from them , declaring them unfit parents .All of those problems appeared to working themselves out , however .\" I 've never been happier in my life , \" Cobain claimed ( Fricke , \" Kurt Cobain , \" 37 ) .His own words paint a picture of a man who is in control of his life for the first time in a long time , maybe ever .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ironically , it was during that same interview that he talked about his gun collection ( from which the suicide weapon comes ) publicly for the first time .He explained that he liked to shoot targets , but could never shoot a human being ( 39 ) .Sometime after January of 1994 , I guess he decided he was no longer a human being .Such a self - concept would not be surprising coming from the man who penned lyrics like these from Nirvana 's first hit song , 1991 's \" Smells Like Teen Spirit \" : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( see Appendix I for complete lyrics ) .This stanza , along with the vast majority of Cobain 's lyrics , is packed with negativity .Perhaps Cobain thought \" It 's fun to lose \" because he had never really experienced winning .The idea that \" self - assured \" is a \" dirty word \" is not especially positive either ; people with self - confidence are \" dirty .\" I also can not help but notice the references to guns .The first line is obvious , but \" She 's over bored \" is a very subtle double entendre .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This characterization of a woman , who is unnamed and may therefore suggest any woman , is no shock given Cobain 's antisocial nature .However , if we insert a hyphen between \" over \" and \" bored , \" the resulting adjective describes guns that may be too powerful for their casings , possibly exploding in the shooter 's hands .Along with the negative impressions these lyrics create , there is also an air of passivity that pervades Cobain 's work as well .The starkest example is from the 1993 release \" In Utero , \" which featured the song \" Rape Me . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "You invited us here ' . \"( Fricke , \" Kurt Cobain , \" 38 ) .Cobain - as - agent has said much here about the generation ( scene ) to which he belongs .The primary message is the sloughing of responsibility , even in so mundane a context .The point is that when he goes to parties , he does not want to take an active role in the situation .He would prefer to have the fun brought to him .If a situation is \" boring or uncomfortable , \" it must be because the host of the party is not working hard enough .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This forfeiting of agency ( he could have been active at parties if he 'd wanted to ) , captured in a simple song lyric , may ultimately reflect the tension Cobain felt in his own life .There is something to be said for the idea that his suicide was the most active role he ever took in anything .I am not arguing that Cobain was the kind of person who sat and let the world pass him by without comment .Clearly , he wrote songs that angrily described his perception of dark hopelessness .While he may have been crying loudly over the pain and anguish of America 's youth , he did so with an edge that made people listen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Cobain 's music was both more melodic and more abrasive than the grunge norm .He usually eschewed the therapeutic vignettes of the ' recovery rock ' bands , and vented his spleen directly at the audience . . . .( 42 ) .I do need to clarify two points about Star 's analysis .First , Nirvana essentially established the \" grunge norm \" ; any comparison should be made against them .Second , the \" recovery rock \" bands to which he refers are socially conscious bands like Fugazi and the Rollins Band , who seek to redeem themselves from what they see as the darkness of the times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He had given up hope long ago and did not hide that fact from his audience .In terms of the agent - agency ratio , we might say that Cobain 's agency ( music ) signifies his loss of agency .He seems to consider himself an unwilling agent .In addition to his lyrics , Cobain 's music similarly mixes moods .The vast majority of Nirvana songs follow a pattern of moving from hard power - rock riffs to softer , slower melodic sections during verses .The dynamic of the music suggests the same passive - aggressiveness that the lyrics do , i.e. , switching back and forth between anger and depression .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dick Dahl , in the Utne Reader , says : .Like the Replacements , Nirvana describes a world of youthful alienation .Sometimes the music broods , sometimes it swaggers .But it does so in a dark intellectual valley walled off on one end by mindless adolescence and on the other by the empty , spirit - killing world of adulthood .In this passage , Dahl has located Nirvana in a scene that few could hope to live in happily .He has placed Kurt Cobain at the crossroads between his unhappy childhood and his hopeless adulthood , a condition that many young adults claim to find themselves in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've claimed that Cobain 's work paints bleak pictures ; there is also a way to look at them , and his personality in general , that suggests a dark sense of humor .The fact that he would pun on guns in \" Smells Like Teen Spirit \" is one example .This story ( I apologize for its length , but the writing is too good to pass up ) is another : .Blood is pouring onto the floor of Nirvana 's dressing room .To make matters worse , the source of the bleeding - a fan with a hole in his head where his front tooth used to be - has gone into shock and is convulsing uncontrollably .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "His diving into the crowd and smashing instruments was not original .Pete Townshend , guitarist for the Who , had been smashing guitars on stage since 1965 .Slam - dancing and crowd - surfing had been popular since the late 1970s , as punks ' badge that they were willing to trust even their bodies to each other while they disclaimed membership in any other social group .Cobain 's adoption of these punk idioms indicates that he was at least sympathetic to certain punk ideologies .In an obituary in the New Yorker , Alex Ross , one of legion commentators on Cobain 's death , writes , \" Cobain was at once irritated and intrigued by the randomness of his new audience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But . . .Nirvana could n't shift from dormant to militant because , like most of the American underground , they were sceptical about attempts to politicise rock and marshal it into a movement .( Reynolds and Press 98 ) .If Reynolds and Press are correct , then perhaps it would be more accurate to say that Cobain was not unwilling to speak to his generation ; rather , we might say that he thought he was unable to do so ( more to come on that idea ) .Although this reading provides some interesting food for thought , I 'm not convinced that Reynolds and Press are correct ; neither is David Fricke in a Rolling Stone obituary : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Therefore , I begin with a comparatively narrow circumference - the 1990s punk / disaffected youth subculture .Earlier , I pointed out some of the key terms within this circumference : the \" Seattle scene \" and the \" grunge ( anti)movement \" are two particularly important phrases .Through this lens , we can say that the \" scene \" consisted of a number of bands and their fans .The focus was loud , abrasive , self - deprecating music , along the attending fashions and attitudes .Alex Ross , in his aforementioned obituary , explains : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Others just got off on the crushing power of the sound .Ross ' description touches on the mood of many teenagers and young adults in the early 1990s .Because he uses the word \" identified \" in this passage , here we need to look at another of Burke 's key ideas , the concept of \" identification . \"Again , there is no clear definition of the term in A Rhetoric of Motives , so I will try to construct one to work with .The concept of identification , for Burke , is rooted in the notion of \" substance , \" which indicates that which underlies any two ideas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Burke suggests that rhetors use consubstantiation , i.e. , identification , as rhetorical strategy : .And identification ranges from the politician who , addressing an audience of farmers , says , ' I was a farm boy myself , ' through mysteries of social status , to the mystic 's devout identification with the source of all being .( Rhetoric x ) .In general , then , the point is that rhetors seek to identify with their audiences so that the speakers ' messages share certain connections with the ideas of the audience members .But what happens when the identification is unintentional on the part of the speaker ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We know , however , that many of his listeners looked to him for certain messages .In other words , his audience identified with him , perhaps much more than he identified with them .The outpouring of media coverage in the weeks after Cobain 's death provides a wealth of examples ; two articles are representative , both in tone and in content .The first is a letter to the editor of Time , in which the writer claims : .Many think Cobain was selfish and crude , but he spoke to many young people around the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Luckily he shared some of his heartache with us , so we did n't feel so alone .( Wickerham 8) .Nirvana fan Julie Wickerham believes that the angst of Generation X is so widespread as to be universal .At the same time , in one of the great paradoxes of Generation X , the angst and \" heartache \" are \" extremely personal \" ; herein lies another source of tension for this generation .The \" twentysomethings \" feel pain and fear that are very intensely private and personal , but at the same time know that everyone else feels them too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Her repeated use of first - person plural pronouns , especially in conjunction with negative emotions , clearly indicates her identification with Cobain 's message .The second example comes from an obituary in the New York Times .Music writer Lorraine Ali suggests that the cause of Cobain 's personal pain may arguably have been the cause of his success : .Kurt Cobain was one among a league of kids raised by 60 's parents who shuffled their children from relative to relative in a quest for personal freedom .Courtney Love ( Cobain 's widow ) of Hole , Bill Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins , Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and Moby are just a few more .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( C28 ) .I believe Ali is correct when she connects the success of these musicians to the decay of the traditional American family .Kurt Cobain , Bill Corgan and others are especially articulate when it comes to expressing the pain of family breakups , the loss of goals and what some twentysomethings consider the end of the American Dream .Cobain was a product of a divorced , relatively poor family , and that background , especially as it became more publicized , helped create the identification that drove his career until his death .The point I 'm working towards in this part of the discussion is that Cobain 's audience looked to him for hope / relief / catharsis that he only partially wanted to provide for them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In Burkean terms , the scene was asking too much from the agent , and the agent could n't or would n't comply ; but at the same time , he felt bad about it .If we widen the circumference beyond Cobain 's music and its audience , and look at Nirvana 's larger cultural impact , the scene becomes even more dominant .The youth subculture 's identification with the grunge anti - movement became manifest in more ways than simply buying Nirvana records .Throughout history , people have shown a tendency to emulate the styles of their heroes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Whatever the reason , Nirvana popularized a look that became intimately connected with the meaning that we attach to the band .The image of the \" grunge \" fan is very different from the traditional \" punk \" image of the 1970s .Gone is the fear appeal of swastikas tattooed on foreheads , safety pins worn through the nose and ears , and bondage clothing .Instead , beginning from the top of the body , we see hair that is commonly long and unwashed ; grungers often strive to look like they have not bathed or taken any time whatsoever to consider their appearance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Others do not shave their faces , or their legs , or their underarms , etc .Often their jewelry and clothes come from thrift - stores .The goal is to look destitute , as if to suggest that this position in society is the best they can achieve .A typical grunge uniform consists of a flannel shirt around the waist and another one worn normally , with a dirty or ratty T - shirt underneath .Legs are kept warm on those cold winter nights and those hot summer days by torn jeans ( often black ) or fatigue pants .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Knit ski caps are common .In an article from Business Week in May 1993 , Christina Thompson , a graduate student at Columbia University , described her standard daily attire : two flannel shirts , torn Levi 's , a T - shirt and a pendant .The total price of her outfit was $ 26 ( Tilsner 39 ) .The grunge uniform , when constructed and worn successfully , may evoke feelings of pity from those who observe it .The popularity of the look , causing it to show up in as mainstream a publication as Business Week , makes two points .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Up until that point , Cobain was nothing if not a punk kid .With the formation of his first relatively stable band , and especially after the release of their first record , 1989 's \" Bleach , \" the scene began to change .As his music ( his agency ) began to affect larger audiences , his own intentions as a musician ( purpose ) became steadily less important .But what happens to this explanation if we expand the circumference in which we place it ?If we look at Cobain 's suicide through the eyes of a record - label executive , or any other pop music businessperson , the picture changes considerably .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Cobain 's personality does not appear any more stable when we take more destabilizing factors , such as money and pressure from his record label ( industry giant DGC Records ) , into account .He still was trapped in the limbo between DIY punk and rock star .But by 1994 , the popular music scene had changed considerably , and Cobain 's status as pop icon had diminished .Nirvana 's own record sales , after \" Nevermind 's \" overwhelming success , were not nearly as impressive .Also , other bands began following in Nirvana 's wake , capitalizing on the inroads Cobain 's work had made into the mainstream .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To begin with , the sales figures for Nirvana 's next release after \" Nevermind , \" called \" Incesticide , \" were incredibly disappointing .The record was a collection of B - sides and covers , many of which had been recorded before \" Nevermind .\" Most of the band 's new fans were not prepared for the raw punk energy of this record , and it sold fewer than 100,000 copies .David Geffen of DGC records , the label which released both \" Nevermind \" and \" Incesticide , \" took a beating in the industry for allowing the band to release such unpolished work on the heels of their early success .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Apparently , the reaction to \" Incesticide \" was so bad that Geffen tried to assert some control over the band 's next project , 1993 's \" In Utero .\"During the last few months before the record came out , the popular music press published article after article claiming that Cobain and producer Butch Vig were engaging in screaming matches and even fist - fights over the sound of the album .The band tried to fire Vig , but Geffen would not let them .Eventually , Vig and Cobain worked out their differences , and in his Rolling Stone interview from January 1994 , Cobain claimed to be satisfied with the product ( Fricke , \" Kurt Cobain , \" 37 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We can cast this idea also as a conflict between two powerful scenes to which Cobain belonged : the punk subculture and the pop music mainstream .Although the sales of \" Incesticide \" were disappointing , the music - buying public still seemed to have latched onto the \" punkness \" of Nirvana .On the other hand , the industry spokesperson for the band ( Geffen ) , was concerned ( and rightly so from his point of view ) about record sales .Their own problems were not the only problems they faced trying to stay at the top .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Pearl Jam and the Stone Temple Pilots , in particular , soon carved out their own niches in the grunge / punk market , and every record they sold was a Nirvana record left on the shelf .A fierce rivalry developed between Kurt Cobain and Eddie Vedder , lead singer of Pearl Jam , over who was the \" leader of the pack , \" and between late 1992 and early 1994 , Vedder began to emerge .In addition , not only were other grunge bands beginning to find success in mainstream youth culture , but other types of \" punk \" bands were beginning to make their marks as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I can understand why Kurt Cobain might not be happy with this new development .This more 70s - styled punk appropriated the angst and discontent of the 1990s from Cobain , and combined it with more melodic songs to create a more listenable misery .At the same time , these bands began to mix the angst that drove them with a silliness and humor that blunted their edge .The back cover is a blurry photo of a crowd of slam - dancers , with an Ernie ( from Sesame Street ) puppet being thrust up into the air .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the last couple of years , this trend has continued , as even grunge bands like the Stone Temple Pilots have developed a pop sensibility that changes their impact radically .For whatever reason ( I could do another paper just on this issue ) , the music scene and the larger scene of our mass culture that supports it has taken a turn away from serious , dark , brooding music .In simplest terms , then , we can say with some degree that the scene changed significantly over the course of just a few years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
