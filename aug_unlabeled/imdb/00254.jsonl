{"text": "If any of you guys liked ( or did n't like ) Tom Goes to the Mayor , the guys behind it - Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim , are coming out with a new show .I kinda always thought their other stuff was better than TGTTM ( although I loved that show ) , and it looks like this show will have a bunch of guests like Tom did .So far in the clips online are David Cross , Zack Galifinakis , Bob Odenkirk and a bunch bunch more .I hated tom goes to the mayor , and I really do n't like the non animation shows that are coming soon to adult swim .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "MTV2 canceled Wonder Showzen ( I think ) , and Stella only lasted one season on Comedy Central .I am perfectly happy with adult swim becoming the new home of anti - tv tv .I 'm interested in it mainly because any Tim and Eric bit that involves retarded CGI and/or 80s - era TV graphic effects I find absolutely hilarious for some reason .( I could watch the TGTTM opening 10 times in a row and not get sick of it . )I 'm also finding myself laughing at the \" awkward\"-themed bits too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
