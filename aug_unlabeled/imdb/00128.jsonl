{"text": "One Crazy Summer ( 1986 ) .August 9 , 1986 .SCREEN : ' CRAZY SUMMER ' .By NINA DARNTON .There are all kinds of movies .Movies that entertain , that frighten , that excite , that thrill , that move , that make you laugh and that make you think . ''One Crazy Summer ' ' can not be accused of being any of these - although there are a few jokes at which you may find yourself smiling .In fact , the film is so successful at turning your brain into something resembling mashed potatoes that it is not clear when you 'll be able to respond to intelligible stimuli again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This mindless romp written and directed by Savage Steve Holland , whose last film was ' ' Better Off Dead , ' ' is a string of set - up punch lines .It is the ultimate luxury for the kid who has everything - a film that means nothing .It opened yesterday at the RKO National Twin and other theaters .Two high school graduates ( John Cusack as Hoop and Joel Murray as George ) go to Nantucket for the summer , looking for fun and romance .They meet Cassandra ( Demi Moore ) , whose house is being foreclosed by some wicked developers who want to build a restaurant on the property .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hoop wants to be a cartoonist , and his animated drawings are set up as sequences interspersed throughout the film .This is a clever idea , and Mr. Holland used animation to good effect in ' ' Better Off Dead . ' ' If the movie could have reached the lunacy of Mad magazine at its best , it might have worked .But that would mean some focus - intelligent satire in an absurdist style .In spite of the director 's flair for zany humor , this film is just absurd .John Cusack and Demi Moore are such charming personalities that they are appealing even in so silly a setting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It would be interesting to see them make a film together , instead of being stock figures in an extended joke .One Crazy Summer ' ' has been rated PG ( ' ' Parental Guidance Suggested ' ' ) .It contains some mild vulgarity .THE CAST - ONE CRAZY SUMMER , written and directed by Savage Steve Holland ; photographed by Isadore Mankofsky ; edited by Alan Balsam ; music by Cory Lerios ; produced by Michael Jaffe ; released by Warner Brothers .At Warner Twin , Broadway and 47th Street ; 86th Street Twin , at Lexington Avenue ; Manhattan Twin , 59th St. east of Third Ave .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
