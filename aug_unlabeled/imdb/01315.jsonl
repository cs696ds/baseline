{"text": "Monthly Archives : July 2012 .So ...The Night Brings Charlie ...In the place where I grew up , it most certainly did .And still does , but that 's beside the point .There 's an amazing true story about a guy named Terry Wallis , who on Friday the 13th of July 1984 , after celebrating the birth of his first born child , was involved in a terrible traffic accident .He was seriously injured , lost consciousness and fell into a coma , which left the doctor 's giving him little hope of recovery .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nineteen , yes nineteen years later and believe it or not , on Friday the 13th , he regained full consciousness and said the words,'milk ' and ' Pepsi ' to his mother who was beside him at his bedside .What a fantastic tale and a great example of the strength of human spirit .He went on to make up for lost time getting to know his teenage daughter .Funnily enough , it took him a while to realise that it was n't still 1984 .Tom Logan 's slasher also comes across like it has been comatose for a while .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The success of A Nightmare on Elm Street saw obvious changes begin appearing within the slasher genre , but none of those updates can be seen here .It 's like the last seven - years never happened for the crew involved in this one and much like Mr Wallis , they still thought that they were living in the early eighties .A small town called Pakoe is being terrorised by a vicious serial killer .Sporting the traditional Southern loon garb of a lumberjack shirt and potato sack over his head , he is driving round late at night , killing youngsters and collecting their decapitated heads .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only reason I wrote that this looks like it was filmed in ' 83 and I did n't go as far back as ' 80 is because director Tom Logan has CLEARLY cut and pasted a scene from Friday the 13thPart III ( 1982 ) .Three leather - clad bikers get chopped up in a barn by the hooded killer and the overall set - up is almost identical to the sequence from that Friday installment .In fact , many of the best parts of The Night Brings Charlie have been seen previously in either Halloween or Friday .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The final girl is the typical shy virgin type and they even remember the essential heavy - breathing POV shot .The Night Brings Charlie is the movie equivalent of going on a date with a girl who shows you her breasts in the first ten - minutes , but then sits across the table from you for the rest of the evening and gets the early bus home .The opening murder is gooey as hell with a great throat slicing and a gallon of blood , but the rest of them are disappointingly dry and mostly off - screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This scene also plays host to the strangest product placement in the history of cruddy films .Do you take a can of fizzy drink with you in to the shower ?No ... ?Well a girl does here .I enjoy playing the ' guess who financed this movie ' game when watching low - budget flicks .If ever you see a car stuck behind a lorry that carries a massive logo in filmland , you know that there 's a marketing bod somewhere that is more hopeful than the crew that this movie is going to be a hit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "How 's that for advertising ?Like a night at an elderly relatives birthday party , Charlie has moments that are painful and a few that are actually quite fun .The acting is stilted tosh , the script is most definitely a ' first draft ' without any proofreads and the cinematography ( or videotography ) is as grainy as a sheet of sandpaper .Despite this though , Logan manages to chuck in a handful of minor jumps that are really well crafted and quite frequent .There 's also a hilarious scene where the killer alters the population number on the town 's welcome board with a piece of chalk after he has dispatched another victim .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A boisterous lump by the name of Ella , she speaks openly about her bowel movements and states stuff like , \" That 's the fifteenth person today who wants your nuts on a plate \" .Pure class , eh ?As I mentioned earlier , the killer goes for the burlap sack dress code , but just to add his own stamp to the kit , he also sports what looks to be a pair of swimming goggles .There 's a twist in the story that 's ok and even if the runtime lingers on the edge of tedium , it does n't drag enough to make you want to turn it off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maybe it was the barns ?Or the boobs ?Or the Pepsi cans ?Or the bad acting ?I ca n't be sure , but something here most definitely reminded me of something there .So should you rush out madly and spend a fortune hunting this one down ?Quite frankly , no ; - but if you come across it somewhere at an agreeable rate , you can give it a shot .Aside from an interesting killer guise and a few cans of Pepsi , there 's not much that you have n't seen elsewhere and most likely handled much better .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You could n't count on ten hands the amount of slasher movies that have titles that end with the word ' massacre ' .It must have been tempting for director John Marshall to call his movie Rocky Ridge Massacre .Or even , maybe , Rocky Ridge Party Massacre !But no ...Massacre at Rocky Ridge it is .Right , so you know what to expect .This one is so obscure that it is not yet on the IMDB .It was made by the small independent movie house , Rainforest Studios and despite some of the cast and crew going on to larger things , it has been totally and completely forgotten .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What does that usually tell you ?Come on , we have been here before , yes ?In a billion+ cases that means that a movie has disappeared simply because it stinks .Stinks like a skunk after a Vindaloo and a tin of baked beans .Pheeeeeeeeeeew ! ! !A group of four friends head off in to the woodland on a project for their church .There , they come across an old Crazy Ralph - esque guy who tells them about a group of youngsters that were murdered a while earlier .The killer was never captured , so before long he comes back to leave a few more corpses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thank you John Marshall , because you gave me one of the most unexpected ever .It 's quite obvious by this site that I enjoy watching slasher films , but sometimes the really cruddy ones are extremely painful .Even for me .I was expecting the worst with a zero budget title that 's not listed on any film websites .But prepare to be shocked ladies and gentlemen , because this obscurity is not bad at all .In fact , it 's actually quite good !Massacre at Rocky Ridge is a tribu te to Friday the 13th and one that most definitely carries some of the chemistry of a classic killer in the woods yarn .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The scene is superbly lighted with energetic photography and attempts at jump scares .The killer looks fantastic in a ' cherubic ' white mask and cape combo , but the best part is what happens when he finally catches the fleeing bunny .You see what really makes Massacre at Rocky Ridge stand out is that the victims really look like they are getting stabbed .It 's almost like a snuff film in places .They fight for every last breath and the look on their faces when they 're impaled is sometimes uncomfortable .Marshall has done a superb job with his actors and has tried to make things as realistic as possible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have never really been a huge fan of sex scenes , but I appreciate that they 're part of the ' exploitation package ' .However if you ask me to give my judgement , then seeing two slim counsellors in the closest you can imagine to school uniform ' get it on ' is a far more appealing proposition than what I saw in Sandy Hook .Ridge has not one , not two , but three lesbo clinches and at least the girls here are attractive with lumps in the right places ( not just above the belt ! )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It shows how a group of female scouts head off in to the forest and are brutally killed one by one by the maniac .To me , it looked pretty obvious that the nut job was going to make a reappearance when the tale that was being told had come to an end .And he does ; but they leave it right until the last eight minutes .I do n't have any information as to why , but I can only guess that it was to make the runtime longer .It 's not necessarily a bad thing , but it is easy to notice that this was the case , because the characters that we are introduced to in the opening seemed certain to have had a bigger part to play in the storyline .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What I did n't particularly like and it 's more a personal thing , was the way it gets a bit too perverted as things head to the conclusion .Now I mentioned the girl on girl stuff already , but when the park ranger turns up in the morning and discovers all the ( naked ) bodies , he puts them in a big pile and films them with a camcorder .Cue plenty of lingering shots of naked girlies splashed in blood .Whilst searching for information on this flick , I discovered a forum where people were discussing movies that show corpses dumped on top of each other .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm not sure to be honest , but if nude dead chicks in a heap is your fantasy , buy this movie now !Despite being put together on peanuts , Ridge hides its budget restraints splendidly .The only places where you can see its low funding are in the slightly repetitive score , ' eccentric ' continuity and some of the editing , which is amazing during the kill scenes , but jumps around like a record player aboard the sinking Titanic in other places .What was impressive though was the fact that when you think of how many big budget slashers had trouble with lig hting ( Campsite Massacre , Humongous et al ) , Ridge gets it all spot on and it 's a fabulous achievement .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Watching someone get stabbed very realistically once is cool .Twice is still ok .But by the tenth time , I was wishing that the maniac could show a bit more creativity .Maybe he should go watch Happy Birthday to Me and learn a few more interesting ways to wipe out some teens ?I was told once that if you streamline your movie to fit its funding - for example , you do n't write a script with explosions and helicopters if you 're working on a David Sterling production - then meagre budget is no excuse for a poor movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was expecting Carnage Road and although what I got was n't quite Coda , to end up with Cutting Class was a real treat :) .So here we have Sandy Hook Lingerie Party Massacre .Let 's say that again , SANDY HOOK LINGERIE PARTY MASSACRE !What do you think of when you see that combination of words ?What 's in a title anyway ?Does it have a cryptic meaning ?Who is Sandy Hook ?What on earth am I writing about ?Let 's move on ... .Very hard to find on any format ( I picked up mine in Moscow ) , Sandy Hook is another Debbie Rochon carried feature .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ms Rochon has built a successful career on being a half decent actress with an awesome pair of boobs .What she specialises in is attaching her name to modestly funded features , turning up for a second ( usually to expose aforementioned ' twin peaks ' ) and then disappearing with a healthy paycheque .Everyone 's a winner though , because she gets paid , the producers get a fairly experienced name to place above their title and her fans get to appreciate those two bad boys in all their bra - less glory .As she generally sticks to no - budget efforts , it 's fairly obvious that she has done her share of slashers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "They have the boobies for sure , but aside from Debbie Rochon , they also have the bellies to match .Here begins the film 's fundamental flaw .It 's not just because these girls are awful actresses .We are used to that by now .It 's just that they 're incredibly unappealing and a runtime filled with them gets very long and very boring very quickly .To break it down : We get to watch fat chicks dancing on a bridge for ten minutes .Then we get fat chicks playing beach - ball for the same length of time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps the film 's kill shot in terms of a decent ranking comes during the lightweight lesbian scene , which could in effect be a sumo match .Yes , it 's poor ; - astronomically so .Also , Dios m\u00edo , I did n't mention the nipple and tongue piercing scene ... errrrrghhhh !After an hour ( you read right - a full sixty minutes ) the masked killer turns up ( awesome mask btw ) and we get down to business .Most of the murders are too dark to see but one of them is ok .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The maniac uses a hook - like weapon and stalks using typical POV .A film really has to be abysmal to get slated by me on this site , because I always hope to uncover a title that no one else has given time to .This however is most DEFINITELY not one of those .So what did Mr .Creepo ( The film 's producer and a guy so egotistical that he makes his characters discuss whether they would go to bed with him ) - do wrong ?Well , in the UK , they have the descriptive term ' chav ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Every second word from their mouths is either about sex or their lady lumps , which to be fair is all that they have to offer .It 's perhaps worth noting that Hook is billed as a horror / comedy , but the only horror to be found here is the inane attempt every now and then to be humorous .These ' jokes ' are so unevenly placed that they make little sense .There is one , believe it or not , very good shot .It shows the killer creeping up behind our final girl , who as you may have already guessed happens to be Ms Rochon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This is arguably one of the best of them .Lucy Lethal , Cynthia Slayed , Nancy Napalm , Randy Rot and Bertha Beirut are all members of the heavy metal band Dead Girls .They have found notoriety with a gimmick that revolves around murder , death and lyrics that glorify suicide .Bertha Beirut is the lead songwriter and would like to try and move them in a more uplifting direction , but her band mates just do n't think it would work .\" We 're the Dead Girls not the Shirelles , \" remarks Lucy Lethal sarcastically .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It seems someone else has taken the death gimmick a tad too seriously ... .Director Dennis Devine admits that Dead Girls is widely regarded as the best of his B movie output .He also notes that it was possibly the most difficult and frustrating project that he has worked upon .This was mainly due to the size of the script that he had to squeeze into a fourteen - day time - scale .Apparently the abysmal weather conditions did n't help , as he had to shoot a lot of scenes outdoors and it kept snowing at all the wrong times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite these production challenges , Dead Girls is a pretty decent late entry to the cycle .It takes a little while to step up a gear , but once the victims are stranded in the realms of woodland wilderness - struggling to uncover the maniac 's identity - it provides a few cheesy thrills .All the essential slasher movie regulations are intact , including a tad of nudity , some tacky gore and a soundtrack of ear numbing heavy metal that seems only to be found in these kind of pictures .There 's even a gooey finger - lopping scene , which looks to have been inspired by Tony Maylem 's The Burning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The killer himself looks pretty creepy in a decent rubber skull - mask and traditional Giallo - like psycho garb and there 's more than enough suspects to keep viewers playing the guessing game until the film 's lengthy climax .The only real problems with Dead Girls are those that plague almost every other genre attempt from this period - uneven performances .It 's a shame that the dramatics continuously blow so hot and cold , because in this particular movie it really does hold back the chance of a higher rating .Some of the potential shown by the leads was hampered by unconvincing work from the supporting cast , which never allows the motion picture to go to the heights that it could have done .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To be frank , I did n't really have too much of a problem with the runtime and I actually enjoyed the film quite a lot .A while back , I attended a horror festival type thing in London .Some of the ' stars ' in attendance were Alan Birkinshaw , George Dugdale and Caroline Munro to name but a couple and I watched Killer 's Moon for the first time on a big screen .On the way back I got talking to two guys about horror in general and more specifically , the slasher genre that we know and love .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This was pretty much the same amount that they had spent on its development .It was a fantastic bit of business for the media giant however as it went on to make over 20 million dollars in VHS sales .If you have a copy on VHS , then keep hold of it as it may be worth something in years to come .The rare director 's cut version that I watched this time around was a rough quality bootleg and is quite different from the other one that I have on the Sony label .I know that I am quite a generous critic , but I actually think that it plays much better and has a completely different tone due to it being what was initially intended .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I did n't note any suspense on the review that I wrote of this in 2001 , but there was most definitely the odd smidgen here .Although most of the stalking shots were directly lifted from Friday the 13th parts 1 and 2 , Preston does chuck in the odd good idea .I especially liked the killer 's revelation scene where he bursts through the door and closes in on his prey .The way the director sets up the dynamics of the shot and the distance , which makes the cowering victim seem so small in comparison is no less than brilliant .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The script does well to create a false sense of security , because they mistake the identity of the madman and believe that they have stopped him early on .I was sure that I 'd picked our final girl when one of the bunnies started talking of her uneasy feelings and wanting to get off the island .But instead , she got quite gorily slaughtered , which was unusual and authentic .None of the cast ever really did anything else worth noting after this and for first timers , they did ok with what they were given .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What I appreciated was the fact that they were genuinely likeable and showed concern for their buddies when the trouble started .They do n't really do enough for you to want any of them not to get splattered , but at least they 're not conceited ignoramuses of the type we see so regularly in new age slasher flicks .The feature is still weakened by a bloated mid - section and incredibly bizarre dialogue , which switches from comedic to bewildering many times throughout .There are far too many pointless scenes that could have been either cut down or completely removed to have given the film a slicker runtime .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is somewhat frustrating that the killer seems to take forever to get his butt in gear and when he does , the murders are edited so choppily that they 're tough to make out .There is some goo , but it 's not really shown for enough time to be appreciated and therefore seems pretty pointless .It 's also hilariously non - politically correct with lines such as , \" Joe 's a little bit retarded and ca n't speak , but if you need anything , just ask him and he 'll get it for you . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nice .Honeymoon Horror is a poorly put together movie , but looks much better here than in the most common print available .Preston has said that the production was so awkward that most of his ideas were devoured by the lack of budget and the film does look shoddy and cheap .For a slice of regional filmmaking with a cool maniac though , it at least deserves to be seen .One thing that I forgot to mention .What a crap place to have a honeymoon ;) .Oh Tulisa Tulisa .A couple of months ago I posted a review of Nine Lives here on the site .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well here we have Demons Never Die , one of the few slasher flicks produced in 2011 .Ok so there 's no Gucci bag clenching heiresses in sight , but it does include a walk on appearance from Tulisa Contostavlos aka the new Cheryl Cole .( Just before finishing this review , I noticed she also has a sex tape floating about ) .Hands up who watches X Factor ?Come on boys , you 're only lying to yourself if you say no .Not many people know this , but I 've had an action packed life so far and I once got through a couple of auditions for the big X.

{"text": "Was it really that good ?Heeeell yeah !Anyway back to the film , or kind of .So Tulisa 's success as the Cheryl replacement on the aforementioned program has pushed her celebrity status up a few thousand notches and Arjun Rose ( cool name ) has capitalised on that timing to get her in a bit part here .Did she improve sales amongst teeny - boppers ?I would say probably yes .Does she improve the movie in any way outside of eye candy ?I would definitely say no .Funnily enough she grew up in the same part of London as me and we obviously both come from ' other ' European heritage , which is noticeable by our ( not so ) ' strong British names ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But the thing is that by that point we are left with a bunch of cardboard cut out personalities and no one really to bond to .Demons is obviously heavily inspired by Wes Craven 's Scream and includes a multitude of references .Many of them reach beyond the realms of just ' inspiration ' in to flagrant cut , copy and paste territory .For a genre that has survived on its ability to self reference , this is all acceptable if it 's handled correctly .Rose 's script lacks charm however and the wit to accompany its lack of authenticity and energy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As slasher movies are not renowned for their strengths in dramatics , complexity in plotting or philosophical messages , they can only really aim for two emotions .The first and most obvious is fear - everybody loves a good scare .The only other option is to make the film as camp as possible and give the audience something to enjoy in a more humorous way .Demons however gets lost in its attempt to convey a message that a ) we do n't understand and b ) we do n't give a damn about and takes itself far too seriously to be fun .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I saw some positive reviews floating around before I picked this up myself , but I am guessing that they were posted by crew members as a form of marketing , because what I saw was pretty irredeemable .I mean , what 's the moral of the story ?What 's the point ?Do n't commit suicide because a maniac will come and kill you ?I would n't care about the lack of logic if it at least had something , anything to cover up the obvious amateurism .I grew up in the kind of areas that this film attempts to convey .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In 2007 , his psychological thriller , Caregiver was one of the best B - movies of that year and the light hearted Dewitt and Maria from 2010 displayed a previously unseen ability for creating warmth and positivity in a screenplay .Whatever your opinion on his filmography , it must be said that he makes the most of the resources that are given to him .It 's always an argument that possibly even someone like David Lynch would struggle on a budget of $ 20,000 .Perhaps his most recognised piece is Dead Girls from 1989 .Not only is it a noted stalk and slash flick , but it is also one of the few heavy metal horrors from the peak period .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The characters are also laughably developed to the point of being infuriating .Each one is conceited , shallow and it does n't help that they are given dialogue that seems to have been written by a rebellious fourteen year - old .There 's a lot of vulgar swear words and talk about ' ass kicking ' and gags that only the aforementioned teenager would find amusing .The killer reminds me of the nut job from Honeymoon Horror in terms of his appearance , but even that forgettable entry from the early eighties would wipe the floor in terms of entertainment levels with this half - hearted throwaway .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One thing that is totally unforgivable however is that Sawblade feels like its been pushed together and rushed out the door with minimal effort from those involved and it does n't even make an attempt to cover up the fact .Towards the end of the runtime there 's not just one , but two silly twists and although the first is totally predictable , the second is mind boggling and laughable .The killer works his was through a large number of victims , but the obvious lack of budget means that the effects are expectedly cruddy .On the plus side , things move along quite quickly and you 'll never get bored .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
