{"text": "Indeed , the plot ir relatively patchy , but it holds a few avant - garde topics , namely the human expansion and environemental concerns .The end of the movie is particularly poignant with the scene of that modern mansion exploding under an early form of Floyd 's Careful With That Axe , Eugene .Even 40 years later , that scene still sends chills down my spine .Aside that finale for the rest of the music 's plece in the movie , it 's a lot less noticeable , partly due to the difference between the soundtrack presenting the entire \" songs \" when the movie featured only bits and extracts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The second disc is somehow interesting because of the Love Scene 's several trials , both from Grateful Dead 's Jerry Garcia and Floyd 's runs .In some ways , it 's kind of too bad Floyd lost that \" bid \" as well , but history wo n't be remade .If the Dead / Garcia pieces and the Kaleidscope ( US group ) songs are relevant pure psychedelia , the Floyd pieces are even more relevant .They 're sonically somewhere in between the More Soundtrack and Ummagumma 's live disc .Sorry if this reads more like a review of the movie rather than the soundtrack , but this new \" expanded \" reissue is not really more interesting than the original vinyl version that I 'd borrowed from a frend in the mid-70 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
