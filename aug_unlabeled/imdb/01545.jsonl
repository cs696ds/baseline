{"text": "5 Responses to The Downfall of the Movie - Going Experience . 1 ) Patrick Fabian may be the scariest person on screen today .We were ingrained to fear him after he predator - ed poor Kelly in Saved by the Bell : The College Years .THEN , he continued to have sketchy roles on so many television programs as murderers , murder suspects , adulterers , and the like ( Pushing Daisies , Veronica Mars , Big Love , and so many more ) .Warning : Apparently , he 's in an episode of Aaron Sorkin 's new show , The Newsroom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "BUT , I think there are other easier fixes , which for one reason or another , I 've automatically adapted with in order to still maintain the moviegoing experience , which is still one of my favorite things to do .Attending a movie ( even a bad one ) in a multiplex is still one of my all - time favorite things to do ; it 's practically therapeutic for me whenever I 'm stressed , anxious , or exhausted from life .It really is magical .Now , I do n't go to the movies nearly as much as I used to ( adult life , hooray ! ) , but when I do go , it 's still just as magical as when I was a little kid going to the $ 1.50 movie theater in Memphis or the early morning summer kids showings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "IF I do , I see them at a less crowded movie theater , during an off - hour , etc .Most of the time , I see a movie several weeks after it 's come out when it is inevitably much less crowded and more chill .This maintains the classic movie - going experience that you yearn for from yesteryear .Is it perfect ?No .But it 's pretty darn close .So do n't give up on the movies .Adapt a bit .Find that magical moment once again , that hooks you into the movies ... even if you do n't go very often , make the ones you do go see count .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
