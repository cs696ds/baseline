{"text": "When Sean Connery opted out of the James Bond role , the 007 series took a tumble .George Lazenby 's On Her Majesty 's Secret Service did respectable business , but fear for the franchise brought Connery back for Diamonds Are Forever while Danjaq decided how to reinvent Bond for the 1970s .The result was 1973 's Live and Let Die , which confirmed 007 's turn toward comedy .New Bond Roger Moore already had a strong association with secret agent work on Television , and was considered a master at straight - faced quips .Screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz had apparently been chosen to pen Diamonds are Forever because of his script for The Sweet Ride , a 1968 movie set in Las Vegas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Bond fights gay assassins on a pleasure cruise and grapples with lesbian killer - girls in a desert hideaway .Blofeld appears in drag .Live and Let Die continues the trend of self - spoofery . ...\" I 'm just being disarming , dear . \" The original Bond diet of intrigue and danger has been jettisoned in favor of a series of cartoon adventures and chases .Bond gets caught in revolving caf\u00e9 tables and booths that drop like elevators through the floor .Because Roger Moore is n't very physically adept or graceful in motion , the major set pieces have him piloting vehicles that perform all the action .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By the time we get to the main set piece , a speedboat chase in a Louisiana bayou , Live and Let Die has lowered 007 to the level of a Roadrunner cartoon .The action is often spectacular , especially those awesome boat jumps .Mankiewicz comes up with some good Buster Keaton - style sight gags , such as the wedding party demolished by the grass - hopping speedboats .The new direction is funny and exciting , but it abandons most of what made James Bond 007 unique .Roger Moore 's Bond is essentially a clown .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The bad guys are all black , from the fat henchman Whisper ( Earl Jolly Brown ) to the amusingly lethal Tee Hee ( Julius Harris ) with his mechanical claw .Tom Mankiewicz enlivens the movie with touchy content that the English producers could never navigate on their own .Instead of downplaying the film 's black villains , Mankiewicz lampoons America 's race divide with a wholesale parody of the Blaxploitation craze .In print , the movie reads like a provocation .Strutting around as the epitome of class - conscious England , Bond sleeps with Gloria Hendry 's Rosie Carver as casually as he beds the first scene 's Miss Caruso ( Madeline Smith ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Bond outwits them only half the time .At the top of the heap is Kananga , a \" respectable \" diplomat with a secret identity as Mr. Big ( the great Yaphet Kotto ) , a brutal drug baron .The racist politics favor the prejudices of right - wing Brits : Even though Kananga / Big rules a Caribbean island , the inference is that black politics are a sham and that the UK 's newly independent colonies need her paternal governance .On the side of the blacks is magic , in the form of Solitaire ( Jane Seymour ) a beautiful fortuneteller in the employ of Mr. Big .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This gives the movie a good reason to claim that Mr. Big has never slept with Solitaire , thus maintaining racist standards .Of course , it 's perfectly acceptable for the black Rosie to be bedded by Bond .It would seem that Solitaire would be an ideal planning assistant for \" M \" back in London , but Bond has no trouble \" curing \" her of her prognostic talents .When the show ends , Solitaire is just another ordinary conquest , ready for the 007 Home for Cast - Off Girl Friends .The fun comes when Bond interacts with Mr. Big 's hoodlum minions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Bond may get the best of them , but as he 's just a clown , the joke 's really on him .Yaphet Kotto was very proud of his opportunity to play a bigger - than - life Bond villain ; a starring role in a James Bond film is a big step up from the usual grindhouse opportunities .Black moviegoers loved Live and Let Die .I remember the audience uproar of approval for one particular exchange drowning out the soundtrack for at least half a minute : .James Bond : \" There seems to be some mistake .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Mr. Big : \" Names is for tombstones , baby !Y'all take this honkey out and waste him ! \"Urban blacks even loved the film 's Sheriff J. W. Pepper character , an exaggerated Southern cracker who talks like a moron and provides an escape valve for resentment .When his prowl car is ripped in two by an airborne speedboat , Pepper becomes hysterical , claiming that \" Black Russians \" are invading his Parish .Pepper is played by New York actor Clifton James , who was noted for sensitive roles as social workers and counselors in movies like Lilith and David and Lisa .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sheriff Pepper proved so popular that he returned in The Man with the Golden Gun and even made an appearance in Mankiewicz 's Superman II .The Blaxploitation humor may be liberating , but the Voodoo segments prove that Live and Let Die is still racist at heart .The rituals are as ' primitive ' and ' savage ' as the rites in xenophobic Hammer films like The Stranglers of Bombay .Solitare is tied to an altar like Ann Darrow in King Kong , playing out the old rape fantasy .Bond wades into the cowering Voodoo cult , shooting down blacks with his chrome pistol ... it 's Sax Rohmer and H. Rider Haggard all over again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Voodoo tricks and magical appearances of Baron Samedi ( Geoffrey Holder ) are far too elaborate to be stage fakery .The first thing we hear about Baron Samedi is that he ca n't be killed .Black audiences were clearly pleased when the film gives Samedi the literal last laugh .Had Roger Moore 's debut been a \" serious \" thriller , it might have incited riots .MGM 's Blu - ray of Live and Let Die is a crisp copy of 007 's eighth outing .If the film makes less of a visual impact than the earlier entries , it might be a matter of color design .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some of the exteriors in Harlem ( which looks like a rubble - strewn war zone ) exhibit prominent grain .After four Panavision releases , Live and Let Die shrinks Bond back down to matted widescreen , diminishing our expectations of lavish spectacle .The great score by George Martin , with its fantastic title theme by Paul McCartney and Wings , makes us wish that Martin wrote more movie music than he did .John Barry may be the king but Martin 's underscore is perfectly placed , bracketing key action moments rather than smothering them .The music is an exception to the tendency for rock scores to date badly ; the title tune is a ode to transcendent violence and anarchy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All of the extras from the DVD Ultimate Editions have been retained but nothing is new .A 1973 interview piece is present in a pretty ragged form ; it was heavily raided for bites to put in the main Making - Of Docu .Also included is a half - hour UK variety show from 1964 in which Roger Moore appears as James Bond , with Millicent Martin .The humor is obvious and dreadful , and Moore 's skit interpretation of the role is pretty embarrassing .His suave comedy underplaying in Live and Let Die is a distinct improvement .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Patrick Macnee 's narration is as smooth as ever .The clips in the remarkable Crocodile Outtake section have been retransferred in HD as well , giving us a better view of the ( insane ) stunt in which a man hops , skips and jumps across the backs of several very irate reptiles .Savant watched Live and Let Die by driving to the house of an understanding friend and playing it on his newer Blu - ray machine ; it would n't even load up on my Sony BDP S300 .Ten days after street date , Sony is offering a firmware upgrade .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Mission Dossier : Inside Live and Let Die , On Set with Roger Moore .Packaging : Keep case Reviewed : November 3 , 2008 .DVD Savant Text \u00a9 Copyright 2008 Glenn Erickson Go BACK to the Savant Main Page .Reviews on the Savant main site have additional credits information and are more likely to be updated and annotated with reader input and graphics .Return to Top of Page When I picked up Goobers ! from the Redbox kiosk , I did so with a resigned attitude .As I venture through all of these Full Moon features , so many of them are less than awesome and so far their films for kids ( under the Moonbeam label ) have been some of the more trying entries in the series .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It had apparently been a Blockbuster exclusive release and was edited down to a paltry fifty - three minutes .So at long last in 2012 , Full Moon has unleashed these mystery monsters onto the unknowing public in their uncut , eighty - one minute glory .While you might expect this to lead to a film filled with fat that needs to be trimmed , Goobers ! is anything but .It remained funny and entertaining throughout for this B - Movie fan , and if you 're similarly minded I think you 'll enjoy it as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Tommy is the new kid on the set , and his curiosity about special FX and puppets leads him to question how the goobers are manipulated and created .He is told in no uncertain terms to mind his own business , but ever the intrepid sleuth , Tommy bores a hole in his dressing room wall with a pocket knife ( do n't try this at home , kiddos ! ) and observes Mike and the goobers playing poker and smoking together .Mike is anything but kind to the goobers and keeps them locked in the magical trunk he stole from the evil Queen Mara .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They vow to come to Earth and reclaim what is rightfully theirs , and so Mara disguises herself as an Executive Producer to buy the studio and all the props ( including her magical chest of Tron ) .Queen Mara and her goon Groon have a thick vibe of over - the - top Power Rangers villains , and they were immensely enjoyable .You mileage will vary of course , but I loved them .Mara 's lack of knowledge of Earth customs also allows the film instances to educate the viewers on the definitions of such things as : FBI , SEC , contract , interest , and binding agreements .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The TV show 's titles are newly created for this rebranded edition , as are some of the magic FX .These are all comparable with Full Moon 's recent uses of CG in their films and done fairly well in terms of the budget here .The scene early on where Captain Mike tells Tommy the rules has a few times when he mentions the goobers , but every time he says \" goobers \" it 's pretty hilariously dubbed in to remove any mention of their original name , the mystery monsters .The visual editing is quick to cut to Tommy 's face every time the goobers are mentioned as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps Goobers ! will trick more people into renting the film than the title Mystery Monsters would , but at least for me , I 'd have watched it regardless .The original title is still visible throughout too , on the ship 's sails and the dressing room doors , but these details will definitely go over the heads of younger viewers who manage to make it through the opening scene .The goobers themselves are pretty awful , and by that I mean fantastic .Squidgy is the best looking of the three , with his close - ups being a guy in full facial makeup as opposed to the poorly articulated puppets the other two get .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Esmerelda goes through the whole movie waving an arm inconsistently and barely moving her mouth while mumbling out some unintelligible nothings .She has a wonderful moment when she uses Tommy 's mother 's makeup and stares into the mirror plaintively as the camera slowly pulls back .She looks deep into her own eyes and then puts her head on the table , all the while mumbling incoherently .She is the washed - up actress stereotype in interdimensional puppet form , and I loved it .Perhaps Blop is a Cookie Monster that just took a wrong turn .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Blop only has a few lines , but they 're all through a thick , Blopian accent that 's hard to understand and simple - minded .That being said , I loved him as well .The first half of the film is the standard Full Moon film with everything dragged out longer than it needs to be .Most films will have some details spelled out through the editing , but in Full Moon films , these minute details are almost always exaggerated and expanded to fill up the runtime of the film .There 's a lot more story here than in their recent offerings , but compared to a mainstream kid 's film , this one is pretty threadbare .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But that 's OK , because the last twenty minutes are nearly pure action and intrigue , as the kids finally team up and take on Queen Mara and Groon .The finale is rather clever and fun to watch , making me wish that the entire film was as exciting .But I do n't want to be too harsh to this awful movie , I had a grand time watching it .I usually go into the Moonbeam films with very reserved expectations , but Goobers ! was entertaining throughout and got me to laugh out loud a number of times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I laughed , I cried , I thoroughly enjoyed myself watching this .I 'm sure that indicates some screws are loose in the old brain , but I do n't care .Goobers ! is absolute trash B - Movie fun .How can I not enjoy a kid 's movie that features a torture scene involving knives and brass knuckles ?I 'll leave you with the best quote in the film , as Queen Mara signs the contract and seals it with a drop of blood from her finger cut by \" the sacrificial blade \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
