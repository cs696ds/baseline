{"text": "BP Unfiltered .Classifying Your Photos of Baseball Prospectus 2014 .Many of you have bought Baseball Prospectus 2014 , for which we 're very grateful .But that 's not what this post is about .This post is about the smaller ( but still substantial ! ) subset of you who have not only bought the book , but also sent a picture of your purchase to BP 's official Twitter account .But it 's still nice to receive your reminders that we did n't dream the darn thing .Look at enough of these pictures , and you 'll notice that they fall into a number of easily identifiable categories .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Basic Book Pic The most common kind of annual photo , often taken in the endorphin - filled moments immediately after pulling the book out of the box , with no concern for composition .The text usually says something about going off the grid for a while , and the picture includes nothing but the book ( usually just the cover ) , as if to say , \" Behold , I have bought this .\" It 's a proof of purchase that looks like the stock photo from Amazon with way worse lighting .( But we still love that you bought our book . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The On the Road Pic A close cousin of the Basic Book Pic , indistinguishable except for the setting - which may or may not be a moving vehicle .As a native New Yorker , I do n't drive , but this seems like something that could lead to a ticket .The Artistic Arrangement Pic If Annie Leibovitz were to take a photo of an annual , it would look like one of these .There 's the black - and - white look with a canted frame , deftly balanced by beer and a baseball : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It 's not like you need it .Probably time to de - clutter .Doubt the book is worth anything anyway .There were so many copies made . )The Girlfriend Pic The only photo in which an adult other than the picture taker appears .This one says , \" I bought this book , but I still have social skills .\" It also makes me wonder who she called first when she found out what the Wacha projection was .The Anti - Girlfriend Pic The polar opposite of the last category .If anyone needs you , you 'll be in the bathroom , with the book .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The efficient book - photo - taker fits multiple books into the frame of one photo .There 's a lot of overlap between the two groups , which for one moment brought BP and Mike Tyson together .The Kid Pic We 're all for .brainwashing teaching your kids to care about baseball analysis at an early age , but we wonder whether that 's all that 's going on here .Sure , maybe your daughters were pre - K classmates of Julio Urias and wanted to peek at his PECOTA , but could it be that you 're also angling for a retweet from the big softy who runs the BP account ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Full index : VCL 1101 - 1001 .Heartbeeps : ( John Williams )The lovable 1981 Allan Arkush film Heartbeeps was a rare opportunity to see Andy Kaufman on the big screen .He and Bernadette Peters star as obsolete robots in the future , awaiting their demise in a company warehouse until they decide to break loose by stealing a van and searching for a life on their own .Other malfunctioning robots go in pursuit , though a happy ending awaits as the two primary robots discover the concept a love and , after building a child out of spare parts , retire to a blissful existence together in a junk yard .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When an average movie - goer ( or even a film music collector ) thinks about John Williams soundtracks of the early 1980 's , Heartbeeps is n't exactly what comes to mind .But as is the case with every established composer , a successful collaboration with a director or producer for a major film will often lead to a subsequent collaboration on a smaller , more personal project .Such was the case with Heartbeeps .Williams had worked with the producer , Michael Phillips , on Close Encounters of a Third Kind , and when this lighthearted Phillips comedy was being assembled in 1981 , Williams accepted the scoring job .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For the reason of a lack of interest from an ambivalent population of fans , Heartbeeps was never released into the digital medium until long after all of Williams ' other post-Star Wars era scores had debuted on CD .With the resurrection of the once popular Var\u00e8se Sarabande CD Club in 2001 , the score was finally pressed onto CD to , quite frankly , the praise of only a few Williams collectors .Unfortunately , as noted by more than a few film score experts , soundtracks such as Heartbeeps do n't go un - pressed on CD without good reason .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nor is it particularly listenable .Williams approached the very short film with a touch of comedy and a more pronounced use of electronics than in any other score of his career .While there are tender orchestral performances of especially the score 's love theme , the tone of the work is dominated by the extremely simplistic , MIDI - like electronic style chosen specifically to augment to robots ' somewhat comedic and cheesy existence .Also at work is a sense of jazz that existed throughout the composer 's early years .If you had a strong opinion about \" Johnny \" Williams ' days of writing music like A Guide for the Married Man and Not With My Wife You Do n't ! , then you 'll probably have an equally strong opinion about the underlying comedy elements in Heartbeeps .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As such , for fans of the orchestrally complex Williams styles of the early-1970 's and beyond , Heartbeeps will be one of his few post-Star Wars scores that is barely listenable , if at all .He intentionally produced electronics that merged with jazzy , contemporary instrumentation to produce a psychotic form of sci - fi disco .The programming is purposefully dumb , as to enhance the comedy and silliness of the film 's content .The themes are trademark Williams on paper , but once fleshed out with the prancing electronics chosen for the recording , the music is a mesh of embarrassingly trite and ridiculous sounds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After four or five of the numerous performances of that theme , the fast forward button on your CD player will be a welcome sight .Even the orchestral closing of the theme in \" Crimebuster Always Gets His Man , \" which comically mirrors the hits at the end of The Fury , does n't please the ears .These include little motifs that would later be expanded upon for his future classics .In the end , this is the kind of music you expect to hear in a Woody Allen film , or maybe a television cartoon , and resembles very little of the composer that Digital Age film music fans know and love .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What few moments Williams uses to concentrate on orchestral harmony can not make up for the deafeningly irritating electronics , marking Heartbeeps as a surprisingly weak score to present as the very first entry in the second generation of Var\u00e8se Club releases .The original Var\u00e8se Sarabande CD Club began circa 1988 and finished roughly five years later , highlighting a movement made by the label to press limited editions of CDs in a series parallel to their commercial products .The final few Club CDs sat in the label 's warehouse for ten years before selling out , so it is no surprise that the original series , despite some excellent successes ( namely The ' Burbs by Jerry Goldsmith ) , fizzled to an unglamorous end .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All one has to do is read Townson 's liner notes to grasp his overwhelming respect and joy for this score .It is indeed a fascinating score to study and even appreciate , but it is far from a coherent listening experience , and any Williams collector purchasing this album blindly will likely be disappointed the tone of the music .It 's hard to fault Williams for producing the score that was necessary for this film , but given the subject matter , Heartbeeps is a potentially no - win prospect .Many older fans , however , maintain a strong affection for the work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Nobody ever really knew what to make of Andy Kaufman .That was the whole point .Even in his closest approach to mainstream palatability , playing Latka Gravas on \" Taxi \" for five years , he was an enigma- his character was an immigrant with no discernable country of origin , and his performance was a broadly caricatured stereotype of no recognizable ethnicity .Things only got weirder outside the banal oasis of prime - time sitcom television , too .Kaufman occasionally performed incognito as his own opening act , posing as a Las Vegas lounge singer by the name of Tony Clifton , in which guise he would attempt to pick fights with both the audience and his headlining alter - ego .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kaufman launched a pro - wrestling career of his own lasting some three years , but insisted upon grappling only with women for most of that time- and generally women with no formal training , at that !His stage shows and appearances on television programs like \" Fridays \" and \" Saturday Night Live \" rarely featured anything that we Earthlings would recognize as jokes , although they were generally billed as either sketch or stand - up comedy .And through it all , Andy Kaufman was never , ever funny .That , so far as it 's possible to determine now , was also the whole point .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you were entertained , it would not be directly by anything Kaufman did or said , but rather by the bafflement of those among your fellow spectators who had n't yet given up trying to get the joke .That being the case , you kind of have to question his motives for appearing in Heartbeeps .This is the kind of movie where you have to look hard for something to appreciate , so let me start out by drawing attention to Heartbeeps ' charmingly restrained notion of futurism .Things in this world look and function much the way they did in 1981 , except that there are robots all over the place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sometimes these complex machines break down , of course , and that 's where Charlie ( Randy Quaid , from The Wraith and Independence Day ) and Max ( Kenneth McMillan , of Salem 's Lot and The Stepford Wives ) come in .These two work in the warehouse for a robot repair company , taking deliveries of damaged or defective droids , and keeping track of them until such time as the mechanics get around to them .All three robots are exhibiting the same unusual fault ; they 're behaving as if they have wills of their own , disregarding direction from their owners and spontaneously performing all manner of unauthorized actions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Either that or Charlie and Max have no more capacity for independent thought than their mechanical charges are supposed to .The thing is , the mysterious malfunction responsible for the droids ' autonomy has also left them capable of experiencing human - like emotions .In Val 's case , Aqua makes him feel interesting , intelligent , and virile , with the result that the two of them are making goo - goo optics at each other come nightfall .Eventually , Val asks Aqua out on what presumably passes for a date among robots , inviting her to help him \" gather information \" on the trees which are visible just below the horizon from their perch in the warehouse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Catskill asks to tag along ( or comes as close to asking as can be managed with no means of communication other than terrible Borsht Belt one - liners ) , and the next thing we know , the three droids are joyriding around the countryside in a stolen delivery van .Val is an atrocious driver , however , and he wipes out the van long before they reach the grove they ostensibly meant to study .Yes , good call .Heartbeeps is indeed setting up Val and Aqua not merely as each other 's love interests , but as parental figures for Phil as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Start by picturing Number 5 from the Short Circuit movies .Now cross him with VINCENT from The Black Hole , shrink him to the size of a moped , and have him speak in R2-D2-like torrents of beeps .Finally , imagine that the firm commissioned to build the prop for the movie was Fisher - Price .That 's Phil for you .( Clearly this is n't a William Girdler grizzly we 're dealing with here ... ) .Aboard that chopper , incidentally , are Charlie and Max , whose boss ( Richard B. Schull , of Sssssss and The Pack ) is furious at them for allowing three of the robots to wander out of the warehouse on their shift .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Meanwhile , yet a fourth malfunctioning robot- a massively armed police drone called Crimebuster 00719- overhears the humans in the repair shop discussing Val , Aqua , and Catskill 's vanishing act , and charges off to bring the fugitives to justice .Crimebuster 00719 is easily my favorite thing about Heartbeeps , and not just because his presence in the film introduces some triflingly remote possibility that at least one of the protagonists will wind up blasted to tiny bits by the time the credits roll .Also , it looks exactly like a cross between a Dalek and a 1975 Buick Riviera- which , as I 'm sure you can imagine , led the audience to break out into giddy choruses of \" Exterminate !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "whenever Crimebuster rolled into view at B - Fest 2010 .Back at the beginning of the review , I raised the question of whether Andy Kaufman recognized going in that Heartbeeps was destined for failure .It would not have taken an exceptionally perceptive person to make that prediction .Except for Crimebuster 00719 's scenes and the all - too - brief moments when Paul Bartel is on the screen , this movie has very , very little going for it .Kaufman and a thoroughly de - sexed Bernadette Peters simply wander around not being funny for an hour and a quarter in shockingly poor robot makeup by Stan Winston , who was obviously having a succession of off - days while Heartbeeps was in production .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What is surprising about Catskill , however , is that he figures in a scene suggesting that Kaufman was n't the only one who might have been approaching Heartbeeps as a prank on the audience .As I said , the robots are running very low on power as the movie nears its conclusion , all of them operating in the range of 3 - 4 % .All , that is , except for Catskill , who mysteriously still has a 43 % charge in his power module .In what I 'm sure we 're supposed to take as a touching gesture of self - sacrifice , Catskill switches power units with Phil , enabling Val and Aqua 's \" baby \" a fighting chance to reach the repair shop and receive his function programming .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
