{"text": "It 's gone from theaters now , but this type of film demands to be seen on the big screen .It 's similar to a horror movie .You 've got to laugh and get grossed out with the crowd .Slapstick pain is not funny when it inflicts more pain on the viewer than the victimized character .Nothing new here worthy of cinematic note , but one richly deserved point for the odd genuinely funny moment .Let 's get this straight , Jackass is just not comedy , no part of it is clever , witty or satirical .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Overall a very big disaapointment as I thought they would develop the idea of jackass into sometime much better .The Jackass crew is back in a sequel that ups the gross - out and pain factors .This makes for a movie that is much harder to watch and because of that some of the more disturbing stunts are more horrifying than funny .Still , there are plenty of laughs to be had here and I was laughing just as much as I was gagging .I do n't think I 've seen that many scrotums in a non - porno ever .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I love it .The only stuff that made me really cringe was the choreographed beginning and ending of the movie- that was pretty dumb .But some of the clips totally made up for it .The most inane , preposterous , pointless , over - hyped and unfunny movie I 've seen in a long time .Even if you do n't try to take it seriously you ca n't find any humour present here .At least if you think is funny watching grown men behaving like they were 5 years old , this film is not for you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
