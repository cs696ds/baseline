{"text": "They could have just crammed every character into it and it would have ended up being a complete mess , but here they have the perfect balance between the Simpson family and making sure all the other favourites get a look in .I love the look of the film , the added budget really gives the movie a polish and a sheen .Whether it be with the extra shading or the cgi cel - shaded backgrounds that really do look incredible when they move and spin around .Everything just has an added bit of quality about it to differentiate it from a regular episode .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you 're a fan of the Simpson brand of comedy it is hilarious .I ca n't remember a film where I have laughed constantly from beginning to end , my cheeks were sore afterwards .Not every gag is going to make you rupture your appendix but they 'll make you giggle , and none of the jokes fall flat .The whole audience I watched it with were having an excellent time .After about half way through I thought to myself \" I hope they keep this up for the whole film \" , and they did !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I 'd place The Simpsons Movie third in my list of favourite TV - cartoons - that - have - been - made - into - films after South Park and Beavis & Butthead .I do n't think the film 's ever going to live up to everyone 's expectations but it 's definitely good fun , I laughed my ass off , and at the end of the day what more can you ask for from a film like this ?P.S. - Tom Hanks cameo is really funny stuff , especially his little bit during the credits .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They ca n't all be good reviews ... can they ?So the first question is , is the film old - school classic Simpsons or modern - day average entertainment Simpsons ?Well , it 's a bit of both ( Homer 's still a bumbling buffoon as per the later seasons ) but with the quality results thankfully erring toward the former .A quick synopsis - Lake Springfield is at risk of turning into a very nasty mess of toxic waste thanks to everything from the nuclear waste dumped there to Fat Tony 's dead bodies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The EPA - led by Albert Brooks ' underused villain Russ Cargill - use this as an excuse to throw a giant dome around Springfield and removing any knowledge of its existence .Naturally the townspeople revolt against the family leading to them having to learn to bond together , save Springfield and ... well , a bit more learning how to bond together .That 's about the first half hour and by far the best in terms of laughs , although it 's mostly just a series of skits for 30 minutes .It helps set up the world of The Simpsons fine but the jokes rarely seem part of a bigger plot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a shame then when the plot moves away from them as the fate of Springfield and its residents is only glimpsed every now and again .It does n't feel hugely epic and , just out of familiarity 's sake , it feels odd once it 's past the half way point to still be watching a Simpsons story , but it 's absolutely fine .The film also sticks with the show 's irreverent digs at society and there are a couple of attempts at post - modernism which work and make you wish for more .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fans will gripe ( no scenes inside the Kwiki Mart or Nuclear Power Station ?No Sideshow Bob ? ! ) about what they wanted in the film but did n't get - after 18 years you 're not going to get everything - but the writers and producers have done as good a job as they were going to do - better than they should considering the current seasons .It does just about feel like a film and it has more than enough laughs for you to pay to see it at a cinema .It 's not up to the level of South Park : Biggerl , Longer & Uncut - which remains a classic film even away from the TV series - but it 's a worthy addition to the Simpsons legacy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
