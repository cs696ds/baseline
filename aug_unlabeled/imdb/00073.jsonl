{"text": "A COMPLETE list of my disc reviews .HTF Rules / 2009 , 2010 , 2011 Film Lists .Saw Revenge of the Sith last night at New York 's Ziegfeld Theatre in DLP projection at the first exhibitor screening .It was supposed to be an exhibitor - only show , but from the looks of the audience , a lot of people gave their tickets away .Background : I loved Star Wars ( what is now known as Episode IV ) ; saw it at least 12 times in 1977 and 1978 .Rating : 10 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Rating : 8 .Did not like Return of the Jedi , saw it twice and then played it for two weeks at a theatre I managed - more than enough viewings .Rating : 5 .I thought Phantom Menace was okay , saw it twice but it 's too long and over - plotted ; in retrospect , Jar Jar Binks was the best thing about it .Rating : 5 .Found Attack of the Clones to be pretty awful - a very dull action - packed film with no heart .Barely made it through a second showing ( the things parents will do for their kids ! )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Revenge of the Sith - spoiler - free review .The story is now finished - or at least it 's now brought full - circle by George Lucas .I 'm not unhappy at finally seeing it , but this movie suffers many of the same faults as the last two - it 's wildly over - plotted for what is a simple story and spends too much time with characters that are uninteresting .There are moments when the film comes to life , particularly in the last 30 minutes or so , but there is no forward momentum as it lurches from planet to planet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The arc of Padme and Anakin is the main focus , and Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen ( less wooden this time ) do their best with the awkward dialogue .What does work very well is the relationship between Obi - Wan and Anakin , I think it 's Ewan McGregor 's performance that keeps it interesting as you do get a sense of genuine regret and loss from his character .Christopher Lee ( the best actor in these last two installments - he knows exactly how to play a larger - than - life character in a fantasy film ) is wasted in his small role as Count Dooku .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The rest of the cast is fine given the limitations of their characters .Technically , the film is virtually flawless .The frame is constantly filled with moving objects , to the point of distraction .The digital video cinematography is better than Clones , but there are still scenes that have a soft and flat look , which I have to guess is a deliberate stylistic choice .The John Williams music is grand and sweeping , but is spoiled by the director 's insistence on spotting the film with music heard in the previous films .Listening to several scenes on the CD shows that Lucas had Williams replace some newly written music with new recordings featuring \" Duel of the Fates \" from Phantom Menace .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nobody 's cheering for Mace Windu or Bail Organa .The best new character is the evil General Grievous , though I 'll admit I was waiting for his subordinates Captain Calamity and Major Disaster to show up .Yes it 's \" darker \" ( a term I 'm growing to dislike ) than the last two .Yes it resolves the story .Yes it looks and sounds great .Yes there are some moments to cheer and boo .But I 'm still left with an unsatisfied feeling .Rating : 6 out of 10 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The DLP projection was pretty good - it 's still lacking the depth and sharpness of film but is getting better .Since this was a digital production , I 'll bet the DLP showings are better than the film prints - see it on the biggest and loudest screen you can .Episode 1 - 7/10 Episode 2 - 2/10 Episode 4 - 8/10 Episode 5 - 10/10 Episode 6 - 7/10 .Episode 3 - 3/10 .I did n't go in to Ep3 with high expectations , although I hoped it would be an entertaining watch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Here are the few positive things I can say about the movie .- Ewan 's performance was good , considering the horrendous dialog - The special effects were great - Lightsaber battles ( sort of .... ) .Well ... that 's about it .While the opening and closing of the film are action packed , it 's quite boring to watch .The lightsaber battles have their moments , but are overly choreographed .The plot is borderline ridiculous , with Anakin 's turn to the dark side making absolutely no sense .Sorry , but I just did n't buy it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have to disagree with Peter as I did n't feel that General Grevious was a good villain .He could have easily been removed from the movie without affecting anything .Gary Oldman will probably be happy he was unable to do the voice acting for the role .The sad part about all of this is I 'll still end up buying this on DVD .Why ?Because I could n't stand having episodes 1 , 4 , 5 and 6 while missing 2 and 3 .I 'll probably see it again with some friends when it opens to the public , but I doubt my feelings will change ( my score for Ep2 dropped each time I watched it ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anakin is selfish and wants to keep or consume everything he loves ( note his reaction to Obi - Wan after Padme is injured ) .So he turns on the Jedi because of her and he joins the Sith because of her .I do n't know what was difficult to accept about that .Everything he does seems to indicate that he does n't believe that he can afford to lose another person he loves .Also , Grievous was a great villain .He reminded me of a vampirish android with a case of vanity .He is n't all that brave but when push comes to shove he jumps into the fight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Come on .Did you go into this movie trying to dislike it ?There was nothing boring about it .It was paced very well and we moved from action to action at a good speed .I also felt that the humor was turned up a tad during the opening and it worked for me .The ending was n't action packed so I do n't know where you got that from since the last 15 minutes is the Vader / Padme / twins stuff .If you mean the ending action then again , what movie were you watching ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I ca n't imagine anything else .The acting was much better than in Attack of the Clones and the dialogue far less campy than the last two prequels ( and for that matter , Return of the Jedi and A New Hope ) .McDiarmid steals the movie , followed by McGregor .I also felt that Christensen did a fantastic job and really owned the more dramatic scenes .He was a wonderful surprise for me .Here are my grades for the saga : .Episode 1 : 7/10 Episode 2 : 6/10 Episode 3 : 9/10 Episode 4 : 8/10 Episode 5 : 10/10 Episode 6 : 6/10 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This movie simply rocked ....The last hour of the film will just send chills down the fanboys spines ...Anakins turn was ( un)believable , and IMHO Palpatine stole the show .I truly believe Lucas Redeemed himself with the fans ...This 30 year old fanboy is in awe ....The second half of this movie just felt like vintage Star Wars .....It ties to Episode 4 perfectly ...The Dooku scene could have been a tad longer , but what the heck ..... .4 of 4 Stars ! ! !As Anakin layed on the black ash , with his legs cut off beneath him , you ca n't believe the anger and true emotion that engulfs him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He truely looked evil .First off , let me preface my review by saying I 'm in a real emotional place at the moment after having viewed this movie .As I stated in one of my other threads , Star Wars has influenced me in a multitude of ways including ( most importantly ) what career path to choose .It 's probably the first movie I ever saw and I remember coming home to watch it every single day after school .I memorized it backwards and forwards ... and I was n't even born when the first one came out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By the ability to be transported to a completely different world by artists and craftsman .And that is when I decided that is what I wanted to do with my life .Now onto the good stuff .Here are my reviews of the other films to see where I 'm coming from .Star Wars- 8 .Empire 9.5 .Jedi : 7 .Phantom : 4 .Clones : 6 .And now ...Revenge of the Sith .Mostly everything that I felt about this movie has been said already so I wo n't rehash it but will expand a bit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "From one moment to the next , it 's just pure unadulterated FUN .The characters are having fun .They 're relating to each other .The R2 bits are not NEARLY as stupid as people made them out to be and our audience was applauding at each one of them .Everyone seemed to be there to genuinely enjoy it ... and boy , did they .The pacing of this movie is furious .I was NEVER bored .Not once .You 're always waiting to see what happens next .Now , that 's not saying that there are n't some moments where you go \" ugh \" because that 's a lie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The weak points ?HANDS DOWN :Samual and Natalie .They 're both terrible and should never have been cast in these movies .I genuinely believe that they brought them down in some ways more than Jar Jar .The movie had it 's first \" bad acting \" moment when Samuel shows up .He 's just not good at all .And that 's all I have to complain about .I even liked Grevious .Nohthing to complain about there .Did n't look fake at all and did n't even mind his over the top line delivery nor the coughing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'll talk about my \" crying . \"Aside for shedding a tear at the beginning of the film , I have to say that the scene where the Emporer announces the \" order \" shook me up hard .I just started crying pretty hardcore .Seeing the troopers all stop and start slaughtering the Jedi is heart - wrenching .It 's done with a lot of skill and emotion .It 's one of the many moment in this movie that we 've been waiting to see .It happens very fast and just rips your heart out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Other highlights ... and another moment when I cried was when Yoda says goodbye to Chewbacca .He says goodbye and you almost feel like it 's George saying goodbye to you .The last 40 minutes of the film are sheer perfection .From the slaughter of the Jedi to the end is just absolutely amazing .Spellbinding .Some of the best scenes ( if possibly not THE best scenes ) in the entire Star Wars saga .I wo n't go on and on about it ... but everyone was captivated .The final scene with Anakin and Obi Wan is so utterly moving and gruesome .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's so much of what we do n't come to expect from Star Wars but at the same time , knew it would be coming .You want to look away .It 's really too much .And at the same time , you feel horrible ...ESPECIALLY when you see the terror on Anakin 's face as the mask is lowered .This is n't what he wants .As a HUGE HUGE HUGE John Williams fan , i would be remiss if I did n't comment on George 's great way of fucking up the score .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And again ... RE USE OF CUES FROM THE OTHER TWO MOVIES .The crash landing repeats anakin 's \" force theme \" from the end of Phantom Menace .There were other moments as well where music was re - used but that stuck out because I love that piece of music .The Duel of the Fates is DEFINITELY tracked in from Phantom Menace .No re - recording .It 's definitely the same .I know there are going to be a lot of Williams fans pissed about this as well they should .The end credits do not have the Throne Room Music .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I turned to a movie reviewer friend ( who actually got me the ticket and HATED Phantom and Clones ) and she actually REALLY liked it .She said it was MUCH closer to the other 3 than PM or AOTC .On the other side of me , I had two friends who really like star wars a lot and she was crying .Oddly enough , she made fun of me before the screening and could n't believe what she just saw .She said it was so NOT star wars and just was all at the same time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While we were joking around about it , the guy in front of me turned around and said that HE was crying as well .And we all bonded about our history with Star Wars as the final credits rolled .And just as the whole thing was ending ... i shed my last tear .The last frames of the last star wars film ... ever .I remember seeing PM at the same theater opening night and how angry some people were .They felt cheated .Some people were ok with it .Others were questioning it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "AOTC had a better reaction ... but there was still same sort of reactions .Sith , although it has a horribly downbeat ending , was sheer bliss .I did n't see a single person walking out of that theater without a smile on their face .People in the bathroom were just amazed .Someone said that they just do n't even know where to begin processing what they had just seen .My opinion of the prequels rests in moments .The Phantom Menace had a few great moments .Attack of the Clones gave us more .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But they are only that - moments .Sith opens in spectacular fashion , which to be honest , caught me off guard .I found myself thinking : All right ; I 'm listening , I 'm listening .Followed directly by : Please do n't let me down , please do n't let me down .Followed even closer by : Damn !First - The Good ( and there was plenty of it as the film progressed ! ) a ) Everyone will be relieved to know the dialogue is significantly better on this outing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As anyone who has heard me speak about the prequels knows already , this was my biggest fear for Sith .There were a few clunkers in there , but overall I felt absolutely satisfied .Some of Yoda 's lines were quite good indeed .I even wrote one line down to keep with me .On par with some of his wisdom from Empire .b )The Acting !All around the board it was way up .Hayden made some excellent choices ( a few odd ones , but nothing jarring ) .I found myself smiling along with him in many of the early scenes and I was surprised at how comfortable he looked .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For the first time in the prequels , I found Ewen 's ObiWan to be out of place , at least early on .He seemed less like a mentor and more like an ass .I realize ObiWan has a rebellious streak in him , but at the point in which the story takes place , he would have already grown out of it and even so , the way it was played just felt wrong .He turned it around when they moved on to the more serious material and Ewen still remains the best of the bunch when it 's all said and done .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unlike many of the other reviewers , I felt most of Ian 's performance was way over - the - top .I was actually shocked .There were moments of brilliance , but I 'd hoped for more with him .I found him to be more comical than chilling , particularly in Mace Duel and his unfortunate accident .c )The special effects .What more can be said ?Awesome .Really .You wo n't want to take your eyes off the screen during a single battle for fear of missing anything .Sometimes it 's a bit too much , though - distracting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just sit back and enjoy the ride .Oh baby - that Battle of the Heros !And make sure you check out the bottom right hand side of the screen after ObiWan and Anakin return from the opening battle .Really nice surprise .Second - The Bad . a ) Stupid Choices .I was trying to figure out why I was so frustrated with the first two prequels and I finally figured it out tonight .There were certainly some poor choices made in the Original Trilogy .Nothing jarring , but some things that I would have changed ( granted we all have our own ideas - it 's so subjective ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That is not the case here .With the prequels ( and I 'm afraid to say this includes Sith ) there have been stupid choices .For example .The Trade Federation are an Alien species .They could have any number of possible accents .So why did George go ahead and make them sound like they are straight out of a Godzilla movie ?Why ?Because he made a stupid choice .I 'm not going to go into what I thought those stupid choices were in Sith ; if you really want to know , send me an e - mail and I 'll get a list to you as soon as I can .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There were considerably less stupid moments in Sith than in the previous 2 prequels , but still they were there .b ) Editing .Dear Lord give someone else the controls .It was a strange balance of either rushing important moments or slowing down moments that could have been told quicker .It was almost as if Costanza 's opposite rule should have been evoked here .Let 's face it , George has never been known for his pacing so this really is n't any surprise .I just wish key moments , like Anakin 's turn to the dark side , had more meat to them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This was the case for many of those poignant events .c ) Grievous .Just should have been taken out of the film .In fact if he had been excised , there would have been more time to spend on the important moments .He was a cartoon character .Actually , he was kind of the prototypical bad guy in the old serials ( talks a good game but goes down real easy ! ) , so I guess Lucas kind of had a weird success there .Grievous was made out to be a real bad dude , but then was hacking like old man when he gets up in the morning during most of his scenes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And he was killed way too easily .All right - enough about him .d )The comedy of the first act was so out of place and felt very forced .R2 and the other droids did have a few moments that had me laughing out loud ( as did the entire audience ) but then it became too much - like George was trying too hard .Closing thoughts .I could go on for hours about this movie - just ask my wife .I helped her fall asleep tonight !I have to say I was definitely satisfied overall .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wanted to feel more for the characters , but I did n't , as has been the case throughout the prequel trilogy .When it comes down to it , there are 2 major differences between the OT and PT .We already touched on the \" stupid moments \" theory .But the other is heart .With Luke and Han and Leia , you rooted for them , you wanted them to succeed , to fall in love , to defeat the Empire .With the PT , I found a serious lack of soul .I felt like George wanted to show off his new toys ( and he has some really spectacular ones in his arsenal ! )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The movie opens with the most action of any previous Star Wars film .This intense scene lasts about 25 minutes and you simply do not have time to catch your breath .This is the most exciting opening to a Star Wars film ... the best of the 6 .After the dust settles from this epic opening ... the real plot begins ... and yes ... there is a plot .This movie is unlike any other Star Wars film .Aside from being the darkest by far , it is paced very differently ... it took some getting used to .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Once it starts ... you have to strap yourself in for the rest of the film ... because it is one hell of a ride and you can not catch up with your own thoughts .So many times I wanted to pause this movie and catch my breath , but of course I could n't ....This film is relentless .Yoda and Palpatine steal the show .Palpatine especially shines .... in many ways ... this is his movie .The problems I had with Yoda fighting Dooku in AOTC did not duplicate here .When we see Yoda in action in ROTS ... it is truly something special .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I also loved ... yes ... loved ...Samuel Jackson as Mace Windu .It took me a long time to warm up to the character , but I liked him in AOTC and I love him in this movie .His scene with Palpatine is truly amazing .It 's great stuff ... absolutely gripping .The dialogue is much improved this time , especially with the Anakin / Padme scenes .The delivery on the parts of Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman also were greatly improved .I did n't feel there were any flat deliveries with any of the cast .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are many plotholes and not every question is answered .There are problems with the editing as was the case in the two previous films .There are some scenes that go on for too long and some scenes ( and characters ) that are n't needed at all .So yes ... there are things to nit pick over , however unlike the two previous films ... the good far outweighs any bad .What I loved about this film ...I really loved , and the things I did n't care for , I can live with .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I spoke to one of them after the screening was over last night .To say something like \" if people hate this movie , they are lying \" is just asinine .I can see people hating this film easily .It pretty much will go like this ...If you are going into this film thinking you are going to hate it , you most likely will .You will find reasons to hate it by nitpicking and focusing on the negative .Obviously , if you loved the first two prequels ... you will be in another world while watching this film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
