{"text": "In the end , when he jumps , before he hits the ground , he turns into a bird ( you can see the bird shadow form ) and so he flys across .I do n't think this game is literally taken as he is jumping off the radio tower , it is just a metaphore .When I played through the game it felt more like the whole island was a labrynth that the narrator walked through in his head trying to sort his thoughts out .The ending chapter was him growing to be at peace and finally being redeemed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "More of a metafore than literal .This game can be viewed all sorts of different ways .Pinning one meaning to it will get you no where .The main character leaping from the tower can be equated as much to suicide as it can be casting his angst and ill will away .I wish I could agree , but sadly I can not .The white lines that were carved in the cliffs were carved by others who had earlier inhabitted the island , caught the disease , and wanted to warn others from landing on the island too before they ended their own misery .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The island is both literal and metaphorical : it epitomizes the solitude his grief has created and emphasizes the hopelessness of finding a way out of the cancerous state with which he has smited himself .The actual gameplay is also a metaphor of the story .Both entities can not interact with what they observe but can only stop and look around , observing the tiniest of details such as the number of gulls or the miles or micrometers .Having not found all the answers to finish the puzzle , both narrator and player subject themselves to the memories in hope to find another answer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As the narrator reaches \" Damascus \" ( a clear Biblical reference of opening blinded eyes ) , he has indeed decided to let go of his constant searching .But sadly , at this point , he realizes his kidney stones and his infected leg have hopelessly sealed his fate here on the island .These , too , are metaphors of the painful memories he continually endures , yet also tries to numb the pain with the painkillers .It creates a throbbing , a continual pounding of the grief that haunts him .He throws away the pills ( thus opening his blindness so he can see it all clearly ) and decides to make \" peace \" with it all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think you might want to revise your theories slightly ^_^ See how long you can stay underwater in the caves .What does that imply ?It implies for the purpose of the gameplay you are observing .Nothing you do will affect you or your environment .Just as you can jump down the hole but be dropped back on top ; the gameplay itself is a metaphor of the narrator 's observation and therefore will not change the outcome of anything that happens to him or the world ( memories ) he oberserves .The island itself seems to be at least to some degree literal seeing there were previous inhabitants ; the things he sees on it are obviously metaphors ( the tires , chemical figures , etc . ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The gameplay itself is most certaintly a metaphor , too .My post also was n't aimed directly at you , in case you thought it was .I was trying more to make the others realize that the character most likely did n't commit suicide in any sense whatsoever , and rather , was already dead or non - existent as it was .Also , something to take notice of : When the Hermit travels from place to place , in the game , he turns into a Gull .He 's always one step ahead of you , wherever you go , flying ahead of you at all times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Or do you ?Is it just that somebody is flying beside you , who is a gull , and that you have no form whatsoever ?Hmm ... .No matter which way you interpret the ending to Dear Esther I believe that this suicide , literal or metaphorical , was not him giving up .The entire time he walks through the island he remembers the time that he spent with Esther and the events that led to her death .He sought to see his journey until the end when he could have given in and died many times though the journey .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you , like me , believe it was a step towards redemption , it was his final step to release himself of the burden he had carried since her death .She was the only thing he thought of while he pondered what to do with his life .He eventually came to realize that as much as he loved her he had to let himself go .He was destroying himself over her , repeatedly visiting the spot of her death , visiting Paul knowing he would gain no answers to the questions he no longer had .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
