{"text": "Thursday , August 27 , 2009 .The endings of Paranormal Activity .Rumours are filtering through that one of the scariest movies ever made will finally get a US release date almost three years after it finished production .The facts are still elusive but signs point to September 25 as the date for a limited release in the States .But as audiences begin to gear up for one of the most traumatic experiences to be had in the cinema , controversy will surely turn to which ENDING they will be getting .The word is director Oren Peli has been tinkering with his cut of the film over the last year and may even have ditched the film 's original ending for a an alternative ending .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately , as I wrote in my review , the ending was the one time I felt the film went Hollywood and utilised more conventional shock tactics and even added an annoying , self - referential touch .So it made sense when I found out the ending was actually an alternate ending and there was an original ending said to be much longer and much more horrific .Two months ago I thought I had found it .She then sits and rocks beside the bed for days ( long enough that we hear the phone ringing and worried messages left in the background ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Katie comes back to the bedroom and continues rocking beside the bed as the counter records more days going past .Finally police arrive and as she approaches them with the knife they open fire on her and we fade out to the sound of police radios .It sounded much more unsettling than the ending I had seen and seemed to make better use of the dread that rendered the rest of the film so traumatic .The only thing that seemed off was the use of police - it seemed a little anti - climatic and risked providing too much closure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was in fact one of THREE different endings .So which one was the original ?From what I 've heard I believe the description below to be that of the original ending , or at least the earliest one screened .Unlike the previous two , I regard this ending to be the perfect finish to one of the most original horror films I 've ever seen .When I first heard the description , I gasped .I ca n't imagine how it 's going to feel on screen .I recommend you go into Paranormal Activity cold but if you 've already seen the film and are curious about the original ending here is a description below : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then suddenly Kate sits straight up , gets out of bed , walks over to Micah and stands over him staring at him for a few hours .Then she walks out of the bedroom and we hear her going downstairs .After a few minutes tick off the clock , we hear Kate screaming .Micah wakes up , screams to Kate that he is coming to help her , and he darts out of the room .For the next few minutes you just see an empty bedroom with the ticking clock and you hear both Kate and Micah screaming and a lot of commotion like they are fighting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After a minute or two of silence , you hear a loud stomping sound ( like something very heavy is coming up the stairs ) .From here , the ending diverges : Kate walks into the bedroom covered in blood and holding a large butcher knife down at her side .She walks into the room very heavy and stiff - like .The camera keeps rolling so we just see an empty bedroom for a few seconds and then the camera shuts off and the movie ends .I love this ending .It 's actually much more in line with how I hoped the film would finish .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If the dread of Paranormal Activity is the traumatic , sustained experience of pure desire ( desire being an experience of lack , of absence ) , this ending is traumatic precisely because it realises that desire .Violence is withheld and withheld in this film , fueling our anticipation for it , an anticipation that becomes unbearable .We know something horrific is about to happen but the more the film shies away from it the worst our expectations become .This ending finally gives us all the violence we feared .More than that , it directly posits the violence as something we desire by offering it up in front of the camera .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is less Kate who is possessed in this film than us .The demon is seeing through our eyes .What is shown to the camera is not just guided by the desire of the demon it is also guided by our own desire when we walked into this film - a desire for horror .This other worldly nature of our desire , this implication of our neutral gaze , is traumatic , and it 's the original ending that so perfectly realises the nature of this gaze .Why Dreamworks decided to change the ending is beyond me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps some timid audiences found it too confronting .Ultimately though it 's an insane move .The fact is the film is not complete without its original ending .But there are signs of hope .At least according to the film 's official website , which quotes my review , the filmmakers have read my criticism of the first alternate ending .Hopefully they 'll be paying attention here as well .Let 's not forget that at one stage we were actually going to get a Hollywood remake instead of the original .Perhaps these alternate endings will go the same route .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The suicide ending on the other hand was a rare alternate ending screened publicly only once .Peli goes on to say that there were many more alternative endings but they never got screened .However , we may see all of these endings on some kind of special edition DVD in the future .159 Comments : .A superb account , not just of the movie 's original finale , but - importantly - why it 's so effective ( and essential ) .And one other thing - do you have any idea how wonderful it is to read your comments , articulate , eloquently expressed and GRAMATICALLY CORRECT ? !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think the key point is that instead of the demon seeing through our eyes the demon is now looking at us through Kate 's eyes .The desire that felt so traumatic for us , precisely because of its other wordliness , is now rendered distinct and distant .It 's like the final scene exorcises the demon from us !With Kate 's look and Micah thrown against the camera , we are instead asked to occupy the standard Hollywood horror victim position - an essentially reactionary viewpoint rather than an implicated one .This might still be scary but it 's far from the terror of possession , which was terrifying precisely because it frustrated any such reactionary position , and left us no way out but to implicate our own desire in the horror .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The female friend comes to the house and the possessed Katie walks down again and kill her friend .Katie walks up to the bed again .Counter records more days passing .THEN police comes to the house and shot Katie .She walks downstairs , calls for Micah , he goes gets killed , then she comes back to the room ( with blood and knife ) stands on tops of the bed and days pass ( the counter goes fast ) .The female friend comes to the house and the possessed Katie walks down again and kill her friend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Counter records more days passing .THEN police comes to the house and shot Katie .The throat slitting ending reminds me a lot of the Michael Haneke film Cache .I 'd be interested to know if the director was inspired by that film at all , because it 's all about withholding the inevitable doom over our heads until the last moment where the giant act of violence is a character slashing his own throat .So glad to find out that there may be a better ending to this otherwise great film .My review , like yours , called the ending out as the failure of the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I ca n't believe I never thought of it but you 're absolutely right - it 's incredibly similar .Even just the way both films use the static watching camera and the way it feels like we ourselves are being watched when we look through it ( like Cache 's opening shot which we later realise is actually a tape being watched by the protagonists ) .Like Cache , PA 's static camera sets us up as both the watcher and the watched .We neutrally survey the scene but it also feels like we are ourselves are being watched by the demon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On the one hand we ca n't do anything but react , but on the other hand , the camera does n't take into account our reactions - we thus become unwillingly implicated in what we see on screen .And yeah , the throat cutting scene in Cache was the most traumatic scene of the movie , I literally let out a 5 second gasp when I saw it - can you imagine how scary it would have been in Paranormal Activity ? chip : your review made me realise how much I just automatically tuned out when the film started going all Hollywood - I was n't even in the right frame of mind for the shot to work on me !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "so silly to say the ending with Micah getting thrown through the room into the camera was ALL hollywood .I thought it worked really well .As a matter of fact the act of him getting thrown with such force put an exclamation point on the fact that the demon had invaded it 's host and there was no louder shriek by the audience than during that last scene .I think some were disappointed in the use of CGI on katie 's face as it seemed a juxtaposition of the non use of it throughout .I think it 's much scarier to have her walking around versus seeing her slit her own throat .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I totally agree with AJ Johnson !What are you guys smoking ! ! ! !I saw the movie , last night .I did n't want to see a cliche slasher knife !Micah being thrown 25 ' from the stairwell to the back of the room was much more supernatural !And , it was a great reveal of bloody Kate !You prefer a stupid throat slit ?I 'm sorry , I read that and it made me angry .Go watch FRIDAY THE 13TH , if you like that .I say this as someone who was very much into the movie and could not sleep , afterwards .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "PARANORMAL ACTIVITY ultimately delivers !Subtle buildup is great , but I do not want a subtle ending ! ! !When Kate looks at the camera , it is the demon inside of her who is looking at that camera , messing with whoever might view the footage - it is a warning to us , the audience , who are not off the hook !I thought it was completely appropriate .I will be mad as hell if this changes in some way for DVD , though I would n't mind the inclusion of the previous alternates , in the special features .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That final scene is what kept me from sleeping , last night !The rest of it was .... subtle .The throwing of Micah 's body into the camera by the demon - possessed Kate was to acknowledge Micah 's fixation on filming the evidence .It would be a way of saying , \" Here .Let 's make sure you get this one last shot , pal .\" I suggest you guys go watch the suicide scene in Michael Haneke 's Hidden .The film 's use of the static camera is very similar Paranormal Activity and its suicide scene is what I imagine Kate slashing her throat would have felt like ie . utterly traumatic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've seen both endings -- her cutting her throat was very creepy , very horrifying .More in tone with the rest of the movie .The CGI \" demon \" morph at the very end of the new ending was pretty lame , I think .However ... before that , when Kate throws the body across the room , that was hugely effective and very terrifying .The \" exclamation point \" analogy above is apt .This was the point where her possession was an undeniable reality and we as the audience are shocked and filled with revulsion and terror that Kate had truly become Something Else .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Oh AND- I think the ending should include micah being thrown and katie slitting her throat .The fact that Katie was strong enough to hurl a 150 lb man at the camera ... awesome .I agree with Iain who said that it was demons way of giving Micah what he asked for , that perfect shot .Thanks for posting this !I saw film last Thursday here in NYC .I loved everything about it except for the very last shot of Kate as the demon looking at the camera .That particular scene alone could have completely killed the movie for me - had it not been for the previous well crafted 98 minutes and 55 seconds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It would have been stupid to go with the cutting of the throat thing as it would n't have helped how the overall movie went .I just saw this movie and it SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME ! !I am literally afraid to go to sleep in my own bedroom !Absolutely the new generation \" The Exorcist \" mixed with a little \" The Blair Witch Project .\" I LOVED this film .I read about the alternate endings but I really love the one with Micah being thrown into his own camera and sweet Katie looking so scary as the demon possessed her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "CREEPY SCARY CREEPY .... excellent film .An instant classic and in the top 5 of my all time fave classic horror films .Thank you for making this film I hope to see a PNA-2 .I have to say that micah being thrown was perfect .I was mostly confused at that , nevertheless i was still shaking with fear .And to the comments above about a sequel i think would be kinda of a bad idea .The filmakers would have to be very careful on not to ruin the concept .I m starting to get chills just by thinking of the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I too prefer the theatrical ending because it does n't give a sense of finality to the haunting .In other words , I mean that we , the audience , see that the demon is still out there and there 's no telling what it 's going to do next .With the other endings , by Kate slashing her throat or the cops killing her , it 's basically like an open and shut case : demon be gone .I think it 's creepier to be led to believe that a malevolent being is out and about and in the guise of a regular human being than to see Kate being dead and therefore assume the demon is also vanquished .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , why would it suddenly decide to kill her once it finally possessed her ?Why go through all that effort to get into her body just to slash her throat ?As for the cops ending ?That 's just so cheesy , I wo n't get started on that one .While the other endings do sound cool ( especially the throat slashing one )I have to say that I liked the so - called ' Hollywood ' ending that 's running in theaters now .It gives the audience that supernatural ' money shot ' that we never got with Blair Witch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't know what kinds of idiots the studios are hiring to produce trailers these days , but what the hell is up with Hollywood showing the ending in the trailer ? !They did it with Quarantine , now this .Someone on Paramount 's marketing team need to be fired ... immediately !I 've read that the ending we got - the ' Hollywood ' one - was Speilberg 's idea specifically .- I can see why the ending we got works .As others have said , it 's the \" capper \" after nothing but slowly rising action , the one big scare we perhaps really need before we return to our lives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Keeping us in the place of the demon watching Kate kill herself is unsettling , but the light of day ( or even the lobby ) would defeat that pretty quicky .Not everybody would be satisfied by that ending .This way , we leave the theater with a nice adrenalin rush .And I 'll tell you what : the ending with \" her whereabouts are currently UNKNOWN \" is precisely as cheesy as \" ... and when they got home , hanging from the car 's door was A HOOK ! \"But driving home , I was creeped out by the idea that I could n't see into the back seat of my own car .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Altho that ending would have been pretty scary and quite disturbing also .I like the idea that the demon is still out there , esp .if they make a PA 2 .Of course they would have to be more careful with a sequel ( maybe a prequel ? go back to when Katie was a little girl perhaps ? )b / c most sequels do n't work ( eg : Blair Witch , lol )I have 2 questions if someone can answer please . .1stdid demon possessed Kate break the camera at the end or did someone , like the police see the footage ? and 2nd , what was the scariest part for everyone ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Love this film , ca n't wait to see it again .I 'm sure I missed a few things b / c I could not concentrate !Still sleeping my bedroom light on too , with my pups to protect me :O LOL .Thank you for such a great post about the alternate endings !I actually think the ending where the police end up coming and killing Katie sounds like the worst choice of the three known endings .It took all of the tension that was building up for an hour and half between boyfriend and demon and literally threw it in our faces .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I thought this was a fantastic movie , I saw it yesterday and made my dog sleep with me because I was terrified of having the lights out , lol .What could they have included to make the movie even more scary ?Was everyone too scared to remember that Katie was not the demon 's first possession ?Remember Diane and when he finished her he went on to Kate after 20 - 25 years .If they had used to throat slitting ending it would not have finished the demon in any way .It actually opens up for a sequel quite well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think i might actually prefer the police ending , only for the days of sitting on the bed and killing the friend as well .What do you guys think ?i think the thought of having a paranormal activity 2 is a really bad idea .and i just find it really rare that two people possessed by the same demon would both come up with the idea to film their whole lives .i agree that the ending in theaters was really good .but the entire time i was watching it i was wondering when she was gon na be rocking on the floor next to the bed lol .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "the police ending seems to be the most hollywood to me and the suicide one just ties everything up and i personally like to be kept wondering what happened at the end of a movie .but i m also curious to know what peoples favorite parts were , besides the ending of course .i loved this movie so much it was awesome .So my favorite parts were the scene where a ) they showed you the notebook from where Micah was trying to figure out the Ouiji board message and you saw it say \" Goodbye Diana \" ( the original girl possessed ! ) ; b ) the scene where she 's pulled off the bed by her foot and dragged screaming down the hallway , and finally , c ) the footprint scene , because is it just me or those looked like birds ' feet ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Either that or hands like it had crawled .Totally a reference to that demon book Micah bought and was looking at pictures of speculated Renaissance demons .I think a follow - up movie could be made of the relatives of the originally possessed girl finding out about Micah and Kate and going back to their house in San Diego .Prequel / sequel in one .If you remember the web page about the other girl that had been troubled since she was 8 and eventually we ( and Micah and Kate ) see pictures of her dead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Assuming its the same demon this time and with Kate the demon has her .She did not manage to get away ( read not dead ) and she is well and truly possessed and on the loose - \" no trace of Kate \" .And the jumping at the camera ( at us ) - demon and all - is like a warning that we 're next , as a lot of folks pointed out above .I think this ending is a scarier and an apt way to end the movie .Kate slashing her throat would have been anti - climatic in this movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And eventually the director gets us by letting Kate / demon go at us .This also leaves the door open for PA2 , with the demon all ready to go .I REALLY like the idea of the throat slashing in front of the camera instead of her demon face .BUT , Micha being thrown at the camera was perfect for many reasons some commentors stated .It made me jump , which I so want out of a movie like this .I 'd say keep in her throwing him at the camera , but end with the throat slash . .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The more I read these comments the more I appreciate the ending I saw in the theater .and the thing about a sequel / prequel is it does n't have to be like the original .There does n't have to be a video camera capturing the paranormal activity , does there ?That was just the \" gimmick \" they used for THIS film which worked quite well actually ... one other question ... what did Katie and Micah think they were gon na do with all that footage in the end anyway ?Sell it to A+E or something ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "hahaha wow nick i love how you re saying that we do n't have lives because were commenting on a movie that we really like when in actuality you are the one who is posting comments making fun of a movie that you hate and the people who watch it .At first I was disappointed by the ending , especially since it 's all over the TV spot .However , after thinking about it , the theatrical ending works well ... but instead of the CGI demon - face I think it would have been creepier if Kate just laughed or smiled menacingly at Micah 's body , followed by the camera shutting off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Great movie though !I had an idea for the ending which is already freaking me the hell out .but what if Katie ( after killing Micah ) and fixating on the camera , just walked up to the camera and stared into it , the same way she had stood over Micah 's sleeping body and stared at him for HOURS as he slept .The time lapse would then show that she 's been staring at us , the audience , for perhaps 3 hours or so .This would ultimately show that , yes , we the audience are now of the demon 's interest .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What 's scary about the rest of the film is that the demon is like the blind spot in our vision - he is invisible , we do n't where he 'll come from next .That 's why it feels like the demon is looking through our eyes , because the ultimate blind spot is our own condition of sight .It 's like the horror is in us but we ca n't see it .Our implication in the horror is invisible - that 's what makes it so scary .When Kate morphs into the demon and looks at the camera it exorcises the demon from us by making it visible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's why I think Micah being thrown against the camera ( despite the potent shock value ) is the wrong kind of horror .It 's not about the horror being in us but outside of us .This kind of ending ultimately lets us off the hook .In other words , I reckon J 's ending would still be really freaky but that Katie ca n't look at the camera in it .Her face should be partly cut off ( like the suicide ending ) , as if she 's looking at something behind us .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This whole time , we - the audience , have been watching as safe voyeurs , but now the demon turns its attention to the camera to taunt whoever is watching the footage .That to me , is not breaking the fourth wall , since the camera has an acknowledged presence .Breaking the fourth wall is when actors break character to wink at the camera ..... when there is not supposed to be a camera .However , I might have had Kate walk into the room and attack Micah 's body .She pushes him closer to the camera , out of view .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She attacks the camera , revealing her bloody mouth , and knocks it out of commission , so you would see glimpses of her screaming , bloody face and flashes of screen snow , until it the image completely goes to black .( But that 's me .Heh ) .One possible argument against the throat slit ending , is that it would n't be in keeping with case studies of possession , like those in Hostage To The Devil , written by Malachi Martin .I know that sounds nitpicky , but the director did do a lot of research on the subject and being realistic seems to have paid off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It kept the burnt picture of her .That is also why it smashed the photo of the two of them , but only left claw marks in Micah 's face .Yes , ultimately , it is to the satisfaction of the demon that the host - vessel is eventually killed- but , that event is usually reserved for a scenario involving death at the hands of another person or people .A suicide would simply send the demon back to the drawing board more prematurely than it would have otherwise preferred .I 'm glad that they did n't use that ending ( -but , of course it 's gon na undoubtedly be included in the Director's - cut DVD / Bluray bonus disc release lol ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Further , suicide would be a sort of victory for Katie over the demon in that it could never haunt her again .I prefer the darker ending where the demon wins ( gets Katie ) .As for the current ending , I read her looking into the camera and attacking it not as a meaningless self - referential moment , but as a lashing out at the device that she & the demon have hated for the entire film .It makes sense to couple it with Micah 's murder .For these reasons the current ending works best for me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The ending made it all worthwhile i think .Personally , i think the ending where she comes back upstairs , rocks back and fourth curled up in a ball , then the police come and shoot her .IS CRAP . to make that scene way better , what SHOULD happen is : Katie should be in her room .Then the police come and shoot her several times .Then when they go to the back rooms , she should get up , walk to the camera , smile , and turn it off .now THAT would be creepy xD .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "it sounds creepy .if anyone knows of a link that ACTUALLY WORKS , please inform me :) !the BEST ending though would be : Katie wakes up and walks to Micah 's side of the bed .Stands over him for ages .Then goes downstairs .Screams for Micah .He then runs down after her .He then shouts \" WTF IS THAT !AHHH ! \"Then everything goes silent for a few seconds .Then she should walk back upstairs .Throw Micah at the camera .Then she jumps on him and sniffs him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then the demon should go out of her and she falls next to Micah .She wakes up and crawls to the bedside .She does her whole Rocking back and fourth thing lol .Then the police come in and see Micah 's dead body .Then they shoot Katie , believing that she 's just murdered him .Then as they turn their backs , Katie should get up , walk to the camera . smile .then turn the camera off .I saw this film yesterday .In the ending I saw Katie sits upright and walks to stand over Micah for a few hours .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's then some more screaming from both of them and it suddenly goes silent .I think there 's some footsteps and then Micah 's body gets thrown at the camera and hits the ground .Katie is stood in the doorway covered in blood and walks over to Micah 's body .She seems to smell it and then looks at the camera .Her face then changes to something demonic and she lunges at the camera .The writing that follows says something like : ' The police found Micah 's body the next day but Katie has n't been seen since ' Which I think is meant to scare you into thinking she might come after you , she 's still ' out there ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The ending is different to what I saw .According to my version .Katie kills Micah then comes back upstairs and sits rocking back and forth .The clock ticks .Her friend enters the house and gets killed ( not by Katie ) as she is still sat down .Then the cops back in and kill Katie .that 's the original police ending .but i think the woman that went inside the house the next day did n't die .she went inside and saw mica 's dead body that 's why she screamed . went out the house and call the police .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Why would the demon keep her alive all these years just to have her commit suicide now , that makes no sense , and any explanation of this would be a stretch to \" make it fit \" .Also , why does she have to \" put on a show \" for the camera while she does it ? ?Yes , it 's too much of a stretch to say \" the camera is now the demon 's eyes \" , that 's just ridiculous , IMO .The cop ending is the best by FAR , because it keeps true to actually what would probably happen if this were real , although I really do n't think she had to be shot dead by the police .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I look at horror films not of how they make you feel during them but after it .The movie did not scare me ... after the movie did .I felt myself scared beyond belief .The feeling someones watching you .After the movie was done it was around 1 am .The ending i saw was the cop one ... did not like it all that much .I 've been reading for about an hour now and no luck finding other endings ... one I have seen though is the one were she kills her boy friend then slits her throat .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They could pull off a prequel , they do n't have to use the camera sort of thing ... if could work to do that to but i would n't advise it .You can show story plots of the chick before Katie slowly drove to the point were the exercisim took place .If they wanted to and i do nt know about they could make it into 2 parts one of the girl before her and then Katie 's childhood ....Just giving ideas . sequel probably would n't be a good idea because you have to make a whole new story ... do you include Kate ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I really hope there is a prequel though because i enjoyed the film .Peace xD .The female friend comes to the house and the possessed Katie walks down again and kill her friend .Katie walks up to the bed again .Counter records more days passing .THEN police comes to the house and shot Katie .Term Paper .Loved this review .But as other people have stated I also got a slightly different version of the police ending .After the couple sleep for a short while Katie gets up , turns around and stares at Micah from her side of the bed for a few hours .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After a few moments blood curdling screaming is heard from downstairs and Micah urgently trundles out of the room and darts downstairs , calling for Katie .More screaming is heard as I think a panicked Micah tries to ask her what 's wrong .Then silence .Katie heavily , almost stomping , walks upstairs with the large knife in her hand as seen at the beginning of the movie when Micah is chopping vegetables .She simply sits down on the floor with her back to the bed and rocks back and forth .She does this for several days during which the morning alarm goes off and a worried answer phone message is left , neither of which seem to affect her state at all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It sounds like she 's searching all around the downstairs floor until she finds , what I thought would be Micah 's dead body but it sounds like something much more strange happens .When the friend 's screams begin to be heard from downstairs Katie stops rocking .A scuffling sound starts like a physical struggle where it sounds like she is being attacked .All the while Katie sits upstairs , beside the bed , in her paused state .Once the screams stop with a concluding bang Katie resumes her rocking .The rest carries out with the police ending as described before .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was left wondering what on earth could have attacked Katie 's friend downstairs ?Was it Micah ?Was it the demon ?It could n't have been Katie because she was sat in front of the camera the entire time .I came up with different theories that entertained my thoughts long after the movie finished .When Katie stopped rocking perhaps that was the demon leaving her body momentarily to enter Micah 's body .Or perhaps the demon actually manifested itself in front of the friend as the dark mass that Katie describes having seen when she was 8 yrs old near the beginning of the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , I really like the sound of the third ending that was described in this review .Katie slits her throat in front of the camera without looking into the lens .That seems like it would have wrapped up the movie nicely .Also , it references the first time we see the knife at the beginning .When Micah is , I think , talking about people coming over to help .Talking to the camera he says something like \" and they 'll ( slit throat motion with knife ) take care of it \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "From what I 've read about demon possession , referencing past actions is apparently always what the demon does .Which is why I feel I have to appreciate this ending more .For me , the horror of this movie is in the concept of \" inviting evil in by giving it attention \" .That idea is closely tied with with my idea of what fear is , and with why I 'm interested in horror in the first place : psychological amplifier interference .The emotion of fear can be very hard to deal with , because the very nature or purpose of fear is to make you avoid knowing it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In PA , the action of watching the movie places the audience in the position where it is forced to confront and empower the evil , as an \" accomplice \" .The boyfriend wants to see and confront the evil , but that effectively makes him a catalyst for the evil actually taking place .The audience is forced to identify with the boyfriend , but in a very intelligent way : the boyfriend is almost \" just another audience member \" .It makes you imagine how much the entity might be empowered by many people watching its manifestation , and it makes you feel as if you 're inviting evil by watching the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The horror is in the audience imagining what might happen after seeing it , because they saw it .I 've just been reading through some of the comments regarding the ending that has the police show up .In the version I saw Katie kills Micah downstairs then returns to beside the bed rocking back and forth for a day or two .The girlfriend is heard entering the house and finding Micah 's body at which point she leaves the house terrified and supposedly alerts the police who turn up shortly after .In this version Katie did not kill the girlfriend as I have read in other people 's accounts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I seem to remember in the version I saw that at the time the police can be heard downstairs discovering Micah 's body and Katie is still sat beside the bed , that distant hallway light turns off ( and maybe back on ? )This would suggest that at the time the police came upstairs the demon had left Katie 's body .She gets up utterly confused and she moves towards the police with genuine concern for Micah and is sadly killed because she still carries the knife .I kind of liked this ending as it gave Katie , at the last moment , her innocence back to suffer a fate devised by the evil demon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What it also did was to leave the door wide open for a sequel as we know the demon will now find someone else .I think it would be cooler if we see the thrown boyfriend scene , along with Kate slashing her own throat .The time - lapse of her female friend calling to check up on where she has been .Then maybe she comes to check up on them , and then goes upstairs looking for signs of life .From the camera 's view we would see her come in , have a shocked and scared look on her face , and then back out of the room .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although this would open the gates for a sequel with Kate 's friend possessed by this demon , I would rather not see that happen .I find it better to think that it just latched onto another victim in a totally arbitrary manner rather than some pre - destined kind of deal where the victim lives knowing they have a demon following them around all of their life .This way seems like it could happen to anyone and would fit ( in an eerie way ) with why normal , functional people sometimes do randomly crazy things like kill their loved ones or commit suicide with little or no reason .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maybe I 'm going way to deep into this .Just an idea .I really liked the film and liked the thrown boyfriend ending as well .Like most , I was disappointed in the CGI demon face .It seemed to cliche .I was totally ready for this , which made it just seem corny to me .I do n't necessarily like the idea of the slit throat without knowing the demon jumped to another host .Otherwise it seems like the demon died with her .I liked the idea of hours of her standing over the camera looking at us .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It turns us from just being the voyeur into the one being watched .Since the demon was intent on killing the last person it stared at like that , it would be creepy to think of ourselves as the next victim .I have studied religious malevolence for a while now and would like to speak of the superb research the writers and director did with this film .The general idea here is that this evil spirit has become fixated on Kate , but to totally possess Kate , the spirit must first cut off emotional and spiritual support from Micah .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As the movie progresses and Micah becomes foolishly more brash with the spirit , the hauntings become more physical and more blunt .The scene indicating that the spirit seemingly punched the photograph and left marks on Micah was a warning to both the audience and Micah .I suspect that Kate 's captor had wanted to eliminate Micah early on in the movie as depicted as the first time she stood up staring at him for hours .It was probably the young girl 's will that kept the demon at bay or the demon did n't have a large enough hold over her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It has been speculated that slitting her own throat would somehow damage the movie 's integrity .I would like to point out that in the case of Kate and Micah , Micah was the focal point of Kate 's emotional attachment .For all the pain he brought her with his idiotic ideas , she loved him very much and he obviously had a deep devotion for her .A demon exists to purely cause pain , torment , and evil .There is nothing more evil than having a hand in the destruction of something or someone you love .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He also had some business to attend to in the form of Diane as well .The bottom line is that to a spirit like this , murdering Micah using Kate 's hand would have been a sense of enjoyment for the demon to the equivalent that you or I just gor a promotion or a new car .Killing her at the end would have satisfied the lust for total power , over her mind , body , and soul .But also killing her sister would have been in keeping with the basic agenda .Very good movie though , and I 'm glad that I got the experience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Slit throat ending left me like .... \"thas it ? \" The one where she does the Criss Angel cam swallow was too soon on some M. Night Shyamalan , it was an alien the whole time type shit .DOES ANYBODY KNOW anything about the ending where Mich kills Katie ?I ve seen screen shots of the ending and people were saying Mich ended up killing Katie .because in the second one you get a message after the movie ends that katie and hunter are not yet found .and also the daughter with the boy friend is alive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
