{"text": "In a film like this , with no wasted gestures , small details add up to a lot .Without giving much away , pay attention to questions about car crashes , and the buying of shirts to find connections between the fates of the two main actors .The story is all there , it 's just not always made plain .The only thing I can think of to criticize here was the deletion of some of the Sheriff 's scenes and dialogue that were in the book .Most of the mild complaints I heard about this movie stemmed from Tommy Lee Jones character not having quite enough airtime for people to grasp that this is HIS story , more so than Llewellyn 's or Anton 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Every performance here is great as well , but particularly the Scottish actress Kelly McDonald 's as Carla Jean Moss .Amazing ! ! !The action scenes , for which they 're not particularly known , are especially striking and powerful .All in all a superb film .I watched this movie again recently .I 've watched it at least ten times by now .I 've decided that it is hands down the greatest movie I have ever seen .The subtle background sounds , the off - hand expository dialogue and the visual cues seem so natural , and are so effortlessly and seamlessly interwoven into the story that I learn something new with each viewing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The acting is flawless .The screenplay is riveting .It is of the highest level of artistry for the medium .This movie kept me at the edge of my seat .The assasin in this movie single handedly created the majority of the action .The sheriff wanted to solve murders from the seat he was seating on .He 's one liners and witty conversations adds to the movies country style persona .If you have an @hotmail , @live , @msn , or @outlook email , please change it if you wish to receive emails from BTVA .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ultra Magnus is awesome , despite the infamous \" I ca n't deal with that now \" line .My favourite voice here is Robert Stack , he has an awesome authoritative voice and he sounds like a humble and respected city commander and I could maybe see him pulling off the more cold and distant and comically serious characterization he has in the IDW comics .Michael Ironside is my second favourite , he is an awesome choice for the role , however he sometimes feels kind of bland mostly because Magnus did n't really do much in Prime other than show up and get beaten a lot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His voice is more fitting for the IDW characterization .Kim Strauss is fitting for the more renegade who plays by his own rules RID version and I could totally have seen him pulling off a more traditional Ultra Magnus in his Dewey Novak voice from Eureka Seven .I feel both Jack Angel and Jeff Bennett have the exact opposite problem I have with them .He sounds too awkward and stilted with his deliveries .I get that DJW loved G1 and wanted to have them homage Robert Stack 's portrayal but they really should have went with their own original voice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Barry Gjerde has a strange , awkward accent and delivery , it 's all wrong for Ultra Magnus .I 've never heard Jamieson Price 's from the WFC DS game , it 's probably one a few lines but I know he 'd be fantastic if he voiced him in another game or show .BONUS : Whenever I 'm reading the IDW MTMTE comics I always read Ultra Magnus with the voice of Academy Award Winning Actor J.K Simmons .I can just see him playing Magnus similar to his Tenzin , who is also the comically serious type character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Michael Ironside was a little bland to me outside of his voice just being cool in general .Jeff Bennett is okay , but it sounds a little goofy to me .Jack Angel is n't that distinct , IMO .@PsychicVoiceSpy I completely understand your judgment , but I still beg to differ .Ironside fit the bill well .Stack has a more distinctive emotional range in the role than Ironside in his .But in all honesty , as much as I love Stack as Magnus , I felt more emotion and personality from Ironside than I did with stack .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "@DreamMaster08X I kept that in mind when I judged the performances .But the problem is that they have two very distinct characterizations and it 's ends up being pretty subjective .I preferred Magnus ' characterization in TF : The Movie .I liked his mature , but emotive and friendly sound more .As much as I liked Michael Ironside as a casting choice , I felt the range of tone and emotions he was allowed to portray given the material for his character in particular was kinda bland and uninteresting on the whole , holding back his talent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "They just happened to have the better casting , IMHO .If Stack had more dialogue than that in the movie , perhaps now would be a good time to update his clip so that he has a more firm holding in this poll .It 's barely ever that a non - Prime VA holds the popular vote around here , and I 'd rather not let that honor slip now ;) .I do have to admit , it did take me by surprise at how many votes Michael Ironside had gotten once he was added , he and Stack were already neck - and - neck in a matter of a couple days .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
