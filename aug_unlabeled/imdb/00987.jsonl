{"text": "Despite World War II as a setting for games becoming as old and as used as Hugh Hefner , Pandemic Studios have at least tried a fresh approach for the setting .One that feels fresh and fairly unique .Whilst on the one hand The Saboteur delivers as it originally intended , on the other , it seems like it 's another Pandemic game that lacks that extra layer of polish to make it something great .A shame , but a fitting end to a studio that 's struggled to recapture their glory days .Titties and smokes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Saboteur takes place during World War II in a regimented Paris that is absolutely littered and suppressed by the strong Nazi presence .The story itself is a classic tale of revenge , revolving around supposedly Irish racing driver and mechanic , Sean Devlin .I say supposedly , because although his misdemeanour may fall in line with all the traditional stereotypes of an Irish person - smokes a ton , drinks a lot and swears like a trooper - but the accent itself is ... a little more Hollywood than Dublin .Other than that , and a few flaccid performances from a few other voice actors , the story itself is actually quite an enjoyable one , with each scene stepping up to an even more elaborate set piece than the one previous .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They normally involve the \" quiet in , loud out \" mantra , but storming bases and even castles to get to a target or bring down an iconic piece of German military presence never seems to get old .There are a few tools at your disposal to stealth into these situations including the ability to steal disguises and also being able to sneak and perform stealth kills , but chances are , you wo n't be able to sneak out once you 've performed your main objective .The problem is , other than the main story , The Saboteur is n't really that much of a \" sandbox \" game per se .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The environment itself though is absolutely huge and represents all the major landmarks of Paris in stylish fashion .That alone is good enough for you to get lost in .What sets The Saboteur apart from other sandbox and World War II titles is Pandemic 's unique take on the art style .In the early stages , the game world is presented with these film noir style visuals that are reminiscent of the visuals found in Sin City - the black and white backdrops , vivid reds and bright lights .It 's frankly a pretty epic sight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The problem comes when the story progresses .The art style signifies the Nazi suppression in the area , and so if you progress the story enough and inspire the people of the region , the colour drips back , and the game becomes yet another generic looking sandbox title .Devlin takes hanging around to a new level .The game controls in The Saboteur will be familiar to anyone who was played Pandemic 's other title , Mercenaries .The driving controls retain that arcade , fast paced feel , whereas the shooting mechanics feel responsive , simplistic and again , fairly arcadey .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The climbing mechanics themselves are pretty well delivered , but after playing Assassin 's Creed 2 , the mechanics seem to pale in comparison and feel somewhat sluggish .Unless you 're presented with a drainpipe or a ladder , it can take an absolute age to scale a building .The climbing mechanics come into their own though when you 're actually on the rooftops , as you fling yourself from roof to roof .Sometimes Devlin will refuse to latch on to a zip - wire which results in an Irish pancake on the streets of Paris , but other than that , they 're very well implemented .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are a ton of different weapons to use including rocket launchers , flamethrowers , sniper rifles and the usual array of standard weaponry .Chances are though , dynamite will be your best friend as it 'll allow you to take out key German structures in true saboteur fashion .If you 're feeling slightly more destructive , then stealing a tank is usually the best course of action .Grabbing one of the old fashioned sports cars and trying to outrun them is always worth a shot as well , but get to level 4 or level 5 on the wanted system , and trying to outrun Zeppelins and APCs is n't exactly a walk in the park .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These can be simple things like 10 head shots using a sniper scope , or collect every vehicle in the game and store in your garage .The rewards you can get from them as well are actually really beneficial and can net you new weapons , new vehicles or even character traits that stop you from getting knocked over by explosions and the like .Whilst the game 's controls have many similarities to Mercenaries , the game also carries the same issues that tainted the game .Other than the fairly weak enemy AI , the game also lacks the polish that Mercenaries 2 lacked ... but not quite to the same extent as its sister title .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This happened in numerous missions on numerous occasions .The game also misses some kind of fast - travel system considering that the game world is absolutely massive , especially with its vast , often lifeless countryside .Bomb planted , time for a stylish getaway .On an achievement point front , you can probably mop up around 800 points in around 15 - 20 hours , but to get the full thousand , prepare to grind .And when I mean grind , I mean really grind .A good portion of the points are allocated to taking down all of the ambient occlusions located around the massive environment , of which there are about 1,000 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Other than that , the balance is good and there is a good spread .You 'll get the vast majority just playing normally , but there are a few missable achievements ( complete a mission without detection and complete a mission in disguise ) , although you 'd have to be pretty callous to miss those .The problem is definitely the collectibles though .I 'm not sure anyone has put more than 1,000 in the game , so this maybe a first .More side missions , less glitches and a fast travel system would have made this an immensely more satisfying game .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It does a lot of things right , but at the same time , does so many things wrong ...I mean , is it that hard to employ an Irish actor ?Or even an Irish hobo ... both would have done a better job at voicing the main character .The Saboteur is definitely one worth trying , but after the story has gone , and the colour has seeped back into the game world , you may be heading down the store to trade this one back in for something else .The small list of fitting songs does n't make - up for one of the worst Irish voice over performances I 've ever heard .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you 've played Mercenaries , this game will feel second nature to you .Simple driving mechanics , responsive shooting mechanics and a climbing system that seems to work , but only just .It 's a little slow if you ask us .Hit and miss is an appropriate phrase for The Saboteur .There is no doubting it is a decent game and a lot of fun , but at times , it can be frustrating .Not as raw as Mercenaries 2 , but it definitely needed another layer of polish to smooth off the rough edges .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "5.0 out of 5 stars The British classic that really put Hitchcock on the map .By Daniel Jolley on September 4 , 2006 .1935 's The 39 Steps is the film that really put Alfred Hitchcock on the map as a world - class movie director .With its mixture of classic Hitchcockian wit , dark ( and light ) humor , and suspense , it brought to the fore the man 's genius and set the stage for many a classic thriller to come .All he has to go on are a cryptic reference to something called \" the 39 steps , \" a name of a town in Scotland , and a warning to stay away from any man missing the upper digit on his right pinkie finger .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The journey he makes from London to a little town in Scotland is not an easy one , as Hannay finds himself running from the bad guys who want to kill him as well as the cops pursuing him for murder .Deceit and double - crossing as well as assistance from unexpected quarters keep things very interesting - particularly after he finds himself on the run yet again ( after one of several narrow escapes ) , now handcuffed to the lovely and initially unsympathetic Pamela ( Madeleine Carroll ) .The romantic element thus introduced into the film deviates from the original novel on which the screenplay was based , but it clearly strengthens the film , setting the stage for a most climactic conclusion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are those who will agrue forever and a day about which Hitchcock was better .In my personal opinion I like the American Hitchcock .His Britsh films , while very entertaining always seem to have smug characters .Maybe it 's just because of who is playing the parts , but , I never find myself opening up to them .And his dry wit sometimes gets in the way of the over - all story .The entire set - up with Donat and Carroll handcuffed together would have fit perfectly in a screwball comedy .In fact if I remember correctly was n't there a scene in \" I Was A Male War Bride \" that is quite similiar ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
