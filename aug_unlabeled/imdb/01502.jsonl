{"text": "Pages .I 'm going to start by saying that never in my life have I put holiday decorations away as late as January 19 .After New Year 's , there 's nothing that gets old faster than Christmas as far as I 'm concerned .It 's just how I 've always felt about it and so all of my adult life since I began decorating for the biggest holiday of the year , I would always have it all put away by the weekend after New Year 's .I 'm sorry to keep going on about it but glad to say that it 's all finally done .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And early this morning , I walked around the house , gathering all the detritus of the holiday and depositing it on the dining room table , my staging area for packing .Surprisingly , I had it all done within two hours , my husband helping by taking all of the crates to storage .In retrospect , I guess I really could have squeezed two hours from one of the previous weekends but with everything going on , it was all just too much .I did some cleaning before putting everything back in its usual place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I finished my book , The House at Riverton by Kate Morton .It was a decent read and kept me interested .Next up are The Thirteenth Tale , and The Book Thief , both of which I really look forward to .I read outside in the sunshine this afternoon in a protected spot .Sunshine can do a world of good in the middle of winter , ca n't it ? \" Just living is not enough , \" said the butterfly , \" one must have sunshine , freedom and a little flower .\" This afternoon , the light coming in the west windows was beautiful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I very rarely give 5 stars to movies .If I could have given any stars , I would have given way more than 5 .Spectacular , soul - satisfying , thought - provoking ... even without the 3D.
