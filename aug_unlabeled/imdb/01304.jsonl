{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .Scopers ( or The Speed of Thought as it 's also known ) tries hard and there 's some interesting ideas at work here but I found it ultimately disappointing .The film follows Nick Stahl as Joshua , one of the Scopers of the title , who has telepathic powers .He uses these in his work for a shady government department , they prove pretty useful in that line of work .On a mission he comes into contact with a previously unknown fellow scoper named Anna .Their interaction changes both of their lives and provides the momentum for the plot , a slow burning romantic thriller with a few twists and double crosses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The budget appears to be pretty low for this project and it shows .There are various scenes of the scopers visiting each other within their minds in strange almost fantasy worlds - due to the lack of production values these do n't always entirely convince unfortunately .Not everyone can have the budget of something like Inception of course which I think is the kind of vibe they were looking for .The acting ranges from decent for many and pretty wooden for some of the smaller roles .To be fair , Stahl carries the film pretty well and the central romance is relatively convincing but a later plot twist feels kind of obvious early on so it lacks the intended impact for the conclusion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Comment 4 of 4 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .The front cover of this movie is deceptive - You might be expecting a high octane thriller with impressive special effects but not much in the way of character development .This is n't the case .What you get instead is a very slow moving film , about a mind reading agent who is coming to terms with the fact that he has to be alone and he is going to lose his mind at 29 ... or is he ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .This movie has been totally misclassified as \" horror \" : it 's actually in the conceptual sci - fi / fantasy genre and is perhaps primarily a psychological thriller .Very low budget & very little action ( the poster is completely misleading ) but actually quite an interesting storyline .Just do n't expect to see especially high production values or big action scenes , or any impressive special effects - even the sci - fi aspect is very low - key .Watch it as an interesting story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am very pleasantly surprised - it has the same sort of vibe as Inception , The Adjustment Bureau , and maybe a smidge of X - Men but on a smaller budget .The smaller budget somehow makes it more believable IMO .Do n't expect big explosions or uber effects - this is n't a blockbuster .Do expect some interesting concepts and a tight plot .Recommended watching .As another reviewer mentioned , this is not a horror - in any sense of the word .I would describe it more as a love story - come - light action film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
