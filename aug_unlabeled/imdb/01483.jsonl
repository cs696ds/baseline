{"text": "But by saying that , I do n't want to dismiss this film as fantasy kitsch , nor do I want to portray Ava Gardner as the ultimate sex kitten and that is why this film should be watched .\" Pandora and the Flying Dutchman \" is much more than that .It 's a magical film in which characters encounter fate , destiny , tragedy and focuses on a unique love shared by two individuals .VIDEO : . \" Pandora and the Flying Dutchman \" is presented in 1080p ( 1920 x 1080p ) .It 's important to note that this film is 60-years - old and prior to watching this Blu - ray release , I have had the movie on DVD from KINO courtesy of their \" Glamour Girls \" DVD box set .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Blu - ray release is a major step forward in the restoration of this film .Read more ' .2 Comments 20 of 20 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .This movie is a very deep and philosophical story of the Flying Dutchman .A man doomed to roam the seven seas for eternity unless he meets someone who loves him enough to die for him .There are wonderful quotations from ' Dover Beach ' and ' Omar Khayyam ' which say so much .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of James Mason 's great performances , in my opinion , and a great performance by Ava Gardner .Nothing wooden about it ! !Comment 36 of 40 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I highly recommend this movie .It 's a great story , really romantic .Beautiful actress Ava Gardner , is just wonderful in it , and so is actor James Mason .They make a great on screen couple .It 's a film definitly worth seeing .It definitly deserves all the stars it can get .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .The fantasy / romance premise for this film is an interesting one , but the execution of the plot leaves quite a lot to be desired and much of the dialogue is quite lame and stilted .The plot has been covered well by others , no need to add more about that .James Mason 's central character is the best thing about the film .He is extraordinary ( as usual ) .Ava Gardner is very lovely to look upon ( although her gowns are far closer to 1951 than to the 1930 time frame ) , but her acting is rather lackluster ( as usual ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Spanish location photography is great , as to be expected from the legendary cinematographer , Jack Cardiff .The direction is adequate , but no better .The telecine transfer on this DVD is poor in places , with color timing way off at times ( sometimes with a purplish cast ) and falls seriously short of what a Technicolor print can deliver .The print this was transferred from has considerable damage at the start and end of reels ( ca n't be missed with scratches , dirt , and multiple cue marks ) .There are several splices , most producing a loud pop in the audio .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
