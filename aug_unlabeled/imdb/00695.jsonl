{"text": "Flatliners Blu - ray Review .Directed by Joel Schumacher Written by Peter Filardi 1990 , Region A , 114 minutes , Rated R Blu - ray released on July 22nd , 2014 .Starring : .Kiefer Sutherland as Nelson Julia Roberts as Rachel Mannus Kevin Bacon as David Labraccio William Baldwin as Joe Hurley Oliver Platt as Randy Steckle Kimberly Scott as Winnie Hicks Joshua Rudoy as Billy Mahoney Benjamin Mouton as Rachel 's father Beth Grant as Housewife .Review : .Nelson , a medical student , believes he has figured out a way to cheat death and to be able to come back and report on the afterlife .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's atheist Labraccio , the womanizing Hurley , Steckle , a smart guy with some great comic timing , and Nelson 's ex - flame Rachel Mannus .Together these five conspirators sneak equipment and medicine into a Chicago University building undergoing renovations and perform their death - defying trick .The group succeeds and Nelson is indeed clinically dead one moment and then returned to life less than two minutes later .The others start playing a figurative game of Russian Roulette by upping the amount of time they are willing to play dead in order to outdo the previous experiment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It seems our medical deviants are haunted by the sins of their past and these ghosts not only scare them , they are able to physically harm them too .What follows is a race to see if there is a way to atone for the offenses of your earlier days , or if the ultimate price really is a one - way ticket underground .Flatliners has a great premise and largely runs with it , but the script by Peter Filardi ( The Craft ) could easily have benefitted from a few darker turns .The round trip to the great beyond is intriguing , but I 'm surprised the majority of the characters are so shallow in their reasons for experimenting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The aspect of ghosts of the past coming back to haunt you is also a promising conflict for the arrogant anti - heroes content to play God , but only one of them seeks to atone for his shitty behavior .Director Joel Schumacher ( D.C.Cab ) has made a lot of fun movies over the years and was at his creative peak throughout the mid 1980s and ' 90s .Here he throws his entire bag of tricks at the screen , including a gorgeous cast dressed in trendy fashions , surrounded by giant wind machines and placed inside stunningly colorful ( occasionally black - lit ) environments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Schumacher keeps things on track , narrowly avoiding several plot holes by moving things at a brisk pace and maintaining a stylistic music video design with the help of ace Cinematographer Jan De Bant ( Die Hard ) .Flatliners features some similar moments to Schumacher 's earlier films like The Lost Boys and St. Elmo 's Fire , in part due to dynamic aerial photography or in other cases like familiar music cues courtesy of James Newton Howard ( Falling Down ) .The cast comes off as a twisted horror genre variation of The Brat Pack , but fortunately they deliver solid performances across the board and sell the whole med student angle surprisingly well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Challenging Nelson for both the leadership and the girl is Labraccio , played by the always - watchable Kevin Bacon ( Tremors ) .There are enough quiet moments between the two male leads to make this feel like a real friendship being stressed by a love triangle and the film is stronger for it .William Baldwin ( Backdraft ) objectifies women as the ever - horny Hurley , a man obsessed with making fuck tapes without his fianc\u00e9e .Rounding out the group is Steckle ( Oliver Platt , Lake Placid ) , the voice of reason who wants to support his friends , and yet his biggest risks remain rooted in academia .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Joshua Rudoy ( Harry and the Hendersons ) , who plays the haunting figure of Billy Mahoney , has little more to do than look either terrified or terrifying and handles both really well .Kimberly Scott ( The Abyss ) and Beth Grant ( Donnie Darko ) have limited screen time , but both leave lasting impressions as they are fantastic actors and always nice to see .Flatliners remains a fun experience that works as both a medical thriller and , with its Gothic imagery , a genre film .The fact that I like the characters despite their cavalier attitudes when dealing with matters of life , death and other consequences is a real compliment to all involved .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Flatliners receives an acceptable video transfer that , while not perfect , is no worse than the original Columbia Blu - ray ( 2007 ) , and may in fact be the same .Presented in the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio , colors are strong and black levels are solid , but some scenes feel a bit dark and would benefit from a full remaster .Maybe next year when the film turns 25 ( yikes ) .In a weird move , this release ditches the DTS - HD MA 5.1 mix of the original Blu - ray , and even abandons the 5.1 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only audio option here is presented in a 2.0 Dolby Digital track ( not even an uncompressed DTS - HD 2-channel ) that is a bit thin overall .There is really not much more to say about this , but it makes for a strong argument to track down the Sony release .Special Features : .I think the trailer was present on some earlier releases ( dating back to the Laser Disc ) , but even that modest feature is missing from this completely bare - bones release .If you press enough buttons , you will eventually be led to one of the worst menu screens of the Hi - Def era that features a simple \" Play Movie \" option .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Whoever does decide to awaken should put their whole effort , attention , and life into it , in order to make it succeed .Being in the Present Moment .To live without awareness is to live as the deaf , blind , and dumb in a world of vibrant light and sound .The spirit is beyond pleasure and pain ; it 's outside them .They are swings of opposites .The spiritual is in the here and now .It 's not pleasure nor is it pain .It is its own substance , its own kind .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Awareness is not an idea about awareness , as it is not thought at all .Awareness allows you to feel life as it 's happening , as it is in perception that consciousness and all spiritual qualities are manifest .When we are aware , we step into the moment which is outside of time .Consciousness .There is a knowledge that is beyond the mind and the intellect , it is the wisdom of consciousness .Consciousness can not be glimpsed as though it were something outside yourself , because it is you .The spiritual work builds upon awareness , increases consciousness , transforms it , merges it with the divine , and this is how to reach true spirituality in life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Each of us at our root is consciousness , and in the highest of the spiritual realms life and form become light .I experienced this in an OBE in which I went to the outer ring of the source of creation .Death .What you have within you in your life is what you are after death .If you have explored it to some extent , you would see how life continues after death , and know that after death the consequences of the way that you have lived follow .Whoever is able to look beyond the body and experience what is beyond it can know about death .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By living life well , using it to successfully awaken , death is faced in a completely different way .External things can be created , but they are left behind at some point , they decay and are eventually gone .But within , something can be created which lasts forever , something which goes beyond this life .To live without knowing what one takes with them with death , or without knowing what exists within that is spiritual and is not of time , is to live a life in darkness .Dreams .Dreams are an insight into our psychology : they are what we are , but stripped of the conventions and norms of psychology , and the rules of the physical world ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dreams provide a doorway that opens to the inner world of oneself .They show the intricate workings of the mind in ways that can not be avoided or hidden .The subconscious seen in dreams is what a person really is .Emotions .By indulging in pleasure or misery , the potential feelings of spirituality are sacrificed .Whoever has hatred toward someone is that hatred .The negativity within has to be overcome to be able to reach to the spiritual , and therefore to find peace , because peace and negativity are incompatible .Pleasure brings pain , but inner silence brings nothing negative ; it is in itself of great value and is a far better way to be than to be in ego states .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many try to do this work while wanting to be a better version of themselves , without appreciating that this work involves dying to oneself , which is something very different .Enlightenment .Enlightenment comes as the result of a very long and difficult process , with many obstacles to overcome , and many things to create and destroy within .Having goals in terms of achieving physical things of the world is necessary , but if you do n't have the fundamental goal of enlightenment , then your life is going to be lived as any other ordinary person , subject to all that it brings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Esoteric Knowledge .You may think that you should get knowledge just because you 're you , because you deserve it , but that 's not the case .Everyone has to meet certain standards in order to get knowledge .Esoteric knowledge is something which you acquire for yourself in your own terms .It 's not something that you just get from reading , because that is purely intellectual knowledge and it does n't have that much spiritual value - it has its use , obviously , but it is spiritual experience that is needed .Heaven .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Heaven is found by those who re - unite with divinity .Inner Change .To bring about the new takes not just a development of the old , but a radical leap forward - revolutionary and transforming .Change in the spiritual aspects of life requires change from within .Knowing who and what you are is fundamental to bringing about lasting change .Whoever tries to change without seeing and uncovering the subconscious , will not fundamentally succeed - its unseen workings will always have their grip upon them .To change radically , remove the subconscious desires , the egos , help others to awaken , and transform awareness with alchemy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Love is not simply about thinking positively , or thinking loving thoughts , or even doing kind deeds , although these may be expressions of it .It 's there in seeing and feeling and being part of reality , because in reality we 're all part of one - not only one humanity , but one substance , which is the cosmic consciousness of the universe .In reality each person is a self - aware part of the great cosmic consciousness .So love is in seeing reality , and when it 's there you feel it , you do n't even have to think about it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They regard those qualities as weakness and even look down on them , when in fact those qualities are among the highest ones and they belong to higher , spiritual realms .There is a secret path , whereupon alchemists who dedicate themselves to a spiritual life can become vehicles for something more than themselves - and that which is more is , in its nature , love .The Meaning of Life .Each person is in this physical world for a very short time - appearing in it , and then disappearing out of it , and yet existing in eternity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you just live and die and do n't know why you 've lived , you 've lived a kind of an illusory life - it 's a waste of a life .A life lived knowing what its purpose is , and fulfilling that purpose , is possible and waiting .What is within determines what someone does with their life .How someone spends each day becomes how they live their lives .Everyone has the free will to make what they will of their life .If someone wants to awaken with it , then they need to examine carefully the way that they live .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By examining what it is that you truly value most in your life , you can reveal where your life is heading and where your true heart lies .Opposition .Instead of seeing opposition simply as a detriment to spiritual growth , it 's more realistic to see it as an essential element of spiritual growth .For those who strive for the light , the darkness comes to oppose them ; the darkness is internal or external as is the opposition .They become part of the struggle for good and evil , both in the world and in themselves , gaining merits for themselves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Good and evil translate in reality to forces of spirituality and of evolution and devolution .Those who fight for the spirit help humanity face the forces of devolution and ignorance .Out - of - Body Experiences .Out - of - body experiences are a natural process .The ability to have them is part of the way that we are built ; it 's part of the design .The symbolic content of ancient texts and the art of archaeological sites have often been misinterpreted as myths , legends , and the attempts of primitive peoples to understand their world , but many have their origin in the astral plane .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Peace is not compatible with negativity ; peace is not compatible with desire .They 're completely different and are separate in their nature .One is of animal desires and drives , the other is of consciousness .The message of the path to enlightenment is for everyone who wishes to realize true peace within .The Path to Awakening .It is in the moment that one acts spiritually , or as an animal with a mind , but it is through the path to awakening that one becomes spiritual .The path to the light becomes increasingly narrow as we walk it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sacrifice .If live an ordinary life and expect to get profound spiritual knowledge and enlightenment without making sacrifices , you wo n't .We have to sacrifice something in order to receive something superior , and in giving to others spiritually we receive spiritually .Self - Knowledge .Having self - knowledge is essential for spiritual development and enlightenment .To live without self - knowledge is to walk through life blindly .A blind person misses much of the activity of life around them ; a psychologically blind person misses most of the activity taking place inside them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Whoever wants spiritual change must see and understand themselves .Something that is not seen is never truly understood and something not truly understood can not fundamentally be changed .By transforming what it is that sees , what is seen is transformed also .Whoever does not understand what 's going on inside themselves is a victim of it .When someone does n't see or understand what happens within , they are governed by it and can not fundamentally change it .Whoever wants to truly understand what they are really like , must be able to see themselves as they are , accurately and with clear objectivity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some people treat sex as ungodly and taboo , as if it was something separate from spirituality .But spirituality is not apart from life , and thus sex is not apart from spirituality either .Sex is part of the great mystery of creation .Spiritual Experience .It does n't matter what you think about consciousness , higher truths , or different dimensions - it 's what you do and what you are that counts .The spiritual must be found to know what it is .It can not be found by thinking about it ; only by experiencing it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Internal knowledge is something gained from personal experience , and it 's known only to the one who experiences it .Learning to explore and find the truth through personal experiences is far more sensible than believing what is not known .By studying esoteric knowledge and having out - of - body experiences , which is just a part of it , then you increase your capacity to experience life and the world , because it 's about experiencing reality , and reality is to each individual what they experience .Spirituality .Spirituality is for people .It 's not just for those who you might have read about in books , it 's for people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's not just found in an instant - it 's part of and the result of a long process of studying and transforming oneself .If you connect with the spiritual you connect with a higher reality , then you see how much value your ideas , plans , and hopes actually have and you are able to perceive what is truly precious and of value .The life of the spirit depends upon the death of the animal within A lot of people who are searching for spirituality are searching for a way to confirm their own beliefs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is a personal inner work .It 's the union with the divine .It 's between you and your Being .You do n't compete with anyone , nor do you have to show anything to anyone .The State of the World .Many look at the problems in the world and ask what can be done to solve them , but rarely will anyone ask what they can do to change themselves .The starting point of fundamental change in the world is from each individual , and it is the individual that is responsible for making it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If enough change , then it can affect the whole of a society and the world .Everything a person does and feels comes from what is within them , everything a society does comes from the individuals living within it , whatever humanity does is governed by what is within each person , and each one forms the whole .The Sun , Solstice and Equinox .The sun , source of all light and life , is central to a cosmic spirituality that is both ancient and timeless - and as ever - present as always . yay ! moses yay ! omg !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
