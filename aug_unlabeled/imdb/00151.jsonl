{"text": "It 's about a group of friends and their tangled web of feelings for one another .One day a new guy comes in , David ( aka really Kakeru ) and he can see fragments of the future .He lets the ditzy , cute girl in the group ( Toko ) know that she also can do the same .And so this sets off a series of events between the friends .I felt like the subtitles were wrong when I was watching this anime because the conversations between the characters might as well have been a mix of Swahili and German .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Person 1 : The sky is blue today is n't it ?Person 2 : I miss you and I think you should be careful of falling vases .Do you understand the point I 'm making ? ?The dialogue was an unrealistic mess for a slice of life anime .And are these people REALLY a group of friends ?Because as the anime progressed none of them really talked genuinely with each other ; they all seemed like cold strangers who kept secrets from each other more than anything .I could n't follow what was going on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sure , they all have hobbies , but as the series goes on the personalities I thought they had seem to fade away .I 'm on episode 10 and with only a few eps left until it ends , I do n't see how they can salvage the wreck it became .I 'm disappointed to say the least .I think my favorite character is Jonathan .A chicken ( or was he a rooster ? ) kept on the school grounds .He did n't talk or had magical powers .He just pecked the ground .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It could be a lot worse , for instance , if characters repeatedly said what others had just said , or like in Ruroni Kenshin where our hero repeatedly lists every person he 's ever killed along with their favorite breakfast food .This is n't like that .It 's much closer to the opening scenes in Totoro where we are introduced to the slow pace of country living .The timing in Glasslip has a lot of empty space and neither the social interactions nor the science fiction elements seem to be able to fill in the void .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To continue the comparison , Totoro builds up speed throughout the movie .This series seems stuck at the same pace throughout and to me the real suspense is whether or not it will be faster the next episode .I 'm sure for some of you this is exactly what you are looking for , in which case you should watch it and enjoy it but sadly to me it seems aimless .Do you enjoy watching paint dry ?Or watching the grass grow ?Do you enjoy spending all that time and then not being really sure whether or not the paint actually dried or the grass really grew ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "They do n't really matter anyway ... .Glasslip gets 1 star for decent animation and 1 for a pretty good soundtrack .I would give it less , but at least the story was n't OFFENSIVE , it was merely bad .Final revise at season end .Added a rough summery at the bottom of the review as a wrap up of my take on what happened .This slice of life series starts out with a beautiful blend of softer music and an animation that shifts it 's style depending on flow , focus , or spectacle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The clarity of the situations tends to suffer a bit due to an over reliance on the viewer intuitively picking up on subtleties , and in that regard it seems they are trying to force a feeling of outside looking in .We arrive with much of the social framework already engaged and in motion , and at times like hearing half a phone conversation .In this slice of life series we will bear witness to the growth and changes of these six young people as they find love , and perhaps themselves .A well established group of friends , centered around Touko Fukami , in their 3rd year of high school suddenly find themselves confronted with an enigmatic new transfer student Kakeru Okikura .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like a pebble dropping into a still pond , the arrival of Okikura is already causing ripples that will make for very interesting movements in the story .From the start some of the groups internal dynamics are already evident through the interactions and expressions of the characters , and the impression of depth to character and story is significant .Friendship and romance will battle with youthful uncertainty as feelings are expressed , and secrets revealed .Touko also learns that her mysterious visions are something more than she ever expected , but although Kakeru initially calls them fragments of the future it is more accurate to call it a transcendant insight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just like Kakeru , this show is enigmatic and mysterious .It layers metaphor like a confectionery , and even after you get below the surface you still may not get all the flavor on the first bite .Overall there is character progression for all of the main characters of some sort , but not as much as expected or made clearly discernible .Touko has an established circle of friends at the start when Kakeru shows up on his nomadic journey .Like ripples in a still pond , his arrival disrupts the artificial status quo of things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While initially perceived only as glimpses of the future , they are actually driven by a deeper insight into the world and encompass more than simple precognition .Numerous situations muddle the waters to bring more cause for confusion than answers , but the writers are short on giving up easy clues to follow .At the end she gains a better understanding of herself , as well as a clearer sense of what she really wants in life .Kakeru is essentially a catalyst for change in the show that does n't really change much itself , although he does eventually learn to accept happiness for himself where ever it can be found .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Arguably the strongest part of Glasslip , its music is at least okay .The OP is somewhat nice due to its relaxing melodies and nice use of the guitar .The ED is okay .It reminds me of Hanasaku Iroha with its singing , and while the show tries to be dramatic , the ED instead is rather upbeat .Enjoyment : .Many people started watching this show because it was tagged with the P.A Works label .And that 's fine , because they have done a splendid job with some of their recent works .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
