{"text": "I suggest we harvest another lesbian .Snakes on a Train ( 2006 )This film was produced by Asylum , so instantly you know its going to be bad .Through the whole film I was utterly bored ... until the last 30 minutes .I do n't want to spoil it but it really is just awesome , and worth it for those 30 minutes of hilarity .A woman has a zombie curse placed on her that causes snakes to live inside her , she is on her way to L.A. to be cured .Sherlock Holmes ( Asylum ) ( 2010 )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But as far as a thriller making you laugh I thought this was perfect .Red Eye was released 19th August 2005 .So , the first Jeepers Creepers I did n't think was too bad but I did n't think it was great either .It did try to keep to the horror concept no matter how unbelievable the storyline was .And then came , Jeepers Creepers 2 .Well , what can we say about this , other than the bus full of wailing teens was hilarious .Absolutley no scare factor in this film at all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "See no Evil , Hear no Evil was released on 12th May 1989 .So straight away the film was n't going to be the best when they cast a wrestler to play the leading part .Eventhough , I quite enjoyed Steve Austin in this movie , it always seems a little bit deflating with all the pretend fighting and macho brovado .So the story goes that 10 ' condemned ' to death prisoners all get dumped on an island and have to fight to the death .The last one standing gets to leave the island as a free man , or woman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So despite , the wrestling type scraps and the some - what questionable acting the film is n't too bad .I definatley enjoyed it .I really do like Vinnie Jones and the hard men he plays , he does n't disappoint in this film .It is all a little bit cheesy with all the typical one liners that come from the convicts , but overall quite a good watch .The Condemned was released on 27th April 2007 .The Running Man is set in a run down 2019 , and is centred around a television show where people have to escape serial killers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "And both are just as bad as the other with the storylines .But just had to be watched .I did actually spend money to go to the cinema and watch the The Ruins .Other than being slightly bored but unexplainably enthrauled I did end up gagging ALOUD whilst watching this film .One particular part where a girl is trying to slice her skin off to get the vines out of her body did really make me feel sick .But then they would ruin it by making the plants be able to mimic a mobile rintone .....", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "He beats Lee Evens any day of the week at the physical comedy .Farley is that fat numpti you have at work , usually in the stores or warehouse , who has to act the clown because he looks likes the clown .# UNDER SIEGE 2 : The Dark Territory # .Steven Seagal ( 1994 ) .Not a patch on the first film this ridiculous and awaited sequel for Seagal action fans sees the big man on a train journey to hell , protecting his sweet daughter and saving the world as per usual .Talk about a script written in a day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Roger Moore ( 1982 ) .Post Bond , Roger Moore did some really bad movies .In fact he never did a decent movie again .In fact his Bond films sucked so he never did a decent movie !Moore plays HMS navy frogman Rufus Excalibur ( yup ! ) , up against Anthony Perkins , who intends to blow up a North Sea platform .The funniest bit of the movie is when Moore arises from the water triumphant from his not so covert mission wearing a vermillion wetsuit ( bright orange to you and me ) , only to be greeted by the Queen , the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What are they doing there !Michael Caine ( 1978 ) .This truly awful film was one of many projects Michael Caine was attracted to after he had made his name in England .Our Mick liked his money and would take anything if the cheque was big enough .Its one of those films that is so stupid it just makes you laugh .Not only that but the African bees even mange to explode a nuclear power station in the bargain !Poor old cockney Cain even had to be called Brad Cane ( presumably the American for Michael Caine ) for his fist big American feature in that hive of Hollywood has - beens- all 2 hours 20 painful minutes of it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "# THE BONE COLLECTOR # .Denzel Washington ( 1999 ) .This has to be one of the dumbest movies ever made , the ending even dumber than that .Such is the loyalty to Ryhme for his accident in the line of duty the whole of the NYPD are prepared to work through their weekends for nothing to help capture the killer , only to fail miserably .Its just one of those films you watch and scratch you head and think that clearly no one has considered how preposterous the plot is .Just ludicrous ! # COMMANDO # .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Going Commando means something very different in the new millennium but back in the 80s it was comfortably Arnies most ridiculous movie .For 11 years it had the highest body count in the action category in Hollywood and the indestructible Colonel Matrix was that symbol of celluloid American imperial power around the world .However many magazines and bazookas were emptied into Arnie he would not die , picking out shells and bullets with his teeth between reloads .The dialogue was dire but irreverent , his first film after the huge success of Terminator allowing him to play a human version of the robot to kill with impunity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The fact George crashed a plane every film was reason enough to fire the guy from the airline , you would have thought .The Airplane films brilliantly spoofed it in the eighties , a measure on just how big these movies are .The final Airport film inevitably involved the Concorde .First they have to outrun a missile by doing barrel roles ; then they have to land without breaks , all that with the doors being blown off .This was , of course , a French Concorde .It was totally over the top trying to better the last film and when ever they pop up on terrestrial TV on a wet weekend they are just an irresistible watch to see just how cheesy and mindless action packed movies were back there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Rodney Dangerfield ( 1983 ) .It definitely fits into the so bad its good category because Dangerfield was unsure whether to play this at his uncouth comedy best or try to win a new audience or play the chubby but likeable party animal .But Rodney is only funny pulling those pig - eyed faces and cracking the one - liners , opportunities few and far between here .But boy when he is its very funny and obnoxious .The first twenty minutes of Fist of Fury is hilarious .When arriving at the funeral , wailing and unannounced , one of the monks just whacks him on the head with a frying pan , Lee , of course , falling into the grave in driving rain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
