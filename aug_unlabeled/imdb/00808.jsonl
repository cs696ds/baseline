{"text": "The area started to gain its fame right after the end of World War II and reached its peak during the 60 's and 70 's .However , long before the Triangle gained its fame and its name , the high seas of the area were full of mystery and danger for the sailors .To the south , the numerous Caribbean islands were the base of operations for ruthless pirates .To the west , and partially inside the Triangle 's area , the well - known Gulf Stream runs as a \" river in the sea \" , with a temperature and other physicochemical characteristics slightly different from those of the rest of the ocean .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Finally , at the northeast and also partially inside the Triangle , lies the Sargasso Sea , perhaps the most strange piece of ocean in the world .Sargasso .When Christopher Columbus made his journey to the New World , he encountered waters full of seaweed that made him believe he was approaching land .When he tried to measure depth , he could n't , since at some places the ocean is as much as 5.000 m deep .In the following years , the Sargasso Sea became a nightmare for sailors .In the area defined by the 20 th and 35 th north parallel and the 30 th and 75 th west meridian , a thick layer of seaweed covers the Atlantic Ocean .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The seaweed named Sargassum is reproducing on the ocean surface and remains gathered in the Sargasso Sea because of the weak sea currents .The main characteristics of the Sargasso Sea , besides the floating seaweed , are the weak currents , the higher than normal salinity and the long periods of total lack of wind .When ships were depending on the wind for their motion , a ship in the Sargasso could be trapped for weeks or even months due to weak or no winds at all .For many centuries it was known as the \" Graveyard of ships \" since there were many vessels trapped , often with their crews on board , dead from thirst and hunger .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When a ship was trapped in the Sargasso and the sailors were starting to experience thirst , they used to throw horses in the sea to save water .Many ships used to encounter floating dead horses , or horses skeletons mingled in the seaweed .For centuries , the sailors , always - superstitious beings , believed that the spirits of the horses that had died there haunted the area .The legends were fed by the frequent discoveries of abandoned ships .Many times , when a ship was trapped in the Sargasso Sea , the crew would try to escape rowing the lifeboats .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The Gulf Stream is responsible for many intense and sudden weather phenomena .When the wind is blowing strong from the northeast , the sea can get suddenly very rough with 10 - 15 m waves , capable to sink or capsize small vessels .The temperature difference between the ocean and the Stream water often creates a thick fog curtain that appears and disappears unexpectedly , approximately defining the Stream 's route in the ocean .Area morphology and characteristics .On the north and east of the Triangle there is only the Atlantic Ocean and the Sargasso Sea which is partially located inside it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Another interesting and important fact is that Fort Lauderdale had the wrong Estimated Time of Arrival ( ETA ) for Flight 19 .The Control Tower 's recorded ETA was 17.23 , a flight of 3 hours and 13 minutes .But , according to the testimonies of other trainers and pilots the duration of the specific exercise was 2 hours and 13 minutes .This detail led to crisis management mistakes .At 16.00 , when the first reports arrived from Taylor about Flight 19 being lost , Fort Lauderdale Control Tower believed that the airplanes were at least 1 hour from their ETA and therefore the fact that they did not register on radar was not something to worry about .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If that point was clear then the emergency procedures would have been initiated much earlier .What happened after 19.00 with the airplanes still flying West , remains unknown .Perhaps Taylor convinced Powers to turn again to the East .In that case they ditched in the ocean somewhere north of Grand Bahama and to the South of Georgia .Maybe they encountered strong head winds and they were out of fuel before they reached land .A third scenario has also been offered : the strong South - SouthWest winds may have carried the airplanes to the North , over Georgia and finally crashed them in the vast Okefenokee swamps .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As for why no debris or other trace of the aircraft was never found , the answer depends on where they finally crashed .If they ditched in the ocean , bad weather and the Gulf Stream flow can provide reasonable explanations .If they crashed in the Okefenokee swamps the answer is even simpler : no one ever searched there .Other Disappearances .The disappearance of Flight 19 may be the most well known but is not the only Bermuda Triangle mystery .There are dozens , or even hundreds of incidents presented by various researchers as mysterious disappearances or accidents , involving aircrafts and ships as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
