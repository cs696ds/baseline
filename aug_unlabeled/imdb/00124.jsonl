{"text": "Rand Pauluses and Minuses - Massive Disappointment in Iowa .Lions of Liberty Podcast 180 : 7th GOP Debate Reaction Show !Another year brings another Holiday that makes me slightly uncomfortable , the honored Veteran 's day .This celebration makes me uncomfortable because it requires unquestioning admiration for causes that I do n't fully endorse .Phrases like \" Keeping us safe from \" and \" preserving democracy for \" assume that the cause of the vets was some noble defense of personal freedom .This Veteran 's day provided yet another example of the kind of things that make me question this socially unquestionable holiday in the form of a special about Vietnam on the History channel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
