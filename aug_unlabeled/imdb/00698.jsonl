{"text": "For the many things The Hurt Locker got wrong from a technical standpoint , they nailed the epitaph ' War is a drug ' : . \" In the first years after returning from deployment , veterans of the two wars are 75 percent more likely to die in motor vehicle accidents than civilians of comparable age , race , and sex , according to a 2008 VA study .The rate for motorcycle deaths is an astounding 148 percent higher .\" I never had a speeding ticket until I came home from Iraq .Now I have five .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The bar has been set ridiculously low ; Redacted , the reigning champ of tasteless war movies , makes Stop Loss look like A Bridge Too Far .But do n't let the sad state of Iraq movies keep you away from the cineplex this week .Kathryn Bigelow 's The Hurt Locker is not without its narrative problems , but it 's a solid and dramatic entry that can satisfy both sides of the fence .The story follows a three man team of EOD ( explosive ordnance disposal ) techs in the final month of their deployment in Baghdad in 2004 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie 's epitaph lingers on the screen long after the words fade .War is a drug .It is clear from James ' first mission that he feeds off the adrenaline rush of bomb defusing at any cost .When he should be wearing his suit or utilizing a remote - driven robot , James goes right for his clippers , wearing nothing more than his uniform .His two subordinates , Sgt .Sanborn ( Anthony Mackie ) and Specialist Eldridge ( Brian Geraghy ) , quickly grow weary of James ' vigilante ways .As James becomes more cavalier with his work , the calendar slowly crawls toward the date they are supposed to redeploy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With James in charge , they figure , it 's only a matter of time before they get killed .The way the team goes about their missions is completely absurd .The three men drive alone , all over Baghdad and its periphery , in a single Humvee .No escorts , no convoy , just a gun truck and three soldiers .To leave a FOB in the real world , you need a minimum of three trucks , and even that is stretching it .In one scene , the solitary truck arrives on an empty street where soldiers should be setting a cordon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of them manages to point him in the direction of a suspected VBIED .Only then do soldiers beyond the EOD trio emerge to cordon off the area and evacuate local Iraqis .In a later scene , James leaves the base by himself to confront an Iraqi man about a local boy that peddles DVDs on the base .I had to bite my tongue from erupting in laughter when James , left by his hostage taxi driver , had to run all the way back to base dressed in fatigues and a sweatshirt .He could n't have been more obvious if he had shot his pistol into the air and shouted , \" COME AND GET ME ! \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I understand why Bigelow kept scenes mostly free of extras .The audience can only take so many characters in combat gear before they all start looking the same .Directing EOD to a possible bomb is tricky and cumbersome in combat .Striving for complete accuracy by showing each step of the way would bog down a movie that relies on suspenseful and a fluid narrative .The time between finding an IED and its eventual destruction can flow into hours of tedium that climax into a few moments of spectacular explosions .The script is taut and disciplined , willing to trim away the superfluous moments and get to the core of what EOD techs do .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is no war , or even earth , beyond the cordon .Just three soldiers left to tinker with homemade destruction .My chief complaint about the film is that it goes too far with this view .Besides a scene with a team of mercenaries , the team is alone outside the wire constantly .Civilians can overlook that , but those with field experience might be rolling their eyes at yet another scene involving James cutting the right wire just in time .I 've seen dozens of controlled detonations , and I ca n't think of any that had an EOD tech waltzing up to the bomb to clip wires .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It does happen , but not as frequently as the writer has you believe .In one of the final scenes , the team is called out to assess the damage of a VBIED detonation .James spots a possible escape route for the triggerman , and in a wildly implausible decision , takes his team into three separate alleys in the dead of night .Shockingly , one of the men is nearly carted off by militants .Instead of a close call changing the way James thinks about his leadership , he keeps on with his reckless self .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of course , who knows what happens when he comes back to the FOB to find a stack of Article 15s .I do n't think it was out of neglect that such unrealistic moments crept into a generally realistic movie .I applaud the efforts of the technical advisers that worked on this film .The movement of the soldiers , particularly inside an IED factory , was textbook perfect .They operated in concert , double clearing hallways and moving with an air of urgency and flow .Combat scenes from Home of the Brave and Redacted looked like they were filmed in Brian de Palma 's backyard .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They nailed the environment , the crushing paranoia of watching Iraqi bystanders eyeballing you , everything .Toward the end of the film , James is back home , crippled with Sudden Civilian Syndrome .He gazes at a wall of breakfast cereals in a grocery store , confounded about the sheer amount of choice .It is here where we see James suffering from combat withdrawal .In Iraq he was on his game , disarming bombs with a few snips .The EOD suit he wears is his real skin .When it comes off , he 's an alien on a planet he does n't understand .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Nolte feigns outrage about a scene involving a taxi driver running a roadblock .After a tense standoff , a soldier takes down the driver and violently handcuffs him .With what I imagine is a straight face , Nolte takes umbrage with the quote , \" If he was n't an insurgent , he sure as hell is now .\" Man , that was a favorite joke of mine !I said that about a man who owned a courtyard where I found two Molotov cocktails .Moments before he opened his trunk for us .It was full of whiskey , a rarity to see in a Muslim country .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I joked that next time , there would be a spring loaded boxing glove that came out .Nolte does n't realize that most people were n't too happy to see us , or consider the possibility that combat operations are a societal irritant .No , that is too complex a notion .He just decides to phone it in as a liberal slight and call it a day .There must be a shortage of veterans in West Hollywood ( tip : if someone describes their residence with a cardinal direction , they probably have a gargantuan chip on their shoulder ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Quoth the Noltmeister : \" The [ Iraqi ] men are alternately terrorists , a menacing presence , victims , the butt of jokes or utterly clueless .\" The movie is about guys who go find bombs buried in the road .What kind of person lingers around that environment John ?You guessed it .Terrorists , menacing civilians , victims and clueless people .I can agree with Marlow and Nolte that the order from a full bird to let an insurgent bleed to death is out of place , poorly staged and irrelevant to the plot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Things like that do happen , as some of you might remember ( long story short : we watched some insurgents bleed to death , and we watched a blindfolded guy die in slow agony after his house exploded and fell on top of him ) .A field grade officer ordering his men to let an insurgent bleed out is over the line though , and should have been left on the cutting room floor .It 's a shame some people ca n't look past their narrow view to enjoy the best Iraq movie to date .Though flawed with a serious case of the WTFs , The Hurt Locker more than makes up for it with technical prowess and unbelievably tense moments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That kind of audience involvement is a testament to how well crafted the story is , regardless of the basic absurdity of the plot .General moviegoers will have plenty to rave about , and seasoned vets can walk away satisfied if they willfully suspend their disbelief for a couple of hours .I 'm sure your wife or girlfriend wo n't mind that you stop whispering \" That totally would n't happen \" every five minutes .There are n't many things that instantly burn me up , but Ralph Peters just bested his personal low with remarks so outrageously ballsy it 's difficult not to admire his brazen viciousness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
