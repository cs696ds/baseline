{"text": "Huge , heartfelt thanks to Leah for transcribing this for me ; said transcript can be found below the images - click here to be taken to it .Note : The original memo was circulated 20 years ago , hurriedly by fax , and as a result the image quality is n't great .I 've cleaned it up as best as possible .Enjoy .Attached is a memo that reflects some thinking that I 've been doing over the past several weeks about our studio .My hope is that after everybody has had a chance to read it that we will sit down together to review and discuss it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Distribution : Michael Eisner Frank Wells Rich Frank David Hoberman and Disney / Touchstone Creative Staff Ricardo Mestres and Hollywood Creative Staff Dick Cook Helene Hahn Marty Katz Bob Levin Chris McGurk Bill Mechanic Randy Reiss Peter Schneider .As we begin the new year , I strongly believe we are entering a period of great danger and even greater uncertainty .Events are unfolding within and without the movie industry that are extremely threatening to our studio .Some of you might be surprised to read these words .After all , was n't Disney number one in 1990 ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Instead , it merely underscored the fact that our studio did the least badly in a year of steady decline for all of Hollywood ... a year that was capped off by a disastrous Christmas for nearly everyone .Although we led at the box office in 1990 , our bottom line profits in the movie business were the lowest in three years .Now , added to that , the nation 's economy is acknowledged to be in a recession ... a recession that I am convinced will be quite devastating to our industry .That 's the bad news .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No one is better positioned to weather the coming storm than we are .We are the current box office champ .But , more important , our underlying philosophy of moviemaking lends itself especially well to lean times .As a result , we are not only in the strongest position to succeed during a time of economic adversity , but we have the potential to establish a very high platform from which to launch into the next round of good times , whenever they may come .Make no mistake about it , ours is a cyclical business and we are once again repeating the cycle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Interestingly , even if the economic outlook were rosy , I believe we at Disney would still be due for a major self - examination .Since 1984 , we have slowly drifted away from our original vision of how to run our movie business .Once we had a fairly strict and pretty successful strategy , which we referred to as our \" Singles and Doubles Philosophy .\" There should always be room for exceptions to rules , but of late the exceptions seem to be the rule .Not surprisingly , our control of our own destiny has been eroded .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The current condition of our business is typical enough of American businesses that an entire management theory has been developed to describe it .This theory is formally called the Product Life Cycle .It holds that businesses go through a natural development process that is comprised of four stages : Introduction .Growth .Maturity and Decline .In 1984 , The Walt Disney Studios had already been through the full cycle .We arrived here fresh , energetic and ready to create an entire movie studio from the ground up .We succeeded spectacularly in growing a new business and re - starting the cycle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is why , even if there were no recession , I hope that I would be feeling as I do and would still be writing this memo .However , because of the severe economic environment we are entering , this review of our way of doing business is now not only timely , but critically essential .In good times , drift can be tolerable .In bad times , it can prove fatal .Back in 1984 , our initial success at Disney was based on the ability to tell good stories well .Big stars , special effects and name directors were of little importance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We had small budgets and not much respect .So we substituted dollars with creativity and big stars with talent we believed in .Success ensued .With success came bigger budgets and bigger names .We found ourselves attracting the calibre of talent with which \" event \" movies could be made .And , more and more , we began making them .The result : costs have escalated , profitability has slipped and our level of risk has compounded .The time has come to get back to our roots .In urging this course , I recognize that we have some serious disadvantages and some extraordinary advantages relative to when we first started out six years ago .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But this fact plays into our biggest advantage -- you .We have a proven team that has come through time and time again .Others will scramble for higher and higher ground , spending feverishly to keep their noses above water .We , on the other hand , have the internal talent , creativity and absolute ability to control our own destiny .With this strength , we can plunge in and successfully find our way no matter how strong the current .What I am asking is difficult and challenging .But it is clear that we could n't have in place a more remarkable group of able and experienced individuals to pull it off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In 1984 , when Disney was last and unprofitable , the worst that could happen was that we would remain last .Now we are Number One .Our shareholders , Wall Street and the public expect us to be a leader .Such expectations can be inhibiting .We ca n't let them be .Instead , we must lay out our goals with as clear a vision as when we were unconstrained by success .In returning to an emphasis on creative story development , there will be risk of failure , as one project or even a series of projects misses the mark .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is impossible to create new and original -- and therefore appealing -- new works without taking on the chance that you 'll fall flat on your face .Remember that before \" Pretty Woman , \" we had five misses in a row .I know that my negative outlook for our industry will be challenged by many Wall Street analysts .These pundits will argue that the film industry is recession resistant or even recession proof because , when there is fear and uncertainty in the real world , people seek escape and entertainment in their local movie theaters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When there is fear and uncertainty , the people have craved bargain entertainment .During previous downturns , the best escapist entertainment value was at the movie theaters .But no longer .The notion of the film industry being recession proof began during The Great Depression .People wanted to escape and the movies offered it cheap -- 10 cents a ticket , or the cost of a loaf of bread .Today , a ticket to the movies costs the equivalent of six or seven loaves of bread .What 's more , a family of four requires $ 20-$30 to get in to see a movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On the other hand , that same family can go to the local video store and rent a videotape for a mere $ 2.00 ... 50 cents each -- less than the cost of a loaf of bread .So , when times get tough I have no doubt that people will still want to escape to the movies , but they 'll want it for the historic cost of a loaf of bread .This may be a reason to re - think our approach to home video .Perhaps we should consider charging $ 200 for a rental title .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Such strategizing among our divisions , divorced from pre - conceived notions , is the kind of thinking we will need to cope with the recession .As big a factor as the recession is , I believe we would be making a grave mistake to blame our industry 's woes on the national downturn .Just as the seeds of a sick economy were growing before Iraq 's invasion , the seeds of a sick movie business were growing before the recession .And the seeds were planted by the \" blockbuster mentality \" that has gripped our industry .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It used to be that there was a reliable criterion for a film 's success -- whether or not it had \" legs .\" Studios would toy with different strategies for opening a film , all with the goal of helping it develop \" legs \" through positive word of mouth .Now the term \" legs \" has all but disappeared from the Hollywood vocabulary .Thanks to the dictates of the blockbuster mentality , the shelf life of many movies has come to be somewhat shorter than a supermarket tomato .With such a make - or - break emphasis on the first weekend 's numbers , studios have been cranking out highly promoted , big budget films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The result has been a paradox .In an effort to make \" risk - free \" movies , Hollywood has been willing to put tens of millions of dollars on the line with each major release .Unfortunately , our industry has travelled this road before .During the late 1950s and into the ' 60s , studios spent larger and larger amounts to produce historical epic films .This trend climaxed with the 1963 release of \" Cleopatra , \" a film that cost $ 44 million at the time -- a staggering $ 186 million in 1990 dollars .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now that we have gone full circle and many of the independents have gone under while the majors are experiencing a resurgence , it would be ironic if we failed to learn from the not - so - distant past and instead blindly go about repeating the mistakes of our mogul predecessors .Here at Disney , our biggest effort to compete in blockbuster terms , \" Dick Tracy , \" is a case in point as to how the box office mentality is affecting the moviegoing experience . \"Dick Tracy \" was in the works for nearly ten years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , we did everything that we could in order to get the film the audience and recognition we felt it deserved , including the unheard of notion of \" clothing \" our opening night audience .The result was a film that did very well , a film we were rightly proud of , a film that was critically acclaimed ... and a film that is still being savagely disparaged as \" having failed to achieve Batman - like success at the box office .\" This is not a healthy situation .Not surprisingly , this box office mania is fostering a frenzy among actors , writers , directors and their agents as they try to claim their share of the big budget pie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It seems that , like lemmings , we are all racing faster and faster into the sea , each of us trying to outrun and outspend and out - earn the other in a mad sprint toward the mirage of making the next blockbuster .In this atmosphere of near hysteria , I feel that we at Disney have been seriously distracted from doing what we do best .It is a tribute to our abilities that , even as we have strayed , we have continued to be successful .But it is instructive to re - visit the film that anchored our success in 1990 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Pretty Woman \" is in fact the kind of modest , story - driven movie we tended to make in our salad days .The extraordinary popularity of such films as \" Pretty Woman , \" \" Ghost \" and \" Home Alone \" teaches the real lesson of 1990 : Despite all the hype and promotional noise , in the end the public will search out the movies it wants to see .And these films , more often than not , will be primarily based on two basic elements -- a good story , well executed .Not stars , not special effects , not casts of thousands , not mega - budgets , not hype .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Regardless of the recession , people will still leave their VCR 's to go to the movie theater ... if they are convinced that the experience that awaits them there will be magical enough .We are lucky .We get to manufacture magic and , in so doing , produce a product that makes a difference .Most other jobs exist to create products that are purely functional .While any profession can have its rewards , the range of impact in producing shoes or cars or toothpaste is limited .Our product has no function other than to entertain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In a way , there is something quite noble about what we do .Our potential impact can not be minimized and should never be trivialized .At the same time that America has lost its dominance of the world 's economy , it has become a pre - eminent force in the world 's culture .And this is largely because of what we do .People around the world may no longer drive in American cars , build with American steel or listen to American radios .But they go see American films .They share our hopes and dreams and values when they experience the joy of a \" Pretty Woman , \" the enchantment of a \" Little Mermaid \" or the inspiration of a \" Dead Poets Society . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For the price of admission , they want to be transported to places and people they would otherwise never know .If the trip we provide is wondrous enough , then the $ 7 price for a ticket to ride will still be an exceptional bargain indeed .Especially during these economic hard times , we must not fool with the public 's expectations ... we must deliver on them .I have written this memo in the hope of offering a blueprint for a business that can deliver on the public 's expectations with some consistency .A business that can weather the economic storms because it is governed by a sensible strategy designed to foster fiscal success ... and , in the end , create magic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For this reason , there will not be any revolutionary new ideas presented in the following pages .Rather , what I want to offer is a restatement of our underlying philosophy , adapted to today 's changing times .In writing this , I take some comfort in knowing that I am preaching to the already converted .After all , together we 've built Hollywood 's number one studio largely by adhering to the concepts I 'll be expounding here .But , with greater and greater success have come greater and greater temptations to stray from our guiding principles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the dizzying world of moviemaking , we must not be distracted from one fundamental concept : the idea is king .Stars , directors , writers , hardware , special effects , new sound systems ... all of these can have a role to play in the success of a film , but they must all serve as humble subjects to the supremacy of the idea .If a movie begins with a great , original idea , chances are good it will be successful , even if it is executed only marginally well .However , if a film begins with a flawed idea , it will most certainly fail , even if it is made with \" A \" talent and marketed to the hilt .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , we need to be bold enough to stretch bounds , push the envelope of creativity and follow our hearts along with our heads .When we fail , let it be because we tried to innovate , not emulate .And , by so doing , I am convinced that we will continue to reap success .This is the key for controlling our destiny -- to have the courage to search out authentic , great ideas ... and then have the steadfastness to control the material that is subsequently developed .If the idea and the screenplay are strong , then it is possible to hire a less established star and a less established director and as a result be less of a hostage to the marketplace .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of course , this idea of internal development runs counter to the actions of many of our competitors , who have been paying $ 2 - 3 million for screenplays .While their willingness to pay such sums may be a sign of financial strength , it is also a blatant admission of creative bankruptcy .Creative studio executives should be in the business of developing ideas , not buying them .It 's a temptation we 'll keep having to resist .It 's our job to find the great idea , then nurture it and manage it until it has a shot at finding its audience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" The phrase was introduced by Michael for internal use by creative executives at Paramount as a guide for evaluating ideas .But it quickly spread throughout Hollywood and has since been widely misinterpreted and abused .\"High concept \" was intended to describe a unique idea whose originality could be conveyed briefly .The emphasis was supposed to be on \" originality \" but has come to be placed on \" briefly , \" so that today \" high concept \" is thought to mean an idea that can be summarized in a logline in TV Guide .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It makes a link between movie making and movie marketing .It embellishes the concept that \" the idea is king \" by asserting that the idea that forms the basis of a film should not only be one that is compelling but also one that can be communicated .The real meaning of high concept is that ingenuity is more important than production values .This is why we should constantly be looking for creative solutions , not financial ones .It seems that the root cause of the blockbuster mentality is the notion that one can construct a film project in such a way that it has a \" floor \" for its anticipated revenues .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is felt that this kind of film not only has a built - in audience , but that it also ensures a big opening weekend .This approach to filmmaking was seen to get its ultimate vindication with the success of \" Batman , \" which combined action and hardware with an established fictional hero and an established real - life star , Jack Nicholson .The movie that ensued became one of the all - time box office champs and landed its producers at the helm of a major studio .So , it was particularly interesting to see what happened when the blockbuster mentality got its true test last year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To be sure , international box office , cable and , especially , home video have increased the profit potential of many films and have helped some marginal films creep into the black .But these markets have never rescued a box office bomb .There simply is no such thing as a revenue floor .Those who think a major sequel is a sure financial bet , consider the fate of \" The Two Jakes \" or \" Robocop II .\" Those who think an epic , romantic movie is a sure bet , consider \" Havana .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Any film can fail at the box office .And that 's o.k .It 's part of our business .No one can know for certain what the public will want to see .So the basic problem with the above movies was n't that they were ill conceived or misguided or even bad entertainments .The problem was that they were just too expensive .So , what about \" Dick Tracy ?\" By every rational measure , it was a success .It topped $ 100 million in domestic box office , sold millions of dollars of merchandise and was by all accounts a cultural event .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As profitable as it was , \" Dick Tracy \" made demands on our time , talent and treasury that , upon reflection , may not have been worth it .The number of hours it required , the amount of anxiety it generated and the amount of dollars that needed to be expended were disproportionate to the amount of success achieved .As a company trying to bring to market 25 to 30 films a year , we simply ca n't afford to indulge in the blockbuster mentality , even as a sidelight , even as a hobby .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When there is so much at stake with the $ 40-$60 million films , an inordinate amount of time must be lavished on them in an effort to protect the massive investment .But , with a finite number of development , production , distribution and marketing people , this time has to come from somewhere else and it inevitably must come from the less costly projects .The result is a few mega - budget projects that have to do well and a bunch of smaller projects whose full potential may be jeopardized because the big projects drained away the executive attention the smaller ones needed and deserved .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Definitely not .But , we should approach them in as intelligent a manner as possible .One way to do this is represented by our Cinergi deal .Under the terms of the agreement , for five years , we will be associated with Andy Vajna , who has a very good track record in the big budget action movie business .But our relationship is merely as a distributor , allowing us to enjoy considerable upside potential with minimal downside risk .Cinergi will continue to produce big action films featuring major stars and geared toward an international market .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In this way , we should be able to profit from a business we do n't want to directly be in ourselves , while still devoting most of our energy to smaller movies , many of which will still have breakthrough potential .Another alliance we are currently working on is with Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer .Some might think that this effort runs counter to the sentiments being expressed in this memo .Nothing could be further from the truth .Don and Jerry are among the best and most responsible producers in the business .I know that the \" conventional wisdom \" holds that they can only make giant big budget movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I worked with Don for ten years and helped bring him together with Jerry .They understand the supremacy of the idea and they know what it means to get value for the production dollar .When talented people like this are available , we should be smart enough to try and find a way to bring them on under terms that make sense to us .If a deal is signed , it will be entirely unlike their Paramount contract .It will be structured so that they will be extremely well rewarded in success .But they will also be at substantial risk , along with us , in failure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Scenes From a Mall , \" \" Billy Bathgate \" and \" What About Bob ? \" are all outstanding projects .But there are too many of them .In varying degrees , each of them will require a disproportionate amount of energy on our part to achieve the level of revenues such films require .We 'll get them done , and we 'll do them right , but in the future we 'll have to do a better job of controlling our appetite .There 's a fourth Big Movie underway that should be instructive as to the kind of event film I feel we must continue to make . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But all the money will be up on the screen .And , if the film succeeds , most of the rewards will be ours .There are no giant stars , no big gross participants , we own the rights , we control the licensing and we have talent contracts covering sequels in the event it works . \"Dick Tracy \" was a great experience .It was a solid hit and an outstanding accomplishment that was remarkable for making Variety 's list of ten biggest grosser and The New York Times ' list of ten best films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And that 's too high a price to pay for any movie .We started out in 1984 as the most cost - conscious of all studios .One of our primary means for controlling costs was by avoiding the reigning stars of the moment .Instead we featured stars on the downward slope of their career or invented new ones of our own .Robin Williams suggested to Newsweek magazine that we recruited talent by standing outside the back door of the Betty Ford Clinic .The first instance of this approach to movie - making was \" Down & Out in Beverly Hills , \" a film that re - ignited the careers of its three stars , Bette Midler , Richard Dreyfuss and Nick Nolte .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But , it would be an extreme understatement to say that a Bette Midler movie today is not the same thing as a Bette Midler movie was then .In 1984 , we paid Bette only for her considerable talent .Now , we must also pay her for her considerable and well - earned celebrity .This is what might be called the \" celebrity surcharge \" that must be ante'd up when hiring major stars .And , more and more , we 've been working with the biggest stars in the industry .It 's hard to say \" no \" to the likes of Steve Martin , Bill Murray , Dustin Hoffman and Sylvester Stallone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These are the kind of luminaries who are said to be \" bankable stars .\" But , 1990 should have demolished for once and for all this notion .This concept of the \" bankable star \" maintains that there are some stars whose very presence guarantees a certain level of box office performance .If this were true , then how can one explain what happened to 1990 's vehicle for 1989 's \" most bankable star , \" Jack Nicholson , to say nothing of the heralded return to the screen of Robert Redford ?The fact is that \" bankability \" places too much of a burden on the star .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "These kinds of deals can only make sense if a star 's presence can absolutely guarantee monstrous success for a film .And , as we have seen , there are no such guarantees .Unreasonable salaries coupled with giant participations comprise a win / win situation for the talent and a lose / lose situation for us .It results in us getting punished in failure and having no upside in success .We have to find ways to make deals with major stars that work for everyone .And we have to summon the energy to go out and find the new people who have just as much talent and will be the stars of the future .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Her soft features and gentle manner never allow her to seem appropriately lethal or menacing , which is crucial to the role .In the end , Aeon Flux suffers its inevitable fate by refusing to take any of the chances that made the animated series such a sensation .The filmmakers have diluted all the elements ( moral ambiguity , raw sensuality , brutal violence , and a playful sense of the absurd ) that created this unique world in order to satisfy commercial interests and make it more palatable to the widest possible audience .Their one feeble attempt at homage , the signature image of Aeon capturing a fly in her eyelash , opens the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Disc : .The Widescreen Special Collector 's Edition of Aeon Flux actually contains a few features that are worth investigating .If anything , the copious behind - the - scenes footage is useful in illustrating how much earnest time and effort goes into making a bad movie .I felt a slight pang of remorse about savaging the film after listening to everyone give voice to their best intentions in on - set interviews .The disc contains the original theatrical trailer and no fewer than five making - of featurettes , each focusing on a specific aspect of the production . \" Creating a World : Aeon Flux \" documents the evolution ( or in this case devolution ) of the film from its cartoon origins and includes numerous storyboard details and clips from the animated series .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As I recall , even the gaffer and key grip were quite impressed with Ms. Theron 's courage and athleticism in the fight scenes . \"The Locations of Aeon Flux \" ranks as the best of the lot as we gain insight into the enviable job of location scout .Originally , Kusama wanted to shoot in the striking city of Brasilia , Brazil because of its jungle location and futuristic architecture but the budget would n't allow it .They eventually settled on Berlin , which itself had no shortage of otherworldly buildings and promising interior spaces .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" The Stunts of Aeon Flux \" predictably sings the praises of Theron and cast members who did the majority of their own stunts and wirework .The actors trained for over three months in gymnastics and martial arts but surprisingly little of that comes across onscreen .\" The Costume Design Workshop of Aeon Flux \" spends an inordinate amount of time detailing the decision - making process on each and every little piece of fabric .Enough already .Finally , a short feature , \" The Craft of the Set Photographer on Aeon Flux \" , introduces us to a lively Aussie shutterbug who shares how he captures some truly gorgeous stills that will be used for posters and promotion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It contains two commentary tracks that run with the feature .The first one has Theron and producer Gale Ann Hurd in a mutual lovefest that borders on nauseating .It 's full of so many platitudes about the \" craft \" of filmmaking and Hurd steps over herself so often to praise her star that it 's difficult to glean anything even remotely useful from their comments .Theron does spend some time discussing her fairly serious neck injury ( she herniated a disc just ten days into production ) which caused the set to shut down for five weeks while she recovered and started a wave of rumors that the film was in jeopardy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The second commentary track , featuring screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi , is much more lively and insightful .Though many of their jokes fall flat , they both maintain a sense of humor throughout and do n't hesitate to point out the schizophrenic nature of the finished film .Although it 's a familiar lament of frustrated scribes everywhere ( They cut up my masterpiece ! ) , it is fun to hear them express their dismay at a key line or sequence that was cut in the name of commerce .They repeatedly hint at an underlying conflict between their artistic vision and that of the studio suits who seemed intent on dumbing things down whenever possible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
