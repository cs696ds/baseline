{"text": "May I do the same ? PIP-PETA euthanizes animals because they are proponents of \" animal welfare , \" meaning they support the humane treatment of animals , but ( at face value at least ) do not push for \" animal rights \" which demands no animal should be killed .For instance , the National Conference on Organized Resistance , the largest annual anarchist gathering on the East Coast , features ALF / ELF tabling , literature , and seminars .PETA does not attend .If any of you are into podcasts , the \" Vegan Freak \" podcast is one of the best animal rights podcasts out there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
