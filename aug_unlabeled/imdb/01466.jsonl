{"text": "As the director explains in the interview elsewhere on this site , these were conscious choices .From the start , the idea of a third Tetsuo went hand - in - hand with either American funding or location shooting and over the years Tsukamoto never shook off the connection .As Steven Brown notes in his recent book Tokyo Cyberpunk , Tsukamoto 's filmmaking and particularly the original Tetsuo is profoundly transnational .Blade Runner , Alien , The Fly , and Godzilla were all influences of equal importance on the 1989 epoch - making indie .So with Tetsuo : The Bullet Man Tsukamoto at last gets his chance to overtly pay tribute to his influences by making an English - language , Japanese - funded film shot in Tokyo featuring a very international cast doing their own riffs on one of the icons of contemporary Japanese cinema .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Tsukamoto himself returns as The Guy , the one - time metal fetishist turned depressed and suicidal lone terrorist , who hopes to get a final dose of kicks from pushing Anthony over the edge by driving a car over his little son .Tsukamoto 's performance and appearance here are more reminiscent of his turn as the villain Zero in Nightmare Detective than of The Guy 's previous incarnation as the youthful and charismatic cult leader in Tetsuo II .All these details and touches make Tetsuo : The Bullet Man a film that is ( somewhat inevitably ) always referring to the past , as well as to other works of cinema .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With Miike having gone on to direct the likes of 13 Assassins and Zebraman 2 , and Kurosawa delivering the astonishing Tokyo Sonata , the latter has been the case so far .But what about Tsukamoto ?After all , back in 1992/93 , many of those who had championed the original Tetsuo : The Iron Man three years earlier decried the switch to colour , the elevated budget and the perceived conventional style .Very similar arguments have been heard in response to Tetsuo : The Bullet Man - though regarding Tetsuo II the objections seem to have largely been forgotten .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It not only has the considerable legacy of the first two films to fight against , but also the spectre of the Tsukamoto / Tarantino / Tim Roth / Roger Avary version that never was .Seen from this angle , the film was and always will be up against a fantasy in fans ' heads that is sweeter , cooler , and better than any actual hands - on film could ever be .Filling Tetsuo 's boots is one thing , filling imaginary boots is quite another .So what of the criticism ?A fair share of the blows were dealt to the fact that Tetsuo : The Bullet Man is largely spoken in English .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Or are we now at last noticing shortcomings of which we were never aware because their being committed by Japanese people in their own language made us either incapable of judging them or made us qualify them , consciously or otherwise , as pleasingly exotic ?No , the language and delivery of Tetsuo : The Bullet Man never were shortcomings in the first place , but stylistic choices .Tsukamoto 's use of the digital camera - a technical mark - up comparable to the switch to colour on Tetsuo II - picks up where he left off with Haze and will likely constitute the future for the eternal independent Tsukamoto .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Should this prove to be the case , Tsukamoto 's embracing of the digital format will at least alleviate this predicament somewhat , giving the director more flexibility to shoot where , as , and when he pleases .It is not entirely unlikely that a further evolution in his style will be the result .And if anyone 's creative evolution in Japanese film has been a consistently fascinating process to observe , it is Tsukamoto 's .The weaknesses apparent here are of another nature .The director 's intentional switch to a more reasoned , expositional form of narrative sits rather uncomfortably with the purely erratic process of the Iron Man 's transformation , as well as with the above mentioned stylized performances .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Admittedly , this is somewhat of a challenge when said protagonist has a metallic head the size of beach ball and drools motor oil from its no less deformed mouth .And so , a crucial factor in the way the film wants to appeal to its audience is lost .The other problem , though less immediately apparent , is the absence of eroticism .The first Tetsuo was deeply fetishistic , and it overtly and irreverently explored various forms of sexual deviance , natural and otherwise .This approach was abandoned in Tetsuo II through the choice of making the protagonist a husband and father , but was replaced by a strong current of homoeroticism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A few verbal gripes by The Guy aside , sexuality is wholly absent .The first physical sign of affection between husband and wife occurs just before the end credits .Even the aforementioned Oedipal issues are explored through the tensions between father and son only , leaving the dramatic and erotic potential of the presence of the perfectly preserved young body of the departed mother unused .That she is played by Yuko Nakamura , who demonstrated a good deal of erotic charisma in her roles as a stripper in Naomi Kawase 's Hotaru and as a kinky call girl in Hitoshi Yazaki 's Strawberry Shortcakes , makes one lament this missed opportunity all the more .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Did the man who infused eroticism into metallic mutants , breast amputation , and a dissected corpse , to name but a few examples , find himself suddenly tongue - tied and blushing at having to deal with the ( naked ) foreign body ?For all the psychology broached in the film , perhaps this is Tetsuo : The Bullet Man 's most revealing insight .Tetsuo : The Bullet Man IS a true Tetsuo film as well as a true Tsukamoto film .There is no doubt about this ; it represents another step in the evolution of both .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
