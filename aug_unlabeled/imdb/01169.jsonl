{"text": "Quicklinks .Beautiful Film .\" The object of this massive tribute died as he had always lived , without wealth , without property , without official title or office .Mahatma Gandhi was not the commander of armies , nor the ruler of vast lands .He could not boast any scientific achievement or artistic gift .Yet men , governments , dignitaries from all over the world , have joined hands today to pay homage to the little brown man in the loin cloth , who led his country to freedom .\" This quote is from the funeral scene in the 1982 film \" Gandhi \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film opens with Gandhi 's assassination .The next scene , his funeral , is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history .Attenborough managed to recreate Gandhi 's funeral on January 31st , 1981 , the 33rd anniversary of the actual funeral .It is estimated that nearly 400,000 people were on hand to be a part of the filming the recreation .This film was made before CGI ( computer generated images ) , so the funeral scene is probably the last live action crowd of that magnitude that will ever be filmed .Mahatma Gandhi 's message of non - violent resistance is delivered in an interesting and enthralling body of art .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Gandhi \" serves both as entertainment and an important historical record of one of the most important figures in history .Ben Kingsley played Gandhi .He was the perfect for the role .He resembled the real Gandhi .He was young enough to portray Gandhi as a young man .He is a British actor that nailed the British influenced Indian accent .He is a wonderful actor that was patient and humble with such an important part .And he was a relatively unknown actor at the time , so the \" big - time actor \" persona did not get in the way of viewing the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He became Gandhi .The cinematography was outstanding .Attenborough filmed \" Gandhi \" on location in India .The scenes of India are spectacular , and India is very much another character in the film .This film is as much about India itself as it is about Gandhi .Attenborough shows the audience the people of India from its countryside to the vast city of Calcutta .It is suggested by Kingsley , on the DVD , that Attenborough had a difficult time with the elite class in India at the time of filming .They were against the making of such a film by an Englishman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Every crowd scene , he used real Indians from the area .Attenborough also won both the Academy Award and Golden Globe for best direction .This movie is a must see for everyone .It should be required viewing in high schools , as part of History class .The fight against prejudice will forever be relevant .It is also a beautiful work of art .This movie is not tainted by the embellishment of Hollywood ( see \" Pearl Harbor \" for that ) .Of course , it would have been hard to screw up a movie about such a great man .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As soon as I finished watching Gandhi , I thought to myself \" This movie had to have won Best Picture .\" I think it 's one of the best epics of all time .It masterfully tells one of the most important stories of the 20th century , that of India 's struggle to free itself , spearheaded by one of the most extraordinary men of all time , Mahatma Gandhi .I would be hard pressed to name anything lacking about it .Direction , cinematography , costumes , they 're all great .And Ben Kingsley !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Playing the pacifist Indian lawyer - turned - leader could n't have been an easy task , and I do n't think anyone could have pulled it off as well as he did .This movie deserves all the praise anyone gives it and more .Excellent .A true epic , in every sense of the word .Very , VERY few films have had the distinct ability to move and inspire me to the point where the effect is almost life - altering .\" Gandhi \" - the unbelievable , first - rate biopic on the historical figure - is truly one of those films , no question whatsoever .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As a matter of fact , ever since I first saw the film , and became much more aware of the back story , I can also say that Gandhi is now one of my biggest role models in life .I can not fully express how much this great man 's way of thinking - his words , his struggles , his accomplishments - has affected my own , for I am now a practicing pacifist .I am a firm believer in the value of non - violent protest , and have tried my best to apply that philosophy to most situations in my life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like I said , VERY few films can do something like that to me .Took nearly twenty years to make - not a single minute was wasted .Here indeed is one of the great films of the 20th Century about one of the greatest men of the 20th Century .Ben Kingsley 's interpretation of the Mahatma must go down in history as one of the most perfect cinema r\u00f4les ever carried out .Throughout the long film you forget you are watching an actor playing the part of a great man in history : you are watching the real Gandhi .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Richard Attenborough 's patient and perfect directing added all the superlatives possible to make a crowning achievement , transporting biographic films into another dimension .It is all there : from the most intimate and poignant portrait to the incredible crowd scenes , beautifully captured in the most painstaking photography .Enthralling : how such a cinematographic work of art can reach such proportions is truly amazing ; this film is nothing less than a miracle .During 1971 I travelled a good bit around India ; I constantly had to apologise to energetic Indians who approached me on the subject of the British Raj .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But as a young and unappointed ambassador , I felt it my duty to bow my head in that country which is a microcosm of the whole planet .Thanks to this film , ' Gandhi ' , Attenborough and Kingsley have said just about all there was to say .Better than you 'd think ... .Thinking back , I suppose I have now seen many ( sometimes good ) films that follow the same recipe : One man makes a difference .But this film is an exception in so many ways : .This film does not bother the viewer with an opening montage of scenes of the main character at various ages ( \" Dragon \" , I 'm looking at you ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With its subtle relevance to today 's situations in that part of the world , this is a history buff must - see .Watch this film and see great performances ( an obvious oscar went to Ben Kingsly ) , excellent cinematography , and a wonderful inspiring story , whose essence soars well above the corny , do - gooder mentality of other pitiful efforts of \" bio - pics \" .Great Man , Great Story , Great Film !This is one that absolutely must go on everyone 's \" must see \" list .One of the truly greatest movies ever made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For those who like to actually see real human history come to life on the screen , \" Gandhi \" is a true masterpiece for all times .A excellent summary of one of the greatest and most interesting lives of the 20th . century !I find it odd that aside from a fine performance in \" Shindler 's List , \" that Ben Kingsley has really been a major disappointment as an actor following his role as \" Gandhi . \" Perhaps like George C. Scott in \" Patton , \" he was destined to play just one truly great role as an actor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For those who keep mentioning that Kingsley is \" English , \" well , yes he is , but he is also \" Anglo - Indian . \"His father is from India .In fact his father was born in the same small sea - coast town as Mahatma Gandhi !While filming the movie in the small towns of rural India , there were those older people who actually remembered seeing the original Gandhi who collapsed in shock when they saw Kingsley in his makeup .Hundreds became convinced that he actually was the Mahatma , returned !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I mean that 's just a tad spooky , no .... ?Making of Mahatma 's movie .Picture this .Gandhiji walks in a court , accused of influencing the people and starting a movement , the Non Cooperation movement , immediately after Gandhiji broke the fast he started to curb the movement which had assumed violence after Chauri Chora .We walks in alone , unescorted and as soon as he walks in there is an unexplainable silence in the court , and to everyone 's surprise the Judge , stands up in respect of the accused !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This scene though may seem insignificant on paper is one without which this entire movie would have been incomplete .To know why read on !On day of 2nd October they play this movie every year on DD National , Richard Attenborough 's Gandhi .I never watched it whenever it was shown since 20 years of 2nd Octobers I had seen .The first few years because I could n't understand and the next few because I felt that though it 's a multiple Oscar winner , how could at the end of the day , a British person understand and do justice to an Indian icon ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A picture is worth a thousand words and a scene without words is worth a million .Like the first scene I described and others .In one scene towards the end of the movie , Gandhiji starts a fast until death to stop the communal riots post independence and Nehru goes to meet him .A crowd had gathered near his residence and one of the person in the crowd shouted a suggestion , ' Why do n't they kill Gandhi ? ' , Nehru furiously jumps into the crowd to search for this person and the camera moves in the crowd and for a briefest time and quite unmistakably you spot Nathuram Godse in the crowd .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So what about the outsider theory ?Well you see if Rajkumar Santoshi , Yash Chopra , Raj Kapoor or Mani Ratnam had made this movie they would have fallen under the pressure and the unbearably weight of historical facts , Richard had that advantage .Someone quite ignorant about Indian culture was telling a story of an Indian to an audience even more ignorant .What I mean is that there are things which are skewed up , characters gone wrong and famous words mouthed by someone else .For example the writer has messed the character of the Patel Siblings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Again it is a known fact that Vallabhai continued the Dandi march after Gandhi 's arrest , the fact which is ignored .Once again the characters of Kriplani , Maulana Azad etc are all skewed .But at the end of it works , why , because Richard 's view is focused .I would notice these mistakes because I am an Indian aware of this , a person in England may never find out and even if he does he would consider it as trivial because this is a story of Gandhi and not the Indian freedom struggle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But before I end my take on this movie I must comment on the characterization .Starting with Ben Kinsley as Gandhi .To tell you the truth when I first saw him as Mohandas KG in the train I was shocked , he did n't look like Gandhi which I imagined , but as the movie goes ahead I changed my opinion .Ben worked because of multiple reasons .The first he is a British Gujarati , Gandhi was gujarati who did his law in England so both speak the same language , Partly British English with unmistakable Gujarati overtones .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ben did carry some more body than others and which made Gandhi look more real , more alive .Also he had an infectious little smile which works because Gandhi in many was a jovial happy person who smiled a lot , a kind smile of calm which no one but Ben Kinsley brought out !Of the other characters , Martin Sheen as Walker was impressive , so were Lord Erwin , Gen Dyer , Margrets , Nehru and Miraben 's characters .Rohini Hattangidi as Kasturba does a remarkable job too , though she was shown a little more extroverted than Kasturba was , maybe .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you missed it this 2nd October do n't forget to tune into it the next .Gandhi 's Umpteenth Fast .In her diary entry of Saturday , February 27 , 1943 , Anne Frank wrote in passing ( translated from the Dutch ) : \" The freedom - loving Gandhi of India is holding his umpteenth fast .\" It 's a comment at once mildly comical and respectfully admiring , one I think the Mahatma would have appreciated with a twinkle and a laugh .He and Miss Frank are linked with the Reverend Martin Luther King , Jr. , as the civil rights spokesperson - giants of the 20th century .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Movie viewers are apt to find in the diary remark a distillation of their experience of the Richard Attenborough film .A recommendation is that it be followed by rentals of Saving Private Ryan and The Long Walk Home , which together convey the investment put into the respective causes the trio represented .At the beginning of Gandhi we confront these words : \" No man 's life can be encompassed in one telling .There is no way to give each year its allotted weight , to include each event , each person who helped to shape a lifetime .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "John Briley 's screenplay accomplishes that faithfulness , and one probably has to be a scholar of the subject to sort out what is his and what is Gandhi 's .Not that it really is of relevance , given what we learn from the movie about the value of eclecticism .Looking out over the bay at Porbandar , Gandhi ( Ben Kingsley ) tells Walker ( Martin Sheen ) : \" The temple where you were yesterday is of my family 's sect , the Pranami .It was Hindu of course , but the priests used to read from the Muslim Koran and the Hindu Gita , moving from one to the other as though it mattered not at all which book was read as long as God was worshipped . \" In a preceding scene , similarly , confronted by young toughs on a South African street , Gandhi defends for his Christian friend Charlie ( Ian Charleson ) the New Testament intelligence of turning the other cheek .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't think our Lord meant ... , \" and is interrupted by a movie shot of the approaching menace .Gandhi replies calmly , \" I 'm not so certain .I have thought about it a great deal .I suspect he meant you must show courage -- be willing to take a blow -- several blows -- to show you will not strike back -- nor will you be turned aside ....And when you do that it calls upon something ... that makes ... hate for you diminish and ... respect increase .I think Christ grasped that and I .. have seen it work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kingsley is sublime in the lead role .Saeed Jaffrey , Roshan Seth , and Alyque Padamsee do well as Gandhi 's pro - independence collaborators .Ditto , Athol Fugard ( \" Assuming we are in agreement ? \" ) and John Gielgud ( \" Salt ? \" ) as two of his adversaries .Charleson , in his clerical collar , looks like he has walked in off the set of the preceding year 's Academy Award winner , Chariots of Fire ( where he played the Scottish sprinter - missionary , Eric Liddell ) .This movie won eight Oscars , with Attenborough , Briley , and Kingsley all earning honors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It will stand the test of time and inform multiple generations .One doubts remakes will be necessary .Old - Time Hollywood Epic Redux .Long , opulent , breath - taking and completely memorable take on one of the most important historical figures the world has ever known .Oscar - winning director Richard Attenborough obviously studied David Lean 's epic film - making masterpieces from the 1950s and 1960s as we have similarities galore with \" The Bridge on the River Kwai \" and much more importantly \" Lawrence of Arabia \" .Make no mistake of it though , \" Gandhi \" works because of Kingsley as he weaves a colorful tapestry of cinematic performing ungodliness with a totally convincing take on his role and the complex subject matter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
