{"text": "The 17 Best Western Movies .The 17 Best Western Movies .Few figures in history have had as powerful an impact on American masculinity as the cowboy .For over a century , the cowboy has - for better or for worse - been a standard of rugged individualism and stoic bravery for the American male .While the mythologization of the American cowboy began all the way back in the 1880s with dime novels and Wild West shows , it was n't until the advent of twentieth century cinema that the cowboy cemented his place as an icon of manliness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many of the early silent films at the beginning of the 20th century were Westerns , the most famous being 1903 's The Great Train Robbery .During the 1920s , the Western film genre produced some of Hollywood 's first megastars such as Tom Mix and William S. Hart .These early Westerns were heavy on action , but light on plot .Their primary goal was to simply entertain .It is n't until the 1930s that the Western became an avenue for telling stories with searching and hard - hitting messages .Directors and screenwriters used the genre to overtly and symbolically explore the pressing subjects of their day like racism , nationalism , capitalism , family , and honor - issues deeply meshed with manhood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Instead of taking on bad guys with a posse , the protagonists in these mid - century Westerns ( Shane and High Noon being the best examples ) were loners who were compelled by their own values to fight against wrong while those around them cowered in fear like sheep .The tenor of Westerns changed once again during the cultural , social , and political upheaval of the 1960s .Like many films during that time , the antihero now took center - stage , and the heroes in these films were typically outlaws who were fighting against a corrupt system of justice and inequality ( see Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was n't until the late 80s and early 90s that the genre returned to prominence in film and TV .Reflecting the post - modern era in which they were made , these more recent Westerns are much more morally ambiguous ( Unforgiven ) or satirical and/or comedic ( City Slickers ) than their earlier counterparts .Because the Western has played such a huge role in the shaping of American masculinity ( not to mention simply being enjoyable entertainment ) , I thought it only proper to highlight some of the best from the genre .Below you 'll find my picks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It goes without saying that John Wayne makes an appearance in several of these films .Enjoy .High Noon is film about being torn between duty and love and standing up for what you believe in , even when everyone else abandons you .Gary Cooper plays Will Kane , a town marshal from New Mexico , who settles down with his pacifist Quaker wife ( played by Grace Kelly , one of your grandpa 's babes ) .Kane 's plans to retire to a peaceful life are interrupted after he gets word that a former gunslinger is coming in on the noon train to settle an old score with him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He has a duty to defend the town and his honor .Will finds himself alone in the battle as everyone in town , including his deputy sheriff , have turned away from him .The tension builds , leading up to the final gun battle - the quintessential mano - a - mano showdown that historians say rarely actually happened in the Old West , but has become an indelible part of popular culture .This is the movie that made John Wayne a star and set the standard for all subsequent Westerns ( some would say it set the standard for all 20th century cinema ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All of the characters have their own personal demons that they 're running from and the journey through the treacherous Apache territory in many ways serves as a symbolic road to redemption for each of them .The acting and screenplay is top notch .Despite being filmed in 1939 , the movie is still fresh and engaging .Be on the lookout for the epic chase scene featuring one of the most famous movie stunts of all time performed by Yakima Canutt .Best line : \" Well , there are some things a man just ca n't run away from .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Technically this is n't a movie , but rather a TV mini - series , but I do n't care .Lonesome Dove is a Western every man should see .Even if you do n't like Westerns , you 'll love Lonesome Dove .Its themes of friendship , regret , and love will resonate with any man .The action scenes are just icing on the cake .Based on the Pulitzer Prize - winning novel by Larry McMurty , Lonesome Dove follows two retired Texas Rangers - Augustus McCrae ( Robert Duvall ) and Woodrow Call ( Tommy Lee Jones ) - as they lead a cattle drive from South Texas all the way to Montana .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The costumes , the locations , even the way the characters speak make you feel like you 've been plopped on a horse in 1876 America .But what really separates Lonesome Dove from the rest of the Westerns on this list ( and I 'd go as far as saying most movies ever made ) are the characters .Thanks to top - notch writing and acting , Lonesome Dove is one of those rare movies that makes you feel like its fictional characters are real life people .Not only that , you feel like old friends with them by the end .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Do yourself a favor and rent the complete series and watch it .You 'll be a better man for it .Trivia : Our son 's name - Augustus McKay - was inspired by August McCrae .That 's how much I love this book and movie .Cinema often glorifies the Old West as a mythic time when good guys wore white and the bad ones wore black .In Unforgiven , director / actor / producer Clint Eastwood shines a light on the dark , violent , and morally ambiguous aspects of life in frontier America .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now , he 's just a quiet and tired farmer who is a devoted father still mourning his dead wife .But Will 's old life comes back to haunt him when he 's asked to do a hit on a cowboy who slashed the face of a prostitute .Will is transplanted from his farm in Kansas to a town in Wyoming where he meets Sheriff Little Bill Daggett ( Gene Hackman ) , a mean son - of - a - bitch who is determined to not let the hit go down , no matter what it takes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Best line : \" Hell of a thing , killing a man .You take away all he 's got and all he 's ever gon na have .\" This is a great sheepdog movie .A quiet gunslinger who is trying to escape his past befriends a pioneer family that has settled out west .He attempts to settle down and become a hired hand to the family , but the ranchers who want to drive cattle through the homesteaders ' property are attempting to push them out .Shane tries to stay out of the disputes , but keeps being drawn in and is finally compelled to put his six shooter back on to protect his adoptive family .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Best line : \" A gun is a tool , Marian ; no better or no worse than any other tool : an axe , a shovel or anything .A gun is as good or as bad as the man using it .Remember that . \" Based loosely on the real lives of Western outlaws Robert LeRoy Parker ( aka Butch Cassidy ) and Harry Longabaugh ( aka the Sundance Kid ) , Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a classic movie about two buddies trying to make it in a changing world .What 's funny about this flick is that you forget that these guys were hardened criminals who robbed banks and trains for a living .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Their clever hijinks and humor make the movie an enjoyable ride .Inspired by the classic Japanese film Seven Samurai , The Magnificent Seven follows a group of seven American gunfighters who band together to defend an oppressed Mexican village .This film has it all : great story , great cast , and one of the most iconic movie scores of all time .Best line : \" It 's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun .Nothing big about that .\" What happens to a man when he 's consumed by obsession ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "John Wayne plays Thomas Dunson , a determined and sometimes ruthless man who has the goal of forming the largest cattle ranch in America .With nothing but his trusty trail - hand ( Walter Brennan ) and a young boy who survived an Indian attack on his wagon train ( Montgomery Clift ) , Dunson does just that .To make money , though , he 's got to get the cattle to market , so Dunson sets out to drive thousands of cattle from Texas to Missouri .Along the way , Dunson 's brutal and dictatorial leadership causes his young protege and adopted son to mutiny and take the cattle from Dunson .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Does he do it in the end ?You 'll have to watch the movie to find out .The Good , the Bad and the Ugly is the last in Sergio Leone 's trilogy of \" spaghetti westerns . \"Despite being the last , it has come to stand on its own .Even if you have n't seen the film , you probably know something about it .Most likely you 've heard the iconic theme song with its spooky \" wha wha wha \" shouts .And you 've probably seen images and scenes of Clint Eastwood wearing a poncho and smoking a cigar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's not much of a deep message in this film .It 's just a lot of fun to watch .Hired by a young girl to track down the man that killed her father , Jeff Bridges takes on the role of Rooster Cogburn , the marshal with \" grit \" enough to bring the man to justice .The 2010 version is definitely better than the 1969 John Wayne version .Bridges simply did a superior job portraying Rooster Cogburn , and thanks to the Coen brothers , the movie just seemed more real and alive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Set in 1913 , the West by then was no longer \" wild .\" The old rule of \" might makes right \" had been replaced by government - dispensed justice .Moreover , technology had made many of the skills and know - how needed to survive and thrive in the Wild West obsolete .Sensing that their time is up , a group of outlaws decide to go out in a blaze of glory and gore .The Wild Bunch was and is a controversial film .Its violence and nihilism paints a bleak picture of life at the end of the American West .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just as the outlaws in the film were out of step with a changing society , so too were Westerns out of step with 1969 America .It 's interesting to note that very few new major Westerns were produced after The Wild Bunch was released in 1969 .Director Howard Hawks made this film in reaction to High Noon .Both he and John Wayne despised what they saw as the wimpy and unmanly lack of resolve in Gary Cooper 's character .I 'm not sure I agree with Wayne and Hawks about that , but that 's a debate for another day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Editor 's Note : I added this one after initial publication .I ca n't believe I forgot to put it in !Lots of other great suggestions in the comments too , by the way .This 2007 film directed by Andrew Dominik is the film version of the 1983 novel of the same name .Brad Pitt stars as Jesse James with Casey Affleck taking on the role of his killer , Robert Ford .When James ' gang plans a train robbery in Missouri , Ford makes multiple attempts to join the gang .Ultimately , Ford gets rejected by James , and so sets out to get revenge .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
