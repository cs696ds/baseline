{"text": "Unfortunately I had a day job , and no time to log , much less edit all of it .In desperation I hired another friend , an editor , to look at all the footage and choose the three \" best \" tapes .Meanwhile , I was off at my day job , writing technical books for an Internet company so I could pay the mortgage and feed the family .It was clear to me that I needed a better way to go about making an unscripted documentary .Filmmaker Dorothy Fadiman has been making successful unscripted documentaries for 30 years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She began by telling me of how she made the award - winning documentary Why Do These Kids Love School ?My videographer , Peter , and I chose to spend our first day of shooting in the schoolyard of an alternative school .We were ready to record whatever happened .Peter waded into a group of twenty nursery school students .Soon the children forgot about the camera .He filmed as they screamed with excitement , dunking fat brushes into cans of paint , bristles dripping with thick wet color as they painted their climbing equipment , and sometimes each other .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He knew , intuitively , how to spot \" the action .\" I watched as he followed a little boy with golden curls who was starting to cry .The child ran over to his teacher to tell her he was sad .She leaned toward him to listen .As Peter came closer , the camera microphone picked up the little boy 's words , \" John splashed paint in my ear .\" The teacher asked , \" Did you tell him you did n't like it ? \" The boy shook his head \" No , \" then turned toward the other little boy , who was now far across the schoolyard .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The camera microphone picked up his voice as he announced , with determination , \" John !Do n't splash paint in my ear ! \"Later , during an on - camera interview the school 's director told me , \" We do n't label children 's behavior as good or bad , we look at what 's working and what is n't working , and that makes sense to kids . \"Her statement explained why no one was reprimanded in the paint - splashing episode .When edited together , the interview and the unplanned paint - splashing episode graphically illustrated the school 's approach to education .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some filmmakers write a treatment , proposal and script before they begin shooting .Fadiman 's approach is different .After some initial background research , she assembles a crew , contacts interviewees , and starts filming .She watches each day 's footage , chooses the best clips , and allows the film 's story to emerge .She says that the key to this approach is to be ready for moments that can become the heart of the story as you are filming .Fadiman cautioned that the absence of a blueprint does not mean grabbing the camera and running out to shoot whatever you see .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
