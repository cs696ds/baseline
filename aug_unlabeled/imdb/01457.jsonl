{"text": "In 32 years there was only one times where I watched a movie thinking it was the first time I was watching it .Well , now this has happened in the past two challenges as last month I watched WEIRD SCIENCE thinking it was for the first time and now last night I watched CREEPOZOIDS .Creepozoids ( 1987 ) : star::star :In the distant future ( year 1998 ) , a group of survivors find an abandoned building as they are trying to find safety .You see , the world was pretty much destroyed by monstrous creatures and this group just wants to live in peace but soon they realize that they 're not alone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One is that it was his first film shot on 35 mm and another reason is that it features Linnea Quigley in the shower .CREEPOZOIDS is often called one of the worst films of the decade but I think those comments are rather harsh when you consider this was shot in just 15-days with a $ 150,000 budget .The film is n't like most of its type as this here at least tries to do something big .I say that because usually these types of films just feature people walking around and getting killed one - by - one but off camera .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The monster is obviously fake but this does n't take away from the entertainment as he 's constantly going after people .The end results includes all sorts of blood effects but also plenty of goo being thrown around .The death scenes are n't all that memorable but at least they 're fun and just wait until you see the exploding eye .Even these effects are n't the greatest but they 're at least fun and that 's good enough .At just 68-minutes ( without the end credits ) the film really does feel like the type of \" B \" picture from the 1950s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fans of Quigley will enjoy her sequence in the shower and there 's no question that she 's quite charming here delivering some pretty bad lines .Most people are n't going to want to watch a low - budget film like this but if you enjoy campy \" B \" movies then there 's plenty to enjoy here .Phantom from Space ( 1953 ) : star::star : W.

{"text": "The film runs 75-minutes , which at times feels long but there 's also no question that this film tries to do a bit more than your typical drive - in fluff from this period .I thought the screenplay was actually decent as it tried to bring some real thought to the stuff going on .This includes the various ways they try to figure out what this creature is .I thought Wilder actually made a good looking film that at least looks very professional and it 's even more impressive considering the budget and the no - name cast .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Another major plus is the look of the actual alien when we do finally get to see it .I 'm not going to ruin how it 's revealed but once you see it and the position he 's in , it 's certainly not something you 'd expect to see from 1953 .There are still many problems with the film including the pacing , which is n't all that strong .Another problem is some of the early stuff where stock footage and narration are used to tell the story .PHANTOM FROM SPACE certainly is n't a classic but fans of \" B \" films will know there 's much worse out there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It really does seem like the filmmakers just found some abandon buildings and run - down neighborhoods to film in .Outside of the look , the film also delivers on some rather generic looking action scenes with Van Damme doing his best during them .These scenes really are n't that special and at times they 're poorly edited but they 're good enough for this type of film .As far as the performances go , Van Damme is fairly stiff but this really does n't take away from the fun of the character .The actor can certainly handle himself well during the action scenes and this here is the most important thing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With such a low - budget and rather weak story , there really was n't too much they could do here except deliver a cheap \" B \" movie .As long as you do n't come in expecting too much you should be mildly entertained but there 's no question that there are better films out there in the genre .Cyborg 2 ( 1993 ) : star : Really bad , direct - to - video \" sequel \" takes place in 2074 when two companies ( an American and Japanese ) are battling over creating cyborgs , which are now everywhere .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I would say her performance is certainly weak and there 's no question that you 'd every have watched this in 1993 and thought you were seeing a future Oscar - winner .Thankfully she has a nude scene but this comes so far into the movie that most would have probably already turned the thing off .Palance actually is a blast here and just wait to you hear his narration at the start of the picture .That crispy old voice is just priceless and I think the film would have been a lot more entertaining had they just cut everything from the film except his narration .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The special effects are slightly better than you 'd typically see in a picture like this including the sequence over the opening credits .However , the story itself just drags way too much and there was n't a single second where I was actually interested in what was going on .The boredom level is quite high from start to finish as the 99-minute running time really drags .Teenagers from Outer Space ( 1959 ) : star::star : Aliens land on Earth to find a new place to breed their deadly mutant creature but Derek ( David Love ) decides he does n't want to hurt anyone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "TEENAGERS FROM OUTER SPACE is certainly one of the dumbest movies ever made but I must admit that I get a laugh out of watching it ever so often .I think everything that can happen in a \" so bad it 's good \" film in here including the bad acting , stupid story , awful special effects and of course the rather bland direction .However , some of these things are just so campy that I ca n't help but be entertained by some of them .This includes the rather bad performances with Love being way too laid back and boring to be able to carry the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The lovable Harvey B.

{"text": "I guess you can say that aliens just are n't as scary as ghosts but DARK SKIES has some interesting ideas scattered around but sadly nothing every really comes together .I thought there were some interesting ideas that started to come to light in the final act but by the time this happens the film is almost over and what \" happens \" just is n't great enough to make up for the first ninety - minutes .Even worse is that we 're given a pretty good final scene but it 's wasted .The first half of the film just never really gets the viewer to care about the people we 're watching and as I said it does n't help that the film is n't scary .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Both Dakota Goyo and Kadam Rockett are good as the children and J.K.

{"text": "Often times it seems as if the ants are walking in thin air and at other times you can obviously see the rear projection .Most films would be dead in the water with such bad effects but I think it adds some charm because of how serious Gordon treats them .Most directors would know these effects are bad and try to downplay them or hide them but not Gordon .He shows these bad effects with his head held high and it at least gives the viewer some entertainment .Collins and the rest of the cast do what they can with the material they 're given but the humans certainly are n't the high point of the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
