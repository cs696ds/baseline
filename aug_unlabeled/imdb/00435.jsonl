{"text": "Dismounting from his bay , Charley casually wrapped the lines on the long hitching pole in front of the headquarters .He noted the inner door stood open , no doubt due to the heat of the day .His first steps on the porch alerted the Charge of Quarters who stepped outside the door .\" Good morning , Sheriff !Come inside .Lieutenant Hoch is on duty . \" Following the corporal inside , the Lieutenant arose from behind a desk and extended his hand to greet Charley .\" Good morning , Charley !What 's your pleasure today ? \" \" Hello , Oliver .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've some trouble over in the hills west of St. Joe .I need a little assistance .Canadian Indians have crossed to our side of the line again , and are giving the settlers hell . \"Hoch shook his head dolefully .\" The Inspector General is here inspecting the post , and we 're trying to finish qualifying the men on the rifle range before the snow flies .We 're hard up for ready patrols just now .I have my doubts , but of course , it 's the captain 's decision .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I probably need only about a dozen .Do n't believe the Indians have much support from the locals .Probably a small bunch who have their dander up and will back down and skedaddle back to Canada if pushed hard . \"Reflecting , he added , \" A couple of weeks in your guardhouse on bread and water would really straighten them out !Hoch turned to the corporal , \" Find the Captain and inform him the sheriff is here .I think he 's at the laundry . \"He turned back to Charley .\" The steam jenny that heats the water over there is giving the laundresses a fit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Charley managed a wrinkled grin . \" Hold up !It 's not necessary to send Corporal Donegan .I 'll walk over there myself .After Charley left the day room , Hoch questioned the veteran corporal . \" Was n't he Captain Wheaton 's First Sergeant when the captain was in charge a few years ago ?Yes sir !And do n't let that easygoing manner fool you .He was hell on wheels before he quit the army in ' 75 .He was a real tight soldier ; a man 's man , tough as nails .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He made brevet lieutenant after our first scrap and his platoon was usually given the dirty , most dangerous jobs .He took over the company command on more than one occasion , only to be deposed by Pointers who were jealous of his ability .His men would go through hell for him ; I know , for he was my lieutenant until he was captured late in ' 63 .Taking a direct route across the parade ground Charley passed between two of the officer - cottages on his way to the laundry .A sudden spurt of firing came from the rifle range to the west , causing him a quick glance in that direction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Let the fire die out after the laundresses finish for the day , then disassemble the safety valve and clean it thoroughly .You do n't need that huge fire in the boiler .Keep it small and feed it often , just enough to keep the steam up .The noise of the steam escaping from the valve is frightening the women . \"He half turned upon hearing Charley 's approach , then added , \" Stay on the job when the boiler is fired .I do n't want to hear any more complaints from the ladies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yup !Indians in the Hair Hills are putting the run to settlers .I 've got to try to recover a team and wagon loaded with government goods they 've seized .It was destined for the smallpox area .It 'll probably be a cold day in Hades if I get any of that stuff back !Collins shook his head .\" Darn trouble makers !We underestimate the Indians at times .Fetterman sure did !So did Custer !I only wish I understood them better . \"He sighed , \" Charley , I ca n't spare you any men until late next week .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The sheriff shrugged his shoulders . \"Guess I 'll ride out that way on Monday .If I have no luck I 'll be back on your doorstep . \"He hesitated , \" Hock inferred that you 're swamped with the federal inspector visiting .I know what you 're up against .Just my career , \" Collins joked . \"General Gibbon is the inspector ; he 's not too hard to get along with .He 's fair , \" Charley admitted . \"He 's inspected the fort before , back when I was stationed here under Captain Wheaton .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My wife and son will be put out if you do n't stop .We do n't see much of you -- might as well have lunch with us .At l:30 that afternoon the sheriff arrived back in town .Hearing voices from Bob Ewing 's office he climbed the outside staircase .Opening the screen door , he found Deputy Anderson and Jud LaMoure seated near the lawyer 's desk .Anderson looked embarrassed , \" Sorry I missed you this morning , sheriff .I ran across Marshal LaMoure at breakfast and we discussed my problem at length .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Charley , it seems the man Anderson wants is Bill Gale .\" Charley took a chair next to Ewing 's desk . \" Kind of figured it had to be him .He has n't been around here long , and I kind of wondered about his accent .It 's from the southwest , sure not local .I still need him , \" Anderson spoke up softly .Ewing looked guilty .\" You 're right Charley , he 's from Texas .Said he was trying for a new life .He had me write a letter to his wife saying he would soon send money to get her here . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" It 's my fault they 've found him out .He 's no innocent , \" Anderson grumbled . \"He was arrested in Dallas last February for assault and carrying a concealed weapon ; he pleaded guilty to that -- jumped a $ 15,000 bail in June , just took off .Charley , was n't he working for Bill Moorhead this fall ?\" LaMoure asked .Yes , but he 's working for White now , bartending in his hotel at the border .At least that 's the last I 've heard .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Until someone complains , it 's not my problem , \" Charley shrugged .Anderson spoke up , \" Collins has been moving .I traced him to Missouri in early August , then to St. Paul .Finally I got word from Dallas that he was here . \" Anderson turned to LaMoure , \" I stopped in Fargo and talked to your boss , but he was busy in court .He said to see you and the local sheriff .They told me he might have crossed the border into Canada by now .If so , I 'd have to bait him across the line somehow .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" If you take your warrant to Canada you 'll get the runaround .Best you catch him on this side .Charley turned to Anderson angrily , \" What do you want me to do ?I 'm only the sheriff ; you and Jud are both Federal Marshals .You two can make your own arrest ; it 's a federal matter -- your job .Anderson was defensive .\" I told you Bill and I were friends back in Texas .He 'll recognize me immediately and be on his guard .He 'll know I 'm after him and probably run again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I 've got some Indians to fuss with out there .Deputy Anderson stood , and then began to smile .\" I appreciate your help sheriff .Perhaps my stay in Pembina wo n't be too long .Charley picked up his horse and buggy at Mason 's Livery .Crossing on the Red River ferry he questioned the operator , \" Trudo , how late will you be running tonight ?Until dark , Sheriff .
