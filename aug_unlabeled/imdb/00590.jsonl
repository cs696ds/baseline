{"text": "Go See Precious .Now .This is the beginning of something new : The Afrobella Review !I know I 've got a whole category devoted to product reviews , but I 'm expanding my repertoire to include films , music , and books that move me .And the whole thing was inspired by this movie .I tend to avoid sad movies , which is a shame and something I 'm trying to change .There 's so much to be learned from movies that bring you down , and often so little to be gained from movies that are pure escapism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But Precious is the kind of film that needs our support .It 's a film that reveals a slice of American life that we too often close our eyes to .Because we do n't want to see .All of the rumors about Precious are true .It 's unbearably sad .At times it 's hard to watch .If you 've read Push by Sapphire - upon which this film is based - you already know that .What you may not know about the film - Mariah Carey is GREAT in it .Lenny Kravitz is unexpected and WONDERFUL .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
