{"text": "The Great Game .MIKE NICHOLS 'Charlie Wilson 's War is about three songs away from turning into The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas , with Julia Roberts in the Dolly Parton role .Nichols loads the film with farce , laughs babes and the triangulation of Southern Baptist hotheads .It boasts a lighting - quick Philip Seymour Hoffman as a CIA agent who manages to get a ride to glory .Charlie Wilson 's War does a better job of concealing its essential simple - mindedness than any other film this year , but then the jig is up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The action begins with a typical comedic - funeral scene .This is n't a burial ; it 's a covert awards ceremony where a congressman is being lauded by the CIA .Hearing himself praised , the guest of honor , Rep. Charlie Wilson ( Tom Hanks ) , shows the proverbial discomfort of a whore in church .His right - hand man , Gust Avrakotos ( Hoffman ) , smiles thinly , considering everything he knows and wo n't tell .Flashback to a memorable reveal : in 1980 , Wilson is saut\u00e9ing in a hot tub full of topless women in Las Vegas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Texas congressman is tended by a team of secretaries who look like Dallas Cowgirls .And he is mother - henned by his adviser Bonnie , so we can watch the syncopated switch of Amy Adams ' long red ponytail as she charges down the halls .The rapid scenes of Wilson 's down - homeness and canniness show Southern politics done to a savory turn like nothing since A.J. Liebling 's book The Earl of Louisiana .Though he seems like a breezy nonentity , Wilson has a long history of covert operations .His achievements are rattled through so quickly that we do n't quite catch them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But the Great Game calls him when the Soviets invade Afghanistan .And Avrakotos , a geeky , unsavory CIA operative , nudges the playboy congressman into action .Wilson jets to Texas to rally a wealthy anti - communist political donor , Joanne Herring ( Julia Roberts ) .Using her money and connections , Wilson engineers a proxy deal , getting Israeli guns into the hands of Pakistani proxies and then to the Afghani mujahedeen .The film ends on a slog of exuberant war scenes that both parody and epitomize the imbecility of the mid-1980s military thriller .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
