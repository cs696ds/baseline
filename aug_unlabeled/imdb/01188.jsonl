{"text": "I bought this baby for $ 1.99 on good ol classic VHS .One of the worst of the worst zombie flicks to come out of Italy .A montage to plot holes , ripoffs , and bloopers .If you really love zombies , and really love crap movies , this one is for you .Deffinately a Plan 9 level of crappy , except without the charm .One of those movies you can\u00b4t take too serious .Its just the right footage for a video - party with lots of beer and potato - flips .Obviously a rip - off Romeros \" Dawn of the Dead \" with bad acting but funny to watch after all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I mean like the ENTIRE soundtrack .like every piece of music in that movie is ripped right of romero 's .anyway , just sayin ... .I 'd heard plenty of bad reviews , including this one , before watching this movie , and I was prepared for the worst .But when this movie ended , my only thought was ' That was awesome ' .Lots of zombies , lots of gore , pointless nudity , it 's everything a zombie movie should be .The stock nature footage is annoying and stupid , sure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'd be interested to find out how many of the people who commented have actually seen this movie .For one , THIS IS NOT A DAWN OF THE DEAD RIP - OFF .DAWN OF THE DEAD DID NOT TAKE PLACE ON A TROPICAL ISLAND , NOR DID IT INVOLVE COMMANDOS .Honestly , aside from the fact it has zombies there 's almost no similarity , and if being a zombie movie makes this a DotD rip - off , well I guess that makes every movie where a character wears shoes a Wizard Of Oz clone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "complain is a little , well , stupid to make , since Santoro yells at them 3 or 4 times for it in the movie .This is one of my favs .I saw this flick at the a Sepulveda Drive - in , San Fernando Valley Ca . on a Triple bill with \" Dawn of the Dead \" and \" Gates of Hell \" .The night I saw this flick the valley was hit by a freak super storm .Lots of flooding , Few streetlights or traficlights were working .Most of the cities were without power .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
