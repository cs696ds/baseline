{"text": "OK , OK , I rented the damn thing , so I get what I deserve , right ?I just did n't expect it to be so damn boring !You could edit out the first 45 minutes and it would still be too long .Someone apparently forgot to tell director Katt Shea she was working on a horror movie .It does n't offer much in the scares department , but it was a damn good after - school special !Poor Rachel .She 's unpopular and she has fair skin with dark hair .( Never a good combination in high school apparently . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Her real Mom is a nut , you see , and was carted off to the loony bin one night when Rachel was real little .It was a loopy scene , trust me .Enter Jesse , a teenager who is as handsome is he is 30 .He flirts , she comes out of the shell I guess she was supposed to have , but they forgot to mention it earlier .Then the hot young sweetie from American Beauty flings herself off the roof of the school , and we begin the long road to \" Who will die at the end ? \" Emily Bergl plays Rachel , and she 's not too bad , although you must realize all she has to do is look pale and unhappy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Guess what ?Amy Irving shows up to reprise her role as SUE SNELL !She 's a high - school guidance counsellor now , apparently just waiting around for another telekentic psycho to show up .I think this one might have fared a little better if it separated itself from the original Carrie .Without the flashbacks and silly references to Carrie White , I might have bought it a little more .Granted , they could have called it \" Free Head ! \"and I do n't think I 'd have liked it .There 's just waaaaaaaaay to much superfluous crap about Rachel and Jesse , Rachel and SUE SNELL ! , Rachel weeping about the dead American Beauty girl , Rachel getting slapped by her step - daddy , Rachel finally getting down and dirty with the stud Jesse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then we get to the big carnage - filled ending .( Hey , just like that movie Carrie ! )My life seems a little brighter as craniums get impaled with fireplace pokers , and those whiny teen teases get their throats slit with some flying CDs .Ah , yes .This is what I want .Thirty seconds later , the credits roll .You were warned .A few references to a better horror movie and one bloody - mayhem scene do NOT a horror movie make .You want character development and the three - act structure ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
