{"text": "Saturday , August 22 , 2009 .From Hermann Hesse and now to Thomas Mann , I think I am in love with pre - WWII German writers .Mann 's novella Death in Venice starts out very dry , going on and on about the ascetic life of a famed Munich novelist named Gustav von Aschenbach .His hero is the steadfast artist who toils to the brink of exhaustion for his craft and conceals his inner struggle behind a cool , composed facade .Literature is great not because of the beauty of its prose but because of how its readers relate to it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Aschenbach 's books appeal to the bureaucrats and businessmen who labor incessantly at their jobs and yet must maintain a respectable bourgeois appearance at all times .The figure of Saint Sebastian is , in Aschenbach 's mind , the most beautiful image of all : it depicts a man who gladly suffers for his beliefs and who perseveres through the most painful torture .Upon traveling to Venice , however , Aschenbach is seized by the erotic desire for an aristocratic Polish boy named Tadzio who is staying with his family at the same hotel .Aschenbach never actually speaks to Tadzio or interacts with him in any way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The heavens open , a light shines down , and the ancient gods enchant , beguile , and torment him .Having dedicated his art to the constrained and the conservative , having disdained the bohemian fascination with the outcast and debased , having been lauded by schoolteachers and heads of state , Aschenbach finds everything he has believed in thrown into a gloriously delirious flux .Passion is like crime : it does not thrive on the established order and the common round ; it welcomes every blow dealth the bourgeois structure , every weakening of the social fabric , because therein it feels a sure hope of its own advantage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All public honor laid at the artist 's feet , he concludes , is but a farcical homage to appearances .It is absurdity at its finest .Echoing Plato 's views on the poets , as laid out in The Republic ( he sought to ban them ) , Aschenbach admits that art ( be it visual or literary ) is dangerous , as the idolization of form is the very spirit of Dionysus himself .Art destroys all restraints , and the mad piper - the celebration of the material , of the flesh , of the here - and - now - leads art 's devotees to the Pit itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Artists must dedicate themselves to beauty and beauty only .But that is a risky endeavor .At one point , Aschenbach is awakened from a dream / nightmare in which he is drawn into a violent bacchanalian orgy despite his initial fear .It is an extreme metaphor , but the awakening of homosexual longing in a respectable citizen of the early twentieth century is a pretty frightening , anti - social experience .Of course , Aschenbach 's obsession is also pedophiliac - Tadzio is a fourteen - year - old boy after all .Today we strive to be accepting of the LGBT community .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But I think the NAMBLA angle allows us to still experience aversion , which is probably what Mann intended ( although in his time this would have been accomplished with homosexuality alone ) .Hyperbole about the perils of art aside , Aschenbach 's desires really are dangerous .No one in their right mind can blame Tadzio 's family for eventually becoming uneasy whenever their son is around that creepy old guy who 's always watching and stalking him .Heck , they should 've freaked out more .To the ancient Greeks , however , the love between a boy and an older male teacher was the sexual paragon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think his death on the very last page is similar to Edna 's suicide at the end of Kate Chopin 's The Awakening ( written in roughly the same time period ) .The protagonist has achieved a new inner awareness and subsequently rejected social norms .But what has replaced them is transgressive , subversive , or , in Aschenbach 's case , threatening .Okay , so now what ?I actually found this little story to be an indirect commentary on one of the traditional views of women in Western culture - as idealized and exalted , but ultimately dehumanized , beauty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( Aschenbach makes it quite clear that to actually get to know Tadzio would spoil the illusion of perfection , since , of course , a Platonic ideal can not actually exist in humanity 's material world - it is supposed to be beyond it . )She is the subject of poems , prose , and painting , but never the creator .She is the passive recipient of inspired praise and burning passion but never the active agent exploring and expressing her own desires .True , the ancient Greeks , whose philosophy and mythology Mann heavily draws upon , often saw beauty as a prime virtue and an end in and of itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Blog Archive .Besides Mozart and Shostakovich , we will celebrate another centenary this year on November 2 , the birthday of Italian film director Luchino Visconti .His movie adaptation of Der Tod in Venedig by Thomas Mann , Morte a Venezia ( 1971 ) , was shown this weekend in two free screenings at the National Gallery of Art , to close the museum 's tribute to the Italian director .On Saturday , the large auditorium in the East Building filled up remarkably fast for a holiday weekend , a sign of the widespread admiration for Visconti 's masterpiece .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thomas Mann based his 1912 novella on his own experience in Venice .The book 's protagonist , a brilliant but morally ambiguous author , becomes so obsessed with a Polish boy in a sailor suit whom he sees on the Lido that he remains in Venice and dies in a cholera epidemic .Visconti , himself a bisexual , made a documentary about his long search to find a young actor ( Bj\u00f8rn Andresen ) to play the boy , Tadzio , called Alla ricerca di Tadzio .Having heard about the death of Gustav Mahler while he was in Venice , Thomas Mann based some of von Aschenbach 's physical characteristics on his memory of the premiere of Mahler 's Symphony of a Thousand , and the haggard face of the aging composer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie is one of the best adaptations of an interior novel ever made , mostly a series of perfectly composed shots little troubled by dialogue .Venice has never looked so good , and at the same time so dangerous to your health .There is a troubling undercurrent of class conflict that runs through the film , with grotesque characters of the Venetian underclass contrasted by their physical ugliness with the beautiful people of the luxury hotel on the Lido .The musical accompaniment , sonic beauty behind the depravity of the story , is drawn from Mahler 's third and fifth symphonies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is disturbing that von Aschenbach breaks out of self - isolation by his infatuation with a teenage boy , but the protagonist is much more pathetic than menacing .The movie unfolds not through actions but through a series of glances and looks from actors in closeup .Visconti chose Bj\u00f8rn Andresen for his androgynous qualities , and although he is beautiful to look at , his range of expression is , perhaps intentionally , almost nil .Bogarde is much more fascinating to watch , in terms of how his character 's feelings are gradually unmasked .In his final hours , von Aschenbach gives into his yearning for youth only symbolically , submitting to the restorative ministrations of a barber who dyes his hair , colors his lips and eyebrows , and makes up his face .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He had noted , further , that Tadzio 's teeth were imperfect , rather jagged and bluish , without a healthy glaze , and of that peculiar brittle transparency which the teeth of chlorotic people often show . \"He is delicate , he is sickly , \" Aschenbach thought . \"He will most likely not live to grow old . \"He did not try to account for the pleasure the idea gave him .As von Aschenbach falls dead in a chair on the beach , Tadzio waves in the distance , unattainable .FILM AGENDA :", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
