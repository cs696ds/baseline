{"text": "It looks like the whole community is behind them .It 's getting on towards 6.00pm when I arrive at my accommodation in Portnablagh , 120 miles from Belfast .It 's a flat in a modern block ...Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade .It 's pretty clear that by the time Steven Spielberg made Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , he was becoming a different kind of director from the younger man who made Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom .By 1989 , Spielberg had long chafed at being a magician at kiddie parties .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So when Spielberg reunited with George Lucas and Harrison Ford to make Last Crusade , it 's not quite accurate to say his heart was n't in it .It 's more that he was on his way to being the director of Schindler 's List , the movie that did n't use Nazis and Hitler as the punchlines of gags .Spielberg was casting around for something that would render this last Indy adventure - well , clearly it was conceived as the last one at the time - relevant to who he 'd become .So the movie is all about reconnecting with Dad .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Count to twenty ...In Greek \" ) .From there , Spielberg seamlessly cuts to the adult Indy , still chasing after that damn Cross of Coronado .( One wonders how many nearly - acquired artifacts Indy has had a hard - on for over the years . )The action unfolds aboard a ship at stormy sea , and it 's probably the first indication that Last Crusade will focus more on character than on action : it 's staged rather clumsily .( The tank chase near the end has some fine tense moments , but it 's too little too late . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So Last Crusade is a bit of a letdown as an Indy adventure .But it plays like gangbusters as a character comedy starring Harrison Ford and Sean Connery .It often plays as though Spielberg made a third Indy film simply as an excuse to get these two in the same room .Connery brings out a vastly appealing dorky - kid side of Ford we have n't seen before in the Indy films , and Ford parries with Connery angrily yet lovingly .It 's a complex and real relationship - Henry 's guilt , Indy 's resentment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Aaand the chair \" ) , an unstable mix that works beautifully .The rest of the movie occasionally feels tired and schlocky , and not schlocky in a good way .Many have commented bitterly , and rightly so , on how the script reduces Denholm Elliott 's Marcus Brody and John Rhys - Davies ' Sallah to comic - relief oafs , though Rhys - Davies hits the perfect incredulous pitch with \" You are named after the dog ?HA HA HA HAAAA .\" Yes , Indy the icon , the hero , the stud , the brilliant archaeologist and world adventurer , named himself after a dog ( actually Lucas ' dog ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So the action scenes seem obligatory .The comedy is sometimes too broad , and the movie as a whole feels softer and lighter than what came before ( an obvious break from the hysterical darkness and heaviness of Temple of Doom ) .But when the legends are up there together , all is forgiven .On the present days , the clumsy and naive cuckold Jimmy is dumped again by his girlfriend Judy and misses her .His best friend Fletch is fired in his job of clown after hitting an annoying boy .The two friends are broken and decide to camp in the countryside to forget their problems , and Jimmy throws a dart in a map in a pub to decide where they should go .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Bottom line .Mediocre sums up the word for this movie perfectly .Do n't remember much about it , do n't really care too .Worth a look I guess , but it 's vastly forgettable .Like the lad 's magazines whose custom base this ' film ' is aimed at , there are models posing as actors without much clothing and a pair of unlikely lads cracking post - Pegg & Frost type jokes .The script is indescribably bad , beige chat peppered with hokey , irony - impermeable Medievalisms and stumbling over James Corden 's psychotic need to make jokes that he need n't .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I think I had to smirk a single time in the movie after hearing the idea of gay were wolfs .Overall , the trailer has been more funny , than the movie itself .And I do n't think that this can be said about any other movie .This is one of those movies , where the constant bad and silly jokes , destroy all atmosphere , all story , all tension , all interest in the characters - simply everything .I 'll leave all the \" for a vampire movie this sure does suck \" jokes to others , and the follow ups with similar punchlines about Lesbians to the pros .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'll get my obvious whinge out early , the movie revolves around a skinny guy who has a dysfunctional relationship with his on / off girlfriend , and his fat useless mate , who in this case has just been sacked .Remind you of anything ?It is exactly the same set up for Shaun of the Dead , only that was done far better and exceeded any and all expectations .Also both flicks are British so it is impossible that they were n't aware of SotD , surely switching up the formula just a little ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "At least the cast know it ai n't Shakespeare and treat the material as such , all the while vampires explode into massive streams of pasty goo and Fletch tries every joke in the book ( and mostly fails ) .The vampires are all suitably hot , with strategically placed billowy outfits or shadows 90 % of the time , it 's a bit like watching scrambled porn ( I would imagine ) .The finale is just silly , vampires swaying and pretending that they are being warded off or fearsome depending on what is being waved at them , and the good guys trying to act humorous and at least sorta scared .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You already know without checking any reviews that the forecast calls for largely terrible with a chance of boobie , and really for most guys that should be enough .The one thing I could do without was the persistent vaguely homophobic jokes along the lines of \" I 'm worried I 'll get bummed \" , I lost count at about 6 attempts at such \" comedy \" through the pic .It 's shlocky , tacky and mostly terrible , but at 75 minutes it 's over quick .Better with friends present so you can at least share in the B - movie bad / goodness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
