{"text": "Blog .Upon learning that I am the oldest of fourteen children , six of whom are adopted from China , a typical response goes something along the lines of , \" Bless your heart , that sounds crazy .\" My answer is yes , it is crazy !Crazy in the most wonderful , beautiful , joyfully - chaotic way .Others might say , \" Were n't your parents busy enough ?How do they have time for all of those kids ? \" As if we biological children are somehow being cheated on our fair share of love and attention .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , where do you put them all ? \" Let 's just say a bedroom in our house is like a Chinese bus .How many can fit ?One more !Always one more !And so it goes ...For every question wondering why or how we do it , the answer is that when it is God 's will , He will always show us the way !I think it is puzzling to some people why a family who is already larger than average would want to grow by adoption .They act like bringing in a needy orphan is a burden on those already born into your home , but in reality , that is the furthest thing from the truth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A common concern is that with so many people to watch after , we older children will not be able to have a life of our own .That is not the case !Along with giving piano lessons , babysitting for friends , and participating in our church 's music ministry , I work at my dream job as a wedding coordinator .My siblings are all involved in sports , music , and other extracurricular activities , besides being great students under my homeschooling parents .Yes , we are still busy at home helping with the younger kids , cleaning , cooking , etc . , but that 's just part of living with others - being part of the team , as we say .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have seven sisters who will paint nails , dress up , or just lie around talking with me ( what more could a girl ask for ? ) and six brothers who are just as protective of me as I am of them ( it 's as amazing as it sounds ) .I am incredibly close to my siblings .My bond with each of them , biological or adopted , is unbreakable .None of us ever has to be alone .Whether I want to take a hike , go shopping , bake a cake , or watch a crime show , there is always someone around to join me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not a hindrance or disservice .And not only is my life filled with pleasure because of adoption , but God has used them to sanctify me in greater ways than I could have dreamed !Having siblings with special needs ranging from barely noticeable to completely disabling has taught me compassion , servitude , and humility like I 'd never imagined .My life has been - and continues to be - changed by this miracle of adoption .These sweet boys and girls have shown me daily the characteristics for which I should strive .My eight - year - old brother , who is in first grade and learning to read despite two cognitive disabilities , teaches me diligence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My ten - year - old sister , who has slowly but surely overcome cerebral palsy to walk around the house with a walker , teaches me strength .My ( other ) eight - year - old brother , who plays the piano in spite of both hands being deformed , teaches me determination .My ( other ) four - year - old sister , who was once unable to straighten her legs but now runs nonstop , teaches me perseverance .My five - year - old sister , who can only move her head and arms yet still has the biggest smile and loudest laugh of anyone in the room , teaches me joy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I promise , we are having the time of our lives !Do not wonder if we biological kids are missing out on something because of our adopted siblings .We - I - would be lost without a single one of them .Do we have moments of stress and insanity ?Of course !Is it worth it ?Yes .Yes , and yes .I would not be the person I am now without adoption .My life has changed completely since our family started this adventure ... in the very best way possible .As have all my siblings - the biological ones now have best friends who share our last name , and the adopted ones have a family to call their own .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So what really makes being in a large , adoptive family so wonderful ?It is that rather than losing our individuality in the midst of the group , our personalities and strengths are amplified by the opportunities we have to serve and grow in our own home , which we never would have had otherwise .We are not just someone else to take care of , any more than those in your household .No matter how many siblings I have , whether by birth or adoption , each of us will always be a loved , necessary , and valued piece of our unique family puzzle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Each story , each post , each child is special .And for today 's post , this is especially true .Andrea was in the process of writing this post when her daughter Leeya suddenly and unexpectedly passed away .Andrea chose to finish the post and share it here - it is our prayer that Leeya 's precious life would continue to impact others through the sharing of her story .A \" Heart Mama \" , what a title !I had read stories of these brave women and cried trying to understand how hard that must be , to have a heart baby .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That was even harder to wrap my head around .I admired them so much , but I could never be one .I did n't have what it took .Our family could n't handle that .But then , I found myself holding the file of a \" heart baby \" .Not just any baby , a baby that we had met on our second adoption trip .A baby , who my eight year old fell in love with and asked repeatedly for us to adopt .A baby , who when we met her did nothing , nothing but lie on a mat and smile .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Really God ?I really think this was meant for another family but okay , I 'll look .For two weeks we reviewed , and reviewed and reviewed .We looked over a pediatrician review , an international adoption clinic review and five reviews from cardiologists .Her official diagnosis was a congenital heart defect ( that means she was born with it ) called Tetralogy of Fallot .She also had an ASD ( hole between the top chambers ) .Even with all that , TOF can be \" garden variety \" or very severe .Basically , blood was swishing all through her heart in crazy directions and not enough of it was getting through the pulmonary valve to get re - oxygenated but by golly , that right ventricle was going to keep pumping really hard to try to get the blood through that valve .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Her file also threw around terms like hydronephrosis , citrullinemia , bronchitis , pneumonia , lag of brain development and it said she had a weak spirit .Our doctors ' reviews labeled her with global delays , failure to thrive , and they let us know there was a good chance she had a syndrome .Again , Really God ? ?We just could n't do it .We prayed .I cried .But , it was just too much , too scary , too many unknowns .I was to call our agency and say no .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I tried to email them , but I could n't even type the words , much less hit send .It did n't feel right ; I was not at peace saying no to this little girl .Jon ( my awesome husband ) called at lunch to see if I had told them .I told him I could n't , and he said , \" Good , I do n't want to either \" .So ...... WE SAID YES !A little bit scared , but with 100 % confidence that it was the right decision .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We decided that Jon would travel alone .It was n't ideal , but we had only been home six months with our newest son .We did n't feel like he was ready for us both to be gone for that long .Our little girl , Leeya YanQi Grace , was placed in her daddy 's arms on Sept. 14 , 2015 .No matter what happened from that point on , she had a family .He did a wonderful job taking care of her on his own ; he even kept bows in her hair every day for me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She was so tiny and frail .She did n't do anything other than lie there , make odd noises , and play with her fingers .And smile , she always smiled .Finally on Sept 26 , they landed back in the US .I flew to Chicago to surprise them which gave us have a few hours together before introducing her to the rest of the family .It was love at first sight ; she was absolutely perfect and could do no wrong in my eyes .We made it back to Nashville the same night , and just like that we were a family of eight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We got 36 hours at home before the doctor appointments started .We were the first appointment in cardiology on Monday morning .She was very uncooperative for the EKG and ECHO so there were no clear answers from those .A heart cath was scheduled for eight days later .She had lots of blood work that day , a CT scan , and a chest x - ray .Not only was Leeya a heart baby , she had a lot of other stuff going on .An anesthesiologist said , \" She is so special , it is going to take a long time to figure out all of her medical secrets .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was then that she was labeled \" no surgical options at this time \" and too complex .Leeya 's heart cath showed about what they expected for an almost three year old with unrepaired TOF .The doctors considered doing surgery the next morning , but a transplant heart came in for another little one so we scheduled surgery for one week later .We did stay overnight for observation and it was pretty unnerving rocking her at the hospital that night listening to the alarms as her O2 levels would drop into the low 50 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thankfully we were now getting her much needed help .After only having her at home for two short weeks , surgery day came .We were so nervous .She was the first patient scheduled that morning so she went back at 7 am .We did n't see her again for about 12 hours .The surgeon was pleased overall .He was not able to save her pulmonary valve as he had hoped , and he decided to leave her ASD open to allow blood to continue to flow through it while the heart adjusted to it 's new way of beating .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It did n't take long to figure out that she was taking the more difficult recovery path that we had been told was possible .She spent six days on a breathing tube and was only extubated because she bit a hole in the tube .Leeya spent 11 days in the PCICU .Once she came off of the sedation meds , she went 60 hours with no sleep .She had more x - rays , blood draws , and other procedures than I can recall .But , she fought on and as long as there were no \" white coats \" around she smiled and laughed and made the best of the situation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She had me there beside her ; she did n't have to fight alone anymore .Finally , after a total of 23 days in the hospital , we got to take her home .She came home on three medicines , 24/7 oxygen , and an NG tube for all her feeds .However , none of that mattered because she was home .Her happy spirit was back full time , and her five siblings were thrilled to have their baby back .We only ventured out for doctor appointments or therapies the first month back home .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Her first post - op check up was good , and she was able to come off one medicine .The doctor decided to leave her on the oxygen until spring , through cold / flu season , just so that her heart would n't have to work quite so hard .She did n't like going to therapy , but we were seeing improvements .She started rolling over and even stayed in a sitting position sometimes .She gained seven pounds and started to thrive .It was like watching a miracle take place right before my eyes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She has such a happy , joy filled spirit , and I am thankful each day that we did n't give in to fear and say no to being her parents .She is worthy of love , worthy of family , worthy of being given a chance at life .No matter how long that life may be .On January 22 , 2016 our little Leeya passed away .She went into cardiac arrest at a local hospital as we were trying desperately to get her to the children 's hospital .The details of that day I 'll save for another post .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even on oxygen her O2 levels hung around 78 - 85 , her right ventricle was just worn out .She had just seen her cardiologist 10 days prior and there was nothing to make us think this was coming .My heart shattered that day .We were left with so many unanswered questions , what - ifs , and why now ?Things I will never know or understand this side of heaven .Those feelings , like the day itself , I will also save for another time .I do know that she left this earth as a treasured daughter and sister , not an orphan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
