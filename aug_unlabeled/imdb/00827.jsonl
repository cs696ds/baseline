{"text": "From the Vaults -- ' I Bambini Ci Guardano ' ( ' The Children Are Watching Us ' ) 1944 .If we met Nina and Andrea with their young son , Prico , at the beach , we might assume that they were just another family on vacation with no more and no fewer problems than anyone else . \"Children \" is another movie in my random stroll through old foreign films on Netflix , and it was a marvelous discovery .The movie , which was restored in 2000 , is beautifully photographed by Giuseppe Caracciolo and Romolo Garroni , with music by Renzo Rossellini .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I expected something fairly gritty , but \" Children \" turned out to be an opulent production showing middle - class life .Although it was made in the early 1940s , a soldier and sailor in one crowd scene are the only acknowledgment of World War II , and because of its enduring theme , the movie is essentially timeless .The turning point comes in the final scene of the film , when he turns the tables and walks out on his mother - a powerful performance from a 4-year - old actor . \"Children \" opens with Nina ( Isa Pola ) and Prico going to a park so he can ride his scooter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We soon learn that taking Prico to the park is merely a pretense for Nina to meet her lover Roberto ( Adriano Rimoldi ) , who says that he has gotten tickets for them to leave for Genoa that night .Prico discovers them talking and Nina breaks off her conversation , so one might assume that when she tucks her son into bed that night it will be with a heavy heart grieving for her departed lover .Initially , it 's not difficult to understand Nina 's romantic distractions .In the early scenes , her husband , Andrea ( Emilio Cigoli ) , is officious and overbearing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In a more modern setting , what might unfold is something like \" Kramer vs. Kramer , \" in which the abandoned father and son forge a relationship and learn to survive on their own .But not in \" Children , \" where Prico is glaring evidence of his mother 's absence .On the train trip back home , Prico becomes seriously ill and awakens to find that Nina has returned to care for him .Andrea wants no part of Nina , but Prico pleads for her to stay .The couple make a strained truce for the boy 's sake and there is a peaceful interlude when they take a vacation in Alassio in hopes of reconstructing the family .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The best answer we get is that Prico is a shameful reminder of his wife 's habit of running off .If Nina is one of the lousiest mothers in the history of film , Andrea is not one of the screen 's great fathers .The hero of the tale is Prico and as the title indicates , the film is told from his point of view .Not that an American studio would ever attempt this sort of story , but it 's easy to imagine that a U.S. production would impose a child 's narration over the action to explain his thoughts and feelings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Parental Abandonment , by its nature , usually excludes the parent from having much of a role in a character 's story .If the backstory involves a child wallowing in angst because of having no parents , to bring them back and treat everything as being hunky - dory sort of dilutes the origin story 's dramatic impact .Sometimes , though , a parent can be brought back through use of a proper excuse .A parent who we have seen or heard nothing of in some time may suddenly re - appear and explain that there was , in fact , a very good reason for the abandonment- but for various reasons , the details could not be revealed until just this moment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The Boys of St. Vincent is a harrowing film that tellingly reveals both the facts of the boys ' sexual victimizations and the later impact on them .When we see the boys as adults , one or another of them reveals common aftereffects of childhood sexual trauma : dissociation , isolation , addiction , prostitution , ragefulness , suicidality , denial , and the likelihood of becoming abusive himself .We also repeatedly see the callousness and denial of institutions in relation to sexual abuse , and the inability even of those adults who believe abuse has taken place to stop it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have already noted that , among the the films I have examined , only Primal Fear ( 1996 ) and The Celebration ( 1998 ) even mention male - male incest , in both cases father - son incest that is alluded to but not portrayed .In The Celebration , a Danish film , the childhood paternal abuse of a son and daughter is publicly announced by the son when as an adult he is attending his father 's sixtieth birthday party , a large weekend - long celebration at a chateau .The extent of the father 's transgressions is revealed bit by bit in successive revelations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His sister , who has committed suicide , was also deeply damaged .The father denies the incest through most of the movie , and this denial is conveyed and reinforced in the reactions of those who hear the accusations .The partygoers are momentarily shocked by each disclosure , but then continue to celebrate the birthday in a nearly surrealistic manner that serves as a dramatic enactment of the chronic denial often seen in incestuous families .The handling ( or mishandling ) of the themes of paternal incest as well as dissociative identity disorder in Primal Fear are instructive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Sexual initiation .I know of only one movie for general audiences in which a boy is portrayed as being sexually initiated by a man .For a Lost Soldier ( 1994 ) is a Dutch film with a rare theme , a sexual relationship between a man and a young boy who seems already headed for a predominantly homosexual orientation .It had a very limited distribution in the United States , not surprising for a movie that depicts such a relationship in a comparatively positive light .There is no force used in the movie , and the effects of the relationship on the boy are subtle , as opposed to those in , for example , The Boys of St. Vincent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We go back to 1944 in wartime Holland , and Jeroen , then about 12 , is shipped from Amsterdam to the countryside for safety .We see his initial loneliness and his later attachment to the family with whom he lives .Life changes when the Canadian army comes to liberate their village .Jeroen is drawn to Walt , a handsome officer who likewise takes an interest in him .Jeroen develops a crush on Walt , and is delighted with the playful nature of their relationship .Their relationship steadily becomes more overtly sexual .Walt says at one point , \" When I first saw you , I was sure you were different .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "-- You 're special , Jeroen , really fucking special . \"As he draws close to Jeroen , apparently to kiss him , the boy diverts him by pointing out a ship in the water .In a subsequent scene , Jeroen goes into Walt 's room while Walt is showering .The naked Walt grabs him and pulls him under the water , fully clothed , as the two of them whoop with laughter .This playful scene cuts away to the two of them curled up naked in bed , caressing one another in postcoital pleasure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In a later scene , Walt and Jeroen are shown having anal intercourse .Walt is tender , and whispers , \" I love you -- my prince -- you 're mine . \"The scene is lyrical , but the boy looks troubled , and as Walt enters him he winces in pain while his lover 's face is rapturous .After a few days , Walt leaves with the Canadian forces without telling Jeroen .When Jeroen finds out that Walt is gone , he is heartbroken .He desperately attempts to find Walt , then tries unsuccessfully at least to salvage a souvenir to remember him by .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps unsuccessful in adult intimate relationships , there is a hint that he is sexually involved with a very young - looking male dancer .Like the many coming - of - age films involving boys and older women discussed above , For a Lost Soldier emphasizes the erotic component of the intimacy between the boy and man , as well as the boy 's eagerness for the relationship .Yet For a Lost Soldier gives a complex message about Jeroen 's \" sexual initiation . \"Though understated , there is more obvious ambivalence here than in Summer of \" 42 about sexual behavior with the adult object of the boy 's adoring desire .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Walt 's warmth and interest in him would be a heady experience for any lonely boy .Yet , at several points Jeroen diverts Walt from overt sexuality ; and the look of fear and pain on his face before and during anal intercourse belies the otherwise ecstatic feeling of the scene .His sexual betrayal by Walt is twofold : his implicitly eroticized hero worship is turned into unambiguous adult sexuality , and subsequently Walt 's promise of interpersonal intimacy is broken by a heedless and callous desertion .The enigmatic ending suggests that Jeroen has had troubled intimate relationships ever since being seduced and abandoned as a 12-year - old by a man he adored .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jeroen certainly considers himself lucky to have Walt , who is portrayed as a kind of dream lover until his sudden departure .Yet his introduction to sexuality is equivocally depicted , and his abandonment is wrenching .Sexual Victimization of Boys in Film .If we accept the premise that movies both influence and are influenced in turn by popular culture in their depiction of societal attitudes , we must examine what is reflected thereby in their depiction of male sexual victimization .There is a clear differentiation in film between sexual betrayal by women and by men .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is virtually no sense that a boy may not always be happy to be sexually involved with an older woman .Although in some cases they may initially react to their seductions with embarrassed fumbling , often they become magically skilled lovers ( The Graduate , Summer of \" 42 ) , thus reinforcing the idea that such a relationship is their ticket to manhood .And , with a very few exceptions ( The Graduate , Blue Velvet , Spanking the Monkey ) , the women are portrayed as non - exploitative and nonmenacing .Clearly , the message for a boy sexually betrayed by a woman is that he is a fortunate stud who has gotten what all boys long for , that he has found the ticket to manhood , perhaps even that he himself is a victimizer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A boy can not help but deduce that anxiety , dread , or apprehension about these situations make him different from other boys and perhaps unmanly .He learns to ignore these sensations , deny them , or never allow them into awareness .With the exception of Spanking the Monkey ( which was an independent film with a relatively limited distribution ) , none of the movies reviewed portrays clearcut negative consequences of a boy 's premature sexuality .On the contrary , it has very positive sequelae for him in most of the films under discussion ( Summer of \" 42 , Tea and Sympathy , Murmur of the Heart , Harold and Maude ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In every case , the boy keeps silent about his experience ( even , apparently , in For a Lost Soldier , which depicts the abuse in a relatively positive light ) .This silence usually has disastrous effects on him ( Prince of Tides , Sleepers , The Boys of St. Vincent , The Celebration ) .Boys abused by men in some instances are seen as antisocial in later life ( Sleepers , Primal Fear , The Boys of St. Vincent ) .This is indeed often the case , but there is no sense that , as is more frequently true , an abused boy may grow up sensitive and compassionate , although depressed , anxious , or agitated in one way or another .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This movie , however , had censorship problems when it was produced , exactly because of its accurate portrayal of male sexual victimization .A boy abused by a man , therefore , concludes from the movies that he should be silent about a shameful experience , even though his silence is likely to lead to devastating results .He sees his experience as something that may cause ridicule or social ostracism ( Porky 's , Powder , My Life As a Dog ) if it is known .In movie after movie , the message is to keep quiet about sexual abuse by a man in order to avoid derision and humiliation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Aside from The Boys of St. Vincent and , perhaps , Prince of Tides , none of these films shows any kind of model for healing from boyhood abuse by men .As I have indicated , these movies probably reflect cultural attitudes at the time they appeared .But , in addition to reflecting societal attitudes , movies also influence them .Perhaps it is a positive sign that the most balanced and accurate movies I discuss , The Boys of St. Vincent , Spanking the Monkey , and The Celebration , were produced in recent years .On the other hand , they were all independent projects that received limited distribution , while recent portrayals like the revenge - driven Sleepers or the intellectually dishonest Primal Fear are products of Hollywood studios and were widely distributed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am , obviously , not advocating either censorship or limiting artistic freedom of expression in any way .I believe , however , that consciousness raising about male sexual victimization is as appropriate for creative artists as for all other members of society .They have an emotional reunion as the two -- one straight and one gay -- try to make peace with their shared history .Afterward , one of them says : .If we were stars in the latest Hollywood blockbuster , then I would have embraced him , my hands patting his shoulder blades , violins and cellos billowing on the soundtrack as tears streamed down our faces .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
