{"text": "ITV 's Mansfield Park is stodgy fare , lacking style or substance .ITV 's Mansfield Park made for a very dull Sunday evening 's viewing .Maggie Wadey 's script was charmless and uninspiring , displaying zero critical edge , while Iain B Macdonald 's direction lacked finesse or imagination .Despite Macdonald 's penchant for hand - held camera - work and sudden bursts of energy , this filmic experience was lifeless , flat and one - paced .This was a shamefully lazy treatment of one of Austen 's darkest , most menacing and intriguing works .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Here too , Austen establishes a genuine dichotomy between opposing social ideologies .[Claire Tomalin 's Jane Austen :A Life , 2000 , p. 276 ] .In this novel , Austen has also invoked the potential for real human cruelty with a powerful cast of characters , amongst whom we have the likes of Mrs Norris , one of the greatest villains of literature .She is characterised by meanness , officiousness and sycophancy towards the powerful , and bullying of anyone she perceives to be in her power .She positively revels in Fanny 's lowly status .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fanny Price , of course , is the timid yet steely bastion of moral propriety , who is at the heart of the story , but the Crawford siblings , Mary and Henry , pose the most interesting and dynamic challenge , effectively driving the narrative forwards .The ITV Mansfield Park pays passing lip service to these gloriously rich and involving characterisations .This is not simply the fault of cramming a fat novel into a slim tele - film format , as is so often the defence of failed adaptation .It is because the script , the direction , and even in some cases , the cast , fail to breath life into these characters and narrative .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Her performance was competent if a little bland .No , she is not Austen 's Fanny .She runs amok , hair unkempt , a vision of blooming health and vigour far removed from Austen 's sickly heroine .But this alteration is hardly surprising , and I would argue , quite necessary , to enliven Austen 's Fanny in her transition from text to screen .Fanny has to become a more active protagonist to engage our interest .Even so , Piper 's Fanny did not particularly grab and hold my attention .Fanny is in love with her cousin Edmund , played here by Blake Ritson , giving a pretty polished performance , truer to Austen 's novel in tone and manner .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ritson had the look of a sleek , glossy blackbird with large , soulful , red - rimmed eyes , ultimately worn through by his love for what he deems a worthless woman ( Mary Crawford ) .His sudden romantic epiphany at this moment provided me with the best and loudest laugh of the evening .His brother Tom was seriously under - used , considering he was being played by the delectable James D'Arcy .On the plus side , we did cadge a prolonged glimpse of D'Arcy 's bare chest , the downside being that it was covered in large , slimy medicinal leeches at the time , supposedly to help drain away his alcohol - induced fever .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lady Bertram ( Jemma Redgrave ) was far too chirpy and perceptive , while the viciously venomous Mrs Norris was thoroughly de - clawed and de - toxed to the point of insipid by Maggie O'Neill here .Michelle Ryan 's Maria Bertram was much highlighted in previews , due to her celebrity appeal as ex - Zoe Slater from Eastenders .But then again , as there were no key themes , ideas or arguments in play in this adaptation , perhaps Maria 's cardboard cut - out character suffices perfectly well .All Michelle was required to do , it seemed , was to look pretty and alluring , which clearly comes very easily to her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As for Catherine Steadman as Julia , I rather liked her , but on reflection this might have been because her presence was so utterly negligible amidst this tripe , that I can not now for the life of me even recall her face .As for the Crawfords .This pair lacked the genuine charm and allure that Austen 's text requires of them .They must represent a very real and exciting threat , an alternative moral universe for Fanny and Edmund .But here , Joseph Beattie 's Henry Crawford was a pudding - faced fellow with floppy hair , failing to emanate even an iota of Henry 's magnetism and sexual charisma - a feat the original Henry achieves , in spite of his lack of conventional good looks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Most annoying , her costumes were almost always red , ( or reddish ) , graduating to moody black by the end , with dangly red earrings .Such a tired old clich\u00e9 .Clearly the red represented her danger , her passion , her sexuality - all those well - worn cinematic tropes .Meanwhile sweet little Fanny swanned around in pretty pale blues and wholesome colours .A delicate feminine contrast to Mary 's overtly coloured costumes .One thing that puzzled me was the Crawfords ' seeming lack of a home of their own , as we never saw the parsonage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Were they just circling aimlessly , in an endless Stygian purgatory ?Were they perhaps camping out in Sir Bertram 's hedgerows ?Was there really a world beyond Mansfield Park ?Were they all trapped in their own Mansfield Park time - space continuum ?It certainly felt that way .Indeed , the lack of extra locations began to make me feel clostraphobic , even queasy - particularly that nasty pink drawing room .Plus , by excising all external environments , ( perhaps as a budget - saving device ) , we lost some key narrative sequences , most particularly Fanny 's punishing exile to Portsmouth , in retaliation for refusing Henry Crawford 's marriage proposal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fanny 's thinking is strongly influenced by this material disparity .And our awareness of socio - economic and class distinction in Regency Britain is sharply focused by these scenes too , which is refreshing and unusual in the Austen canon .But this was far too interesting to be included in this adaptation .So instead we had to make do with Fanny 's languishing alone and bored in a vast and splendid mansion with sumptuous gardens , whilst the Bertram family peeled off in their separate directions , going to places we were never allowed to see .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The simple truth is some omissions , some deviations from text to screen really do matter .The plot loses dramatic momentum .Characters lose credibility .No .I want to be entertained , stimulated , to be swept up in the whole filmic experience .This is what I want foremost .And that means we need , above all , narrative coherence and dynamism , and a sense of truth in the portrayal of characters .If an adaptation fails in this regard , then , quite simply , it has failed to make the transition from text to screen - as is the case with this version of Mansfield Park , which was frankly turgid , lacking suspense or style .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We also know that Austen herself opposed slavery and read Thomas Clarkson , a chief proponent for abolition , who wrote The Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1808 .Indeed , Mansfield Park itself might well be named after the Mansfield Agreement ( 1772 ) which was ushered in by the Lord Chief Justice of England , Lord Mansfield , concerning James Somerset , a black slave brought to England .A question was raised regarding Somerset 's status .Could he still be owned by his master on English soil ?A ruling was enforced in Somerset 's favour : ' It was resolved that England was too pure an air for slaves to breathe in ... the moment they put their feet on English ground they are free . '", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Rather than enhance the potential for a relevant and timely postcolonial interpretation of the novel , excepting a couple of very small references ( including Sir Thomas 's walking cane with its decorative carved black slave head ) , the producers have opted instead for powder - puff pastiche .Was it fear of alienating their audience with what could be deemed as an overtly politicised approach ?Or simply uninspired filmmaking ?Personally , I believe it was the latter .Adaptation can be exciting and challenging .It is a tribute not a snub to an author - even a well - loved and revered one like Austen - when adaptors reinterpret , reinvent , and challenge the original text .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At least there is an effort to actually ' adapt ' .Indeed , such an effort is entirely and honourably necessary , simply because novels and films are entirely different mediums , behaving in completely different ways , and our consumption of them differs too .Therefore a truly successful filmic adaptation is a pretty remarkable achievement , although often the best adaptations can not stay ' faithful ' to the source text , mainly deriving inspiration and shape from the original .However , even those adaptations that purport to be ' literary ' , with pretensions to fidelity , can never stay ' true ' - and nor should they .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a less frustrating and more honest exercise all round .Better to simply kick back and enjoy a film or TV drama for what it is .My frustration with the ITV 's Mansfield Park is I could n't even do this , despite its being a piece of harmless heritage fluff , because I had a huge emotional disconnect with these characters .Their relationships felt detached , staged and untrue .Dialogue felt wooden and forced .Stage directions lacked energy and verve .And , importantly perhaps , there was minimal erotic zing between Fanny and Edmund - which in truth adheres more closely to the source text , but let 's face it , makes for very dull television .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The credits and signage were irritatingly twee and floral .And the musical scoring was strangely intrusive and entirely grating .Plus , I felt I was suffocating in the richly palatial confines of Mansfield Park .I craved fresh air , I craved liberty , I even craved the ad breaks , and I was so very relieved when the final credits rolled .Next week I will be reviewing ITV 's Northanger Abbey , for which I have much higher hopes already .Quite right !Especially this part ...His brother Tom was seriously under - used , considering he was being played by the delectable James D'Arcy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
