{"text": "It took , in fact , only a few months for the dire predictions to come true .Leno 's show , panned by critics , dragged down the ratings - and the profits - of NBC 's affiliates , while ratings for Conan 's new Tonight show plummeted to the lowest levels in history .Conan 's collapse , meanwhile , opened an unexpected door of opportunity for rival David Letterman .What followed was a boisterous , angry , frequently hilarious public battle that had millions of astonished viewers glued to their sets .Editorial Reviews .About the Author .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He is the author of the New York Times bestseller The Late Shift , two other books on the television industry , Monday Night Mayhem and Desperate Networks , and has written numerous articles for The New York Times Magazine and other publications .He has been a guest on Nightline , Today , CNN , Charlie Rose , NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams , and many other shows .A graduate of the University of Notre Dame , he lives in New Jersey with his wife .They have two children .Top Customer Reviews .When the Lay Leno / Conan O'Brian \" Tonight Show \" debacle began , everyone knew there was only one person who could tell the true story : Bill Carter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Carter 's writing is amazing as he makes you feel like a fly on the wall for the various meetings .He does n't make judgements but gives us a balanced tale of the various players with full bios on Conan , Leno , Jimmy Kimmel , Craig Ferguson and more .This allows you to get behind the people who are fleshed out wonderfully .With Conan , Carter shows that his big problem was being too nice a guy and niave to the network politics .It 's astonishing to discover that his people never secured a deal to make sure \" The Tonight Show \" always followed the evening news , which gave NBC some ammuntion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While Conan is shown as a sympathetic figure , he 's not given a free ride by the author .Leno , meanwhile , does n't come off as some evil schemer but a nice guy in a hard situation .Carter paints the picture that Leno 's decisions are due to his thinking in a time warp , still under the impression that \" Tonight Show \" is the only late night program people care about .As far as Jay 's concerned , HE was the one who had \" The Tonight Show \" taken from him and he sees nothing wrong with taking it back .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This part really drew me in as a reader and I more readily sympathized with Conan because of all the personal details provided .However , I never got the impression that Carter was telling only one side of the story .All three sides ( Conan , Jay , and NBC ) are all given fair treatment , and Carter 's assessment of the actions of each is masterfully related to one another to provide a fuller picture of what transpired .At different points in the book , I got a strong sense of what it must have felt like for each party .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The author does assume the reader has some basic knowledge of how the television industry works , but still provides concise and helpful explanations when needed .The access given to the author is amazing .Bob Woodward - type access .It seems that literally everyone involved talked to Bill Carter , and quite candidly at that .Granted , all sides surely gave their version of events , but thoughts and feelings are always clearly attributed to the different players .The section about Conan 's early years leading up to landing the Late Show in 1993 was very enlightening .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "1 Comment 35 of 37 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Bill Carter 's The War for Late Night is a chronicle about the NBC late night television shows debacle , describing how in 2009 Conan O'Brien seemingly permanently replaced Jay Leno on the Tonight Show , only to have Leno usurp and depose Conan mere months later .I had heard from several discussions by sometime entertainment genius , sometime juvenile egotist Howard Stern on his Sirius / XM radio show , including an interview recently of Conan 's sidekick Andy Richter , who was a major source for Carter , that this book was a fascinating read .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
