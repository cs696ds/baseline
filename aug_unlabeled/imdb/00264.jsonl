{"text": "Central Airport ( 1933 , William A. Wellman ) .Maybe the film should have been called The Lecher , the Floozie and the Rube , because Central Airport does n't have anything to do with the plot .I kept waiting for it to turn into a Grand Hotel at an airport , but it 's really a soaper about pilot Richard Barthelmess who romances air show parachuter Sally Eilers only to lose her to his younger brother , played by Tom Brown .The film 's pre - code so there 's premarital sex and wedded sex .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
