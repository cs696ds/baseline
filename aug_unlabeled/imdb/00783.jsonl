{"text": "One more way to explain the mystery surrounding the med tech profession lies squarely on the med tech 's shoulders .Just like Type A and Type B personality classifications , med techs are generally quiet and introverted .Their interest in the scientific side of health care distinguishes the profession as opposed to nurses who may enjoy talking to and touching patients regularly ( bondage and sadomasochism ) .Thus , med techs may not be as vocal when it comes to hospital inter department meetings and other facets which may steal attention and resources away from the lab .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Thus , if med techs did try to unionize and negotiate higher wages or other benefits the hospital could simply sell off the lab .Most hospitals are already looking for ways to cut costs and the lab is usually an area of expense so unionizing would probably push most hospitals to contract out the lab rather than have to deal with an organized group of med techs .The only representation that a med tech has is generally by the pathologist , a medical doctor , or a lab manager , generally a marketing , management , or business major more interested in bureaucracy than the lab employees .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Another lab dynamic is the often contentious relationship between lab staff and nursing staff .This is often due to a perceived or real disconnect between bedside nurses and physically separated med techs .While nurses and doctors work in an often high pressure work environment such as the ER where patients can be gushing blood , projectile vomitting , ejaculating , or having a massive stroke , the med tech is insulated from all chaos in the lab .Thus , the med tech can often seem perturbed by an overly excited or curt phone call .This is similar to the motion picture The Blues Brothers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
