{"text": "Jammer 's Review .Star Trek V : The Final Frontier .Theatrical release : 6/9/1989 PG ; 1 hr .47 min .Screenplay by David Loughery Story by William Shatner & Harve Bennett & David Loughery Produced by Harve Bennett Directed by William Shatner .Review by Jamahl Epsicokhan .I was tempted to buy the two - disc special - edition DVD of Star Trek V : The Final Frontier because I was interested in hearing the commentary track by William Shatner .I 'd imagine a commentary track on this failed film would be illuminating , or at the very least interesting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In a capitalist society , we vote for consumer products by using our wallets , and Star Trek V is a movie that I must strongly vote against .Instead , I recently pulled out my VHS copy to revisit this film for the first time in many years .I can say with renewed confidence that this will indeed be the only Trek film that wo n't be making its way on to my DVD shelf .( After having just watched it , I wo n't need to watch it again for many more years , if ever .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kidding , kidding . )Let me begin by saying that I like William Shatner .As an actor , I think he sometimes gets a bad rap .Yes , his acting choices are occasionally odd or campy or overshooting the mark , and you can point to it in places in the original series ' run .But that 's why we love the guy .Even when he 's doing camp , he 's doing camp entertainingly .Everybody remembers \" KHAAAAAAAN ! \"from Star Trek II .It 's a laughable moment , yes , but great .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He is not a bad actor .He 's just an actor who sometimes employs stylized acting .But was he a competent director ?I 'm not sure I have enough information to say .I can say that in Star Trek V he made a pretty awful film , a failure on nearly every level , although a sizable percentage of the blame must also go to screenwriter David Loughery .This is easily the worst of the Trek films .It 's a mess .( Truth in criticism requires me to point out that my VHS edition is a 4:3 pan - and - scan presentation of what was a 2.35:1 widescreen film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Where to begin ?How about the first hour of the movie ?It 's mostly just extended setup material - far too extended and aimless , if you ask me .But even the setup has its own setup ; we first meet Sybok in a pre - title scene where he laughs , and the plot takes its time moving along to the point where Sybok takes his hostages .The diplomats are cast in such a way they initially seem to be legitimate supporting characters .We have a human named John Talbot ( David Warner ) ; an obsolete Klingon general named Korrd ( Charles Cooper ) ; and the newly arrived Romulan representative , Caithlin Dar ( Cynthia Gouw ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They are n't .Their purpose in the film is merely as a worthless scrap of plotting , as bait to lure a Federation rescue ship to Nimbus III , which Sybok intends to steal .The plot 's goal of stealing a starship could 've been accomplished in any number of vastly more time - economical and interesting ways than is done here .To insert David Warner as this superfluous throwaway is unforgivable ( and fortunately his role in Star Trek VI helps right this wrong ) .Charles Cooper is serviceable in an almost equally unnecessary part , while Cynthia Gouw is awful in a completely pointless role .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As it stands they are simply inexplicable afterthoughts , and exist as an indicator of the script 's clunkiness .What we get here are a lot of pointless vignettes that try to offer up lightweight characterization but succeed only in being some of the worst so - called \" comedy \" moments in the history of the franchise .Kirk , Spock , and McCoy are on a camping trip at Yosemite National Park , where Kirk fancies himself a free climber as he attempts to scale El Capitan Mountain .The rock - climbing bit strikes me as an especially implausible conceit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , there are a couple palatable ideas that counter this notion , like Kirk 's line that he has always known \" I 'll die alone , \" and the issue of these career Starfleet guys who have no families .But then the payoff is the infamous \" Row , Row , Row Your Boat \" scene , which tries with all its misguided might to bring these guys down to earth but succeeds only in looking completely ridiculous .Only the fact that these actors have inhabited these roles for so long does this scene maintain the slightest trace of dignity , because this is simply poorly written , dead - end material .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie is like the anti-Star Trek IV .Where Trek IV was about well - oiled nuance where humor grew naturally from situations and character , the early scenes of Trek V are about painfully labored , in - your - face Three Stooges gags that clunk and clang to the floor .Among the most cringe - worthy is the awkward Scotty / Uhura innuendo , which seems to hint at a relationship in such a way the audience is left to decide for itself .It 's such a needless and poorly played detour that the only possible response is one of befuddlement .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some of them work because they do n't insist on themselves .For example , Kirk says , \" I could use a shower .\" Spock replies , simply , \" Yes . \"And I sort of got a kick out of Spock 's line near the end : \" Please , captain - not in front of the Klingons .\" But for every moment like this there are two like the one where Scotty hits his head on the bulkhead , har har .The plot slowly tries getting off the ground when Starfleet orders Kirk to take the disaster - prone Enterprise - where nothing is working - to Nimbus III to rescue the hostages .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( Surely there 's someone closer than a ship docked at Earth . )Adding to the mess of the choppy storyline is a thread involving a Klingon Bird of Prey commanded by Captain Klaa ( Todd Byrant ) , which immediately signals itself as being on an obvious collision course with the Enterprise .The Klingons are naturally the TOS era 's default villains , but here they 're mostly extraneous .It does n't help that Klaa is a boring young hothead with so little believable motivation .His only purpose in life is apparently to go into battle against Kirk .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's no teeth to the part , and no point .When the Enterprise reaches Nimbus III to rescue the hostages , we get some blandly routine action sequences in a production that 's envisioned as a Western .The visual effects throughout the film are easily the worst in the entire feature series .Many of the other Trek films ' visuals were produced by Lucasfilm 's ILM .Not this one , which was supervised by Bran Ferren , who , based on the results here , apparently had no grasp of motion - control photography of miniatures .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Still , none of that compares to the film 's worst character indignity , which is to put poor Uhura on center stage in a partially nude dance routine that 's a jaw - dropping embarrassment .Do we really want to see our vaunted Starfleet officers reduced to this sort of wretched punch line ?Finally we get to a point where the movie should 've arrived much sooner , when Kirk & Co. are captured by Sybok .There 's the revelation that Sybok is Spock 's half brother , but that 's ultimately of so little consequence that I 'm only devoting this one sentence to the matter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "According to myth , the planet Sha Ka Ree ( that 's the Vulcan name for it ) lies beyond the Barrier .No ship has ever breached the Barrier , and no probe has ever returned .Sha Ka Ree is alleged by some as the origin of all life , where God Himself may exist .We 'll get to the God question in a moment .Sybok is able to brainwash the crew of the Enterprise into following him on this mission by using his unique power to sense and release others ' worst emotional pain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But I must also praise the film where praise is due .There is a good scene where Sybok uses his power to look into the souls of McCoy and Spock .McCoy in particular lives with an awful moment that has long haunted him ( and relives it here in the film 's single best - played dramatic scene ) .Spock 's pain , somewhat less plausible as presented ( Sarek seems awfully cold ; would this Vulcan have married a human woman in the first place ? ) , centers on his half - human nature and hearkens back to the core of the character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I need my pain ! \"Vintage Kirk .There 's also a little bit of interest to find in the journey through the Great Barrier , which is presented as a landmark moment .Jerry Goldsmith 's score sells it , and McCoy asks in disbelief , \" Are we dreaming ? \"Kirk responds , \" If we are , then life is a dream .\" The moment loses its luster , though , when you consider the shoddy special effects .And more importantly the obvious question : If the Barrier is indeed only an illusion of danger , and yet has long been believed as a possible gateway to the answer to the ultimate cosmic question , why has no one tried going through it before ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Finally comes the film 's climactic moment when we meet \" God .\" It seems to me that this moment is the very definition of an inescapable narrative catch-22 - particularly for Star Trek .You simply must ask yourself , how can Star Trek presume to actually find God ?The answer is , simply , it ca n't , and deep down we know that .The flip side of the coin is that if you do n't find God here , what do you find instead ?The answer is that you must find an inevitable disappointment , because there 's virtually nothing you can do that will pay off that promise once you 've set it up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What we 're dealing with is something masquerading as God , and in a hopelessly hokey and unimaginative way , to boot : \" Brave souls - welcome ! \" rumbles the basso profundo voice .A face appears and I 'm thinking of The Wizard of Oz . \" God \" is soon revealed as merely an aggressive entity that wants to use the Enterprise to escape its prison of a planet .( \" What does God need with a starship ? \"Kirk asks , not unreasonably .Big mistake , 'cause you made it mad . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Only in this movie can a sequence begin by pretending to have found God , and end with a Klingon cannon blowing \" God \" up .I welcome any intelligent attempt to consider questions of religion alongside science fiction .But The Final Frontier hopelessly bungles that attempt .Was its particular premise even workable ?Probably not .The ending almost seems to acknowledge this , with Kirk saying that perhaps God is n't out there in space , but simply within the human heart .( As an agnostic , my own feeling is that the existence of God , or whatever made the universe and passage of time possible , is not something that can be comprehended in this lifetime . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It employs labored storytelling , an inconsistent tone , half - sketched characters , and unfocused plotting to arrive at a thin conclusion to a misguided premise .Since William Shatner was the one sitting in the captain 's chair when this ship hit the rocks , I suppose the blame lies with him .I entirely agree with this review except , when Spock said \" Not in front of the Klingons \" I wanted to finally barf .This entry in the series was way too jokey and much too hokey .Some good moments , but not worth watching again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Since you do n't wanna watch the commentary on DVD , I suggest you pick up the book by Jim Dillard .It has a ton more background and every single major cast member from TOS gets to face their greatest pain .I loved that part when Kirk said he needs his pain - stayed with me all of my life .Also , when \" God \" first appeared , they really had me going for 20 seconds that it was the real thing .Watching it again today as an adult still gives me chills downs my spine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This movie is no masterpiece , we all know it .But all in all , to me it plays like a clumsy season 3 TOS epidode , which makes it more watchable than STMP , which comes off as something more or less unrelated to TOS and a boring 2001 knockoff .This movie has it 's charms , and really only goes off the rails in the ridiculous 3rd act .It 's just too damn bad they went with this script and concept , and it looks worse than it is in comparison with the great 3 films that preceded it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I agree with levi ... it is like a TOS episode blown out of proportion for the movie screen .In fact , it recalls \" Who Mourns for Adonis \" and really , the Enterprise meeting one ' god ' was enough .Do n't even get me started on how the script humiliates Scotty ....DeForest Kelley must have known that William Shatner probably was n't going to be able to steer this one to success , but damn if he did n't give it 100 % in his scenes anyway .I really think he gives the best performance in the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Bones recalling the euthanizing of his father was certainly a character defining moment !Did anyone else get a tingling sensation when \" God \" appeared - I thought it was the real thing for about 30 seconds the first time I saw it .Liked the line about God being in the human heart - reaffirmed my atheism .Also - The \" Boldly Go where No Man Has Gone Before \" on the steeting wheel was a nice touch .The re - invogorated youth of the characters can be attributed to some middle - age crisis :) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's far to say I have seen this more than any other Trek film as a result of having it on tape .I would n't say I loved it but I loved Star Trek and at the time it was the one easy way for me to watch the characthers I loved .If you 'd have asked me back then to rate it out of 4 stars I would have probably given it a 3 and half .If you asked me now .I 'd probably give it a one .It really has n't aged well in comparison to the other movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A good read , if you can find it .It 's funny to me that the worst Trek movie gets one of the best scores .I love Goldsmith 's music especially the Mountain Man and Busy Man cues .I wish they 'd release a special edition of this score the way they did for TMP .If you pick this up make sure though you avoid the awful Hiroshima track at the end .For all its considerable faults , I will still take this one over Nemesis .I just ca n't forgive the way Nemesis took characters with 7 seasons and 3 movies worth of backstory and turned them into nobodies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Actually , I do n't have such a problem with that notion - maybe it 's the Vulcan equivalent of a ' home birth ' : an old - fashioned or traditional birthing .Considering how traditional Vulcan culture can be , maybe some of them choose to give birth as their ancestors did and perhaps Amanda chose to do the same ?Also , considering how hot Vulcan is , I 'm sure a nice cool stone bench in a cave would be a pretty comfortable place to lay .Okay , you 're right .It 's ridiculous .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I actually liked STV , but only after it was over .A New - Agey Vulcan claiming to be leading the crew to God actually leads them to the Devil ( a being willing to imitate people 's idea of God and deceive in order to get what he wants ?Sounds like the Devil to me ) ; and it 's not the logic of Spock , or the emotionality of McCoy that spots the problem , but the plain , ordinary , common sense of Kirk .To certain world - views , that 'll preach .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But the characters -- aside from McCoy -- are so off in this movie .Kirk trying to HUG Spock on a KLINGON VESSEL ?Kirk did n't hug Spock after Spock was brought back from the freaking dead !The writing for Kirk is just so bad , and Shatner plays the role without any of his usual charm , \" He 's sorry .That makes it all right .He 's sorry .\" Spock is too cutesy and Scotty is like a bad Scotty impersonation .The logical gaffes can be ignored .Nobody complains about the Enterprise - E getting from the Neutral Zone to Earth in time to help stop the Borg in ' First Contact ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I will say that I do n't think this movie is all that much worse than STTMP , which I find to be boring and badly written .But ' Final Frontier ' is just truly awful .Like others , I really liked this movie when I was young .I did n't notice the poor sfx and humour , but loved the action scenes , the running around through the ship and even the banging of Scottys head .I watch it again , yesterday , on DVD for the first time in about ten years , and I am afraid I have to agree with the review .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The very poor sfx prevent you to be sucked into the story or to \" belief \" in the visuals , such as the great barrier and \" god \" .I must credit the shuttlebay set though , even if it is scaled weirdly .Engineering , on the other hand , is ... wait , which Engineering ?Well , it beats a brewery I guess .Ignoring Kirks omniscient and heroic portrayal , I thought the interaction between the great three was still good , such as the camp fire beginning / ending , the pain part , the brig part and the standing by the steering wheel whilst entering the Great Barrier .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Certainly this film will always be the worst of the motion pictures , but rather than rake it over the coals again , here are some of the things I liked or thought worked in the film . 1 )The slow - mo arrival of Sybok on his horse seemed mysterious and dramatic . 2 ) Sybok 's laugh at the end of the prologue .3 )The singalong is a silly idea , but the \" I 'll die alone \" dialog is well written and performed .4 ) James Doohan 's performance .If Simon Pegg were truly trying to ape Doohan 's portrayal , I think it would have to be from ST V. It 's Doohan 's most comic of the film series .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Here are these experts of flying through uncharted space , but staying on a hiking trail in the States appears to be beyond their abilities .It reminds me of a line Hawkeye said in MASH to a patient once : \" I know what you 're thinking .This guys looks like he ca n't fix a bicycle tire .Well , I ca n't .But I 'm going to get you through this .\" 6 )The night raid of the Enterprise crew ( while not the greatest action scene of the film series ) is n't bad for as short as it is and the phasers and gattling gun disparancy is refreshing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wanted to hear more of his conversation with Sybok . 8) Laurence Lukenbill really does n't look like a Vulcan ( despite the makeup ) and I do n't care for the halfbrother plotline , but his performance is very well done .He has the evil glint in his eye when he 's throwing Kirk around the shuttlebay , the innocence and faith as he meets \" God .\" The whole thing .He 's not really a villain , but he has the capacity to do some evil things .A well rounded portrayal of an emotional vulcan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "However , when Nichelle Nichols was asked what her favorite memory of working on the Star Trek films was , ( at the 2011Las Vegas Trek convention )She said it was the fan dance scene !It gave her character something new and unusual to do , and was fun to shoot- .So , with this very different perspective , I 've adjusted my opinion of the scene ( if not the movie ... ) .In her memoirs , if I remember correctly , Nichelle Nichols recounts that Shatner actually asked her if she would be comfortable performing the fan dance or if she wanted a body double .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I just watched this movie for the third time since its initial release .I chuckled often .Maybe I am just in a good mood or maybe there are too many people who take these shows too seriously .This film is jovial for true fans of the characters like me who enjoy the camaraderie between the actors .I agree this movie blows , but I also agree with a quote about it I heard when Nemesis came out \" Star Trek Nemesis is un - watchable bad , not watchable bad like Star Trek 5 or the motion picture \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "After making changes that pleased the studio and both Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley , a troubled production began under studio pressure to release the film by summer 1989 so as to not lose Star Trek IV 's tremendous momentum .Shatner 's original cut was over two hours but he was forced to cut it down to a one hour forty - five minute runtime .Harvey Bennett 's cut horrified Shatner and the two fought over what should stay and what could be cut .If one thing can be said for William Shatner 's turn as director , it 's that he sure went for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately , the execution is where Star Trek V falls apart .The story feels like three separate and disjointed ideas brought into one uneven movie .The first third of The Final Frontier deals with a hostage situation .The crew of the Enterprise is on Earth on shore leave after it 's discovered that their new starship is riddled with glitches .Kirk , Spock and McCoy go camping together .Kirk goes mountain climbing in an opening sequence that 's beautifully filmed but ill - conceived .Right away with this opening sequence , The Final Frontier disregards all the character work that 's been done in the previous three movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The aging of these characters was acknowledged in the two follow - up films .But here , the characters are returned to a state of \" eternal youth \" , any and all acknowledgment of them having aged in the 20 years since Star Trek ended dismissed .A perfect example is the painful - to - watch naked fan dance of Uhura in the desert .Sure this would 've worked on an episode of the series ( had censors allowed such things at the time ) but 23 years after first hitting the air , these people are n't exactly spring chicks anymore yet the characters are treated as such .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The three friends sit around a campfire having discussions about death , family and friendship .The bond that 's depicted between each of the characters is touching and noteworthy , unfortunately the scene finishes with a very ill - advised sing - along .Once the crew is reunited , it 's off to Nimbus III to resolve the hostage situation .The crew races to save the hostages as the Klingons have also sent their own ship , led by Captain Klaa ( Todd Bryant in a thankless role ) .This leads to Uhura in a naked fan dance with a big moon behind her in the desert before a shoot - out in a city taken right out of a western .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The ultimate revelation : the hostages are now on Sybok 's side .So much time reassembling the Enterprise crew from shore leave to embark on their adventure that by the time the hostage situation is resolved halfway through , we realize that it 's only purpose was to launch us into the \" main adventure \" .The hostage situation is nothing more than a setup plot to get the main thrust of the plot going .The hostages themselves are mere cardboard characters with no purpose , no personality and no impact on the rest of the movie whatsoever .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The second portion of the story deals with Sybok 's takeover of the Enterprise .Using his ability to \" remove people 's pain \" , Sybok is able to convert Uhura , Chekov and Sulu to his cause .How Sybok is able to do this is never explained and the ease with which these three characters fall victim to his manipulations only demeans the characters .As Sybok hijacks the Enterprise to take it to the center of the galaxy , Kirk , Spock and McCoy work with Scotty to try to call for help while avoiding capture by Sybok and the Enterprise crew .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Which leads to another criticism of The Final Frontier .The humor is n't very humorous .The Final Frontier tries to emulate The Voyage Home 's success by mixing lighthearted fun with drama but it does n't work here .Campfire sing - alongs , mispronunciations of the word \" marshmallow \" and chairs that rock are n't funny .The humor is forced and does n't take full advantage of the cast 's natural chemistry .At times , it 's painful to watch .Sybok manages to catch up to Kirk , Spock and McCoy and tries to convince them that Sha Ka Ree exists .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This leads to a good scene where McCoy must relive his father 's death .DeForest Kelley nails the scene .Less effective is Spock reliving his birth .I find it unlikely that Spock would be able to remember the first seconds of his life .In true Kirk fashion , Kirk refuses to allow Sybok to take his pain away claiming that our pain is what makes us who we are .The line is one of the few in the movie that strikes true yet also calls into question Sybok 's ability to remove someone 's pain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Great Barrier is a disappointingly realized .Intended to be impenetrable , it looks like nothing more than swirling ink in a jar through which the Enterprise easily passes in a matter of seconds .Any suspense is quickly removed .The planet of Sha Ka Ree is also a disappointment , looking similar to the desert used for Nimbus III only through a purple filter .Sybok 's quest is to ultimately meet God from whom he 's been receiving visions .This leads to the ultimate bind for not only the film but the franchise as a whole .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Will they really meet God ?If so , this is truly the final frontier and what 's the point of trying to go further ?Once you 've found God , what else needs to be explored ?If it 's not God , however , what do you find instead ?Obviously , God will not be found and instead find an evil alien that wants to use the Enterprise to get off Sha Ka Ree , a planet which it claims Sybok created .This is never fully explained and the ultimate climax involves the alien creature chasing Kirk and the Klingons attacking the Enterprise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It sure seems like it because the ending is a muddled mess .The resolution with the Klingons is also a little too easy .Of the three rescued ambassdors , Charles Cooper as the Klingon Korrd is the only one who manages to have a role in the film 's finale .Unfortunately , the peace that 's brokered with the Klingons not only takes place off - screen but is n't justified .Korrd is supposedly a drunken has - been in the Klingon Empire who 's been put out to pasture .If so , how does he have enough sway to talk Klaa out of his attack on the Enterprise ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Klingons are also demeaned to being cocktail party guests aboard the Enterprise .How unfortunate .The closing moment is nice , though , as Kirk , Spock and McCoy contemplate on whether or not God is really out there .Kirk 's line that \" Maybe God 's in the human heart \" is thoughtful and seems to grasp the idea that Shatner had originally intended .The Final Frontier tackles theology and religion in a way that Star Trek had n't done before and it 's a noble endeavor .Too bad the movie itself is pretty bad and never achieves the greatness that Shatner sought .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Though the Enterprise bridge is probably one of the best looking bridge sets in the franchise , the rest of the movie 's visuals are bad .The special effects are pretty awful and unconvincing , especially the Enterprise 's escape from an incoming Klingon torpedo and the aforementioned \" Great \" Barrier .The performances of the cast are decent .Shatner , Nimoy and Kelley are reliable as always , as is the rest of the supporting cast .There are actual attempts to develop the supporting characters more , particularly a supposed budding romance between Scotty and Uhura .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And as mentioned before , the crew succumbing so easily to Sybok only diminishes them .Laurence Luckinbill gives a good performance as Sybok , a Vulcan who puts his emotions on full display .However , the actual character is underwritten and not very threatening .Anyone who knows that Sybok is intended to be Spock 's half - brother will not that I 'm only now mentioning that little plot point .The reason for that is that it 's so inconsequential that Sybok that it 's a needless inclusion into the story .Luckinbill gives it his all and compensates for the character 's underdevelopment but he does n't save the character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Goldsmith reprises both his main march ( that was currently being used as the main title for Star Trek : The Next Generation ) and his Klingon theme , putting both to good use .His new themes that accompany the friendship scenes as well as the journey to meet God are great .It 's a shame such a great score accompanies such a bad movie .William Shatner gives it his all , striving to think big and think epic .Unfortunately , he falls far short of his intended vision for a thought - provoking epic adventure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Writing : .5 / 2.0 Characters : .5 / 2.0 Acting : .75 / 2.0 Entertainment : .5 / 2.0 Music : 1.0 / 1.0 Visuals : .25 / 1.0 .I have always had a soft spot for this film , mainly because of a few excellent and in my opinion , essential scenes in the ST continuum .The first is the campfire sequence in which McCoy is going off on Kirk for being irresponsible and careless ... and Kirk elegantly and believably responds by sharing his feelings about the way he knows he 's going to die .... alone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "First you have the three iconic men of Trek ( the big three , if you will ) in each others company in a touchingly intimate and deep way that we really have n't seen before .It then turns into an even deeper reflection as Kirk explains further that he knows he 'll die alone , as in not in the company of his friends or dear ones .The look the on faces of the other two round off what is a masterfully written , directed and performed scene .The three lead basically tragic lives , with no families of their own to be with when off - duty , and yet they still have each other .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Absolutely profound .The next scene is the much acclaimed Sybok flashback scene and subsequent \" I need my pain ! \" dialogue from Kirk .Jammer and others have said enough about this sequence so I wo n't attempt to parrot them .Finally there is the scene where Kirk and co. meet and confront \" God \" .Look past the hokey special effects , painfully obvious ominousness of the God character and McCoy 's flip - flopping out - of - character moments and you have something genuinely well done .Kirk is not just confronting this \" God \" in the here and now but in his one simple question , \" What does God need with a starship ? \" he is simultaneously questioning every God , deity or entity of faith that has ever existed or rather purported to have existed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Since the days we drew stick figures on cave walls through to today , for all our advances we still can not provide a definitive answer .Again profound , not lacking in the nuances of the Kirk character or the attitude of ST as a whole , it manages to articulate the point across well ; that one way or the other we will never know .As for the God character , I address you directly Jammer , is it really important who or what it is and why it is there ?The mysterious element serves it well but that aside , any explanation would only distract from what the picture was trying to get across , namely that whatever this entity is it is not \" God \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In other words God is our prisoner because we created him and he is only as powerful as we make him .It 's a shame this flopped so badly , in some ways , because this movie contained several genuinely great moments .The campfire discussion when Kirk says he 's going to die alone , the moment in the ready room when Sybok looks into Spock 's and McCoy 's lives followed by Kirk 's \" I need my pain \" moment .Good stuff ; I just wish they 'd put that in another movie .Also , this movie debuted my favorite phaser pistol design ( the \" assault phaser \" ) which would later be used in Star Trek VI .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Agree with you about Contact , Jammer , but comparing that masterpiece to this movie is like comparing fancy French food to week - old McDonald 's french fries .Painful to watch .I remember thinking I 'd wasted an afternoon at the cinema .Shatner says that this is his favorite .I like the guy , but ... what ?Only thing I can think of this mess is that someone wanted to punish the fans or the studio .Copyright \u00a9 1994 - 2016 , Jamahl Epsicokhan .All rights reserved .Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of any review or article on this site is prohibited .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
