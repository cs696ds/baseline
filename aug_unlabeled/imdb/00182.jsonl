{"text": "REVIEW : City of the Living Dead .City of the Living Dead Director : Lucio Fulci Year 1980 .City of the Living Dead is an atmospheric zombie film brought to us by Italian horror maestro Lucio Fulci .While wholly unorthodox , the movie has one of the most oppressive atmospheres of the genre , placing the viewer smack dab in the middle of a surreal nightmare where hell is threatening to break loose and seemingly does .With Fulci 's trademark splatter effects and his pension for creating a dreamlike tone for his films , this strange zombie opus is one you wo n't soon forget .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dunwich , where a priest commits suicide by hanging himself from a tree .This disturbing act opens the gates of hell , turning this normally quite town into a feasting ground for the living dead .Plagued by a vision of the dying priest , young psychic Mary Woodhouse , teams up with a .New York City reporter , Peter Bell , as they travel to the town of .Dunwich in order to stop , what Mary possibly believes , to be the end of the world .The dead shall rise and walk the earth and we have front row seats for the zombie apocalypse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Catriona MacColl plays the role of Mary Woodhouse , the psychic who is literally , yet temporarily , struck dead after having a horrible vision of a priest committing suicide .MacColl is no stranger to fans of Lucio Fulci , seeing that she has played key roles in two other films of the Italian filmmaker 's ; The Beyond and The House by the Cemetery .Lucio seems to revel in putting his actors and actresses through hell , and MacColl seems to have the grapes to take anything the twisted director can throw at her , resulting in three strong female characters that are just masterfully performed by the talented actress .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "New York City reporter Peter Bell .I 've always got a kick out of George and enjoyed his various contributions to the horror genre as a whole and City of the Living Dead is no exception .His performances in Pieces , Day of the Animals and Grizzly , are legendary among my circle of friends , and in this film he succeeds in bringing that same charm and watchability that he 's known for .As for the film itself , it is something of an oddity , relying heavily on its tremendously established atmosphere to set the tone and feel of the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Instead , Fulci enjoys throwing the viewer right into the fray and allowing them to swim head deep into a surreal world where nothing is as it seems .The result of this technique is nothing short of brilliant , giving way to a vibrant cinema world that is truly unsettling .The aspects of Fulci 's films that add even more to the unsettling tone of his stories are the outrageously gory moments that he splatters throughout these surreal gems .With City of the Living Dead , we are gifted a truly disgusting series of effects driven wonders , particularly when a young woman begins dripping blood from her eyes and then vomits up her insides in one gore producing mess .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With that horrific ordeal recorded , we also are given some nasty kills provided by the strangely teleporting zombies of the flick .In a great number of scenes , the zombies choose to sneak up on their victims and then proceed to rip out the back of their skull and yank a piece of brain out , squishing it like a rotten piece of fruit .Now that 's got ta hurt !Another one of Fulci 's trademark calling cards is put to the test when a window bursts open and begins pouring a huge mass of maggots onto the ensemble cast , as they try desperately to avoid the shitstorm of creepy crawlers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If there is one thing to be said for City of the Living Dead , it is that it 's one grotesquely surreal and absolutely nasty zombie film , done just the way I like it .City of the Living Dead is as bizarre as a zombie film can get and when you add that to the fact that Lucio Fulci is behind the lens , then you 've got yourself one demented undead smorgasbord .The movie is saturated in doom , never lifting the tone for a second and relishing in every macabre filled moment of it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The level of gore and grotesquely shot moments are abundantly present and the quality to these memorable chunks of movie gold are off the richter scale , showing that tried and true staple of excellence that Italian splatter cinema is famous for .If you 're in the mood for something truly bizarre and you fancy yourself a zombie movie lover , then get your ass a copy of City of the Living Dead , because that Lucio Fulci is one sick , gore loving bastard .This film is ...... .I 've always thought the scene with the girl inside the coffin influenced Tarantino for KILL BILL 2 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
