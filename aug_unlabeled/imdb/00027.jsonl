{"text": "Would you like to know who I would be perfectly okay with removing from movies forever ?Chris Tucker .I ca n't think of a single role where he did n't annoy me and make me wish his character dead .And it 's not like he 's a great actor either .No , the stand - up comedian , ( I do n't actually mind his standup routines ) , just is n't ever given good roles , or is possibly only given roles that people believe he can pull off .And since those roles are always ones of annoyance , he infuriates me when he 's on - screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Tucker plays Rudy Rhod , a media personality who has a high - pitched voice and talks over everyone whenever he gets the chance .He 's introduced to us by getting a chance to sing , but eventually becomes the stereotypical sidekick role .But he 's so over - the - top and so incredibly infuriating that I just wanted him to leave the film and never return .Which happens near the end , when he announces his departure and is n't seen from any more .But it comes too late and by that point , I wanted more conclusion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think that if a character made me feel this strongly - someone who is n't even the lead of the picture - then the film has done a good job .But making an intentionally annoying character has repercussions , as I did n't like the film as much as I potentially would have had it not been included .It 's a mixed bag in including things like this , but I 'll call it a success here because of how strong an emotional response it got out of me .It did this , especially in comparison to how neutral I felt regarding the film 's story , which did n't make me feel much of anything at all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One day , a girl falls through the roof of his cab - more or less unharmed , I might add - but does n't speak English .She manages to tell him to take her to a priest named Vito Cornelius ( Ian Holm ) , and that her name is Leeloo ( Milla Jovovich ) .It 's at the priest 's house that the film 's prologue , which depicted events taking place 300 years ago , starts to make sense .The giant planet headed toward Earth can only be stopped by some mystical being who , together with four stones each representing the four elements ( air , water , earth and fire ) will destroy it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Leeloo is this being .But there are no stones .We learn where they are : They 're being kept by one Diva Plavalaguna ( Inva Mula ) on a planet that is difficult to get to .This sparks a race from four parties : Korben and the government , Leeloo and the priest , the main bad guy of the film , Zorg ( Gary Oldman ) and some creatures called the Mondoshawan .Zorg wants the stones to help the evil planet , who is affectionately named Mr. Shadow , while the Mondoshawan want them to sell them to Zorg .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The story left me with indifference , particularly because of how quickly it comes to a conclusion .We see early on , when Leeloo is learning about our culture that she is horrified at the images of war .If humans are such terrible things , why should she help save them anyway ?We know that this is what 's going through her mind , partially because it 's obvious how shocked she is , but also because of how well Jovovich has to act with only her body language .But the answer to this question comes and goes like a gust of wind , and then the film has its final scene .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Her character does n't know how to speak English ( although she can apparently understand it ) .So she has to convey emotions through her facial expressions , body language , and her eyes .And she does it .It works .We care for a character that ca n't even use verbal communication , because of how well Jovovich does with this role .That 's not to say the other actors do n't do a good job too , ( apart from Tucker ) , but they do n't have the same degree of difficulty as she does .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now , science - fiction films generally go one of two ways , and spend all of their time after production in one of these two directions .They 'll either remain timeless , despite their special effects having aged and not looking quite as good as they once did , or they can look dated very soon after their release .The world created here is one that feels realistic , and the things it dreams up are imaginable .The special effects are n't even that bad , even if they are showing their age a touch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's like finding a chocolate chip in your lemonade .The chocolate chip itself is good , but finding it in your beverage was unwelcome .That 's what the large action scenes in this film felt like .Alone , there 's nothing wrong with them , but when this film was n't really about action , but they 're thrown in near the end anyway , they do n't feel like they should be there .That 's really the biggest problem that this film has though , well , that , and the lack of emotion that came from the main story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The main story takes a while to get going , and once it does , there are moments that slowed it down and seemed unnecessary .You could probably chop this film down to about 105 minutes , instead of just over two hours like it ended up being , and you 'd actually have a better film .( For instance , we could remove all of Tucker 's character , especially the 5 minutes of \" singing \" that happens when we first meet him . )Helping to alleviate some of these pacing problems is the script , which is n't great , but some of the dialogue that comes from it is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are a lot of scenes where I found myself laughing , and this was unexpected .This also stops once the action scenes begin though , which is another reason that I disliked them .The absolute best part of the film comes from how certain scenes , and the transitions from scene to scene , are structured .A character will say something in one scene , and we 'll cut to another character in a completely different area , who will respond or react to what the first character said .While not a revolutionary technique , it 's one that I like to see employed , so I was happy to see it happening here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's not amazing , but it 's a fun ride that has colorful characters and some solid acting .The sci - fi setting is interesting and actually a decent enough depiction as to how our society could go , which means that this is a film that will likely stand the test of time .If only I had cared more about what was happening , or if Chris Tucker had been removed from the production , it would have been an absolute pleasure to watch .As it is , a really solid film that could have been better , but still was really enjoyable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
