{"text": "With BLACK ROCK , we knew exactly where it was going , exactly what was happening , the plot was very laid out and the structure was much more strict in a lot of ways .But that was great .I loved it .I 'm a Libra , so I have a hard time making decisions .I still look at FREEBIE and I 'm like \" I just wish maybe we had done this . \"With this it was like , \" No , that 's what the scene had to be .\" It could have been anything .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "At first , you 're like , \" Oh , cool .These chicks are going to take their clothes off , and then before you know it you totally forget that they are naked , which is so cool .Capone : Did you and Lake have to talk about how that scene was going to progress , and how far you would take it . \"So I was like , \" It 's written that we are naked naked , like fully naked .How cool are you with this ? \" She was like \" Well , you 're right next to me , so if we are doing this , we 're doing this , and I 'm ready .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But yeah , there was a conversation .It 's not like I 'm dying to take my clothes off in a movie , but for the right reasons , in the right context I loved the way these girls had to be naked .I loved that this was a turning point where they get totally animalistic and primal , and this is where they start to really fight to live , and I loved that .They really strip away , metaphorically , all of their shit and get down to the bare bones and basics of survival .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
