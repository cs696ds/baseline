{"text": "The Ultimate Matrix Collection 1999 - 2003 ( 2007 ) - Warner Bros.Released on HD - DVD on May 22nd , 2007 .Overall Box Set Extras ( Original / New ) : A-/C+ Overall Box Set Value : B- .We reviewed Warner 's original 10-disc The Matrix Ultimate Collection when it was first released on standard DVD back in 2004 .So we 're going to forgo any discussion of the films in this review , and focus instead on the quality and features included in this new 5-disc HD - DVD box set .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Let 's get right to it ... .DISC ONE : THE MATRIX -------------------( DVD / HD - DVD Combo format - most content repurposed from previous DVD releases ) .Side One - The Matrix ( HD - DVD ) .Film : A Video ( 1 - 20 ) : 18 Audio ( 1 - 20 ) : 18 Extras ( Original / New ) : A+/C+ .So the big question you 're probably wondering right off the bat , is how does The Matrix look in 1080p video ?The answer is pretty damn great .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Certainly good enough to make even the most picky HD fans happy .Colors are muted and stylized as part of the film 's intended look , but they 're exactly as intended and saturation is certainly better than the previous DVD release .Contrast is absolutely outstanding , with deep blacks and yet plenty of subtle shadow detailing .The only tiny issue here is just the slightest visible compression artifacting in the most complex motion - the quick flurry of \" matrix \" program code , billowing explosions , etc .It 's very minor , but on very large displays , well - trained eyes can spot it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The audio is also much improved in both English Dolby True HD and Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 .Both offer natural and expansive soundstages , with tremendous dynamic range and precise , even at times delicate imaging .The TrueHD adds to this an additional measure of subtle smoothness and clarity .This is a delightful HD home theater experience .The best thing about the extras on this disc , and all of the movie discs in this set for that matter , are the audio commentary tracks ( carried over from the 10-disc set ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have to confess , I was a little miffed back in 2004 when I first learned that the Wachowskis had no intention of recording a director 's commentary .But to my surprise , the tracks are pretty fantastic .Well ... the philosopher commentary is at any rate .The critic track is mostly three guys trying to impress you with their film knowledge , pointing out all the various cinema connections you 'd expect to hear about ( references to Cocteau , film noir , Hong Kong action and other such things ) .It 's amazing , given how much they supposedly dislike these films , how much they actually find to gush about .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These guys are a couple of real hipster / deep thinkers - a genuine Vroomfondel and Majikthise .You 'll be listening and West will mutter something like , \" Good God almighty , I like this music , \" in his smooth , Funkadelic tones , and then he 'll chime in with , \" This is very interesting , the relationship between awakening and danger .Book yourself a nice , long block of free time and consume this track with much alcohol .You will not be disappointed .For this HD - DVD release , Warner has also created a new In - Movie Experience ( IME ) picture - in - picture commentary option for The Matrix .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately , the problem is that , near as I can tell , virtually everything you see and hear has been repurposed from the many documentaries and featurettes that you 'll find elsewhere on this set .You 're not really getting anything new , you 're just getting it fed to you in a different way .I 'd have preferred maybe new interviews with the Brothers ... or more original content .As it is , it 's sort of cool , but nothing you 're likely to want to experience more than once .A very nice touch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One more comment : Warner 's obnoxious new anti - piracy warning screen must go .It 's more than a little irritating to be scolded about copying the moment you put the disc in your player , especially after dropping a cool $ 100 + for the set .Side Two - The Matrix Revisited ( DVD ) .Extras : B .Side Two of this combo disc is basically the same DVD that was released in 2001 , and again as Disc Two in the 2004 box set .It was a sort of The Matrix 1.5 , without actually making you buy the film again ( although it was also sold as a 2-pack with the film disc ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Matrix Revisited helped a great deal by adding a 122-minute documentary on the making of the original film and the preparation that was ( at the time ) underway for the sequels .It 's all presented in 4x3 aspect ratio , which is no surprise .I said this is BASICALLY the same DVD that was released earlier , but it 's not quite identical .A few of the more marketing oriented featurettes from the original Matrix Revisited disc have been left out ( including previews of the forthcoming films , The Animatrix , the official website and a rather silly look at fans of the website ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "DISC TWO : THE MATRIX RELOADED -------------------( DVD / HD - DVD Combo format - most content repurposed from previous DVD releases ) .Side One - The Matrix Reloaded ( HD - DVD ) .Film : C+ Video ( 1 - 20 ) : 18.5 Audio ( 1 - 20 ) : 18.5 Extras ( Original / New ) : A-/C+ .The 1080p video quality of The Matrix Reloaded , if anything , is even a little bit improved from The Matrix HD - DVD .This might be due to the original film stock or the transfer - both Reloaded and Revolutions were shot a couple years after the original Matrix .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's still a little tiny bit of compression artifacting ( visible on very large displays , for example when Trinity dissolves into a flurry of \" matrix \" program code in the film 's opening ) but again it 's very , very minor .The Dolby TrueHD and Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 audio options are also every bit as good as the original film on HD - DVD , and possibly even a little better given that more effort and money was spent on the production .The mix just sounds a little more active - like the film 's more elaborate visuals , Reloaded offers just a little more ear candy too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact , I 'm almost ashamed to say that I have a greater appreciation for this film 's 10-minute rave scene than I did before .Not because of the critics ( \" This music is classic Tarzan ... \") , but rather for the philosophers , who basically ( and rightly ) point out that when you 're confused about the nature of your reality , what you need is to ground yourself .And how better than with a good dose of hot sex and sweaty cave dancing ?Well noted , oh great enlightened ones .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You also get another written intro from the Brothers W. .As with The Matrix HD - DVD , Warner has created another In - Movie Experience video commentary for Reloaded .As with the first , it 's solid but it 's mostly repurposed material .For those who want a more in - depth review of the film itself , check out my review of the previous DVD edition here .Side Two - The Matrix Reloaded Revisited ( DVD ) .Extras : B- .For the bonus side of Reloaded ( similar to Disc Four of the previous box set ) , you get more behind - the - scenes featurettes covering various aspects of the making of the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's nothing really amazing here ( if you 've seen one wire - fu featurette you 've seen them all ) , but fans will certainly enjoy most of this .As we noted above , the Enter the Matrix game footage archive is on the HD - DVD side .DISC THREE : THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS ------------------- ( DVD / HD - DVD Combo format - most content repurposed from previous DVD releases ) .Side One - The Matrix Revolutions ( HD - DVD ) .Film : B Video ( 1 - 20 ) : 18.5 Audio ( 1 - 20 ) : 18.5 Extras ( Original / New ) : B-/C+ .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not much more needs to be said on that score .As for extras , the two audio commentary tracks featuring the critics and the philosophers are again quite good .Their concepts finally all tie together here ... and you do n't want to miss that , do you ?From the previous DVDs , the HD - DVD side also includes 7 Behind the Matix featurettes , the film 's teaser and theatrical trailers , 6 TV spots and the written introduction by the Brothers .Warner has created yet another IME commentary for Revolutions , but it has the same inherent qualities and problems as those on the other HD - DVDs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Side Two - The Matrix Revolutions Revisited ( DVD ) .Extras : B- .The DVD side of this disc includes much of the Disc Six content from the box set - basically a behind - the - scenes look at the making of Revolutions , organized by category into a series of production featurettes .Once again , all are 4x3 video with audio in Dolby Digital 2.0 ( and optional French subs ) .And once again , it 's all fine and dandy - nothing really outstanding , but on the whole good , solid material .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Side One - The Animatrix ( DVD ) .The first side of Disc Four is virtually identical to Disc Seven of the original box set , and is very similar to the previously released DVD version of The Animatrix ( as reviewed here by Adam ) save for differences in the menus .All are presented in anamorphic widescreen video , with Dolby Digital 5.1 audio in English and Japanese ( and subs in English , French and Spanish ) .While these shorts are great , and they 're presented in good standard definition video quality , the fact that they have n't also been upgraded to 1080p is this box set 's MAJOR oversight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Extras : A .The second side of Disc Four contains the same content as Disc Eight from the original DVD box set .It 's broken into two documentaries - Return to Source : Philosophy & The Matrix ( 61 minutes ) and The Hard Problem : The Science Behind the Fiction ( also 61 minutes ) .Each of these documentaries goes in depth to address the various ideas , concepts , technologies and settings depicted in the films .Each boasts interviews with numerous philosophers , professors , futurists , scientists , theorists , writers and other heavy / free / outside - the - box thinkers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also included here are 7 Easter egg featurettes which you 'll find if you select the DVD credits box and press ENTER .I do n't want to say anything more than I already have about this material .Just check it out for yourself .It 's great stuff - the kind of thing I really love in a good DVD special edition of a science fiction film .At the very least , plenty of food for thought .DISC FIVE : THE MATRIX EXPERIENCE - DATABANK , PART TWO -------------------( DVD-18 - all content repurposed from previous DVD releases ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The first side of Disc Five contains the same content as Disc Nine from the original DVD release .The Burly Man Chronicles ( 94 minutes ) tells not so much the story of the making of these films , but rather the story of the people who gathered to make them and their collective struggle to get it all done .This is their journey and it 's a pretty fascinating one , featuring select interview footage with some of those involved , as well as lots of interesting , fly - on - the - wall glimpses of work behind - the - scenes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Interestingly , this documentary utilizes the Follow the White Rabbit viewing option that was found on the original DVD release of The Matrix .Through it , you can access nearly 80 minutes of additional behind - the - scenes featurettes , presented in relevant context within the documentary as a whole .You can also view these featurettes separately if you 'd rather through an index in the menus .There are 7 Pre - Production featurettes ( 32 minutes in all ) , 4 Alameda Shoot featurettes ( 15 minutes ) and 10 Australia Shoot featurettes ( 33 minutes ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's all one continuous piece .That 's a minor pain in the ass , but the program is so interesting that it 's well worth a bit of irritation .Best of all is the fact that the Wachowskis are everywhere in this piece .You see them at work on these films , you see the method to their madness .This is fun stuff .Side Two - The Zion Archive ( DVD ) .Extras : B- .The second side of Disc Five serves the same purpose as Disc Ten from the original DVD release .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When you select one of the galleries , you can either scroll through the images yourself or your player will slowly cycle through them on its own .The galleries are formatted for 16x9 displays , which is appreciated .The menu navigation in this section is awkward , but you quickly get used to it .By the way , if I have n't mentioned it yet , the Experience DVD discs in this set feature ROM weblinks to the official Matrix website .So here 's the deal : The original 10-disc The Matrix Ultimate Collection was , hands - down , an absolutely outstanding special edition DVD release - a deserving winner of our Best DVD - Overall award in our 6th Annual Bitsy Awards back in 2005 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The problem is that most Matrix fans already own it .So the question is this : Are the new features offered by Warner 's HD - DVD release worth a $ 100 + upgrade price .That 's very hard to answer .The upgraded high - definition video and high - resolution audio is excellent , no doubt , and if you 're a diehard fan of these films with a home theater that 's \" go for HD \" , that alone might be reason enough to buy this box .But other than that , you 're not getting much value .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Warner definitely get points from me for that - it 's something I really appreciate .So if you have n't purchased the 10-disc DVD set yet , this HD - DVD box delivers truly everything you could want .Well ... almost .The thing that COULD have made the upgrade to HD - DVD a no - brainer - new high - def transfers for all nine of The Animatrix shorts - did n't happen for some unknown reason .The shame of it is , if Warner had released all the standard DVD content included here on actual HD - DVD discs , the additional disc space might have allowed the Animatrix shorts to be presented in 1080p .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Would a couple more HD - DVD discs have had enough disc space to include all the standard def content plus the 9 shorts in actual HD ?Who knows ?On the other hand , will Warner 's promised Blu - ray Disc version take advantage of the added disc space on BD-50s to include the Animatrix shorts in HD ?Unlikely .In the end , Warner 's The Matrix Ultimate Collection is a very solid HD - DVD release , but it 's not a particularly good value .Who knows ... maybe Warner will re - release The Animatrix in HD separately later .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's worth saying here that since Warner claims to support both high - def formats evenhandedly , we certainly hope the studio 's The Matrix Ultimate Collection Blu - ray Disc announcement is set to happen imminently .May we suggest ditching the IMEs for high - def Animatrix ?In any case , whichever version you ultimately purchase , there can be no doubt that watching these films in 1080p video is a treat .Well ... the original Matrix anyway .It 's tough to watch Reloaded and Revolutions again , even in HD .But did we mention The Matix is pretty cool in HD ?
