{"text": "Born to Rule .Every year as winter begins , millions of sincere Christians eagerly celebrate the birth of Jesus with good will and Christmas cheer , scrumptious dinners and endless parties , eggnog and Yule logs , loads of gifts and lot of carols .On Christmas Eve , as on Easter Sunday , the churches are full , and all seems right with the world .For many , the Christmas season is their favorite time of the year .However , with all the commercialism infusing this particular holiday , the birth of Jesus has slipped far enough from its place of primacy that many concerned Christians make a point of urging their friends and neighbors to return the worship of Jesus to Christmas . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Put Christ back in Christmas ! \"A fine sentiment , undoubtedly expressed in all fervency , but it is entirely misguided .Such a statement is probably shocking to many , but it is true nonetheless because Jesus Christ was never in Christmas .The holiday is an entirely manmade celebration , instituted by Catholic Church fathers - Pope Julius officially sanctioned December 25 as the birthday of Christ in AD 350-to encourage the conversion of pagans to Christianity .It is no coincidence that Christmas coincides with the Roman Saturnalia , the Empire 's winter solstice celebration , because Christmas was instituted to replace the Saturnalia 's pagan rites with more wholesome , Christian ones .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Bible itself is silent on the Christian celebration of Jesus ' birth .One would think that if God the Father wanted His Beloved Son 's birth to be honored , He would have taken special care to ensure that the Good Book contained a directive to do so .But what do we find ?Instead , Jesus Himself instructs us to remember - not His birth - but His death ( Luke 22:14 - 20 ; I Corinthians 11:23 - 26 ) !The coming of the Savior into the world is certainly important , but at that point , Jesus was a helpless baby who had as yet done nothing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Bible contains the true account of Jesus ' begettal and birth in the early chapters of Matthew and Luke .These authors ' aims were 1 ) to give an accurate account of the circumstances , and 2 ) to reveal certain elements of spiritual significance to their readers .Matthew , a Jew writing mainly to other Jews , weaves his story around specific Old Testament prophecies that were fulfilled in these events .He is trying to show that Jesus Christ is the promised Messiah and heir of David , and thus the true King of Israel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Luke , however , was a Gentile writing primarily to other Gentiles , so he is not as interested in fulfillments of prophecy or Jesus ' Jewish roots .He wants his readers to know that Jesus Christ is the Savior of all men and women of every age and condition .In other words , he is intent on revealing Jesus as the universal Christ and Second Adam , through whom came life ( see I Corinthians 15:20 - 22 ) .These two perspectives and objectives go a long way in explaining the differences in their narratives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This distinction is perhaps best seen in their different genealogies of Jesus .Matthew begins his book with Jesus ' family tree ( Matthew 1:1 - 17 ) because a person 's heritage was of primary importance to Jews .In other words , He has a valid , legal claim to the throne of Israel ; He meets the qualifications .Luke has a very different list ( Luke 3:23 - 38 ) .It is evidently Mary 's genealogy , and thus Jesus ' natural genealogy .In addition , Luke takes the record all the way back to Adam and then to God Himself ( verse 38 ) , showing that , not only is Jesus the Son of Man , but He is also the Son of God .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The story of Jesus ' birth we all know well .The angel Gabriel appears to Mary , announcing that God had chosen her to bear His Son ( Luke 1:26 - 38 ) .At some point soon thereafter , she conceives through a miracle from God .When she is found to be pregnant , her betrothed husband Joseph decides to divorce her quietly , but an angel informs him in a dream that what had happened was from God ( Matthew 1:18 - 20 ) .The Child is to be named Jesus , and He would \" save His people from their sins \" ( verse 21 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In accordance with the law , Jesus is circumcised on the eighth day ( verse 21 ) and after forty days presented at the Temple along with an offering ( verses 22 - 24 ) .At that time , Simeon and Anna witness to His being the promised Redeemer ( verses 25 - 38 ) .Sometime after Jesus ' birth , an unknown number of wise men from the East come and worship Him , presenting Him with rich gifts : gold , frankincense , and myrrh ( Matthew 2:1 - 12 ) .These are typically gifts given to royalty , which He was , and signify - among other interpretations - His righteous life , complete sacrifice , and efficacious death .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While they are gone , Herod massacres the children of Bethlehem under two years of age in an attempt to stamp out his rival to the throne ( verses 16 - 18 ) .Returning to Judea after Herod 's death soon thereafter , Joseph , Mary , and Jesus live in Nazareth until He begins His ministry about thirty years later ( verses 19 - 23 ; Luke 2:39 - 40 ; 3:23 ) .The constant theme that emerges from both accounts of Jesus ' birth is that He was born into this world to save humanity from sin and rule as King of kings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
