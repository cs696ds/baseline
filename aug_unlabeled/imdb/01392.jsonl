{"text": "Tag Archives : The Expendables 2 .Lionsgate 's new action flick The Expendables 3 is one of the best new movies of 2014 .The third installment in the studio 's fan favorite franchise , it held its own quite well against the rest of the annual summer blockbusters that filled theaters this year .While it might not have exactly performed as expected domestically in theaters , those numbers mean nothing .The only reason that it did n't pull in the numbers of its counterparts from Marvel Studios and others is that it did n't have the notoriety of those properties .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That in itself is actually one of the reasons that audiences who have n't yet seen this movie will enjoy it .It will be discussed later .The central reason for the movie 's enjoyment is its writing .This includes the movie 's story and its dialogue .Both elements are classic action flick elements in every sense of the word .Together , they make for plenty of reason for every lover of the action genre to watch The Expendables 3 .The acting on the part of the cast adds even more reason for audiences to check out this throwback to Hollywood 's golden era of action flicks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie 's run time is just over two hours .To be precise , it is listed at two hours and six minutes .Over the course of that time , the story 's pacing rarely lets up .The rare times when it does it is only in moments that help to advance the story .The end result of that solid pacing coupled with the cast 's wholly entertaining acting and the movie 's writing overall is a movie that is one more great trip down memory lane for any fan of classic action flicks .In turn it proves itself to justifiably be one of the best new movies of 2014 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While few if any of the sequels thrown out there this year were really worth seeing , Lionsgate 's The Expendables 3 is an exception to that rule .This movie is a fun outing for any lover of action movies .It is especially so for anyone that grew up in the golden age of action flicks .It proves to be so fun thanks in large part to its writing .At the heart of the movie 's writing is the movie 's story .The movie 's story is a time honored element that any classic action flick fan will appreciate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Believe it or not , this is something from which writers seem to have increasingly strayed in the current era of film making .Whether it be action flicks , dramas , or otherwise , writers today seem to be trying to outdo one another in who can churn out the most convoluted and overly busy script possible .It 's nice to see that lead actor Sylvester Stallone and co - writers Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedict were able to work together and keep the story behind this movie so simple .It 's also nice to see other classic elements incorporated into the story such as the script 's dialogue .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The story itself is n't all that 's old school about the trio 's script .The dialogue that is incorporated into the script is a throwback in itself .There are classic one - liners peppered throughout the course of the movie 's run time .And then there is also Stonebanks ' equally classic soliloquy explaining his motives for having gone rogue .Conrad explains that he joined the bad guys ' side because of his hatred for the people that sent The Expendables to clean up their messes and the human cost associated with said missions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is a throwback to so many classic action movie villains before .Considering the classic action flick dialogue and the equally classic story line that are used in The Expendables 3 's script , one ca n't help but make a slight comparison to another movie released this year .The movie in question is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles .It did n't tease audiences with references to the golden era of action movies or the action movies that some audiences grew up with .It goes for the jugular , giving audiences of all ages another example of what once made action movies so great and what can still make them great again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That element is the commentary on the place of the classic action star in today 's movie market .At one point , the commentary makes for some great self deprecating humor with the younger members of the team throwing out verbal barbs at the team 's older members and vice versa .At another point before that , Barney ruminates on the place of himself and his team mates in their line of work .This is in essence the other side of that discussion on whether or not the old school action star still has a place in today 's action movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The ultimate revelation is that there is and always will be a place for action stars of the past and of the future in today 's world of action flicks .Stallone and company do n't come right out and say it with these moments .But it 's pretty obvious that this existential discussion of sorts is what they were using .It just so happened that it worked both as its own discussion and as part of the story in whole , too .And it is a nice addition to the movie 's script .Together with the previously noted factors , it helps to prove once and for all why the writing behind The Expendables 3 is the most important aspect to the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The work of the cast in terms of its acting is just as notable to the movie 's enjoyment .The writing behind The Expendables 3 is a solid foundation for the movie 's success .Resting just as easily on that foundation is the cast 's acting .The cast 's acting is just as enjoyable as the writing .Watching Barney ( Stallone ) and Hunter ( Schwarzenegger ) go was itself like watching a time capsule being opened up .At no one point do either of the duo 's portrayals feel forced .And even Drummer ( Harrison Ford ) is entertaining in a supporting role .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And Blade himself , Wesley Snipes was just as entertaining in his portrayal of Doc .Watching Doc is just like Watching Blade , especially early on when he is first broken off of the train .While the performances by Snipes , Ford , Stallone , and Schwarzenegger were each impressive in their own right , it is Mel Gibson 's portrayal of Stonebanks that is most notable .Gibson has his own experience in the action realm .But his portrayal here is peculiar .That 's not to say that Gibson did a bad job .Rather , he walks a fine line throughout the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nor does he go the route of say Heath Ledger 's Joker a la The Dark Knight or any other villain .It 's almost like he tried to really channel certain classic action movie villains and those of recent years all into one for his portrayal .While a little bit uneasy , the end result is still a villain that remains believable enough .And set against Stallone and the rest of his team , Stonebanks becomes even more entertaining .The rest of the team is just as enjoyable in its own right .But it really is these core actors that make the acting in The Expendables 3 so enjoyable and an important part of the movie 's enjoyment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The last element that makes the movie work as well as it does is the movie 's pacing .Over the course of the movie 's two hour run time , the movie rarely lets up .The only time at which it slows even slightly is when Barney is telling his team mates about breaking up the team .Even in a later moment when they - Lee Christmas ( Jason Statham ) , Doc ( Wesley Snipes ) , Gunner Jensen ( Dolph Lundgren ) , and Toll Road ( Randy Couture)-sit ruminating on the development , the pacing does n't let up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But Stallone and his co - writers do n't allow that to happen .They keep the story moving , allowing for the bulk of the story to be spent on its more important moments .And it is because of this that the movie never loses a step .Because it never loses a step , it allows for more enjoyment of the cast 's acting and of the elements incorporated into the movie 's script .It connects everything , making the movie complete and proving once more why it stands out proudly among Hollywood 's current forgettable crop of prequels , sequels , and remakes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They are movies that were churned out by Hollywood 's Power Five studios more for the sake of making money than actually entertaining audiences .The Expendables 3 is not one of those movies .It has proven through the combination of its in depth writing , the acting by its cast , and its pacing , that it actually sets out both to make money and to entertain audiences .It succeeded in both areas thanks to its global ticket sales total and despite being largely covered up by the rest of the blockbusters churned out this summer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But a much closer look shows that it 's more than that .Yes it 's a story about good versus bad .But it 's more than that .It 's also a story of man versus himself and man versus nature .The entire thing is set against the backdrop of the Afghan / Pakistani border .At the same time that the commandos have to fight a group of relentless Taliban fighters along the way , they also must battle the elements and their own wills in order to survive .The script 's writing will keep viewers engaged as will its cinematography and its backdrop .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Special Forces wastes no time moving the story forward .Right off the bat , audiences are presented with the central plot .That plot is that young reporter Elsa Casanova ( Diane Kruger ) has been kidnapped by a ruthless Taliban fighter who threatens to kill her because of something that she wrote about him in a newspaper .Considering the recent headlines concerning a young girl who was gunned down by Taliban fighters and by some miracle survived the shooting , this simple plot is actually quite believable .That believability will instantly pull viewers in and allow them to suspend their disbelief .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The writing keeps the movie 's action moving at a rapid fire pace early on .The cinematography does much the same .That 's especially the case during the shootout scenes between the commandos and the Taliban fighters .There are those who might complain that it moves too fast .But the point in the quick pacing of the shots is to emphasize the adrenaline levels of the commandos .One can only imagine if that 's what military forces currently fighting the Taliban and Muslim insurgents actually feel when they are actually in the process of firefights .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just as impressive is the work of the camera crews in capturing the landscape which the commandos must navigate in their journey to get Elsa back to Afghanistan .Not to give away too much but it is that same cinematography that helps heighten the drama of the man versus nature element of this action / drama .Audiences see just how much adversity the soldiers have to overcome throughout their journey .Whether it be against the Taliban forces that are constantly on their heels , or against the vast Middle Eastern mountains and plains , Elsa and her protectors are never really safe .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As one can hopefully tell by now , Special Forces is not just another military action thriller .There is more to it than one would realize from simply watching it .But hopefully in understanding everything noted here , viewers who give the movie at least one watch will have more understanding and appreciation for it .The Phil 's Picks Facebook page is also holding a drawing for copies of the movie .A trailer for the movie is also available now .Taken 2 is one of those movies for which there is no grey area .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only difference between that over the top sequel and this one is that more than likely 20th Century Fox will let this franchise end with the end of this movie .Is it the best sequel ever made ?No .But it is a great turn off your brain flick for anyone looking to escape from the constant barrage of negative news and every day stresses thrown at audiences every day on television and in the work - a - day world .Right from the movie 's opening moments , it grabs viewers by the collar , making no bones about what to expect .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Suppose I 'm sitting on my porch , taking a long exposure of something many miles away .( Err , I live on a mountaintop , and it 's dark .Or something like that . )And suppose that while I 'm taking the picture , I pace nervously back and forth across my porch , holding the shutter open all the while , but keeping my camera pointed at that distant object the whole time .No problem , right ?The object will appear to change slightly as I view it from different angles , but if the distance between me and it is much much greater than the width of my porch , the effect is negligible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
