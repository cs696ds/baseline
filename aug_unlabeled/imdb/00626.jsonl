{"text": "Reality slips into the fights forcing and inspired and newly invigorated Van Damme to truly draw on his own genuine fighting history to legitimately weather his younger rival .By way of irony , Adkins in real life while growing up was inspired by Van Damme . 1 Comment 14 of 15 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I must say , I was really looking forward to this movie .And I was probably looking forward to Scott Adkins as much as I was to Van Damme .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie was n't spectacular and it did n't quite reach my highest hopes , but I was n't disappointed .Van Damme played his usual laconic self - this time with a bunny .Scott Adkins ' character was n't very interesting either ( and the main villain was a bit annoying ) , but you ca n't have it all with these kinds of movies .With the exception of the final showdown , the fight scenes were very well shot and choreographed .J.J. Perry ( the fight choreographer ) did a great job with Van Damme 's abilities while still giving him room to exhibit his \" Van Damme \" style .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My chief complaint is about the poor editing and screen effects used in the last fight scene between Damme and Adkins .It would have been an excellent fight if the editors had just left the fight alone and not tried to enhance it .And so the last fight was disappointing because of the editing .On a five point scale , I 'd give it a 3.5 , but amazon does n't give you half points to work with , so I decided to give it a 4 .For the kind of movie this is , it was very satisfying .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Comment 8 of 8 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .The Shepherd : Border Patrol is a very good film !Van Damme 's best and most action packed since Wake of Death .Seriously , all the good ingredients are in there , guys .There 's plenty of hand to hand fighting in The Shepherd , even the gratuitous bar fight .There 's a likable chemistry between the lead and supporting cast , and the villains are well picked .There 's also a lot of good soundtrack work done in a style familiar to spaghetti westerns .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Although Van Damme has had fewer stinkers than those of his peers , he 's had his share .This , however , is n't too bad .It 's more polished and the dialogue more believable .But like so many others of this genre , it relies too much on formula .It 's very predictable and making Bulgaria look like New Mexico was a bit of a stretch .In the end , though , it was entertaining .I like Van Damme and I hope he does more , but it would be good to see some surprises for a change .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I 'm quite torn , after all , this movie , directed by Isaac Florentine , has some silly dialogue and obvious set - ups .Movies need to be rated according to the genre they belong .An action flick with a martial arts twist movie such as this is really quite average and should be 3 stars ; however , Van Damme delivers a more than adequate job and he is back kickin ' and punchin ' !That is the primary reason for the four stars , he is kicking again and unlike \" The Hard Corp \" or \" The Order \" where he was kickin ' too , this is more stylish and rugged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Time cop was probably the first movie to showcase this , but he was inconsistent in bringing out a fine acting performance ( For example , Sudden Death - good , The Quest - bad ) .This movie does not have the depth in script or direction of \" Until Death \" , yet , it is more enjoyable because Van Damme is once again the action and martial arts hero .Further , Van Damme has always stayed in either great or at least good shape ( unlike Seagal ) and while he has aged in the face , he turns in some great martial arts scenes with Scott Adkins ( whose fight scenes are terrific and villainous ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "2 Comments 2 of 2 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Van Damme continues to impress me with these direct to video releases .His only competition ( that I am aware of ) is Steven Seagal , also continuing to pump out the direct to video releases year after year , which fail to make it with fans of the genre .Where Van Damme succeeds , is that his acting and the stories in his new films continue to improve over his earlier action films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the Shepherd , we have a return to action ( though still certain expected restrictions ) but the addition of Scott Adkins ( Undisputed 2 ) aids in carrying it through .Van Damme 's acting has reached a new level and we can expect it to stay , and it is present in the Shepherd ( though yes , he is never going to be close to getting any awards ) .If we compare Shepherd to Until Death , Van Damme 's character is about 50 % as interesting and the story is n't quite as emotional , though it has it moments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
