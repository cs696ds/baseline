{"text": "Siberia , ' ' Mermaids ' and the Trouble With Seriously Fake Reality .Last night , NBC debuted yet another new series with a documentary style structure .The network is no stranger to the format , but this show is apparently more confusing for viewers than , say , The Office and Parks and Recreation .The difference is that this show , Siberia , is not a comedy .It 's a fictional show that plays like a reality game show .Any blurbs calling it \" Survivor meets Lost \" are unnecessary praise because that is literally what is intended .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That is if they are n't already keen enough to see the impossible camerawork ( common to other doc - style fiction series ) or have n't bothered looking up the program on IMDb or NBC 's website .But why would they go looking if they believed it to be just another nonfiction show ?This is n't quite The Blair Witch Project all over again , although that 's another work Siberia is clearly influenced by .I figure if Twitter existed in 1999 , we 'd have seen some similar responses to The Blair Witch Project as can be found about Siberia .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It 's typically easy to discern them as fictions because of their humor , most of which is exaggerated or otherwise obviously written .Because that 's the norm , general audiences expect it , and so it tends to only be if the movie is funny that it is understood to be a faux take on documentaries .Mocking something does n't necessarily mean it 's done to be funny , but it does n't totally allow for truly serious purposes either .Siberia is light enough to consider it to be indeed mocking the reality game show genre , even if it 's not playing for laughs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of course , a TV documentary about mythological creatures is still just as capable of deceiving people as a fake newscast about an alien invasion was in 1938 , given what I 've heard of gullible viewers believing Animal Planet 's Mermaids to be real .And before that , there was the controversial 1992 UK special Ghostwatch , which reportedly had deep psychological ramifications for its audience in spite of being upfront about being fiction .Edward Zwick 's 1983 TV movie Special Bulletin at least had a plausible premise of a nuclear terrorist threat , so it 's understandable that it caused the biggest panic of the sort since The War of the Worlds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm fascinated by serious faux docs and their impact , which is why I tuned in to Siberia ( I do n't even know where I 'd heard about it , but I was always informed that it was a doc - style drama series ) .It 's why I really wanted Daniel Stamm 's suicide film A Necessary Death to become a provocative phenomenon where people talked about the ethics of death and documentary , and if some of them were angry because they thought it was all real , all the better .One thing about serious faux docs is they do n't hold on to public interest for long .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's the dilemma , as neither of those films would have caught the attention and curiosity of people in the first place had they not been sold or been implied as being real .And if you do n't aim for that , you could just wind up like the little - seen Brothers of the Head , a music film about conjoined twins who lead a rock band .It 's a drama presented in documentary form , and though there is some very dry British humor , there was a certain awkwardness to it not being broadly comical .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's all good and fine to buck convention , but that 's likely going to result in something that disappoints people .Why would someone want to watch a fake version of Survivor that is n't laugh out loud parody ?It still is a clever lampoon that comments on the genre , but that 's not of interest to the mainstream television audience ( and we already got a great faux doc satirizing the violence of reality game shows 12 years ago with Series 7 : The Contenders ) .NBC probably played down the mock part for the pilot in order to hook people , and while there is the heavy feeling of it being a Lost copy through and through , Siberia does promise to be interesting long after we 've stopped thinking about its format .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
