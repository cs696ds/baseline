{"text": "Story : Taking into account the fact that this was made in 2004 , I give the story a 7 .Even though it was made almost 9 years ago , I had to take off some points for some serious loopholes in the story .It seemed like , after the first 30 - 40 minutes , the story was just dropped .They had went from not liking each other to suddenly using cute nicknames so fast that you could read more get whiplash .There was never a hint of them liking each other , so it just felt off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The first half hour or so was definitely the best part of this movie though .I had to keep pausing because I was laughing so hard that I could n't even hear what they were saying .Even though Ha Ji Won was 25/26 when she filmed this ( which I still ca n't believe while watching the movie ) , she pulled off her role as a teenager flawlessly .Kim Jae Won was amazing in his role of self - absorbed rich boy .I personally think they meshed well when on screen .The love - hate relationship they had going on was believable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Rewatch Value : Like I said , there were some things that just did n't make sense to me throughout the movie , so it 's not something I 'd want to give another try .At least not for a while .Overall : It had its ups and it had its down .The chemistry between the leads made up for a lot of the downs .The beginning and ending also made up for the downs .Well ... what to say ?What to say ?The story is n't the most original ; rich , jerk falls for a poor girl , but even though it is n't original , it 's a classic storyline .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There was n't any humor really , and the romance there was , was n't that great .It was almost like the genre was ... \"huh . \"The cast did good .I really liked the female lead .I saw her in Secret read more Garden , so it was cool to see her in a different role , and I thought she did great .The other characters / actors did n't leave an impression .I ca n't even remember their faces .I liked the music .It was sweet ?I would n't rewatch this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , the film was nice , no regrets watching it anyway .The story and the plot were n't that great but it was n't boring and that 's what matters the most .However , there were a lot of annoying events during the film .I know the lead actress but I am not too familiar with the lead actor ; they were good overall , I believe they 've done a nice job as actors but I ca n't say read more the same about their characters who were irritating and absurd .If you 're looking for a film to pass time with , this one could be what you 're looking for .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "First of all , I could n't like the main characters , and that is always a problem .I just could n't relate to their lives or problems at all .In my eyes , Ha - Young was just irritating , spoiled little girl screaming , making faces and throwing tantrums all the time .Hyung - Joon was n't any better , he was definitely read more arrogant ( as the movie 's name suggests ) , mean and self - centered .I could have still forgiven these flaws of theirs if they had had any good and amiable side in their personalities but I just could n't find enough good in them to make me like them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm normally okay with dramas or movies that have all sorts of marriage / sibling / dating / cohabitation agreements in order to provide the main characters enough interaction so that they can fall in love with each other .However , this \" Enslavement Agreement \" was too much for me .My dislike for this agreement was further strengthened by the fact that the girl was still underage and the boy in college ( call me prudish if you like ) .Had they had a pure , equal relationship , then it might have been okay , but in this case , the setting was just too weird .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I acknowledge the obvious time limitations of a movie compared to a drama but still , there just was something missing .Fourthly , I really did n't get the humour in this movie .Even the numerous day - dreaming scenes of the main heroine did n't really work or were n't that funny .I was actually really surprised to notice that Ha Ji Won played in this movie .I liked her in \" Secret Garden \" so I 'm tending to believe that this movie was n't so bad because of the acting but because of the storyline .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am no longer teenager , nor am I Korean , so maybe there were just some things I did n't get , but personally , I would n't recommend this movie to anyone .You 'll just feel stupid afterwards for wasting your time on it .Unfortunatley it was n't in a good way .The story line definitely had potential .I mean anyone who knows me will admit that i love the rich boy meets girl falls in love blah blah blah storyline .A LOT .But that 's exactly what this movie was for me ' blah blah blah . '", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "IT WASN\"T GREAT .If you need something to do than watch it .BUT , if you 've got other things to watch than save yourself some time and do n't watch it .I really liked this movies because it has a very surprising ending .This childish \" game \" turned out to be quite serious .And I think it one of the best korean movies for me .( Not the first one but at the top certainly )It 's funny , yet sad before the very ending and it gives you an unexpected solution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This was a cute and funny movie that really got me laughing .I love almost anything that can make me laugh and this did a pretty good job at doing just that .I will say this movie was a little gross at times , but it was n't something I could n't endure .I think there were probably only two scenes in this whole movie that I did n't like , but there were quite a few read more good ones that made me like it .This is also definitely a type of weekend movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think that more could 've been done with the story but it kept my attention .It 's not one of the best things I 've ever seen , it 's not the worst , but it 's not regrettable .Where to start ?The story was nice but nothing special .The idea of the plot had protential in my opinion but the result was n't that great .I did n't know any of the actors before but the main actors are pretty good .I think the actors did a pretty good job but the characters actually annyoed me way too often .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "100 Days with Mr. Arrogant may be cheesy but its super funny .I enjoyed watching the relationship develop between the leads .I loved that they hated each other in the beginning but somehow found themselves falling for each other .The acting did n't blow me away but I still loved the entire cast and they made thier characters believable .This might not be the best romcom out there but for an older movie read more I have to say it set out to do what it meant to , which was to entertain the audience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I disagree with the latest reviews ... but that 's just my opinion .I think that 100 Days With Mr .Arrogant was a pretty enjoyable watch at times it was hilarious too .Ok , after watching this movie , one thing was sure .This is NOT a tragic , tear - jerking romance story involving love triangles and heartbreaks .And that , is good enough for me .For starters , the story was nothing special - the typical rich boy , poor gal kind of modern - day fairy tale that might never happen in real life , although the sweet moments were there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The cast , music , they 're average .Nothing spectacular to squeal about .I just hoped that the chemistry between the main leads is better .I mean , I do n't see much sparks throughout the movie , and their relationship escalated quite fast for me to grasp .Still , in dramaland , everything is possible !Right ?For the record , it 's nice to see that the male lead did care for her in the end .Overall , if you want to pass your time idly , watch this .Nothing too emotional , and yet entertaining to watch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
