{"text": "My wife is importing the tin for me as a Valentine 's Day gift , quite romantic !This is one of the main reasons I bought a region free Phillips 642 dvd player ( about $ 60 US at Wal Mart , produces a great picture on NTSC tvs . )I ca n't wait for the Q & A and the extra scenes .I also noticed that while they 've both dropped dramatically , Firefly and Serenity are both beating Flightplan , nice turnabout since it beat us opening weekend in theaters .Hahahah ... mine is an evil laugh .... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A sequel would just be a pure bonus .That said , are these good or bad ?Numbers wise , I 'd say there 's a good chance it 's outsold Firefly by now , but if it continues to fall it 'll be gone from the charts shortly .If Universal opt to do a few TV movies it would probably boost the Serenity DVD sales again .It really depends if anybody is willing to sink more money into the franchise .Which is something entirely out of our hands .It 's interesting to see how the ranking differs in these different websites not just in sales , but even in DVD rentals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would hope that sales have proven to be big enough at least for Universal to put together a 2-disk special edition version of Serenity for Region 1 .Usually I 'm against that sort of studio double dipping , but I want the extra content !A lot of the work is already done with the Australian version already having a second disk with plenty of extra features .Plus I 'm hoping that they will do another audio commentary with the full cast .Also if anyone is interested , this post on Serenity.org tries to estimate how well Serenity sold during it 's first week based the known sales of other DVD 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Which is n't half bad considering how Serenity did at the box office .Might it have passed 2 million units by now ?I tend to think that Video Business Online might be more accurate since at the bottom of their sales chart it notes that figures come directly from retailers and suppliers whereas the main link on this post is to Hollywood Reporter which gets their figures from Video Scan .My thinking is that figures directly from the retailers and suppliers should be more accurate than figures from a middleman type source .Either way , we have no real way of knowing what true sales figures are since they are closely guarded by Universal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not great news but I guess they had to drop at some point .So many choices !I still do n't know which one to get , the mouse pad , tin case or signed cover slip .hmmm ...If only I had money enough for them all .( I am really enjoying having all this Serenity love in our direction ! )Getting everyone 's schedules together ?That 's kinda strange excuse , is n't it ?In the Alien commentaries that came out with that special edition series of all the films a few years ago , it was obvious that what occurred was several different sessions were recorded with different talents .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like multiple conversations going on simultaneously and someone painstakingly edited the best stuff into one continuous audio recording , making it sound fluid and cohesive , but really it was multiple sessions .Ideally , you 'd want an audio commentary where Joss talks by himself .We already got that .Joss would n't need to be in this second commentary ( tho of course people would wanna hear him I know ) .I 'm trying to think economy of time here and content value .For a second commentary with a full cast and crew kinda thing you 'd want multiple sessions of recordings to then distill down into one that 's released to the public on a special edition DVD .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You 'll want to use him sparingly , predominantly in the moments when he 's actually on screen .The Operative pretty much interacts only directly with Inara and Mal .So you 'd want to either have Chiwetel Ejiofor record his thoughts separately and intersperse him with a separate recording of Nathan and Morena together in the studio , or it might be nice to have one recording session with the three of them together sharing memories .Even having Chiwetel Ejiofor talk when not on screen about what it was like to come into this cast as an outsider .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'd add either David Krumholtz or Michael Hitchcock in that mix perhaps just because they too are funny and improvisational , but all those guys in the same room probably would n't stay on topic .They 'd start riffing and goodness knows where they 'd end up .You 'd also want Hitchcock and Krumholtz to talk mostly only about their moments on screen so maybe record them separately and intersperse them with subtle editing .Or let them be in the room but direct them to curtail their interaction when not on the screen .This would get tricky tho .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sean Maher , Jewel Staite , and Summer Glau should be in a recording session together because the three of them share a chunk of the plot arc .In scenes like where Mal & River face off and during River 's first big fight scene , you 'd have to intersperse Nathan and Summer 's comments .Especially since we 're probably talking about having to pay each participant for their time .This is really gon na start racking up the costs .My point is if you get all these people in the same room and have them all talk at the same time for just one screening ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Your on air talent wo n't stay on topic with more than three or four at the mics at a time .They 'll fight for mike time .It 'll be impossible for post production to make it sound as good as careful multiple recordings seamlessly mixed into one .However , you simultaneously ca n't do a separate recording for each player , because then you wo n't get that magical social interaction that makes many commentaries incredibly fun .The commentaries for The Incredibles are a good example .There 's two .One has about a dozen of the principle animators talking , in multiple sessions but not all together .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then the second one is just Brad Bird talking the whole time with one other guy in the room .The latter is a struggle to listen to cuz it 's mostly just Brad kissing asses and saying it 's impossible to name every person involved and how wonderful they all were , then he goes on for an hour doing just that .Whereas the other one has this fluidity to it and a wealth of very interesting information about just what it takes to make a masterpiece like that . ...OH !And you 'd want a full separate commentary of just Yan and Rafael Feldman doing Christopher Walken impersonations in reaction to whatever 's on screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For a second commentary with a full cast and crew kinda thing you 'd want multiple sessions of recordings to then distill down into one that 's released to the public on a special edition DVD .I 've heard commentaries done that way and it gives people more insight to the movie , but at they do n't have the same energy and humor when people are in the same room .Together people can respond to other people 's comments and sometimes joke around about things and these types of commentaries are generally more fun .Also they tend to be the commentaries that I am more likely to listen to again and again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Example , a lot of Kevin Smith 's audio commentaries can be quite funny and entertaining .In a perfect world , I would want both , but given one or the other for Serenity I would go for the one where they are all together in the same room .Especially since the commentary with Joss Whedon already gives plenty of cool insight into the movie .As for it just appealing to more of the hardcore fans , I figure that most of the people buying a 2-disk special edition version are the hardcore fans so I do n't think it 's a problem .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Still in the end I would be happy with whatever kind of additional commentary that they did with the cast .I want the insight ! !Joking around is fun , but then I find myself getting frustrated because there are things happening in the movie that I want them to comment on and they are in their own little world .I listen to the commentaries for the insight first and actor interaction second .I love Joss 's solo commentaries , he offers great insight .But I do agree , a cast commentary would be a great compliment to Joss 's commentary .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
