{"text": "Case Number 01176 .FRANK HERBERT 'S DUNE .Artisan // 2000 // 265 Minutes // Not Rated Reviewed by Appellate Judge Erick Harper ( Retired )// June 7th , 2001 .The Charge .Arrakis .Dune .Wasteland of the Empire ... and the most valuable planet in the universe , because it is here , and only here , where spice is found .The spice -- without it there is no commerce in the Empire , there is no civilization .Arrakis .Dune .Home of the spice .Greatest treasure in the universe .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "--The Princess Irulan .Opening Statement .First published in 1965 , Frank Herbert 's Dune is one of the undisputed classics of science fiction literature .Over the years the novel and its five sequels have sold millions of copies around the world .It is an epic tale , sprawling over about half a dozen planets and a variety of cultures , running to some 540 pages in my well - worn paperback edition .It is infused with a wealth of minute details about customs , religions , technology , science , and galactic commerce .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The problems in adapting such a massive , intricate literary work for the screen are obvious .In 1984 David Lynch made a theatrical version of Dune , which stands to this day as a sort of benchmark of noble failure , the textbook example of everything that can possibly go wrong when adapting a novel for the screen .It illustrates with painful clarity the inherent difficulties in transferring a story of this magnitude to film .It also shows that some material is just too complex to cook down into the time constraints placed on a theatrical film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , writer / director John Harrison and the good people over at the Sci - Fi Channel have given Dune another chance .Believing that the television mini - series with its looser time constraints was the perfect medium for Herbert 's story , they created an adaptation of the story that runs over four and a half hours in total length .Frank Herbert 's Dune appeared on Sci - Fi late in 2000 , and now comes to us on DVD from Artisan Home Entertainment .Facts of the Case .In a universe filled with a mixture of the feudal and the futuristic , the most valuable commodity is melange , a spice that makes space travel and commerce possible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Power in the galaxy is divided among several great dynastic houses .As our story begins , Emperor Shaddam IV ( Giancarlo Gianinni ) has given control over Arrakis to House Atreides , ruled by Duke Leto ( William Hurt ) .Together with the Lady Jessica ( Saskia Reeves ) , their son Paul ( Alec Newman ) , and their loyal retainers , Leto moves House Atreides to Arrakis from their traditional homeworld of Caladan .This catapults House Atreides into a tangle of interstellar intrigues , primarily guided by their chief rivals for control of Arrakis , House Harkonnen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Harkonnens ruled Dune previously , and will stop at nothing to reclaim it and enhance their power in the galaxy .Their web of deception and trickery extends from the sands of Dune to the Emperor himself .As events unfold , young Paul Atreides finds himself an exile in the wastes of Arrakis , living among the Fremen .The Fremen are a desert - dwelling , semi - nomadic people who live in the deep deserts of Dune where water is the most valuable commodity of all .Their entire culture and beliefs are based around the value of water .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As Paul joins them and learns their ways , he realizes that he has a purpose and destiny foretold in the most ancient Fremen prophecies .As the spice permeates his body and frees his mind , he discovers truths about himself and the future of humanity that defy the imagination .The Evidence .The miniseries format is probably the only visual / cinematic medium that can provide a large enough canvas for the story of Dune .Writer / director John Harrison has created a film that labors mightily to be faithful to Frank Herbert 's work , and succeeds to a great extent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The episodes , like the \" books \" of the novel , are entitled \" Dune , \" \" Muad'Dib , \" and \" Prophet .\" They trace the deepening plots and schemes for control of the vital spice , but more importantly they trace Paul 's development from na\u00efve young aristocrat to desert chieftain to prophet and beyond .Within this structure , the screenplay stays quite faithful to the original .There are certainly bits of information that are lost , even in four and a half hours of screen time , but I was pleased with Harrison 's adaptation of the material .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He is able , both through his writing and his direction , to strike a good balance between exposition and action scenes .He throws a lot of information at the audience , but mostly manages to keep it from getting dull .Harrison makes one notable change to the original that I think is quite an improvement .Those who have read the novel will know that Princess Irulan is invisible until the very end of the book , appearing only as a narrator , relating the events of the story through \" historical \" materials inserted as chapter headings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While perhaps not entirely necessary , I thought this was a clever touch .Of course it is successful largely due to the talents of Julie Cox , the young British actress chosen to play Irulan .Cox is able to play Irulan as an interesting parallel to the role of Paul Atreides , a combination of na\u00efvete and cunning , coming of age in the midst of an interstellar crisis .There are a number of fine acting performances throughout the miniseries .Saskia Reeves was very good as Lady Jessica , bringing a good combination of dignity , beauty , and fire to the role .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kodetova was exactly as I had pictured Chani when reading the book , an exotic beauty with dark hair and complexion , and a wild spirit .Kodetova was only one of many European actors brought aboard the project , and the diverse cast with their variety of accents and appearances really added a layer of believability to the production .Uwe Ochsenknecht , an excellent German actor , was also very good as Stilgar , leader of the Fremen community that adopts Paul and his mother .The actor required to do the heaviest lifting was Alec Newman , the young British actor cast as Paul .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Happily , Newman is up to the challenge , and manages to portray the complex emotions and contradictions within this character .A movie such as Frank Herbert 's Dune of course involves a lot of special effects work , recreating various planetary environments as well as scenes that take place in space .The special effects sequences incorporate a lot of CGI , most of which looks good and is fairly convincing .I was particularly impressed by scenes in space , showing huge Spacing Guild freighters and other ships moving gracefully -- and silently .I was amazed at how effective silence was in these scenes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A lot of attention was paid to the more mundane aspects of the production as well .From gorgeous sets to intriguing costumes , the makers of this miniseries did their best to create a look and feel that brought Dune to life .The results are mostly dazzling , with distinctive designs and color schemes for each of the main locations featured .There are times where the production values suffer from a certain lack of budget , but overall it is clear that a lot of work went into the design and construction of these environments .Artisan 's transfer of Frank Herbert 's Dune to DVD is a thing of beauty to behold .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I never saw the miniseries when it originally aired , so I do n't know if it was shown in this letterbox version , or if it has been slightly cropped on top and bottom for this DVD release .In any case , the picture quality is simply amazing , possibly the best of any DVD in my collection .Every second of film is sharp and clear .Colors are bright and vibrant , and even the most problematic bright reds are dead on .Flesh tones for characters of a variety of backgrounds are accurately reproduced .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Shadowy scenes are sharp and clear , with no hint of graininess or muddiness .The only problems I could find with the transfer were a few isolated incidents of edge over - enhancement , but even these were brief and unobtrusive .It is as close to perfection as I have seen yet .The audio is presented in Dolby Surround .It is adequate to the job , although not up to the impressive standards set by the video transfer .It is sharp and clear , although dialogue often sounded a bit hollow or muffled .The sound effects seemed to lack punch through much of the miniseries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Extra content for this two disc set is included on Disc Two , along with the third installment in the series .The main extra is a making - of featurette entitled \" The Lure of Spice .\" It runs a generous 25 minutes .It is mostly standard fare , including brief soundbites from the director and various actors and some behind the scenes footage , but it is a good effort and fairly informative .I was thankful for the chance to see and hear a bit more from some of the lesser - known actors in the cast , such as Newman , Kodetova , and Cox .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Next on the list of extra content is the \" Dune Gallery .\" It is divided into three sections : Costume Design , Production Design , and a Cinematic Treatment by D.P. Vittorio Storaro .This last does n't include a lot of images from the film , but rather is a treatise by Storaro on the philosophical and mythical underpinnings of Dune , and how he used colors and images to reflect them on the screen .Cast and crew biographical information and a section of production notes round out the extra content .Both sections are fairly detailed and yield some interesting information about the people and the process behind this miniseries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With a budget of around $ 20 million for four and a half hours of screen time , not everything is going to be perfect .While much of the special effects work is passable , there are a number of scenes , usually in the deserts of Arrakis , where it is painfully obvious that the characters are on a soundstage in front of a large matte photograph .Several of the action scenes are kept deliberately short and with as few characters as possible .There are also some instances of pretty bad CGI ; the worst example is the small desert mouse from which Paul takes his Fremen name , Muad'Dib .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "More problematic are some of the acting performances .I noted earlier that I liked the diversity brought by casting a number of non - American actors , many of them central or eastern Europeans .On the other hand , some of them were simply not good , and to compound the situation had accents that I found impenetrable .The most glaring example was Zuzana Geislerov\u00e1 in the role of Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam , the Emperor 's Truthsayer .She was stilted and wooden , and simply not effective in her role .Of course , American actors are not immune to criticism either .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , his perfomance as Duke Leto is completely flat and unengaging .Other problems came from the depiction of the Harkonnen villains in general .Ian McNeice was good as Baron Harkonnen , in an outrageous , over - the - top kind of way , complete with lots of evil laughter .His performance was good , but I was disappointed that the Harkonnens were reduced to such cartoonish stature overall .Finally , there were some parts of the book that had to be left out due to limitations of time or the flow of the plot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would have liked to see the significance of Paul 's tears as \" water for the dead \" explained , as I find this to be one of the most emotionally significant moments of the novel .There are several concepts in the novel that got short shrift in the movie , from mentats to the Bene Gesserit .There are also several of the more interesting characters in the novel that are only passing figures here , such as Thufir Hawat , Duncan Idaho , and even Gurney Halleck , who all get much less screen time than one might expect .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of course , this is nitpicking .Harrison had to make a lot of choices regarding what to include and what to leave out , and for the most part he made good ones .Closing Statement .Frank Herbert 's Dune is as good an adaptation of this material as we are likely to see , but it is not without its flaws .This material will always be at its best in its original printed format .However , I enjoyed this effort and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Herbert 's work , science fiction in general , or a good fantasy / adventure with lots of intrigue and trickery .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Please try again later .I have read all of the original Dune series .This is the first Dune book in a long time to hark back to the quality of the first book .What made Dune remarkable was its retelling of the classic hero story , not unlike Star Wars or any number of classics .The characters were engaging , and the writing was quite good .After the first Dune book , both the quality of writing and of the storyline declined dramatically .The hero element was quickly lost to the bizarre .Who could care about rulers mutating into large worms ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hence the demise of the heroic element of the epic .However , Dune House Harkonnen brings back the heroic elements .On a simplistic level , its easier to tell the good guys from the bad .More importantly , however , the quality of the writing has improved from prior works , and Herbert 's son treats the storyline carefully .If there are excesses in the descriptive passages , they can be forgiven in light of the lushness of the storyline .One major complaint .I detested the movie , Dune , not only because it was utterly incomprehensible , but also because it depicted Baron Harkonnen as a disgusting physical specimen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie merely made him physically repulsive as a means of quickly establishing that he is repulsive .Well , Dune Harkonnen describes the baron 's physical degeneration .It helps put the movie in context , but its at odds with the other novels .Small complaint in all .All Rise ... .The Charge .A mysterious prophecy .A journey for freedom .A world of adventure .Opening Statement .Some of the best movies come out of nowhere , created by a small , dedicated crew of inexperienced amateurs who defy expectations and pour years of their lives into a project about which they feel passionately .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kaena : The Prophecy should have been one of these films - but a generic plot , some terrible voice acting , and bland animation got in the way of the vision .Facts of the Case .A small tribe of superstitious people live in this extremely large tree , collecting sap for their gods , who gain their power from the sap .Little do the people know that the gods are really evil , simply forcing them to collect sap in order to prepare for some sort of freaky mating ritual between the queen ( Anjelica Houston , The Royal Tenenbaums ) and her first - in - command .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only disbelieving villager is a teenage girl named Kaena ( Kirsten Dunst , Spider - Man ) who explores far into the dangerous reaches of the tree , and believes that there is some other answer to their problem - one that involves taking the people away from this terrible place .When the gods convince the leader of the people to travel into their realm , Kaena stumbles over the remnants of an ancient civilization .This new discovery could be the answer to all of their problems , if she is able to save her people in time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If there has been one trend in the computerized animation industry ( Pixar excluded ) , it 's that high tech animators seem to be lousy storytellers .In this case , the story is sloppy and awkward , with tons of science fiction clich\u00e9s crammed in , seemingly with the hopes that they would somehow come together into a brilliant and refreshing tale .Of course , it does n't really work that way at all .The notion of ancient and powerful races guiding the destiny of a weak humanoid race is certainly not a new one in science fiction novels and , perhaps more significant here , video games .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Each action sequence is designed around some new power or artifact that Kaena accesses in order to defeat her foes .In fact , the story structure of Kaena : The Prophecy feels so much like a video game that at times it 's difficult to think of it as a movie .Even the premise - a hero pulled from a small village between two battling forces - seems a little too basic .All of these story elements could have played as classic , but they are done in such a generic way that it does n't ever approach that feeling of timelessness that other such quest stories have achieved .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The animation fares somewhat better .About five years ago , Kaena : The Prophecy would have looked really good .The animation of the liquid gods is fairly slick , and Kaena has fluid and expressive movements .Some of the texture work is fantastic , and there are a number of details and environmental effects that stand out .Unfortunately , many of the other characters do not move as smoothly , but seem to hearken back to the days before the use of motion capture .At times , watching the villagers feels a lot like watching Lego men move , despite their expressive faces .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The animation style of the humans is obviously meant to be stylized , but they come out looking more sloppy than cool .The style of the animation , as well as the overall design of the setting ( an expansive but simple geography surrounded by an enormous void ) , are quite reminiscent of the FMV that was produced for video games starting in the late 1990s .Anyone who was seduced by computer role playing games during that period will understand exactly what I mean when they sit down to watch the film .When things get visually complicated , the frame rate often slows down as well , which makes the film feel unfinished .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A few of the voices stand out , especially Richard Harris as Opaz .His performance is as pleasantly underplayed , as was the case with most of his recent roles .Other characters do not fare so well .Both of the villains sound remarkably generic , especially considering the voice talents that were brought in .Kirsten Dunst does an acceptable job as Kaena , but she is somewhat obnoxious at times , and never sounds particularly heroic .She is not given much to work with in the way of the script though , so I ca n't complain too much about her work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I found that each time his character said a line , my hand moved towards the remote in a strange kind of knee - jerk reaction .I had to force myself to continue , and it got more difficult each time .In my review of Bastof Syndrome : The Hacker , I described two characters that were fighting for the \" most annoying character ever \" award .They are no longer even in the running , all thanks to Gommy .The supporting cast is also generally weak .Watching the segment on the production of the film , I discovered that this comparison to a video game is even more appropriate than I realized .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was only when they expanded their ideas that they decided to create a full theatrical film .I 'm still not sure how to react to knowing this about the production .In one sense , I am surprised that Xilam was able to create Kaena : The Prophecy using open source software designed for video game creation .With that taken into account , they should be very proud of the technical quality they have been able to achieve .At the same time , though , it 's sad that a difficult nine year project did n't begin with a better story concept .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The exceptional Corto Maltese was a recent French production that pulled this off , and it is only one of many examples internationally in the past year .The Japanese have been producing great animated entertainment for teens and adults for decades .Perhaps the team was only referring to fully computer - rendered features , which does narrow the field by quite a bit .Still , other film houses managed to produce and deliver Final Fantasy and Wonderful Days while they were still working , two films that serve as far better examples of the genre .Technically , the disc is far more impressive than the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Occasionally , on a high quality display , it 's possible to see some minor compression artifacts .That said , for the most part the colors are right on , and at times there is a remarkable amount of detail .The sound is also solid , with plenty of action through each channel and clear dialogue .Sometimes frustratingly clear , in fact .The disc only has a few extras .The first is a digital interview with Kaena about her character .Interestingly enough , this test footage is in French , as opposed to the English that the dialogue was eventually produced in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Next up is a featurette on the making of the film , which I have already referred to briefly in my review .Understanding the conditions that the team worked under during production is really useful , and it makes it clear that Kaena : The Prophecy was a true labor of love .I only wish that the product had matched the passion that this team demonstrated over the past decade .The Rebuttal Witnesses .Some of the animation looks pretty cool .Seriously , though , I do n't think that Kaena : The Prophecy is a disaster ; it 's just sadly misguided and a bit out of date .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Closing Statement .I ca n't imagine anyone being happy with a purchase of this disc .While some of the animation is nice , enough of it is far enough out of date that it does not even succeed as pure eye candy anymore .Huge fans of digital animation will want to give it a rent despite my warning , and might not regret it .In the end , though , I think this is one project best left forgotten , in favor of the digital entertainment that came before it and is sure to come in the future .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
