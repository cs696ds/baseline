{"text": "Yes No Sending feedback ... .Tamara is an occasionally diverting horror film .The title character ( well played by dancer Jenna Dewan ) is a shy , nerdy high school student who manages to get on the bad side of the jocks at her school .Natrually , this leads to the jocks pulling a rather cruel prank on Tarma and , of course , this leads to Tamara accidentally getting killed and buried out in the woods .Not only has returning from the dead given Tamara a new look but it 's also left her with a thirst for revenge and the supernatural powers necessary to get it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In this groundbreaking biography of the Japanese emperor Hirohito , Herbert P. Bix offers the first complete , unvarnished look at the enigmatic leader whose sixty - three - year reign ushered Japan into the modern world .Never before has the full life of this controversial figure been revealed with such clarity and vividness .Bix shows what it was like to be trained from birth for a lone position at the apex of the nation 's political hierarchy and as a revered symbol of divine status .Here we see Hirohito as he truly was : a man of strong will and real authority .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Focusing closely on Hirohito 's interactions with his advisers and successive Japanese governments , Bix sheds new light on the causes of the China War in 1937 and the start of the Asia - Pacific War in 1941 .And while conventional wisdom has had it that the nation 's increasing foreign aggression was driven and maintained not by the emperor but by an elite group of Japanese militarists , the reality , as witnessed here , is quite different .Bix documents in detail the strong , decisive role Hirohito played in wartime operations , from the takeover of Manchuria in 1931 through the attack on Pearl Harbor and ultimately the fateful decision in 1945 to accede to an unconditional surrender .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "From the moment of capitulation , we see how American and Japanese leaders moved to justify the retention of Hirohito as emperor by whitewashing his wartime role and reshaping the historical consciousness of the Japanese people .The key to this strategy was Hirohito 's alliance with General MacArthur , who helped him maintain his stature and shed his militaristic image , while MacArthur used the emperor as a figurehead to assist him in converting Japan into a peaceful nation .Until the very end of a career that embodied the conflicting aims of Japan 's development as a nation , Hirohito remained preoccupied with politics and with his place in history .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
