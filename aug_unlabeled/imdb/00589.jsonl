{"text": "\" I am the illustrator of the book .However , toward the end , I started running a bit behind schedule so I took on two assistant artists to help get it finished by the deadline , which is not that unusual when you 're both writing and illustrating a huge project .Every author has their own story about what led them to pick up a pen to write that first story and how their book was born .What is your story ?RRR : I started writing and illustrating homemade books for my family members back in grade school .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , it 's been something I 've always loved doing .In recent years , I 've written a young adult book , a middle grade graphic novel and Dork Diaries .So , although this is actually my third book , it 's the first one to get published .Your main character , Nikki , is not an African - American .Why did you choose to do this ?RRR : The character , Nikki , came to me as she is written .At first I was hesitant , but I remembered reading an article about Shonda Rhimes , the creator , writer and executive director of the hit television show , Grey 's Anatomy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Is there more pressure for Dork Diaries to stand out from Diary of a Wimpy Kid 's shadow ?RRR : Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a funny and well - written series .So , I 'm really flattered by any comparison .Dork Diaries , however , is very different .It 's from a female perspective and deals with issues Tween girls face on a daily basis .My main character is a bit older and has an edgier voice .And , my artwork has a slight manga influence .However , I would be totally elated if Dork Diaries does even half as well as Diary of a Wimpy Kid !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
