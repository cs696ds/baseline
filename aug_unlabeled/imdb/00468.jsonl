{"text": "Your Rating .Overall .Film Details .The year of the 40th anniversary of the end of the Second World War saw the release of several war films in the Soviet Union , many of which were mediocre and decidedly unremarkable .However one film , winner of the top prize at the Moscow Film Festival , stands undoubtedly as one of the most uncompromising , harrowing war films ever made .Klimov employs all the aesthetic devices at his disposal ( widescreen photography , stereo sound ) to plunge the viewer into a hellish , apocalyptic world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Even allowing for the fact that Eastern European cinema is unlikely to set the world alight , this offering is depressingly poor .Clearly a limited budget offering , this constraint does not excuse the inept , wooden \" acting \" , where most of the characters are little more than ridiculous stereotypes , or the inane dialogue which runs throughout .The \" lead \" character becomes more and more of a comical figure as the movie progresses .His change of mood and demanour throughout the film is of course designed to reflect the growing horror that he experiences .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The one genuine attempt at horror in the film comes near the end and deals with the massacre of a village by the German army .The Germans are naturally depicted as murderous brutes but , again , the obvious stereotyping and poor acting take away from the potential tension of the scenes .Again , an opportunity to display the revulsion of war is missed .Incidentally , it is unclear , and wholly incompatible , that our \" hero \" is spared after the German officer holds a gun to his head for the camera ( the image shown on the front of the movie ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( It is unclear how this happened , but never mind . )Once again , the acting and dialogue plumb new depths .Overall , this is a very poor piece of cinema and misses a very real opportunity to make a statement .I understand that the director retired after this work .Most imply this is because he achieved perfection .I can only assume that , in reality , this movie finished his career for other reasons .Come And See stands no comparison with other serious war films .The movie is painful viewing , but not for the reasons intended .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Flawed , yes , but a masterpiece .It 's true that the characters are largely avatars for different aspects on the war - innocent children , sadistic Nazis , principled partisans - but the film is not so much about them as about the overall emotional context of war .From one impressive set piece to another , Klimov examines the imposition of unflinching horror onto people who just want to get on with their lives ( as Glasha says , to love to have children ) .Like cruel adults breaking up a children 's game , the Nazis come into this innocent world and destroy it , depriving the inhabitants of their comfort , their mental health , their dignity and eventually their lives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The camerawork , almost entirely Steadicam , is smooth and fluid , nearly every scene in deep focus to reveal the openness of the landscape - there really is nowhere to hide .Indeed , the film 's title stands over so many of these shots - come and see .The emphasis is on the characters ' seeing , their eyes fixed on unspeakable things , wanting to look away but unable to .In addition to this , Klimov 's sound design is possibly the best I have ever encountered in cinema .Spielberg gave us ringing rifle shots in ' Saving Private Ryan ' , but Klimov beat him to it in ' Come and See ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I found it authentic , alive and in keeping with the film 's slightly heightened tone .Maybe it 's because I have some Russian , I do n't know .If the ( overlong ) rewinding of newsreels at the end may strike cynical , 21st - century viewers as a bit obvious , this is n't where the film is most effective .The most compelling sequences are when Florya finds out his family is dead and , in a moment of psychosis , plunges into a bog to try and find them , and of course the torching of the village by the Nazis near the end of the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
