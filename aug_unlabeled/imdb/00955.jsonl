{"text": "But was the TVM so different ?Does it deserve its place in the history of the show ?Let 's take a look at the Eighth Doctor 's only TV outing and see just how different it really was .One thing that most fans agree on is that Paul McGann made a fantastic Doctor .Even his outfit was in keeping with the shows past .It was very Edwardian and helped him to stand out in a crowd .He even wore a wig much like William Hartnell .To be honest , getting the Doctor right seems like pretty much half the job there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This can clearly be seen in the floor to ceiling central column , as well as the coral support structures that mimic the steal framework surrounding the TVM console .Another complaint heard from many fans is the stonework and leaves that were in the room with the Eye of Harmony .Which is odd when you think about it , because in Tom Baker 's last story we see that the cloister room had both stonework and vines in abundance .In fact , going further back to The Invasion of Time we are shown that the TARDIS interior can change its shape just like the exterior .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Most conventional explosives consist of a fuel - oxidizer premix ( gunpowder , for example , contains 25 % fuel and 75 % oxidizer ) , whereas thermobaric weapons are almost 100 % fuel , so thermobaric weapons are significantly more energetic than conventional condensed explosives of equal weight .Their reliance on atmospheric oxygen makes them unsuitable for use underwater , at high altitude , and in adverse weather .They do , however , cause considerably more destruction when used inside confined environments such as tunnels , caves , and bunkers - partly due to the sustained blast wave , and partly by consuming the available oxygen inside .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are many different types of thermobaric weapons rounds that can be fitted to hand - held launchers .[ 1 ] .Other terms used for this family of weapons are high - impulse thermobaric weapons ( HITs ) , heat and pressure weapons , vacuum bombs , or fuel - air explosives ( FAE or FAX ) .In contrast to condensed explosive , where oxidation in a confined region produces a blast front from essentially a point source , a flame front accelerates to a large volume producing pressure fronts both within the mixture of fuel and oxidant and then in the surrounding air .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thermobaric explosives apply the principles underlying accidental unconfined vapor cloud explosions , which include those from dispersions of flammable dusts and droplets .[ 4 ] .A typical weapon consists of a container packed with a fuel substance , in the center of which is a small conventional - explosive \" scatter charge \" .Fuels are chosen on the basis of the exothermicity of their oxidation , ranging from powdered metals , such as aluminium or magnesium , to organic materials , possibly with a self - contained partial oxidant .The most recent development involves the use of nanofuels .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "5 ] [ 6 ] .In some designs , strong munitions cases allow the blast pressure to be contained long enough for the fuel to be heated up well above its auto - ignition temperature , so that once the container bursts the super - heated fuel will auto - ignite progressively as it comes into contact with atmospheric oxygen .[ 7 ] Conventional upper and lower limits of flammability apply to such weapons .Close in , blast from the dispersal charge , compressing and heating the surrounding atmosphere , will have some influence on the lower limit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "[ 8 ] This weakness may be eliminated by designs where the fuel is preheated well above its ignition temperature , so that its cooling during its dispersion still results in a minimal ignition delay on mixing .The continual combustion of the outer layer of fuel molecules as they come into contact with the air , generates additional heat which maintains the temperature of the interior of the fireball , and thus sustains the detonation .[ 9 ] .In confinement , a series of reflective shock waves are generated , [ 10 ] [ 11 ] which maintain the fireball and can extend its duration to between 10 and 50 ms as exothermic recombination reactions occur .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
