{"text": "T.V. shows for adults and children alike - so outstanding that one even went into primetime on American network television .What was different about these programs was that Anderson and his company had developed special sophisticated puppeteering techniques ( later known as Supermarionation ) which allowed them to build and use puppets that grew more lifelike as each successive series debuted .A mix of dramatic music , science , and special effects combined with meticulously detailed miniature sets and costumes , resulted in surprisingly lifelike - live action dramas , each staged in a futuristic setting .Each puppet character was unique , some sporting heavily caricatured facial features .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A complex electronic lip - sync mechanism was fitted into each puppet which enabled its mouth to move at the same time the artist spoke .Of the 10 series Anderson produced , I had 5 favorites .They were ( chronologically ) : Supercar ( 1961 ) , Fireball XL5 ( 1962 ) , Thunderbirds ( 1964 ) , Stingray ( 1964 ) , and Captain Scarlet ( 1967 ) .Each successive series was a substantial jump from the preceding one in terms of concept , direction , style and sophistication .Supercar ( 1961 ) was the story of an amazing new vehicle and of those who used it to combat evil .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "- inventors of Supercar were Professor Popkiss and Doctor Beaker who apparently were modeled after Werner Von Braun 's team of thickly accented German rocket scientists .Ten year old Jimmy Gibson , orphaned following a plane crash , was saved by Mercury and Supercar , and he along with a mischievous pet monkey named Mitch were also regulars on the show .The group lived and worked in an isolated laboratory deep in the heart of the Nevada desert where Supercar was based .Each new adventure brought Supercar and its heroes to peril and triumph .In comparison to many of Anderson 's other TV series which were to follow , Supercar was a very basic , very primitive , sci - fi adventure , far removed from the sophistication and explosive drama of Thunderbirds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fireball XL5 ( 1962 ) , Anderson 's 2nd Supermarionation puppet series was somewhat more advanced than Supercar .Set around the year 2067 , the show was basically about a futuristic rocket with wings .Fireball XL5 was a long , sleek spacecraft , with one main rocket nozzle engine at the back and two smaller ones fitted to each fin at the end of its wings .Fireball XL5 could be split into two halves , the larger main section and a smaller command section up front from which the entire ship could be controlled .The command section , or \" Fireball Junior \" , could detach from the main body of the ship and land on planets ( using rockets and landing legs ) , while the main part of the spacecraft remained in orbit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The crew of Fireball XL5 included Colonel Steve Zodiac , its handsome pilot , Venus , his romantic love interest and doctor of space medicine , and Robert the clear glass encased Robot .Robert spoke a language which is best described as \" mechanical English \" .What was interesting about Robert was that once ordered to do something he would not stop until he was finished his command which made for some interesting predicaments .Aside from Fireball XL5 itself , the series also featured ships such as for Space Rescue , Robot Supply , and those operated by aliens .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For me , the coolest thing about Fireball XL5 was when it took off from Space City .Here , the spacecraft , positioned on a rocket booster launch platform , would fire , sending it down a long launch rail .Just before the end of the rail , having picked up enough speed , Fireball XL5 would separate from the rocket boosters and take off .I remember the joy I experienced playing with this very toy - launching and recovering Fireball XL5 for hours on end .Thunderbirds ( 1964 ) , in my view the best of the Supermarionation series , was about a secret organization called \" International Rescue \" which was devoted to saving disaster victims from peril on land , sea , air or up in space .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "What was novel about this , the last and most technically advanced production of Anderson 's Supermarionation series , was that it brought a new look to puppetry .Essentially these puppets were exact duplicates of human beings .So realistic were they , that the original Captain Scarlet series concept called for a special guest star puppet in each episode which was to be modeled closely on a famous actor or actress .If you look closely you can easily identify your favorite British and American stars .The plot of this series pitted the Mysterons that could use special powers to destroy people or things on earth and then create exact duplicates of them which would be under their control , essentially to do evil .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
