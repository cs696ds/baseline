{"text": "Gloriously sleazy performance from John Carson and a lovely climax .Best bits ?The zombies realising they are catching fire in the tin mine .Some classic zombie acting there .The Hound of the Baskervilles .This was the BBC TV version with Peter Cushing ( as opposed to the Hammer version with Peter Cushing ) and felt like it was 80 minutes of script stretched out to 100 minutes .Holmes is absent for most of Baskerville , which works when you have a decent actor playing Watson .Unfortunately this does n't have a decent actor playing Watson , and although Cushing is as excellent as ever , he 's not in it enough to rescue it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Best bits ?Watson 's sheep - shagger line , and the guy at the back of the audience quipping Shoulda gone to Specsavers when Stapleton falls into the Grimpen Mire .Shorts : Suffer the Little Children .Every one of these was beautifully shot and lit .None of them had any real technical or quality issues .The scripts , though , varied enormously .The Happy Children was simple and atmospheric , but I was expecting a nastier ending - 6/10 .Darkness Within possibly would have worked if even one of the characters had been in any way likeable , but I struggled to care about the suffering of the irritatingly smug husband and his voiceless wife - 3/10 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It was clear that he and David got on with each other and they were chatting like old friends .It was somewhat frustrating that every bit of Vincent 's career got skated over very briefly , rather than a few choice bits gone into in depth , but I suspect that was always going to be the case .The second half was An Evening With Edgar Allen Poe .I had seen it before , but I do n't think many people there had .The format is basically a one - man reading of some of Poe 's short stories , with some props and make - up , but nobody there other than Vincent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
