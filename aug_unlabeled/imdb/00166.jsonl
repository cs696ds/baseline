{"text": "Choreographer - turned - director Bob Fosse ( Cabaret , Lenny ) turns the camera on himself in this nervy , sometimes unnerving 1979 feature , a nakedly autobiographical piece that veers from gritty drama to razzle - dazzle musical , allegory to satire .It 's an indication of his bravura , and possibly his self - absorption , that Fosse ( who also cowrote the script ) literally opens alter ego Joe Gideon 's heart in a key scene -- an unflinching glimpse of cardiac surgery , shot during an actual open - heart procedure .Gideon 's other romantic partners include Fosse 's own prot\u00e9g\u00e9 ( and a major keeper of his choreographic style since his death ) , Ann Reinking , whose leggy grace is seductive both \" onstage \" and off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The above is said by the main character , Joe Gideon ( Roy Scheider ) , in this movie .This movie is a semi - autobiographical fantasy based on the life and career of dance man , Bob Fosse ( he was also a choreographer , director , screenwriter , and actor ) .Fosse directed , co - wrote , and was choreographer for this movie .We follow Gideon 's ( Fosse 's alter ego ) life where at this point in his life he starts each day with Vivaldi , Visine , Alka - Seltzer , and Dexedrine ( a prescription upper ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is a movie you either love or hate .For me , I found the dancing frenzied , the dialogue piercing , the photography superb , and the acting first - rate .( Actor Roy Scheider gives a brilliant performance . )This is a great - looking film with some humorous parts that sometimes is not easy to watch .There are ten song and dance numbers in this movie .Do n't worry ! !These pieces are integral to the movie , are short and sweet , and in a word are ... fantastic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In 2001 , the U.S. Library of Congress deemed this film \" culturally significant \" and thus selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry .As well , this movie won four Academy Awards .Finally , the DVD itself ( the one released in 2007 ) is perfect in picture and sound quality .Read more ' .5 of 5 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I 've been waiting for this film to hit DVD for a long time .I saw it in high school in 1979 and enjoyed the passion and energy of the movie right up to the final arresting image .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I liked the Roy Scheider commentary and wished there was more .There are great clips of Scheider in character commenting during production and a series of clips of Fosse himself directing the opening \" cattle call \" sequence ( the real \" Joe Gideon \" at work ! )For a very surreal moment , listen to Scheider 's commentary for the final death dance sequence where Fosse tells him , \" They 've all forgiven me ! \"Hopefully , as the film is rediscovered by a new generation of fans ( the CHICAGO phenom has to help ) , a special edition that includes more of Fosse 's life and background information will come out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "ALL THAT JAZZ has what so many films are missing these days : a personal vision unafraid to bare its soul .I remember Fosse took a lot of flack for his \" ego \" back in 1979 , but the honesty and boldness of his vision remains .3 of 3 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Hard to believe this great movie has so few reviews .I was impressed from the opening scene of dancers leaping across the stage to the final zipper at the end of the movie the very first time I saw this movie 20-odd years ago , and every time since .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I had the feeling I was really watching a work of genius .Even if the movie is Bob Fosse 's bloated egotistical account of his life and career ( not my viewpoint ) , it is still amazing in its scope .To predict your own death is one thing , but to put into one of the best 20 minutes on film is quite another .Good acting , writing , directing , cinematography - you name it , it 's there .Sparse extras on the DVD , but worth it for the movie alone .3 of 3 people found this helpful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes No Sending feedback ... .The firm centers around Joe 's new Broadway production , while he concurrently tries to edit a new movie , interpersonal relations , and ..... one other thing that I will leave viewers to find out for themselves .Seeing this movie there are many elements that make it hard to believe that it was released a quarter of a century ago .The best example of how current it looks can be found in the sensual and acrobatic choreography that defines Fosse .Read more ' .2 of 2 people found this helpful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
