{"text": "One of the all time most consistently outstanding film directors , Anthony Mann 's action / suspense films continually returned to the theme of \" intelligent , thoughtful men driven to violence . \"Heroes in Mann movies relentlessly pursued justice , breaking the law along the way if need be .Arguably the premier American film noir director , with its shadows and darkness , Mann also virtually invented ' western noir ' , where sprawling , bright landscapes contrasted with the dark , personal struggles .His 1950s westerns nearly single - handedly rescued the western genre from jokey oblivion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many of Mann 's films were written by Borden Chase ( who also wrote Red River , Vera Cruz and more ) or John Higgins ( The Kid Glove Killer , the classic The Adventures of Tartu and Robinson Crusoe on Mars ) .Mann brought a writer 's sensibility to his filmmaking .His pictures look and move with incredible precision , AND they told fantastic stories .( Mann also wrote for films he did not direct himself , most notably Follow Me Quietly , directed by Richard Fleischer ) .More than twenty Mann movies rate three stars or better , including a handful of the best films of his generation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anthony Mann is n't even credited as the director , but the scenes he filmed are unmistakable .The sequences of Richard Basehart running through the Los Angeles sewers are some of the most arresting visuals ever captured on film .Not only are the shots clever and technically impressive , they literally tell the story on several levels .Sometimes movies have perfect scenes that are essentially accidents .But here they are a deliberate choice .Besides these justifiably famous scenes , He Walked by Night is an important film for it 's portrayal of a brilliant , completely amoral villain as well as it 's depiction of solid police work in rooting out the villain 's identity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Basehart and star Scott Brady are excellent . 2 ) Winchester ' 73 , 1950 .While this film is credited with reviving the serious western , looking back on it today , its even greater legacy is its reinvention of Jimmy Stewart .Prior to this film , Stewart had already done crime films like Rope and Call Northside 777 in addition to his more famous Frank Capra roles , but here America saw Jimmy Stewart as they had never seen him before -- cynical , angry , even outright ruthless .Amazingly this scene is not even the most memorable one in the film -- and its not even second !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When they see each other , Stewart and Dutch Henry ( played by Stephen McNally ) both bolt to their feet and instinctively grab for their guns -- but they are in Dodge City and Wyatt Earp has disarmed them both .They are both left with \" if looks could kill \" looks on their faces .The other scene to watch for could well be the single most cowardly act ever put on film .3 )The Naked Spur , 1953 .Jimmy Stewart made eight films with Anthony Mann .Five were westerns .Many film critics consider The Naked Spur to be the finest western ever made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Technically Ryan is the villain , but each male character is nuts in his way .Meeker in particular personifies heroic villainy , if that is possible .When watching the sunny , breathtaking scenery of The Naked Spur , I always think of the darkness of Mann 's film noir movies .Mann 's command of both dark and panoramic light is an amazing accomplishment .4 ) T - Men , 1947 .T - Men are Treasury agents after an atypical counterfeiting ring .In much the same way as a tribe is known by the strength of its enemies , Mann 's heroes stand taller because his villains are so strong , clever and utterly ruthless .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( See McGraw in the exciting Narrow Margin for a look at him as a hero . )Considering Mann also made Desperate and Railroaded in 1947 , you have to wonder if he was in the shadows all year long .T - Men features the first kill - the - guy - in - the - Turkish - bath movie scene , and a terrifically effective scene featuring the minor character \" Paul Miller \" that again emphasizes the clever , confident nature of an Anthony Mann villain .5 )The Tin Star , 1957 .Henry Fonda slips into the Jimmy Stewart role after Stewart and Mann had a falling out that led to the end of their collaboration .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As usual , Mann surrounds himself with a terrific cast including Anthony Perkins , Lee Van Cleef and one of the best performances of the magnetic Neville Brand ( the fourth most decorated American soldier in World War II ) .Bounty hunter Fonda when confronted by the menacing Brand after bringing Brand 's no - good cousin in dead : \" Every family has a black sheep ... some have two .\" 6 )Raw Deal , 1948 .Here we discover something Anthony Mann loves to film as much as shadows : co - star Marsha Hunt 's face .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( That honor goes to the # 2 villain played by John Ireland . )The lead bad guy here is perhaps the heaviest heavy in the history of American film : Raymond Burr .Perry Mason fans unfamiliar with Burr 's film noir work are in for a jolt here when he throws burning alcohol on a party guest when she accidentally bumps him : \" She should have been more careful .\" True to Anthony Mann movies though , that scene is n't the creepiest .That distinction goes to John Ireland and the deer antlers ... YOW ! 7 )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of my favorite actors of the noir era is Dick Powell .Like Stewart , Powell similarly transformed his career , from a song - and - dance man to being one of the all - time great movie tough guys ( Murder My Sweet , Cornered , Cry Danger , and more ) .Here Powell plays a policeman out to foil an assassination attempt on Abraham Lincoln in 1861 before his inauguration as President .Difficult times full of both clever treachery and false honor are convincingly depicted .Even better is Powell 's explanation about why he is trying so desperately to save Lincoln 's life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "John Kennedy .8) The Man from Laramie , 1955 .Jimmy Stewart again , this time single - mindedly hunting for the person ultimately responsible for the death of his brother .In a memorable scene , Wallace Ford ( notable as \" The Schemer \" in T - Men ) , the closest thing to a friend Stewart has in the film , tells him : \" Hate is unbecoming on some men , Mr. Lockhart .On some men it shows .\" 9 ) Desperate , 1947 .Mann 's run of film noir gems began here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This film could have made impossibly beautiful Audrey Long ( see her in the very underrated Game of Death and Born to Kill ) a big star if every third word out of her mouth was n't her dopey husband 's name !It gets to be like fingers on a chalkboard .10 ) Bend of the River , 1952 .Besides this film , Arthur Kennedy played opposite of Jimmy Stewart in The Man from Laramie and Cheyenne Autumn .Where Stewart is good , Kennedy is almost good .Where Stewart is bad , Kennedy is just a little bit worse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
