{"text": "The Christmas List ( 1997 ) .2015 Dates , Times , and Channels .Not airing this week .Movie Summary .Perfume saleslady Melody Parris feels like her life is in neutral .Her stick - in - the mud boyfriend wo n't commit and she gets passed over for a promotion at the store where she works .She decides to make a Christmas list .After it 's deposited in Santa 's mailbox at the store , she starts getting everything she wanted , but it does n't always turn out as she expected .I wish they would bring this out on DVD .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It use to be on tv almost every year but it 's becoming less and less frequent .This was a great movie .I hate to see if phased out .Would LOVE to see The Christmas List every year .It is warm , funny , and inspirational .It has a great message of believing in yourself and the power of positive thinking in your life .It does n't hurt that there is great romance and love of family in this movie .If you follow the comments on several websites , there is a HUGE following of this movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thank you .Please , please , pretty please release \" The Christmas List \" on DVD !Especially since , despite overwhelming support on multiple sites , you have not included it in this year 's line - up on any Network .I love this film and every year .If you are n't going to run it , at least let me own it . please .This is one of many favorite Christmas movies I watch .Does anyone know when it will be playing on TV for the year 2013 ?I have n't been able to find it on VHS DVD or on TV .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I need my Christmas List fix ! ! ! ! !Lol .P.S. I believe that this is the only movie not on DVD ...To whom do we need to go to haunt them with the spirits of Christmas ?LOL .I love The Christmas List .Please find a time to play it for us in 2013 !I like to watch it every year , it is such a feel good movie !I sure do wish someone out there in TV land would be willing to air this year 2013 .This is my favorite Christmas Show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It makes me mad that they are showing some movies 5 to 6 times during 1 week or even more for the month .This has been one of my favorite Christmas movies since I first saw it .I still cry every single time Danny grabs Melody 's hand to smell the perfume a bit longer .I recorded the movie years ago on VHS , but - alas - I no longer have a VCR .Guess I 'll be hitting up the Goodwill store and/or garage sales .Such a shame to not have it on tv this holiday season .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It seems to me , that every time a movie is made for Christmas or any other time or season ; if that movie is one that many people enjoy then it is given a title like a classic , and the TV industry stops showing it .They take advantage of the movie , and hold it back from viewing until the timing is right , and then they charge you a lot to buy it on DVD .There are so many new so called Christmas movies out there .But the classics ( which they call them)are the best made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That were filmed off the TV .You CAN , however , sign up on Amazon to be notified when ( if ) it 's ever put on DVD .I suggest everyone do that so the producers / studio know there is a big demand !Is THAT why I see only DVDs of a movie that was made in 1997 ? !I 've been on Amazon for a year to be notified , but I guess I 'll have to get one of those DVDs from eBay .Filmed off the TV does n't bother me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Seems they could have taken one of those other movies and shown it only 99 times instead of a hundred and put the Christmas List on once !Sheesh .I 'm with you , Kacki !The new movies this year are all pretty bad , and the older ones they 're showing are not the best either !In fact , I 'd say each year gets worse -- On ALL channels !Bad year .Anyway , I found my copy on eBay and its great .There 's another website too I believe I referenced the link earlier in this post .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I LOVE this movie .Like all of you I am so disappointed it was n't on TV last year .According to a couple websites I searched in December of 2013 , Disney purchased the rights to this movie .Unfortunately we can not assist you with your inquiry .I 'm so disappointed in the recently made movies . 1 out of 10 turns out to be silly- same old nonsense .Once in a while there is one that makes you wish things were really that way , but most of the time : Boy meets girl , major disappointment on either end , disappointment is dissolved , they get back together .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Makes it really unbelievable .Give me someone who has more character , less superstar status .THE CHRISTMAS LIST ! ! ! ! !Have to agree with the newly made Christmas movies being nonsense .Seriously , how many more TV Christmas movies are they going to make based on Family Man , Groundhog Day , blah blah blah .Same old garbage recycled with a different script and different actors .I love this movie and I so wish I could get it on DVD .It has not been on in many years but I still love it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Please put the Christmas List on TV this year .My daughters and I always enjoy watching it .Would n't it be better to watch a large variety of movies instead of the same movie over and over ?When that happens , I switch channels !There are certain traditions that never grow old for each family .Our young people need something that happens regularly , that gives them security .No wonder they go out to tried something new each day - they wind up coming home with the silly thoughts of the people that think love can be switched on and off depending on how a person looks or whether they 've had their coffee in the morning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Please give us back some solid stories that stand by the stuff .I love the old - \" Miracle on 54th Street \" - The old \" Christmas Carol \" - and the \" The Christmas list \" worked right in there too .By the way - You can bring back \" The Cowboy and the Movie Star \" .That too was a good one .WHY IS THIS NOT AIRING ! ? ! ! ? !I 've watched it every year since I was very young ! !Watching this movie with my mom and sisters is one of my favorite christmas traditions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "PLEASE ! ! ! ! ! !Well , yet again Family Channel is NOT showing the Christmas List and they have n't aired it in years .Why do n't they release it back to Lifetime Channel ( or however that works ) because at least when Lifetime owned the rights to it , they actually SHOWED it .I do n't know what Family Channel 's problem is , but if they do n't want to air it , give it to someone who does or release it on DVD .What is the problem ?With all the technology these days , I just do n't understand why it is not available on DVD and I do n't understand why Family Channel refuses to air it , again this year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We agree 100 % with you Dina ( and everyone else who has posted ) ...If networks refuse to air older movies they hold rights to then please , release them on DVD .Unfortunately , legal / money issues are usually the reason behind some movies going off air and/or not making it to DVD .Such a shame .I clicked on the link , but all I see is a list of the movies ( saaaame old stuff ) that ABC Family is airing - no poll .And , of course , once again , the Christmas List AINT on it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am totally in the dark about why they refuse to air it .You must have a different cable provider than I do , because I literally did a universal search for it every day in order to record it , but it never came on .I 've been doing the same this year , and so far , nothing .But they 'll put some other Christmas movies on that few people want to watch anymore .Like , how many times are they going to put that 30-year - old John Denver Christmas movie on ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And most of the new ones are even worse .Just rehashes of other movies .At least the Christmas List is a whole different story !Yes I searched daily also and it did n't pop up but I do think I missed couple days searching cuz when I googled it it showed it came on and I missed I was angry I do n't know why they do n't play it .Lifetime usually plays it but is n't this year and it 's one of the best yet .So glad I 'm not the only one who feels this way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Buying a bootleg makes me a little nervous .Is it still available to view on UTube ?I did a search yesterday but could n't find it .Although they did have The Man in the Santa Clause Suit with Fred Astaire , which I also recommend .One of my absolute favorite Christmas movies .I look forward to it every year .Wish it was in dvd because they rarely give it now .They use to have it on youtube but its no longer there .Needs to be on dvd like three days , picking up and dropping off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They repeat all kinds of holiday movies and they have n't played \" The Christmas List \" once this year yet .Please play this movie it 's one of my mom and I favorite and she 's so disappointed that it has n't been played .She 's 70 years old and loves this movie so much .So could you give her a Very Merry Christmas for her and me .i agree with Everyone !And what really bits is that I had this movie saved to my FAVoRITES folder on YouTube .But now YouTube took it off ... its marked as PRIVATE VIDEO on a gray screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'd be pleased if this movie came out on a DVD or better yet , restore it and put it out on blu - ray .I 'd pay $ 20 for a blu - ray version !I too LOVE The Christmas List and do n't understand why it is n't aired .Someone told me it is supposed to be on at 5 or 6 a.m. on Dec. 23rd this year , but I have n't been able to verify that .Hope it is true !Hoping for DVD at some point as well !The Christmas List was a family favorite ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now , mom and I try to still watch it together in memory of her .However , we ca n't seem to find it on !PLEASE someone play The Christmas List ! ! ! !I agree with everyone .....I love The Christmas List with Mimi Rogers .I look forward to watching it every year and have been disappointed that it has n't been on the last couple of years .Why did you stop airing it ?Why is it not available on DVD , when it 's obvious that many people would buy it ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Please do n't disappoint me this year .Maybe it promotes prayer .I know they would like to think that GOD is dead - but HE is very much alive that 's why some things work out in live and some things do not .It depends if we put GOD first , others second , and self last .If you ( \" abc Family \" ) own the rights to \" The Christmas List \" movie , I really wish that you would let out a DVD of it .The offerings of it on Amazon and Ebay all seem to be pirated from the tv , and I do n't want to get involved in that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you are n't going to do anything with it yourself , perhaps you 'd consider selling it to another company that would put it on tv or sell a dvd of it .Please consider this .Thanks !Just like many of you out there I adore the Christmas list .I had it recorded on my DVR .But erased it thinking I could find this movie on DVD .How disappointed I was when I found out its nearly impossible ! !I was n't giving up .the closest I came to was RareDVDS.Biz it 's a transfer of the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I will post again after receiving it and let you know how it goes .HAPPY THANKSGIVING ! !Kim and Erica , It is not a legal copy for sale on eBay , it is pirated off air , recorded and then sold .Why are you promoting the illegal sale ?The quality will be poor !We are trying to get a LEGAL , CRISP , CLEAN copy of the movie with all the scenes intact !Do n't promote the illegal sale of pirated merchandise .I would like to report I just received my copy of the Christmas List from RAREDVDS.BIZ And even though it was a transfer from the Family Channel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "EBAY Maybe selling it but it comes from the United Kingdom .and the cost is nearly $ 30.00 I paid a little over $ 13.00 and its shipped from California .I ordered it on 11/26/15 . and received it on 12/1/15 .This is the way to go if you really want this movie .you wo nt find it on T.V. Or in the stores .Since Walt Disney owns the rights to it .it arrived in a sleeve .and there are no commercials .even though it was transferred from the family channel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am very PLEASED with my PURCHASE .Who oh why do you not show this movie every year ?I 'm so sick.of seeing the same Christmas movies 5 times in one week and 50 times in a month .If you do n't want to show it , at least put it on DVD so we can buy it and watch it !If it can be posted on the internet for streaming , it could be released on DVD .The ones you can buy on eBay and elsewhere are illegal bootleg copies with poor quality video , and may not have the deleted scenes restored .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
