{"text": "I love the way the 45th Anniversary looks .That Carbon Metallic looks good .Its black , but not to black .Plus the metallic gives it a golden touch .I for one am thinking about putting down an order when it becomes ready this summer .Plus I 'm thinking about the V6 too .For me its the idea of shifting gears that s fun .Great Gas mileage and power of a V8 naturally aspirated .My 1968 396 big block chevy puts out 325 hp and eat gas like I eat twinkies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As far as the stripe , I like it .It 's so in your face loud like the muscle car era mixed with 80 's IROC / Formula 1 Decadence .I still remember as a kid seeing cars with that one stripe over that hump in the hood and wanting one of those cars .This 45th paint scheme brings the Camaro full circle .Plus the interior is nice .I 'm glad they finally put some soft leather / suede in the dash .It needed it badly .Too Much hard plastic .When I see the new dash I think now classic car interior modernized .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That was something I felt the current camaro lacked in interior quality .I know I may be killed for this but the new Mustang if you looked at the interior it had that old school look and one could look at the old Mustang interior and from a glance I could n't tell the difference .That for me was the only cool part to the mustang for me .Now with the improvements I feel the Camaro interior is right where its at .Plus I 've been wanting to see the new guage design and I like what I see in the picks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Plus I like the new steering wheel .Its got a good look to it and I feel if one wanted to there is a nice chrome area to add the Tri color camaro logo .The only thing I would want see ( Please Fbodfather make it so ) is the tapshift auto to be changed .I would like to be able to use the actual stick when shifting like the G8 had rather than having to push the flappy paddles on the the steering wheel .For me that would complete the package .Maybe have Hurst bring back the his / her shifter for the camaro .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "1968 Chevy Caprice-300+HP of 396 BBC Glory 2008 Chevy Cobalt Special Edition - Econo Drag Car . so ... does anybody know anything about pricing other than the zl1 's base is 47k ?i love the 45th camaro .but that zl1 is sick in terms of performance .performance would be my preference , and if the 45th is $ 40k and the zl1 ( loaded ) is $ 50k , i 'd probably just go with the zl1 .but if the 45th is $ 35k and the zl1 is still $ 50k , the 45th makes a much more compelling argument suddenly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We do n't even know price on the ZL1 .We 're all guessing at this point as the only reference point we have is the GT500 which GM has publicly admitted is the ZL1s target .Also , your 15 K for 150hp rationalization would n't be valid anyway .The ZL1 is much more than just a supercharger .The 45th Anniversary car 's exterior design is weak .... the ford guys are having a field day critizing that car .I am a Camaro guy since high school and still have 6 right now , and I ca n't really look at that car with a straight face .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I know this is just a matter of taste ............ or a lack thereof .However , I am still excited about the upcoming ZL1 .Stop drinking the Kool - Aid ...... that stripe is ugly !I totally agree ! ! !The stripe is HORRIBLE ! ! ! ! !Somebody was on crack when they came up with that ! ! ! !But , that s just my opinion .GT500 looks a bit bulkier than the ZL1 , given they are supposed to be in the same class , I would think GT500 might come a bit short on the performance side .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then again , if you are buying a ZL1 ... do n't you think extra weight might cause you to lose a few 1/10th of seconds on the drag strip , or track ?From the current videos on the net , GT500 appears to have issue hooking up with its rear tires , and a bit light when attacking curve aggresively .Anyway , I do n't really think GT500 's engine is anywhere close to compete against LSA .Of course , that 's just my bias ... now ... if GM decides to revive Trans AM ... then I will have to sell out on the Camaro .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "ZL1 rocks .I 'm with you RallySport !Til i see a med blue ( similar to the Bright Blue used on 09vettes)I will keep putting the money into my 67 .I would have bit the bullet and bought a ABM SS , but held out for a Z and now they dropped the color .Fbod mentioned cost to develop colors , but the Bright Blue was already developed for the vette .Might be me , but hard to believe more people want synergy green then blue .That green would grow old on me , but the blue is a classic to the gen 1 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
