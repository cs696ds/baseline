{"text": "Original Photos of Walter L.Main 's Circus Monster Show Train Wreck Tyrone , Pa 1893 .Rare grouping of 18 original 8 \" x 10 photographs of scenes of the wreck of the Walter L.Main 's Monster shows near Tyrone , Pa . on May 30th 1893 .These photographs came from The Bruce Studio at 1263 Penna Avenue in Tyrone .This wreck is perhaps the worst tragedy in Circus history .Five men were dead and a dozen more badly injured .Lions , tigers , leopards , elephants and beasts from African jungles and Indian plains bellowed , roared , screamed , and either lay helpless with shattered limbs or sprang forth to liberty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One lion , a tiger and a panther are still roaming about in the forests .The route lay over the Tyrone & Clearfield branch of Pennsylvania Railroad , and when descending the steep grade near Vail Station , five miles north of Tyrone , the engineer became powerless to abate the train 's rapidly - increasing speed .At the station the train was going at a forty - mile - an - hour gait and jumped the track , owing to a broken axle .The locomotive and passenger coaches remained on the rails .Many of the men slept in the cars under the wagons containing the animals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The dead and wounded people were taken from the wreck and the latter were removed to the hospital .When the wild beasts were freed a strange spectacle was witnessed .The head of one of the elephants was fastened down by one of the cars .As soon as released the huge beast struggled to his feet , shaking off the heavy timbers like straw , plowed through the balance of the wreck to freedom , seemingly happy of his escape .One of the tigers got out , and immediately began looking around to see what he could devour .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The untamed monster started out in the country , looking for new fields .( Terrifies A Farmer 's Wife )He came to the farm - yard of Alfred Thomas , where a woman was milking a cow .The woman left suddenly and the tiger sprang upon the cow and killed her .He was devouring his quivering meal , when the farmer appeared with his rifle and shot the tiger .Pleased with his royal sport , Farmer Thomas shouldered his rifle and started in pursuit of a panther that he knew was cavorting on the mountain - side .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One lion is roaming the woods , but the other lion was captured easily by its trainer .He first cowed it , and then tied a rope around its neck and secured it to a log , where it has been quietly lying all day , viewing the turbulent scene below .Keeper Jenks was endeavoring to subdue a king of the forest , when the ferocious king seized the keeper and tore off his kneecap .All the animals that were saved roamed around loose , seemingly content with their freedom , and not caring to abuse it by running off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many of the smaller animals were not injured , though their cages were crushed about them .None of them seemed at all nervous or excited , but browsed contentedly or wallowed in the creek nearby as through it was an every - day occurrence .( A Famous Horse Badly Injured )A great many monkeys escaped chattering to the trees , where they looked down in wonderment , but were soon calmed by sweetmeats and tied .The dying groans of some of the trained horses were piteous .Most of them were pulled out only to be shot , the limbs being broken or otherwise fatally injured .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He lay carefully bedded and covered by an awning , breathing heavily .Every once in awhile he made an effort to rise , when the attendant would place his hand on the horse 's head and it would lay back again .The alligators were stretched on the ground as if dead , but a rub along the nose with a stick would show them wide awake .Treasurer Train resigned Saturday , May 27 , but was asked to continue until the show reached Lewistown , May 30 .He always slept in the wagon , and was the first person looked after .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He died before taken out .He was well known among circus people .All the wrecked cars are a total loss .The proprietor 's money loss in the smash up is placed at $ 150,000 .Engine No . 1500 was selected to draw the circus train .Stephen Croswell , engineer and Harvey Meese , fireman .When Osceola was reached , in order to make the ascent of the mountain , another engine in charge of Engineer Reeder , was attached as a pusher .The ascent was made in safety .A mile or two below Gardner 's there is a reverse curve , and then follows a mile of straight track to Vail .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( The Rails Spread ) Just what occasioned it an investigation will likely prove .There seems to be no doubt that the train ran away and was beyond the power of the engineer to control .Whether the brakes would not hold , or whether the fault was not in furnishing another engine , remains to be determined .( Six People Killed ) Four persons were instantly killed .These were William Ebberly , head brakeman , of Tyrone ; William Mutterly , showman , of East Liberty , and two other show attachees , names unknown .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He was buried beneath a mass of wreckage , and it was two hours before he could be reached .At times he would urge his rescuers to hurry if they wanted to get him out alive .He died just as he was being conveyed from the wreck .James Strayer , son of the widow Strayer , of Houtzdale , lived an hour after the accident occurred .He was thrown to the open ground where he was found .He and John E. Eddings , also of Houtzdale , had obtained permission to ride to Lewistown .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A moment after the car left the track , and the next he knew he was on the ground , so close to Strayer that he could touch him .He says Strayer was able to speak but did not know anything and died in about an hour .Eddings ' face was scratched and he complained of a slight sickness of the stomach , but was otherwise uninjured .He returned to his home by the first train , the train that carried the corpse of his companion back to Houtzdale .Those injured seriously enough to require medical attention were sent to the Altoona hospital .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In addition to these were to be seen around the wreck many persons having slight wounds , and it is safe to say that few , except those occupying the passenger coaches , escaped without being to a greater or less extent scratched or bruised .The dead were taken to Tyrone as soon as all the railroad men and show attachees were accounted for , the supposition being that all the bodies had been recovered .As in the case of young Strayer , there may have been others on the train unknown to Mr. Main , in which case it is possible other bodies may be found .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is said their bodies will be sent back to Tyrone and interred by the circus people .( Animals Turned Loose ) Sixteen cages of animals were crushed and the animals either killed , maimed or set loose .Three lions escaped .There were three sacred cows in the animal exhibition .Two were killed and the other escaped .One of the tigers spying the cow made a savage attack on her , was driven away , and immediately sprang over a fence into a field and attacked a lot of cattle belonging to Alfred Thomas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( A Woman Races A Lion )For a short time after the wreck strange and wild animals were to be met with at every turn .Mrs. William Lyson , wife of the telegraph operator at Vail , on learning of the wreck , started to walk to the wreck and met a lion , and on turning to run was horror struck at seeing a large hyena within a few feet of her .She stood stock still and screamed when the animals left .When the wreck occurred the engineer and fireman started to walk back to the wrecked cars , and meeting two lions hastily made their way back to the locomotive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
