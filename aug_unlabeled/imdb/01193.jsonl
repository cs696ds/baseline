Night Shyamalan Could Start Working on The Last Airbender 2 in 2013 .If you follow M. Night Shyamalan on Twitter ( you probably do n't ) you most likely saw him tweet about his potential upcoming movies .What you probably did n't notice is that one of his potential upcoming movies is The Last Airbender 2 .Unless you have yet to see The Last Airbender ( do n't see it ) , you 'd know that Shyamalan 's vision of the Avatar World is n't too far from delusional .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But currently , Shyamalan just ca n't seem to work his magic in this decade .It 's gotten so bad , in fact , that many believed that The Last Airbender would be the final tip - off most Studios would need to ensure that Shyamalan does n't direct another movie again .Obviously the Studios still have n't gotten the hint since Shyamalan has another movie , entitled After Earth , that 's due on June 7 th 2013 .And after that , well , we have reason to believe that he 'll start working on The Last Airbender 2 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But if you think about hard enough , you 'll probably realize the cold , hard fact too : The Last Airbender 2 's script is complete ; Shyamalan finished it a little while ago .This most likely means that the movie script that 's \" complete \" is The Last Airbender 2 's .Obviously there is more than one movie competing for Shyamlan 's \" heart \" , but it seems fairly obvious that one of those competing movies is The Last Airbender 2 .After all , why would he write another complete script for a different movie ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
