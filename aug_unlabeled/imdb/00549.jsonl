{"text": "I wo n't provide a comprehensive list of every single time the UK has breached treaties , because - frankly - I ca n't be bothered .However , since you argue the UK has NEVER broken a treaty , and because you ask for only one example , I 'll provide it .The 1783 Treaty of Paris that concluded the American War of Independence stipulated that Great Britain was to pull its troops out of the Great Lakes region \" with all convenient speed .\" This was comprehensively ignored by the British , and redcoats remained in the area until the 1794 Jay Treaty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In theory , the Westminister parliament could legislate tomorrow to abolish the Scottish Parliament without the consent of the people of Scotland .In practice , the power to do so is non - existent .By the way , the ICJ has no jurisdiction in EU matters since the Member States ha .Since it was set up by referendum , i.e. it was felt that such a major constitutional change required the people 's consent , it can be argued that you would need a referendum to get rid of it .It would be argued that it would be unconstitutional to simply abolish it by Act of Parliament .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Call it politically inexpedient if you like .I would say that to act in this way would be unconstitutional in that the constitution of the UK has changed .Dicey 's idea of parliamentary sovereignty does not hold good any more , if it ever did .Of course , the UK parliament can legislate about anything .In practice , it does not for a variety of reasons .For a start , there is the old chestnut about legislating to make smoking illegal in France .Then there are the UK 's international commitments .The UK adheres to them because it wants to be a state governed by the rule of law and to be seen as such - hence , the concern with the illegality of the Iraq war .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then there are the encroachments made on parliamentary sovereignty by the increasing availability of judicial review .As far as the EU is concerned , if the UK wanted to leave it , it could of course do so by repealing the European Communities Act ( and repudiating the EU Treaties to be doubly sure ) .The UK as a state does not live in a vacuum .Its acts have consequences internationally .All these things have whittled away parliamentary sovereignty in practice .We may not have entrenched provisions of constitutional law laid down in a fully written constitution , but things are changing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
