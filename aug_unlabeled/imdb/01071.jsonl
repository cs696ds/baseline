{"text": "How Crime Scene Investigation Works .At the Crime Scene : Scene Documentation .\u00adTh\u00ade goal of crime - scene documentation is to create a visual record that will allow the forensics lab and the prosecuting attorney to easily recreate an accurate view of the scene .The CSI uses digital and film cameras , different types of film , various lenses , flashes , filters , a tripod , a sketchpad , graph paper , pens and pencils , measuring tape , rulers and a notepad at this stage of the investigation .He may also use a camcorder and a camera boom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If there is only one CSI , all of these jobs are his .Notes Note - taking at a crime scene is not as straightforward as it may seem .A CSI 's training includes the art of scientific observation .This fluid might be blood ; it might also be decomposition fluid , which resembles blood at a certain stage .Mr. Clayton explains that in crime scene investigation , opinions do n't matter and assumptions are harmful .When describing a crime scene , a CSI makes factual observations without drawing any conclusions .Joe Clayton 's photography kit : He usually uses a digital Nikon D100 to photograph a crime scene .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Photographs CSIs take pictures of everything before touching or moving a single piece of evidence .The medical examiner will not touch the corpse until the CSI is done photographing it and the surrounding area .There are three types of photographs a CSI takes to document the crime scene : overviews , mid - views , and close - ups .Overview shots are the widest possible views of the entire scene .If the scene is indoors , this includes : . views of all rooms ( not just the room where the crime seems to have occurred ) , with photos taken from each corner and , if a boom is present , overhead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The CSI also takes a second set of close - up shots that includes a ruler for scale .Every photo the CSI takes makes it into the photo log .Without a good photo log , the pictures of the scene lose a lot of their value .In the investigation of John F. Kennedy 's assassination , the FBI photographers who attended the autopsy did n't create descriptions of the pictures they were taking , and investigators were later unable to distinguish between entrance and exit wounds in the photos .Cleanup Crews .Crime scene investigators do not clean up the scene -- neither do police officers , detectives or anyone else involved in the investigation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the last 10 years , however , some people have recognized the need for hired crime - scene cleaners to take care of the job so family members and landlords do n't have to , and some of these people have formed companies dedicated to the task .It 's a dirty , sometimes hazardous , very high - paying job .Crime - scene clean - up can run up to $ 200 an hour on top of flat fees ( in the thousands ) and equipment costs .Cleaning up a meth lab is especially expensive because of the risk to anyone who enters the scene and the amount of work involved in making the area habitable again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "During a video walk - through , the CSI captures the entire crime scene and surrounding areas from every angle and provides a constant audio narrative .After the CSI has created a full record of the crime scene exactly as it was when he arrived , it 's time to collect the evidence .Now he starts touching things .User Reviews .A very good film , has an awesome thrilling feel to it .The situation is somewhat cleverly executed and the film itself is something a little different which I like .It could had been less of a clich\u00e9 but despite that , this film is still worth watching .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
