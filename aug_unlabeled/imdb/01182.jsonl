{"text": "At the time The Terminal Man was made during the time when Hodges suffered a brief spell of depression .He was influenced by artist Get Carter and Beyond the film never had a UK release but was a big hit in Japan .Mayersberg ended up working with Hodges on the minor hit Croupier ( 1998 ) starring Clive Owen .The film at the time had flopped at the US box office , many believe was due to Hodges choice of having George Segal as the lead .Segal is usually known at the time playing comedic roles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Probably the same way you feel for Frankenstein 's monster .Glen Gould music is very disturbing especially the scene where Harry Benson kills his girlfriend on the waterbed which visually cold but memorable .From reading the biopic of Mike Hodges : Region 1 .I know even though this film had been popular on late night TV on Channel 4 in the 90 's , this film has n't had a DVD release .The good news is that now you get it on DVD on Edward Hooper 's paintings which if anybody see this film will know why .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
