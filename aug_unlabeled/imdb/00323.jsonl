{"text": "The History of the Academy Awards : Best Picture - 1944 .Oscar winners Barry Fitzgerald and Bing Crosby in Best Picture winner Going My Way ( 1944 ) .The 17th Academy Awards , for the film year 1944 .The nominations were announced on February 3 , 1945 and the awards were held on March 15 , 1945 .Best Picture : Going My Way .The Race : The race got going pretty early .By the end of May , three of the major contenders - Going My Way , Double Indemnity and Gaslight had all opened .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the meantime , two of the biggest names in Hollywood were preparing long films designed to lift American spirits ; Darryl F. Zanuck had Wilson over at Fox , while David O. Selznick had has his own Since You Went Away , a film about the homefront .Wilson opened to great reviews but Selznick put all his promotion power behind Since You Went Away .Early talk among the industry was that the race would come down between Going My Way and Wilson .The National Board of Review did n't really help matters .They made None But the Lonely Heart their choice for Best Picture and included both Going My Way and Wilson in their top 10 ( along with The Song of Bernadette from the previous year ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Golden Globes agreed , giving Picture and Director to Going My Way while giving Fitzgerald their Best Supporting Actor .Their Best Actor went to Wilson 's Alexander Knox .The Results : The Academy had decided to reduce the Best Picture nominees down to 5 for the first time since 1931 .The major five films were all in , with Going My Way and Wilson each tied with 10 nominations , including Picture , Actor , Director and Screenplay ( though different Screenplay categories ) .In the end , it did indeed come down to those two films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Wilson would eventually take home 5 Oscars , but not Best Picture ( the 5 wins without winning Picture would set a new record that would stand until 1951 ) .But Going My Way would take home a whopping 7 Oscars , at the time , the second most ever .Because of its win in both Screenplay and the now defunct Original Story category , it managed to win 6 major Oscars , something which has never been equaled .Oscar Nominations : Picture , Director , Screenplay , Original Story , Actor ( Crosby ) , Actor ( Fitzgerald ) , Supporting Actor ( Fitzgerald ) , Editing , Cinematography ( Black - and - White ) , Song ( \" Swingin on a Star \" ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "And here was Bing Crosby , the star of the Road pictures with Bob Hope , suddenly playing a more dramatic part .True , it still had some comedy , still even had him singing ( including a nice new song called \" Swingin on a Star \" ) .But this was nothing like the likable rogues he played with Hope .Now he was a priest , assigned to help shepherd an old parish priest on his way and help the young boys find their way in the heart of the city .It 's a nice enough movie , with a pretty solid performance from Crosby and an even more solid one from Barry Fitzgerald as the old priest .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Because it won 7 Oscars and was the biggest hit of the year .It did so well at the Oscars that it would n't be knocked out of the Top 10 list of points until 1997 .It won Best Picture , Director and Screenplay in a year when it was competing against Double Indemnity in all three categories .It won Best Actor for a nice , charming performance that really did n't involve much acting .It even had the bizarre double whammy of having Barry Fitzgerald getting nominated for both lead and supporting ( something a rule change would quickly keep from ever happening again ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It does n't have that much religion in it .It 's just a nice little film about a fairly nice guy who has to replace the older fella at work and is going to help out some people along the way .It 's almost like a coincidence that his job happens to be one of priest .Writer : Billy Wilder / Raymond Chandler ( from the novel by James M. Cain ) .Producer : Joseph Sistrom .Oscar Nominations : Picture , Director , Screenplay , Actress ( Stanwyck ) , Cinematography ( Black - and - White ) , Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedic Picture , Sound .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "And of course , as Roger Ebert so wisely points out here , he does n't really seem all that interested in the money or the girl .Maybe in some ways this is the predecessor to Rope , the notion that you can simply kill and get away with it if you 're smart enough to know how to do it .He is smart enough and probably would get away with it if it was n't for the woman .But , if not for the woman , the way she appears through the haze at the top of the stairs , a vision of carnal danger , he probably would n't be interested enough to try it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Because in a lot of ways that 's the more interesting relationship - that of Neff and Keyes , the way they play off each other , the way they know how the other one seems to think .Not anything sexual , but simply the interworkings of their relationship .Tough talking blondes do n't really belong in their world and it takes one to bring it down .Why does this film work so well , a thriller as good , if not better , than any that Alfred Hitchcock would ever make ?Part of it is the original novel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He was a pulp master and pulp works often turn into great films .They have the story , they have the dialogue , they almost seem to already have that haze ready at the top of the stairs or the smoke off the cigarette tip in the insurance office .Then , of course , there was the double mastery of Chandler himself and Billy Wilder writing the film , one a master of hard - boiled detective novels , the other , the greatest writer to ever set foot in Hollywood .Of course , there were all the technical aspects as well , the way the film is so perfectly fit together , the great sets , the sly score , the memorable cinematography .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For those who ever cast doubt on Billy Wilder as a director , remember this .Think of Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity and The Apartment .Think of Ray Milland in The Lost Weekend .Then think of either one of them in any other performance .There 's no comparison .It 's all about Wilder .Writer : John Van Druten / Walter Reisch / John L.

{"text": "That the house is filled with horrifying memories for her seems to be no objection to her new husband .But she wants him to fulfill his dreams and so off they go .None of these scenes are in the original film version .In that film , the first we see of the couple is as they disembark from the carriage at their house on the square .We know about the crime that has been committed ( in fact , in the earlier version , we actually see the crime ) , but not the couple .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We can see their early happiness and see as Paula becomes increasingly forgetful , not remembering where things are or things that she might have done .The film keeps in quiet suspense about whether or not she is going mad .Of course , you probably know that she 's not .In fact , her husband is systematically driving her mad .But that 's part of the build up of suspense , a nice surprise from a director ( George Cukor ) , normally known for lighter comedies .Here he shows he can do suspense as well as Hitchcock .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Here he gets an Oscar winning ( and much deserving ) performance from Ingrid Bergman and Oscar worthy ( and nominated ) performances out of Charles Boyer and Angela Lansbury , possibly the finest performances in the long careers of all three .And they are surrounded by a masterful score , phenomenal cinematography and first rate ( Oscar winning ) art direction .It is a triumph all around , a magnificent Hitchcock like thriller from someone other than the master , one of those rare films like The Third Man that very much feels like it was directed by Hitchcock .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The Film : Alright , first things first .Unless you are a big epic , and by epic , I mean something like Ben - Hur or even The 10 Commandments , you have no business having an Overture to start the film .Being a ridiculously long film that feels even longer does not make you an epic .This film does n't earn its overture ( made worse by the fact that the score is n't that great - certainly not Oscar worthy , even more embarrassing for it to have won the Oscar in the same year as the classic score from Laura ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It only becomes important when it actually affects the films themselves .Some marriages can add to the film ( witness Burton and Taylor in Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ) .But some film business relationships you ca n't help but know about .David O. Selznick loved Jennifer Jones desperately and because she won the Oscar before they were married , he was always desperate to find the role that would win her another Oscar .This was n't it .Nothing was it .Jones was never a particularly good actress .This film is 172 minutes and amazingly enough feels even longer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This was one of those patriotic films , designed to make us feel for the people left behind , but it lacks the urgency or even the acting of a film like Mrs. Miniver or the humor of something like The More the Merrier .It 's decently acted , though not worthy of the nominations and not badly made .But it drags on for what seems like forever and there 's just enough there to justify the length of the film nor the nine Oscar nominations .I just felt like I was being drummed over the head , being told , \" be good for the war effort .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Nighthawk Nominations : none .The Film : I have been in a spate of reading Presidential biographies .I wonder sometimes if I should read at least one for every President .But after watching this film , I wondered if I should bother .Films , especially ones that get 10 Oscar nominations and win 5 Oscars , would seem to be more interesting and certainly more vibrant than reading several hundred pages of biography .But this film , even with all the Oscar glory , is incredibly boring .And the performance by Henry Knox , the performance upon which the entire film hinges , is frightfully dull .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps the love from the Academy was a reflection of the love that Darryl F. Zanuck poured into this film .It had lost a considerable amount of money , had pretty much bombed everywhere outside of one New York theater and had to make due with just the Golden Globe for Best Actor among the early awards , although it did make the NBR Top 10 .But studio politics always played well at the Oscars and Zanuck 's hopes came true , as it landed in the Best Picture race instead of Laura and the Best Director race instead of Gaslight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I remember desperately trying to track this film down .At the time it had more nominations and more Oscars than any other film I was missing and I finally found it at one random video store and sat down to watch .And I thought , I ca n't believe this .Was Wilson this utterly boring ?So uninspiring as a man , as a President ?No wonder the damn 14 Points and League of Nations failed .The script offers nothing new , the film is edited so badly that it seems like it takes three and a half hours and there 's certainly nothing awards worthy of the Cinematography , Score or Sound .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's one other thing that I 've mentioned before and feel the need to mention again .It 's a big deal to get to 10 Oscar nominations , to reach that all important double digit plateau .So what do the following films all have in common : Wilson , Anne of the Thousand Days , Tootsie and Braveheart ?They all got their 10th nomination with a ridiculously undeserved Best Sound nomination ( I would also mention Sayonara and Airport , but their nominations for Best Sound are n't nearly as egregious as most of their other nominations ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm sure when you do something this huge there are always gon na be things you might want to change afterwards .I just thought you may have unintentionally added a third star .Question about that .Do you ask them to do that ?Or does someone over there notice a good website with good critique and just do it themselves or ask you if they can ?No , it 's something you do yourself .Actually , anyone can submit a review to the IMDB on the external reviews page .I add mine after I post them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
