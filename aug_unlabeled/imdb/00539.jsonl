{"text": "Theatrical Re - relases .Remember the days when movies made multiple theatrical releases ?Being that this is my 50th Retrojunk article , I am going to make a very special topic .I am going to talk about one of the most important things of not only my childhood , but of my entire life : the Disney Animated Classics .Now , before I go on , I have a question to everyone who 's around my age or older .Do you remember the days when movies would make their theatrical release , and then about 6 or 7 years later , they 'd be released again ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "VHS tapes were introduced around 1976 , but they were n't popularized until the 1980 's .The same thing happened with DVD 's , which were introduced in 1997 but were n't popularized until the early 2000 's .During the whole time Disney was making movies , the Disney movies continued to make theatrical releases every few years even through the 80 's and in the early 90 's .Now , I was n't around at the time , but my dad has told me that he remembered hearing Disney make an announcement that they were never going to release any of their movies on video .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At the time , only a few Disney Animated Classics made a video release , but the others continued to make their theatrical releases as usual .I 'm going to talk a little bit about the Disney Animated Classics that I saw theatrically in the late 80 's and early 90 's .Most of these will be re - releases , but I 'll include some original releases as well .Cinderella \" Cinderella \" was my very first theatrical experience .I saw it when it made it 's final theatrical release in late 1987 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This movie came out on video for the first time shortly after this .This was a good movie , not my favorite , but definately my mom 's favorite .The Fox and the Hound \" The Fox and the Hound \" made two theatrical releases : once in 1981 and again in the Spring of 1988 .I , of course , saw it during it 's second run .Strangely , this one did n't come out on video until 1994 .It 's really weird to watch a movie for the first time and then watch it a second time a big gap later , as you do n't rememer much .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Bambi Probably the oldest Disney movie I saw theatrically .I saw it during it 's final theatrical release in the summer of 1988 .This movie came out on video shortly after this release .You 're probably wondering if I was one of the people who ran out of the theater crying when Bambi 's mother died ?I was a pretty tough kid , so to answer your question : No . Oliver & Company This movie was my brother 's first theatrical experience and the first movie I saw on it 's original theatrical release .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It made a second theatrical release in the spring of 1996 , and it finally came out on video later that year .While it may not be Disney 's best movie , it 's still an okay movie .The best part about it was the music !The Rescuers \" The Rescuers \" made three theatrical releases .I saw this movie on it 's third and final theatrical release in early 1989 .Like \" The Fox and the Hound \" , the video release of this movie was a bit delayed ( 1992 ) .I have n't seen this movie as often as most of the other Disney movies , but I do remember it being a really sad story with a really frightening opening .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm one who would n't believe such nonsense , but then again , I would n't doubt anyone who works for the Disney company .Tummy Trouble / Honey , I Shrunk the Kids Granted , this was not a Disney Animated Classic , but it 's still a Disney film .This is a film I saw on it 's original theatrical release mainly to see the Roger Rabbit short at the beginning but only to discover it being followed by the real feature : \" Honey , I Shrunk the Kids \" .This is a movie I just felt like mentioning since \" Honey , I Shrunk the Kids \" was the very first live action movie I saw in the theaters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Strangely , this was a movie that I was already familiar with since we had the movie taped off of TV before seeing it theatrically .It 's really weird when you go see a movie at the theaters when you know the whole thing word for word !Compared to that old tape we used to have , it was a lot cooler seeing it in much better quality ( obviously ) .The Little Mermaid The first movie of Disney 's renaissance era was a movie I saw on it 's original theatrical release in late 1989 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maybe to promote the movie 's upcoming sequel , which came out directly to video a couple years later ?I do n't know ; to me , the reasoning behind that is up in the air .The Prince and the Pauper / The Rescuers Down Under Another double feature I saw theatrically .I remember seeing the half - hour short , \" The Prince and the Pauper \" follwed by the feature , \" The Rescuers Down Under \" together , but they were released seperately upon their video release .After that , I 've seen \" Prince and the Pauper \" numerous times , but theatrically was the only time I saw \" The Rescuers Down Under \" all the way through ( every other time , I only saw bits and pieces of it ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Jungle Book It was a really special treat to see the last Disney Animated Classic with Walt Disney 's involvement theatrically .I saw \" The Jungle Book \" during it 's final theatrical run in the summer of 1990 .This is a really fun movie to watch ; I enjoyed it as a kid , and I still enjoy it today .101 Dalmatians I 've saved for last my personal favorite . \"101 Dalmatians \" made it 's final theatrical run in the summer of 1991 .Of course , my parents took me to go see it , and after I walked out of that theater , I was never the same again , and I will remember that theatrical experience as long as I live !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm sure a lot of Disney fans love this movie , and I say it should be essential to everybody 's collection .Well , that pretty much does it for all the Disney re - releases I saw theatrically .For the remainder of this article , I 'm going to talk about some related material .In 1992 , \" Pinocchio \" made it 's last theatrical run , and in 1993 , \" Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs \" made it 's last theatrical run .Neither of which I saw theatrically during that time , but I did get them when they came out on video .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The only re - release I saw was The Little Mermaid ; it was my first theatrical experience .And I actually thought that was 1996 !So ...I was n't two the first time I went to the theaters ...I was almost four .I remember seeing 101 Dalmations in 1993 , that s the only Disney rerelease I 've ever seen .Infact there are alot of subliminal messages in Disney movies , check it out on Youtube .I think I did see the Rescuers Down Under in theaters , because I remember seeing the Prince and the Pauper as well , and then later again on a VHS or something .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Do you know what year that was released in theaters ?This is me as far as the Disney animated movies go .I enjoy alot of them .My personal favorite is also 101 Dalmations .Some of the others I really like include : The Lion King , The Black Cauldron , The Hunchback of Notre Dame , Dinosaur , Aladdin , The Rescuer 's Down Under , Tarzan , all the Pixar movies ( Except the Incredibles ) , and Robin Hood .All my life though , I have never wanted to ever watch three of them : Beauty and the Beast , Cinderella , and Sleeping Beauty the Disney Princess thing was just not my thing with their ballroom gowns , and the enchanting themes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I forget because the theater near me has been playing it every year for a while anyways , without an official re - release .The oscar contender re - release usually is more like when an oscar contender got a limited initial release and then the studios decide to do a broad release , which is n't the exact same thing as a typical re - release .I did n't know about Dirty Dancing , but I realized I forgot about ET 's re - release just a few years ago .Well I for one , really hope they pick up the trend of rereleasing movies again , because that 's the best .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Goblyn while you 're right in that they do n't do that many rerelases of films anymore , they do rerelease serious , Oscar contender movies that were shown earlier in the year , again right around the Academy Awards .And last yer they did a brief rerelease of Dirty Dancing for th 20th anniversary .They also rereleased A Nightmare Before Christmas last year . jupi73ris right ; unlike the Little Mermaid rumour which is all fluff , the Rescuers controversy is real .Its just very hard to spot , and even harder to find since the 99 reissue was pulled off shelves pretty fast .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Incidently , I just spotted something .You included the Rescuers Down Under in a re - release article !But as far as I know , its NEVER been reissued into theatres .The only time it was shown was when it was a double feature with the Prince and the Pauper .And I do n't think Honey I Shrunk the Kids was shown again either ( I could be wrong , I 'm not entierely sure ... ) .Actually , I think Disney just did n't want to release on videotape because it was easily pirated .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So it 's not like they were completely against home video , but they were very slow to make them available for sale .For a while , the videotapes were available for rent only ( and only through Fotomat , I think ) .They did n't start selling them until around 1982 .They also made them ridiculously expensive at first . hi DL ! the subliminal image in the rescurers is true !i know what you mean about disny theatrical re - issues .here in the UK , during the 80 's and early 90 's , not a summer holiday or christmas break went by without a disney film re - hitting the cinemas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "they only became avaiable to buy here in the 90s . thanks for your article .it brought back many a happy memory of sitting in a smokey cinema , lol !I wish they still did theatrical rereleases of movies .I think the last one I recall having gone to was The Exorcist ( when they reedited it slightly to make \" the version you 've never seen \" , which if I remember correctly , was a huge hit .So it just goes to show you , the studios are spending relatively little money , and people will pay to go back to see the movies again and again on the big screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , I would think that massive rereleases of some really great movies would make the studios so much money , they 'd absolutely want to rerelease them .Maybe they 're just lazy , or maybe they 're worried that there will be one less screen devoted to \" The Love Guru \" or \" You Do n't Mess With the Zohan \" or some other shit they churn out .\" I 've learned so many things in the past , but throughout my history of making articles on this site , I have been quite infamous for recieving arguments that contridicted my knowledge .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It might have been due to the \" re - release \" fever that was going on during that era due to Star Wars being released in the \" Special Editions \" and doing so well .( Hell , I had Star Wars on VHS at the time , and I still paid to go see it an additional 7 times at the theater during the re - release ... back before DVD and widescreen TVs , it was the only way to fly ) .So , could be they were just trying to cash in .I remember seeing alot of the classic Disney movies when they were re - released in the late 70 's and early 80 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You must keep in mind the re - releases occured during the time before VCR 's or during the early days of VCR 's before every movie was mass produced on that format .Now that every movie is mass produced on DVD 4 months after is leaves theaters there is no point in re - releasing them .Back when is was a little kid you got to see a movie once maybe twice in the theater and if you were lucky you got to see an edited version on cable a year later and that was it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I also saw the final Jungle Book re - release with my Mom , but the A / C was out in the theater so we left at the Vulture scene to cool off .I definitely wish that practice was more common today .They need to stop showing us crappy new movies and play the classics we know we 'll enjoy .Like from January to March when all the crap movies come out , make that the re - release season .To this day I 've never seen Oliver and Company .Despite wanting to always see it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And when I say I only saw the first few minutes , I truely mean it .Case in point , I do n't know who all those dogs are in that picture .All I know is the cat , and the dog directly to his right .The reason though is , well , my mom decided I was too young during its original release to see movies .Did she think I 'd be too loud or throw a tantrum ?I dunno .But I never got to see it during its second run either , despite really wanting to .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I saw Snow White during its final run .It was one of the biggest dissapointments of my childhood .I dunno , it was like Oliver and Company , I always heard of it and always wanted to see it .But when I finally saw it I was just ... dissapointed .Too girly maybe ?I have found every subsequent princess movie to be far too girly for my tastes .Ironically , right before Snow White I saw this knock off sequel to Snow White .It was n't produced by Disney of course so they had to make their own \" almost but not quite \" characters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The first theatrical film that I saw ( to my knowledge ) was 101 Dalmations .I remember growing up I rented Cinderella nearly every time we went to Blockbuster much to my parents dismay .Then when I say a commercial for 101 Dalmations I asked to rent it , however it was then that I was introduced to the theater .Beauty and the Beast I believe was my second theater trip then Aladdin which I saw 3 times because I loved it so much .I saw I believe all of the 90 's Disney theater films including rereleases , aside from Little Mermaid because I already owned it on tape .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
