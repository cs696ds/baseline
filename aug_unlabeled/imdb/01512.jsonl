{"text": "How to Survive In South Central .Watching Boyz N The Hood again recently , I was struck by something I never noticed before : This is my generation 's Cooley High .Granted , I saw Michael Schultz 's take on American Graffiti when it came out , but I was a kid who had n't yet experienced life in any form outside of skinned knees and Kindergarten naps .Boyz N The Hood arrived on the scene when I was 21 , far more worldly and quite familiar with the East Coast version of the neighborhood it depicts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I saw a lot of me in Boyz ' Tre Styles , and not just because I look like Cuba Gooding Jr. ; and I saw myself in Cooley 's Preach .We were all smart guys in the ' hood , looking to make something of ourselves amidst all the Satanic temptations our location had to offer .John Singleton was not much older than 21 when he made Boyz N The Hood .The film he submitted to Columbia Pictures was a sad coming of age tale set in his neighborhood .The film was at times violent , but was first and foremost about the relationship between a teenager and the wise father trying to set him straight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Filmgoers expecting to see wall - to - wall violence were confused .This was no exploitation quickie .In fact , there was more violence going on outside the screen at movie theaters and malls than inside the screen during Boyz N The Hood .Critics took notice of the film and its depiction of an environment given little screen time in mainstream cinema .At 24 , Singleton became the youngest person nominated for Best Director , and the first Black person .As of this writing , he still holds both these titles .Lee Daniels , director of Precious , one - upped Singleton by being the first Black person nominated for a Director 's Guild Award , but I doubt he will join Singleton as a fellow directing Oscar nominee .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Precious and Boyz would make a good double bill - call it Boyz and Gurlz N The Hood .The timeframe , at least in the early passages of Boyz , overlaps with Precious ' 1980 's setting .We meet younger versions of Tre , Doughboy and Doughboy 's brother , Ricky .Ricky is never seen without a football , nor Doughboy without a baseball cap .Boyz spends a good half hour with these young boys , sending them on a Stand By Me inspired visit to a dead body ( Singleton even has the boys walk along railroad tracks to get to it ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Doughboy likes criminal activity , and it sends him to Juvenile Hall for 7 years .Tre is intelligent but wants to belong so he acts up in class .The biggest stigma in the ' hood , or at least in my ' hood , was being smart .When Tre gets into a classroom fight , Reva Devereaux ( Angela Bassett ) sends him to live with his father .She realizes that , at Tre 's age , he needs a man to guide him to adulthood .Tre 's dad is named Furious Styles ( one of the great names in all of cinema ) and is played by Ike Turner himself , Laurence Fishburne .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "And Tre is now a slightly unconvincing looking teenager played by my doppelganger .The homecoming barbecue is hosted by Doughboy and Ricky 's Mom ( Tyra Ferrell ) , an angry woman who makes no attempt to hide her preference for her \" good \" son .There are plenty of women at the party , including Regina King as the precursor of the character she 'd play in Singleton 's next movie , Poetic Justice , and Brandi ( Nia Long ) as a good Catholic girl in a sexless relationship with Tre .Ricky 's baby mama is also there , and they seem destined to be together even as Ricky contemplates going to USC after graduation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
