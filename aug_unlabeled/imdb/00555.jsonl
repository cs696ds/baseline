{"text": "Perhaps there is some truth to that story .Remember , Whale was stepping into a production that was already well under way .Just as he used many elements of set designs that already existed , perhaps the Monster 's look evolved from some preliminary work that Pierce had already conceived .In 1970 word surfaced that a print of the lost Lugosi test footage filmed by Florey had surfaced and was for sale .This information was reported in several places and turned out to be a hoax - however , one of the publications where it was reported was a French magazine called Midi - Minuit Fantastique , issue # 23 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But in the studio there are many months of preparation before that prior to filming the first scene , and in the case of Frankenstein I had been barely notified that they would do such a theme when I was immediately brought onboard . \"\" I read on that occasion dozens of books on that material and I am proud to have given an anatomical preparation that was fairly complete .I got in communication with travelers and researchers from Egypt and from the museum of Cairo to whom I am in debt for many of the details that turned out to be most interesting in the characterizations of Karloff .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But none of that .There have been strange people and even doctors that have conducted experiments similar to the ones of Dr. Frankenstein , without success , of course , and articles , studies , and books guided my creation of the figure of the monster .Each detail had a reason for being .Pierce becomes excited , opens a drawer , and pulls out an interesting group of photographs of Karloff .Look at these details - he tells me - Those electromagnets in the joints between the head and the neck , for example , had a definite reason ; to pass between the joined parts the violent current that would move the individual 's blood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
