{"text": "Before dismissing Whitlam , Kerr sought the advice of Sir Garfield Barwick , who then was the Chief Justice of the High Court .On its face , this theory seems to derive from the most hard - headed assessment of the realities of the Constitution .[90 ] .Some thought that the problem was more serious in theory than in practice , and that the balanced judgment and good sense of Australians steeped in British constitutional traditions would prevent the logical possibilities of the Constitution from being carried to their ultimate , destructive extremes .There were others who were more inclined to agree with Winthrop Hackett that the proposed Constitution created a collision waiting to happen : ' either responsible government will kill federation , or federation ... will kill responsible government .

{"text": "Yet that is essentially the position that Kerr and Barwick took up in 1975 and thereafter .In the statement that the Governor - General issued to explain his reasons for dismissing the Whitlam Government , Kerr asserted that : .The position in Australia is quite different from the position in the United Kingdom .Here the confidence of both Houses on supply is necessary to ensure its provision .In the United Kingdom the confidence of the House of Commons alone is necessary .But both here and in the United Kingdom the duty of the Prime Minister is the same in a most important respect - if he can not get supply he must resign or advise an election .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

'It is unclear precisely how , or how precisely , Kerr intended to use the word ' confidence .
