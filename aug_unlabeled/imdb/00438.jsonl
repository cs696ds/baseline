{"text": "Product Description .Amazon.ca .The cinematography by N\u00e9stor Almendros garnered him an Oscar nomination .Unfortunately , the performance by then child star Brooke Shields garnered her a nomination , too -- for a Razzie Award .She won , he did n't .This 1980 remake of a much classier , 1949 British version features Shields and Christopher Atkins as children shipwrecked on a lush tropical island .They grow to maturity and fall in love , with the script paying special attention to their burgeoning sexuality .Should you desire more trite dialogue , there is an even less satisfying sequel , 1991 's Return to the Blue Lagoon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .I had seen this movie in theater on its day of release .June 20 1980 .In matter of fact at the very first showing .I was then a month away from 14 .And like every boy my age i was captivated by this young teen beauty .Still as captivating today as it was then .To say this film is beautifully filmed is a massive understatement .And the DvD only heightens the exsperiance .I still wish they would release the original i believe from the 1940s .It is said that this is somewhat based on a true story of 2 children a boy and a girl who become stranded on a island .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When they hit teenage years they fall in love .There was much scandel about this being their age .But what these so called critics failed to mention in all that hoopla is that they grew up on the island .And did n't know how to deal with things such as puberty & sex .So they depended on their God given instincts .The movie is well acted by both Brooke and Christopher .And is a 1980s must if you are a collector of 80s movies .And the scene of Brooke 's Midnight Hour Swim in the Moonlight is erotic and i remember just heightened how much i was into her back in 1980 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Pure Fantasy at its finest .As Brooke swims laser lights dance with her in the water .Now that is what you call Paradise a Oasis .And listen to Brooke 's commentary for more secrets about that ever CLASSIC scene .They are involved with the extras .The \" Original Featurette \" is in very pitiful terrible shape .And worse yet when it plays it stays on the \" title \" fuction so you ca n't even check into the running time of the featurette .Read more ' .1 of 1 people found this helpful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes No Sending feedback ... .The film was dissected by most critics , but I have always enjoyed it .The stars ; Christopher Atkins and Brooke Shields shine in their youthful beauty and performances .The movie was banned in Oslo when it opened in 1980 , but it played to full houses in the provinces .The docu on this DVD is good , but the sound is not on par with the movie .I think the critics at the time was embaressed by its sensual frankness and therefor tried to \" kill it \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "1 of 1 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I saw this movie several years ago when I was a lot younger .I remember I liked it quite a bit but was sad in the end when I thought they had eaten the poisonous berries and died .Now I guess according to some reviewers they were not really dead ?--Well I hope that 's the case but I guess it really does n't matter either way .Brooke Shields is absolutely beautiful in this movie and does a wonderful job in this role played opposite Christopher Atkins ( who is not too bad himself . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Since they had n't learned much about sexuality prior to their being stranded there they have to discover it for themselves .And before too much longer there is a baby ! ---Much to their surprise !The neat thing about the movie besides the beatiful Brooke and the beautiful secenery is that it is about the innocence of two young children and how they have to make it on their own on a deserted island .We get to see some of the things they go through ( some of their \" growing up \" ) .It makes for an intersting movie that is somewhat stimulating if I may say so .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Everyone should see it at least once .I have just ordered a copy so I can watch it again .And again ... and again .....You really should see this one for yourself .In this remake of the 1949 movie drama .Ms .Brooke Shields and Mr .Christopher Atkins play two teens .Who are marooned on a South Sea isle .Who are trying to cope with their repressed sexual disires and their navie'outlook on life .When Ms .Shields almost dies from a bite from a rockfish .Mr .Atkins takes her to a alter , used by some canibals for their evil rituals and pleads with the lord to save his cousin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Shields recovers from the bite and it is n't long .Before the pair are swimming nude and making out in a quiet , little cove with unrequited joy .There is no real plot here and the acting is none exsistent .The main attraction of \" Blue Lagoon \" is Mr .Kleiser 's filming of the lush , tropical surroundings of Fiji and the rapport between Ms .Shields and Mr .Atkins .Hence . \"The Blue Lagoon\"is good .if you want to see Ms .Shields ' character making love to Mr .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
