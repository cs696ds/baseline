{"text": "NO REVIEWS AVAILABLE .Kind of Uneven .I 'm mainly concerned with countering the ridiculous praise heaped by Drew Barrymore on the Essentials , over Peter Sellers .Saying he was unmatched at physical comedy is totally false .Buster Keaton , Laurel and Hardy , the Marx Brothers , Charlie Chaplin , and more recently Dick Van Dyke , were all greater and more complete masters of slapstick than he .There .the pink panther .The other day I was watching TCM , where between movies , a short mention of up coming movies came on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In a split second , I got more of a laugh , than some so called comedians could give you in a half hour or more .This is the genius of Peter Sellers .Like Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton or Laurel Hardy he could do so much with so little in the way of props and gags .Just the turning of a head or a simple thing , like a pen or a chair or bottle of aspirins .No longer in the Pink .Peter Sellers is fantastic , he gets to do what he does best , bury himself in an odd persona that he somehow turns into a living , breathing comedic creation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But the plot is hokey , the movie is long .The scenes with Niven and Wagner dull .Many of the comedic sequences that were viewed in the 60 's as sort of trendy and hip , just seemed a few decades later tiresome .I grew up in the 60 's so I know what a hit this film was .But even in the 60 's it was viewed as a good comedy not a comedy classic .I showed it to several friends 10 years ago , along with Shot in the Dark and their reaction was .... good music , good Sellers , and yawn .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Robert Wagner is Robert Wagner ... a second rate William Holden .In the end the movie has its charms , and is not just a nostalgia piece but it is simply not a great comedy and has not aged all that well .However , the music , the animation , and Sellers are truly memorable .For those handful of people who have never seen the Pink Panther watch and enjoy , but do not expect too much .The Pink Panther .One of the most enduring comedic franchises in cinema history .A inept Inspector pursues a jewel theif after the rare \" Pink Panther \" diamond .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Mancini 's iconic , Oscar - nominated score add the the overall greatness of this hillarious film .Director Edwards reached immortality with this amazing comedy .I give it a 5/5 .The title says it All . an upper without uppers ! feeling blue ? are you down and feeling low ?well , have i got the solution for you ! watch this movie and i GUARANTEE you wo n't be low , blue or down for very long .one of the funniest ever ! in fact , do n't leave home without it ! a true perfect ' 10 ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is one of my All - Time Favorite Peter Sellers Movies and I think is the best one of the entire Pink Panther Series of Movies .I have had this Movie on DVD for quite a few Years now .I got it for Christmas back in 1998 I believe .I first saw this Movie on Turner Classic Movies , and when I finished Watching it on TCM , I just knew that I had to have this Movie .If I gave it a Star Rating , I would give it 4 Stars out of 4 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am also a BIG Fan of Peter Sellers , of course Turner Classic Movies and MGM .The Music Score is the Best out there thanks to the wonderful Music composer Henry Mancini .Peter Sellers is absolutely hilarious in this Movie .David Niven was perfect for this Movie .The Director made this Movie very well .The Title Sequence is also magnificent .I have the Original Score on a old 33 1/3 RPM record which is still in good condition .I would certainly recommend this Movie to anyone who loves Comedies , The Pink Panther , Peter Sellers , and MGM .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
