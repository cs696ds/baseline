{"text": "The ABC series went back to the fourth position below Days of our Lives and lost the most viewers for the ratings week with -103,000 .Days of our Lives did not fare that much better losing another -76,000 but moving past GH ever so slightly .The Young and the Restless also lost viewers yet again , with a loss of - 64,000 viewers .Of course , it remains without peer in first place .You can view the entire ratings courtesy of Soap Opera Network here !So why do you think B&B showed gains , but the other soaps did not ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Crystal Chappell had her first airdate on Bold and the Beautiful !The numbers do not lie .Days of our Lives made a very big mistake letting go of the uber - talented actress .Cheers to the best actress in daytime ! ! !Viva Chappell ! ! !I have watched Y&R since 1973 when the show began .I followed it religiously for decades .The writing for it has been horrific for several years but I still watched .About two weeks ago ( when the Victor / Sharon romance reared its ugly head and we learned that Eileen Davidson was being released ) , I reached my breaking point and have completely given up on it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I ca n't fathom how the current Y&R remains the most watched soap .Yes , it appears to trending slowly downward with its ratings but it is always the most watched show !I 'm not sure what all of this means : ( 1 ) the ratings are not accurate ; ( 2 ) Y&R has fans who are more loyal than this 35 - 40 year viewer ; or ( 3 ) the entire slat of soaps in serious trouble .I have always been a CBS soap watcher ( with B&B being my least favorite and the one that I easily skipped ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Having watched both of these shows slowly slip into their graves , I refuse to watch this ( unfortunately ) familiar scenario now play out with Y&R and have simply turned the show off .I 'm not replacing it with another show .Sadly , this 40 year viewer of daytime serials has simply given up on the entire genre .Frankly , I do n't completely blame the networks for the situation .We repeatedly hear about producers and writers who have worked on numerous shows to the point of cancellation quickly get new jobs doing the SAME thing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Mere months after OLTL is gone , she is now employed by General Hospital !Frankly , I think the woman 's alleged writing skills should limited to putting the lunch specials on the diner chalkboard before she begins her waitress shift ) .The writing seems old and stale when it is not simply bad .I think a lot of this is due to the veteran writers / producers being creatively burned out .In sum , many of these soaps ( I might not include OLTL ) seem to have imploded rather than having been poorly treated by the networks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It keeps me up to date .Thank you to the people who run it ! !I certainly will continue to visit it in some effort to keep up with things .However , it will take a HELL of a lot to make me a regular viewer of any of them again .After suffering through the cancellations of two of \" my \" shows and five years of godawful writing on Y&R , this viewer 's patience has competely run out !And they need to clean house too many actors and boring stories no one to root for .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I thought starting 2012 off I would go back to my CBS soaps because in the end ( their is so much wrong with Y&R )I do n't want my beloved CBS 's daytime soaps cancelled .I know it 's sort of chic to bash Y&R right now ( rightfully so in many instances ) someone rather coming from CBS or Sony since I returned viewing I have seen some settle changes in direction .CBS 's soaps are still based in a more \" realistic \" story telling then the other networks regardless how people view CBS the proof is in the ratings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I will regardless of hating some stories ...EX : Vicron ...UGH !Victor was becoming a cartoon villain and the episode of Cassie 's death when the Newmans set aside their grievances and had a family moment ... is my type of Y&R.I have been a daytime viewer many years and I think today 's soap writers think it always about \" shock value \" syndrome and forgotten how to write emotional driven scenes and playing the beats of characters which is why I fall in love with soaps .I personally think soaps need to slow down the pace to hit the beats instead speeding up the pace ... it loses something in translation of story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not saying it should go back to kitchen table episodic pace but remember to play all the beats of a story .I have watched this episode 3 times ( I know I 'm a sucker ! ) and cried each time .When Brad Bell showing his mastery from growing up with the master of himself Bill Bell .This is such a Bill Bell storyline it makes me proud to be a soap fan .Sorry for being so long just wanted to voice my view of why CBS is still on top .GH has been awesome lately !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maybe pushing Heather a bit too much its been a long time since the charactor was on and prob a lot of folks do n't know history .I 'm personally not a fan of the Kate story , OLTL did split personalities to death and do n't need to see it on GH .Some of the storylines are seeming to just pop up out of nowhere like the Molly TJ romance , he was almost making fun of her & out of nowhere they are kissing & sneaking around ?Would love to see a Luke / Anna hookup .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "GH is MUST SEE every day !I was n't too crazy about a DID story but Kate is knocking it out of the park .I used to not even like the recast & now I do .We do n't need to waste airtime on TJ / Molly but summer is coming & that 's what soaps do in the summer .Luke & Anna are super hot but I sure love Luke & Spanky !I do n't know how they are gon na save the character of Johnny - having him commit 3 MURDERS !I am shocked .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That Weekend at Bernie 's thing w / Luke & Tracy was too hilarious !Glad to see GH is showing balance with some funny thrown in .Love it .Alexis looked gorgeous yesterday but I worry that the new Kristina looks too old to be Alexis & Sonny 's daughter .Who the heck are they gon na pair her up with ?Except for the rise of B&B from Chappell , the decline in all of the other soaps is more likely related to the time of year and nothing to get too excited about .This would be much clearer if the ratings data were graphed from week to week and compared to graphs of the previous year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Personally , I would n't panic just yet !You have to remember that this is a busy time especially for that demographic .Proms , final exams , weddings , Memorial Day weekend , etc .Things will be rocky over the summer , and then settle back down the closer we get the the autumn .I just hope ABC wo n't try to use the lower summer ratings to justify dumping General Hospital .It 's been at it 's very best , and there is a lot to look forward to .I 've been really trying to watch again , but GH is still not keeping my interest enough to tune in everyday .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Scorpios , The Q 's , The Spencers , and I 'll throw in The Jones ' .I 'm totally bored by the whole Mob thing , and the Sonny / Kate thing .The infusion of OLTL characters is ok , but not at the expense of airtime for the characters I tuned back in for .Who would you rather watch ?Anna kickin ' ass as the new police commish or Starr ?Let 's get real .I was excited that the writers want to give Anna the job as police commisioner .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now let 's see more of what she does best and hopefully that will include story with Mac , Felicia , Luke , Tracy and ( you know what I 'm gon na say ! ) a Robert Scorpio return ( hopefully to rescue Robin ! )I also read that other Vets might be coming back .I hope so .Maybe Frisco ?I wanted to add that I do like Spinelli and Diane too ... even though they do n't fit into my category above .They add texture and heart to the show .Just trying to put in my two cents in case it helps .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It ca n't be easy .I wish them luck .I 'd be sad to see GH go away .Because I watch only GH , I ca n't comment on the other soaps .However , I do have mixed feelings about GH right now .I like a number of changes and stories ; however , in spite of faster and better pacing , I still find that some stories are lasting beyond their best - before date .GH had the biggest decline in numbers for the week in question ... and perhaps this might be because the two most - prominently featured stories had simply dragged on too long .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As well , I find that GH continues to struggle with poor balance in character use , screen time and story - telling details .For some stories , every beat is played ( and sometimes OVERPLAYED ) whereas , in some other stories , a single line of dialogue is all that is given for an essential plot point or element of character development .This unevenness can lead viewers to tire of some overplayed stories ... and to lose interest in under - developed stories because they miss key elements .And , while episode counts can indicate that a number of characters have screen time , the length and quality of that screen time is often very uneven .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , I \" get \" that all shows have \" lead \" ; however , perhaps a number of viewers would prefer to see rotating leads .Just a thought !Woot !So happy Brad is giving her a chance to shine on his show and the fans another chance to see her on TV where she 's been missed .Days did n't deserve the talent of CC .I miss GL so much , i watched Otalia clips all day yesterday .There will never be another story told quiet like that again .I hope to see more of Crystal on B&B and also her new daytime love interst Jo baby lol .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

Brooke / Ridge / Taylor again & again .Now all they have done is switched the characters to Steffy / Liam / Hope and regurgitated the same old plot .You can bet that within a short period of time after the \" shock value \" has worn off CC 's character will be relegated to the backburner .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
