{"text": "In King Kong and Tropic Thunder , he gave a reading that was much more an acting role and not so much his regular shtick .In his latest effort Bernie , Black takes the skills he has honed as an actor and the God - given talents as a comic , and delivers one of the best performances of his career .The film is structured in a faux documentary style , where a group of town folks give the audience information directly to the camera .Some of the biggest laughs come from this Greek Chorus of people and how they tell their little part of the tale .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This is the best performance Jack Black has ever done .He is actually playing an individual , a fully thought out and dimensional persona .There is none of the ' Hey look , I 'm Jack Black playing a wacky character ' but a person with depth and feeling .He gets to show off his singing abilities without all the Tenacious D silliness .He finds all the correct beats in playing both an effeminate male and an East Texas character .While taking on this role , Black never demeans the actual man .Shirley MacLaine is still a national treasure but is overshadowed by Jack Black time and again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are moments of vulnerability combined with moments of cruelty that paint a complex portrait .The weakest link of the trio of actor is Matthew McConaughey as Danny Buck Davidson .The performance feels more like a stunt than a role .While he does have down all the mannerisms of being a Texan down to a perfection , the role still feels like a vanity project and not a fully thought out acting job .The film is written by Skip Hollandsworth , the reporter behind the Texas Monthly article .He knows the material and crafts an unusual screenplay , full of colorful Texas people who seem to populate rural areas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is a very sympathetic offering .Richard Linklater , the man behind Dazed and Confused , Before Sunrise , School of Rock and Me and Orson Welles directs the film .He crafts a wonderful tale that could only happen in Texas , telling the story in almost documentary fashion while still crafting a compelling drama .We know the outcome but still follow the path the characters take .Bernie is a great little dark comedy that goes for some macabre elements on more than one occasion .The best part of the film is that it is true , because a story like this one would be hard to make up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Leave a Reply .Saturday , June 23 , 2007 .Certain people are outraged that Angelina Jolie is playing Marianne Pearl , , the wife of murdered journalist David Pearl .Marianne Pearl , you see , is Afro - Cuban on one side , and Dutch on the other .And therefore , since she is \" of color , \" only an actress of color should be allowed to play her .They have invoked the blackface performers of the 1800s and 1900s , as if Jolie is playing Stepin Fetchit or claiming to know nothin' about birthin ' babies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So far as I know , her story has nothing to do with her \" race , \" whatever that is .Her story is about how her husband , Daniel Pearl , was beheaded by fanatic Muslims in Pakistan .The argument is not , of course , whether Angelina Jolie looks like Marianne Pearl .She does n't , particularly .To my eye , Marianne Pearl looks a good deal like Minnie Driver .The argument is whether Angelina Jolie has the right to play Marianne Pearl .To me the outrage seems racist .It harks back to the old Southern attitude that any African ancestry at all made you a Negro .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Can anyone give me a convincing artistic or moral reason why only African - American people should be allowed to play characters with any visible percentage of African descent ?And if so , how far are you willing to take this ?Should Japanese actors be allowed to play Chinese characters , or vice versa ?Should only full - blood Native Americans be allowed to play full - blood Native Americans ?Exactly how much Native American blood entitles you to play Geronimo ?UPDATE : We just watched SELENA , the biopic of Selena Quintanilla - Perez , the Tejano singer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lopez , you see , is n't Mexican - American .She 's Puerto Rican .( She nailed the role . )28 Comments : .I think it 's a tough call , but clearly there 's a very wide gray area here .For example , would you feel comfortable with a Latino actor playing Nelson Mandela in a movie ?What about a Chinese actor ?Or a women dressed in drag ?Outrage over shifting ethnicity is nothing new , though .There was outrage when Vanessa Williams was cast as a Latina in the movie Shaft ( yeah ,", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One reason would be that there are n't that many leading parts for minorities in the first place , so to take the rare one that comes along and give it to someone who 's already got plenty of options I 'm sure would be frustrating .Of course , the movie might not have gotten made at all if it were n't for someone like Angelina Jolie helping to bring in the financing -- and that would complicate things .In this particular instance , the character is slightly more European than she is African , so it makes the question stickier .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I would like to point out that \" the old Southern attitude \" you describe was not just in the South but rather the entire country and many other countries for decades .This reminds me of the controversy in the late 80s / early 90s when Jonathan Pryce was due to play the role of a half - Asian / half - European character in Miss Saigon on Broadway ( a role he had originated on the London stage ) .When the actor 's union insisted that the role be recast with an Asian ( John Lone , I think -- as if the character was n't also half - European ) the producers said : You know what ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I 'm not talking about her Iroquois ancestry either .Down south , people who look like she and her father usually have African ancestry .I assume the same thing about Jimmy Carter and Bob Barr .( The practice of categorizing anyone with African ancestry as \" black \" got started in the North , incidentally .It 's called the One Drop Rule . )As a practical matter , character driven dramas do n't get made w/o stars , and there are n't any black women stars of Jolie 's caliber .You can make an argument for Hallie , but then Hallie 's mostly European in ancestry herself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I think Jolie has gotten to that point .As to the race issue , I think the whole talk about Chow Yung fat playing George Washington , or a Latino playing Nelson Mandela is exactly what these issues get blown out of proportion .It is ridiculous .It 's all about suspension of disbelief .Chow Yung Fat playing George Washington would talk far too many people out of the moment because it would n't make sense .There 's never been an American President that was n't white , so it simply would n't work , especially considering the time period .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Or should only mixed - race people play mixed - race people ?I do appreciate the sensitivity of the question .But I also think you have to acknowledge that this sort of movie is star driven .It 's not a question of the role going to some deserving , talented Black actress .It 's a question of this movie gets made because someone took the story to Angelina Jolie and she decided she wanted to play Marianne Pearl .I think any producer would have taken it to a relatively Caucasian - looking African - American actress ( e.g. Halle Berry ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
