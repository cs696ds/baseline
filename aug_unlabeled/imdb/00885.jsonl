{"text": "Friday the 13th 1980 R CC .Camp Crystal Lake has been shuttered for over 20 years due to several vicious and unsolved murders .The camp 's new owner and seven young counselors are readying the property for re - opening despite warnings of a \" death curse \" by local residents .The curse proves true on Friday the 13th as one by one each of the counselors is stalked by a violent killer .Top Customer Reviews .I was working in a cinema in 1980 when this film was first released , No one expected it to take a light and it opened in one of the complex 's smallest screens .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "From day one queues formed for this film and many wannabe punters were somewhat peeved for being turned away .Those who got in though experienced a genuinely scary horror film and it remains one of the best audience participation films that I have ever seen .Throughout the film , the suspense runs along and builds up to a crescendo prior to each slaying or to a false moment of fear .The ending , however is something else .Sure it ai n't exactly original but boy is it effective .I have never seen an audience scream so loudly and in total unison , and have some people visibly shaken and in tears sometimes afterwards ....", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Watch out too for a young Kevin Bacon as one of the teens in peril .The passage of time has seen it take its place in the pantheon of really scary horror films and deservedly so .If you have not yet seen this film , then give it a go .Enjoy and be prepared to be scared .6 Comments 74 of 87 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I 've already recorded my thoughts on the original Friday the 13th .I think it 's among the top two or three greatest slasher films ever made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This creates an aura of dread , as well as a nearly tangible feeling that these characters are pretty much doomed .I do n't waste too much time mincing words about such matters - to me , this is a great movie .Not just a great slasher film , but a great film , by ANY standards .And it continues to grow on me .By now , I 've seen it around 100 times , but I continue to like it better over time .One word of caution , though .They refer to it as ' uncut',as if this is a big deal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is n't .So do n't expect to get anything radically different than what you 've had in the past .In fact , the major difference - the death scene of Kevin Bacon - looked better BEFORE .Some things get cut for a reason .But the picture and sound quality are outstanding .The other special features are okay .But if you are satisfied with the version you have at present , there is no overwhelming reason to replace your old dvd with this one .A lot has been said about this being a graphically violent film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But I believe that it 's often what you DON'T see that most powerfully affects your imagination .And that 's where this movie really sets itself apart .The killer is hardly ever shown , up until the final twenty minutes , but their presense hovers ominously and continually over the entire movie .For example , you could consider the scene where the girl is brushing her teeth at the sink .Read more ' .11 Comments 56 of 66 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Before the Blair Witch was haunting the woods , before the werewolves of Dog Soldiers were stomping around in the dark , before countless other copy - cat wannabes , there was the menacing killer of Friday the 13th .To be sure , John Carpenter hit the nail on the head a few years prior with the classic Halloween , but Friday the 13th also opened audience 's eyes to a new breed of horror movie - the gory serial killing scream - fest .For those in the know , Jason does n't make an appearance until Part 2 , but his legacy is revealed in fine family fashion here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Needless to say , his mom is rather pissed and unforgiving , and Jason just might not be dead ... .The killings , for early 80 's , are quite inventive - an ax through the head , an arrow through the neck , and lots of fun at the archery range are just a few of the treats in store .Effects were good because the master Tom Savini was just getting his shoes muddy and honing his skills .Love it .Kevin Bacon , for those of you who were born under a rock , makes his screen debut here , rivaling Johnny Depp 's nasty demise in A Nightmare on Elm Street .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you did n't gasp or scream the first time you saw it , you 're lying .No horror fan should miss this .The sequels however , particularly after the 3rd one , can be thrown in the trash and burned .Ugh .4 Comments 54 of 64 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .There is so much more to this movie that anyone gives it credit for .When you mention Friday the 13th , many people either dismiss it for being \" just a slasher flick \" or a \" Halloween rip - off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When Carpenter 's equally classic Halloween generated top box office revenue in 1978 and 1979 , many eyebrows raised within the film industry .Among those were the brows of a few people in particular .Sean ( director ) Cunningham , Victor ( credited writer ) Miller , Ron ( unaccredited writer )Kurz , Steve ( producer ) Miner , and Georgetown ( independent film production company )Productions all wanted in on the profit made by the Halloween .The only sensible thing they could think of doing was to produce a similar product , which became Friday the 13th .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Instead of just having a walking masked madman on the loose , he and Victor came up with a story that is quite brilliant .Sure , certain scenes in Friday the 13th may have been taken from Halloween , but you can say the same thing about Halloween taking some scenes from Psycho .Friday the 13th , whether it was on purpose or not , utilized a couple of really good themes in their story telling , beyond the typical moral theme that everyone associates with these movies like sex leads to death .The first theme that Friday the 13th throws in your face is the idea of isolated mass hysteria .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
