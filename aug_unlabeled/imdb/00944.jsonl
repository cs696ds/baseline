{"text": "Special Offers and Product Promotions .Editorial Reviews .Product Description .History was made ... by these guys ?Zed ( Jack Black ) and Oh ( Michael Cera ) are cavemen who stumble out of the mountains into an epic journey of biblical proportions .One 's a bumbling hunter , the other 's a gentle gatherer ; together , they become unlikely participants in history 's most pivotal moments .Directed and co - written by comedy legend Harold Ramis ( Groundhog Day , Caddyshack , Analyze This ) , YEAR ONE is rude , crude , wildly absurd , deliciously tasteless and laugh - out - loud funny !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .I seem to find myself in the minority here , but I actually liked \" Year One \" .Having seen it in the theater , I thought it was a fairly fun and light - hearted experience all around .The humor is perhaps not as broad as some prefer - but myself , I sort of enjoyed the subtleties .These type of films usually benefit from a second or even third viewing if you give them a chance .In \" Year One \" , Jack Black plays his part adequately but seems to yield the majority of the spotlight to his on - screen cohort Michael Cera .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Cera 's comedic delivery is dry and spot - on for his character \" Oh \" and he plays the part with real charismatic charm .In short , it is Cera 's film , not Black's - and I would n't have had it any other way .When it comes down to it , Year One is just a harmless little diversionary film which does n't take itself too seriously and nor should you .I personally thought it had a lot of wit and charm .Perhaps it just did n't strike the majority of audiences in the same way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Surprisingly , this film looks amazing on Blu - Ray too - especially the city scenes .6 Comments 61 of 69 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .The first thing that all these 1 star reviews tells me , is that a large portion of our population has become mind - numb to the subtleties and nuances of comedic brilliance .Perhaps they just prefer loud HD boom - booms , realistic CGI bang - bangs , and pointless choppy action with overblown special effects ?Who knows ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The chemistry between the two is immediate and within minutes the movie has you smiling .After Black wreaks a little havoc and eats of the tree of knowledge , he is sent away from the village , Cera joining him somewhat relunctantly .After leaving , their village is raided and the village , including the love interests of the duo , are taken captive .But Year One is without a doubt a fantastic comedy .Jack Black and Michael Cera have a unique chemistry that works marvelously to deliver their lines with comedic brilliance that simply made this movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I mean could they not see that by looking at the cover with a clean shaven , doe eyed Cera cast as a caveman ?You want comedic depth , go watch \" Best in Show \" or \" Arrested Development \" .You want silly and mindless toilet humor , then watch this .I did n't go into this movie expecting an Oscar worthy movie or ground breaking performance , in fact nobody should .This movie is obviously intended for you to shut your brain down and let go for a couple of hours .I really enjoyed this movie and love Black in these type of roles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You get that this movie is going in a whole different direction from the on - set of the movie when the cavemen speak with current day dialogue .It 's right at that point where you 're either sticking with it or bailing because even the most novice move watcher knows that this is n't \" History of the World \" .If you like stuff from the Apatow troupe then this movie might be up your alley .If you do n't get the Apatow reference then you obviously wo n't get this movie .2 Comments 22 of 27 people found this helpful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes No Sending feedback ... .I 'm really surprised by the low ratings .I 'm definitely not a Jack Black fan ( never was ) but his performance here was pretty funny .Throw in actor Michael Cera , and you have yourself a pretty good film overall .Perhaps I 'm just happy with the fact that Jack Black maintains his normal character compared to his other comedy roles and blends it with Michael Cera 's typical character .I recall how hilarious Michael was in Arrested Development , and I believe his performance here is quite similar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The storyline itself ( along with the source of humor ) is extremely whacky , focusing on long long ago during the Biblical times ( hence the name of the film ) and basically making a mockery of the entire time period .I can see how some people would be offended I suppose , but for me , I 'm not the least bit offended .In fact , the storyline is so outrageous that it 's best to just treat the entire film as nothing more than a cheap comedy .That 's all it really is anyway .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
