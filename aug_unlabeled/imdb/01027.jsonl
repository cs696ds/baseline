{"text": "As part of the Westmoreland Park Master Plan , ' Roth explained , ' we 'll be removing the cement duck pond in 2012 .The area will be restored to form the original path of Crystal Springs Creek , and provide surrounding natural wetlands .This will provide a better habitat for fish , and improved habitat for our wild ducks and geese . 'Bob Sallinger , Conservation Director with Audubon Society of Portland said the existing duck pond - and the feeding of birds human food by well - intended people - causes health problems for ducks and geese .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What we see in this park is pretty typical for urban parks - as many as 400 ducks and geese in a very small area .They do n't do very well under those circumstances . 'Sallinger pointed out the problem is n't with wild ducks and geese . 'They come and go as they please .But , about a third of the ducks and geese at this pond are domestic animals !These were cute little ducklings and goslings people got for their kids - but they grew up to be messy , loud , and a pain in the neck to take care of .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The fact is , this kind of waterfowl does very poorly on their own .Domestics were bred to be eaten , not to fly . 'In fact , it 's illegal to ' dump off ' any animal or bird in any Portland city park , Sallinger added .A duck floated by with an oddly upturned wing during the conversation .That 's called ' angel - wing ' .The weight of the wing causes it to flip up and over .This condition is permanent ; this bird ca n't fly , and will have a hard time escaping predators .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On roundup day the plan was use temporary fencing to funnel the waterfowl into a large box trap .Any native ducks and geese would be released , but domestic waterfowl would be captured , examined , and then transported to pre - selected permanent homes where they can live out their lives .Roth concluded our advance briefing with , ' The longer - term vision is to provide a place here where native ducks and geese visit , breed , and forage in more natural numbers . 'Arrival of waterfowl roundup day .As the quiet darkness of the fall - like morning gives way to the hustle and bustle of another work day , staff and volunteers silently stand around the perimeter of the capture area .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Again and again , the duck wranglers coax the city - wise fowl toward the fence - and hopefully , into the trap box .But , after eating their fill , the target birds take off , quacking loudly - sounding sort of like a raucous , snide laugh - heading back into the pond , far from their potential captors reach .Sallinger comments , ' This is typical behavior .We 'll be patient . 'As the sun turns the sky from deep purple to a golden hue , neighbor Bill Courogen watches the activity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They 're known as African geese .For the last ten years , we 've brought duck food for them .They 'll eat it right out of my hand .They know my car ; as soon as they hear my car , they come running right up . 'Courogen 's gaggle of geese - Sallinger calls them the ' Gang of Eight ' - swim aloofly , and watch the other waterfowl squabble over the food .One year , I think they had five youngsters , ' Courogen said . 'Generally , they have not reproduced well here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'll miss them , but having an estuary here will probably help . 'After a long look , the ' Gang of Eight ' come close , boss the other birds around , and then leave in a flurry of flapping wings which sends the gathered ducks and geese back to the pond again .Kara Berglund - she lives across the street from the duck pond - spends a few minutes watching the activity before getting ready for work . 'I do n't mind that they 're rounding up the domestic ducks ; all the native species will remain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The pond is pretty ; it 's a nice feature of the park . 'At this point , it was birds 1 , captors 0 .Many of the reporters leave the scene , to report the day 's activity an apparent failure , but the workers doggedly keep coaxing the waterfowl up into the fence .And with the media gone , the target waterfowl actually start to be safely captured for the trip to their new homes .What really helped was when a neighbor , Sandy , came up , ' Sallinger says . 'This neighbor has looked out for the ducks through the years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All ducks and geese are examined by veterinarians at the park ; any native species are released .In total , 21 domestic ducks and 8 domestic geese were captured , ' Sallinger recounted to THE BEE afterward . 'Seven of the 21 ducks were found to have significant foot problems , a common ailment of non - flighted ducks that spend much of their lives walking around on cement surfaces .A couple of the ducks also had wing deformities , a result of malnutrition associated with being fed bread .These ducks will be treated at Audubon 's Wildlife Care Center until they can be transported to new homes .

{"text": "Asked if they the mission was a success , Sallinger commented , ' All those which were needed to be captured were captured .It was a success . 'The problem that remains , he added , is humans feeding birds and animals in parks .Nobody comes down here with a giant bag of bread because they want or harm ducks and geese , ' sighed Sallinger . 'But the fact is , they 're creating overpopulation problems .And , at the same time , they 're causing health problems .We want to get the word out that some of the things that we do , with the best intentions , are indeed , harmful .
