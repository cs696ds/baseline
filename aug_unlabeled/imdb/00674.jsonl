{"text": "Just who the [ frick ] is gon na be the villain in this movie ?Zod is already been used .... he would have been perfect .Too soon for Darkseid and Brainiac would look like MOS all over again ?Metallo is n't that big of a villain and Superman can take care of him by himself .Now that I think of it ... WB really jumped the shark by wasting Zod on MOS and should have left him for JL .And made Parasite the villain in MOS ... .Metallo could be one of this villains that was a good person forced into doing horrible things via Luthor 's manipulation with his intent being to kill Superman as a family member of his ( primarily his sister ) died and Superman failed to save her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , there 's Mercy but she 's a smaller , bodyguard villain .I honestly think they can have multiple villains working for Luthor .Like if Metallo fails that 's when Luthor calls in guys like Deathstroke and Deadshot for hire .Hell , they could even have a villain like Ra 's work with Luthor .Or they could simply focus on a Batman - Superman conflict with Luthor in the background setting things in motion .Hell , they could have Amazon .So many options .Personally , I want Luthor to win in this film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This man is one of the smartest being in the entire DCU and makes Superman / Batman look borderline retarded by comparison .If they truly wish to illustrate that and have some balls that Marvel has yet to do in this specific area , have the damn villain win for once .Bizarro would n't be Zod 2.0 .Completely different for [ frick ] 's sake .I saw a YouTube video giving a great explanation on Bizarro being used as more of a means to develop Superman and see him become the hero we all know and love , not using a villain of the month tactic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of those moments where Superman and Batman think they have won then is slowly dawns on them and as we hear them talk as they realize their defeat we can see a smug Luthor doing whatever as apart of his plan all along .Be happy she s showing up at all , if they pull her off right in this and get positive buzz from her appearance then her own movie will follow .This is the only chance WB would EVER let her own movie happen , any other is just [ frick]ing fairy tales .I 'm still not happy about how poorly they got down Superman 's character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I swear they were simply trying to make Batman but a nicer guy and with powers in a suit .Awesome !Sounds like he is doing his damndest to do it justice .And , I definitely hope that translates to no pants .If I see the that horrible costume that BlackJack posted one mo ' mothaphuckin ' time , I 'm going to lose my mind .That is not Wonder Woman ; it 's Xena in Wonder Woman 's color scheme .IF he decides to go the \" battle skirt \" route , I certainly hope he does better than that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
