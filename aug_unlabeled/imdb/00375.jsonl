{"text": "I watch the Hallmark Movie Channel a lot less since they removed the daytime mysteries .The mystery movies they do show are on in the middle of the night .Except for the original Perry Mason series , the other mysteries are the same ones over and over .Also , it is very annoying when credits are not shown at the end of the show , particularly since those advertisements are of no interest to me whatsoever .Hallmark should take a lesson from MeTV .Loud and distracting music .Please stop loud and distracting music during the movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I can no longer watch the Halmark channel .I will check in from time to time to see if there have been any changes .loud background music .Ca n't Hear Speech ; Music Too Loud .I was hoping that it would be fixed by last night 's Cedar Cove episode , but it was n't .It was slightly better than last weekend , but not fixed !What is going on ? ? ?Music during the entire movie .I love the movies on the Hallmark Channel .Yesterday you had a marathon of McBride 's movies on from afternoon through evening and all night .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is the same problem with Cedar Cove .However , as with the other complaints of people , I ca n't STAND the constant music throughout all the movies .Please , take the music off ... whether it 's loud or not I do n't like it nor do I see the need for it .I noticed it must be John Larroquette 's son 's orchestra so he must be proud of him , but please , just leave the music out .The music is lovely and I 'm sure there is a time and place for it but NOT during the entire movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The noise or otherwise \" music \" is distracting , senseless , and totally irritating .We like the movies , but along with the countless number of commercials , and same LOUD tinkling music on all your movies , we are jut wasting our time .It 's hard to concentrate and keep up with the plot .Originally , music was added to movies to denote happy , sad , or dangerous actions .Who ever chooses the background music must never listen to what they are using . . .Your program schedule changes at your will , After awhile the Waltons , Little House , becomes so BOOOOOOring .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps your sponsors will listen .W. L. Mitchell .LOUD BACKGROUND MUSIC .I used to love watching the Hallmark movies .Now I turn them off after 15 minutes if their loud music persists .You ca n't even hear what the people are saying .And the music is continous .I think they have the same record that plays in every movie .It is annoying \" bing - bong \" music that is so loud .If I ca n't hear what the people are saying , I might as well not watch it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only time would be if there was a special moment and even then it was not louder than the speaking .And if I ca n't hear the movie , I get on IMDB and I just give it a 1 rating because the movie is totally ruined for me .Ca n't even watch it .Does n't Hallmark see this ?Do n't they sit down and review the movie before it is released ?When a person gives a lecture , there is no music in the background .Now Hallmark has concerts , not movies ! christmas movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Loud Music .I can tell you do n't care about what people think about your lousy music .Or you would have rectified it by now .So the best way folks is to boycott products advertised on Hallmark and drop a note to the manufacture tell them why you are boycotting there product .loud music during entire movie .PLEASE stop ruining every Hallmark movie you make with that horribly loud music .It used to be music was played mostly when people were n't talking , but now the music is almost constant through the entire movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I even tried to turn it up but it did n't help , I still could n't understand the dialogue .I do n't understand how no one that makes these movies can see how distracting , annoying and very disappointing this is to your viewers .I have always loved Hallmark movies , especially Christmas ones , but now I ca n't stand to watch any of them .This is truly sad .Music is one thing but to have it so loud you ca n't hear the dialogue is so very sad .I miss these movies , My family and friends all feel the same way and decided to stop watching them because they ca n't hear the dialogue .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And , why does it have to play almost the entire movie ?The music is NOT as important as the story of the movie .PLEASE fix this problem or you 'll be losing more viewers .Loud background noise during Hallmark channel movies .I notice a number of viewers have complained about loud music on Hallmark channel movies .My complaint is similar ... but rather than music , it is a continual rushing or whirring sound that really detracts from the movie .It is most prevalent in indoor scenes , which leads me to believe it may have something to do with noise from the cameras or perhaps from some kind of production machinery like a fan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Music Too LOUD LOUD LOUD ! ! !Looking at all the previous complaints about the audio quality on the Hallmark channel , I have doubts anyone in programming reads this page or even cares .but I 'll try anyway .As I writ it is Dec 7 2013 at 8:20 pm .We attempted to watch the new show Santa Switch , but gave up trying after 15 minutes because , as usual for Hallmark , the stupid \" background \" music was TOO DAMN LOUD ! ! !Apparently this network is run by clueless empty suits that spend their days looking at ratings wondering why their audiences dissapear so soon after a show begins .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
