{"text": "For many decades in American cinema , the function of the opening credits was to simply acknowledge the efforts of the various filmmakers who were involved in the film that the viewer was about to see .Throughout that time , creativity would occasionally poke its head out - usually by means of clever stop - motion animation or other visual enhancements .But seldom did the opening credits of the film involve themselves in the actual telling of the story .By the mid-1950s , that had changed with the efforts of credits designer Saul Bass .In a similar fashion , the James Bond films of the last fifty years have relied upon artistic and compelling title sequences to set the tone for the film that would follow .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thanks , in large part , should go to Maurice Binder .Born in New York City in 1925 , Binder studied art for a short period of time before working in advertising and eventually heading the ad department of Macy 's Department Store .From there , he moved into films in the 1950 's , first for Universal Studios and then Columbia Pictures .Bond producers had seen a title sequence that Binder had designed for director Stanley Donen 's The Grass is Greener in 1960 and they liked what they saw .Rushing to a meeting with the producers , Binder spent all of twenty minutes to storyboard an opening sequence that would feature animated white dots ( actually price stickers ) against a black background , revealing a walking James Bond viewed through a gun barrel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The unique introduction grabbed the Bond producers ' attentions and they knew Binder was their man .Maurice Binder would design the opening sequences for the first sixteen Bond films , excepting From Russia With Love and Goldfinger , which were designed by American graphic designer Robert Brownjohn .Right from the start - Dr. No - Binder 's titles were bold , with animated colored dots and squares resembling bold flashing lights , as Monty Norman 's James Bond theme blared underneath .The artist also introduced his first images of moving human silhouettes , which would quickly become synonymous with his 007 film work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He expanded on the idea for Goldfinger - this time , projecting actual scenes from the film ( and From Russia With Love , as well ) onto the bikini - clad body of a lovely lady - who just happened to be painted from head to toe in gold .In Thunderball , Binder returned and embraced the underwater motif of the film , warping titles into waves and showing silhouettes of damsels in distress swimming away from spear gun - toting scuba divers , all amid colorful and billowing clouds of air bubbles .For You Only Live Twice , Binder created a montage of boiling volcano lava , neon - bright Japanese umbrellas , and silhouettes of nude Oriental women - a first for the Bond franchise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With Roger Moore taking on the iconic role in Live and Let Die , Maurice Binder 's titles opened with blazing fire , along with a buxom and clearly nude black woman facing the camera .Another 's flaming head popped her eyes wide open before a jump cut turned it into a grinning skull , focusing on the film 's voodoo and blaxploitation themes .More nude women , with strategically - placed items to cover their \" naughty bits , \" closed out the sequence .The Spy Who Loved Me introduced the actual image of Roger Moore as Bond into the sequence , finally including 007 in the frolicking fun .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When Maurice Binder passed away in 1991 at age 66 , artist and music video director Daniel Kleinman took over .His Bond - based production of Gladys Knight 's Licence to Kill performance convinced 007 producers that Kleinman was capable of keeping the look and feel of the iconic title sequences that Binder had pioneered .Kleinman knew the openings needed to be exciting , sexy , as well as tease the upcoming story of the film .GoldenEye - his first sequence and Pierce Brosnan 's first turn as 007 - stayed close to Binder 's template , while becoming more three - dimensional .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His opening also presented the fall of Communism , as icons of Lenin , as well as the hammer and sickle , were broken apart .Brosnan 's remaining three films saw Kleinman 's titles continue to evolve , moving somewhat away from the Binder formula , with repetitive images and bringing computer - generated graphics into play .Animated images fought on - screen , often exploding into geometric shapes in defeat .Kleinman had finally left Binder 's legacy behind and established his own trademark look for 007 film openings .And , as quickly as Daniel Kleinman had established his own distinctive style for the 007 titles , they wound up in the hands of MK12 for Quantum of Solace , the next Bond pic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A group of design and production creatives based in Kansas City , MK12 opened their titles with Daniel Craig sending an artistically - enhanced bullet soaring over an arid desert , as nude female forms became subtle parts of the landscape .Kleinman returned for the latest 007 film , Skyfall .An enormous hand pulled Bond 's lifeless body underwater into a spinning mass of silt .He continued to fall among paper shooting targets of his own image , then a hailstorm of Walther PPKs and daggers fell as the camera moved quickly through a graveyard .Hopefully , Binder and Brownjohn were looking down from somewhere in approval .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Guaranteed to be a hot topic of conversation around the water cooler , but remember - this is not a competition so , please , no wagering .George Lazenby .Not necessarily for the reason you may think .At only one appearance as 007 , he hardly had the chance to develop any sense of character or continuity .Of course , his limited acting skills certainly factor in , as well .Roger Moore .Although he gains points for longevity , he loses even more for his lack of chest hair .Not just by his own doing , Moore took a dark and thrilling character and , in terms of sincerity , left him just short of Shemp Howard .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
