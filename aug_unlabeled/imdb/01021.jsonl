{"text": "A crushing blow !Thanks for reading - feel free to comment .Comments .One of Guy Ritchie 's best directions .Generally speaking , in the film world , Guy Ritchie is more of a genre than a director .His films all seem to follow suit .Most involve copious levels of violence , classic gangster crime , and Vinnie Jones .He never makes a feminine film .In fact , he 's about as masculine as directors come .His 2000 film Snatch .( to give it its correct punctuation ) certainly followed this trend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The only actor I was slightly disappointed with was Brad Pitt .Though his performance was good his accent really was n't .I understand that the \" pikey \" ( Ritchie 's word not mine ) accent is supposed to be a mix of irish and english but Pitt seemed to have gone for saying words as quickly ass possible in a poor irish accent .There are a few other downsides to the film .Firstly , there are no characters to whom you have an emotional tie .To put it simply , I did n't care who died or why .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In truth it probably is n't the most original of films either .The film is rated 18 and with good reason .There is a lot of violence and strong language that would n't be suitable for young viewers or for the easily offended .The extras on the dvd are ; A making of featurette Directors Commentary B roll Deleted Scenes Phtot Library TV Spots Soundbites Trailers Storyboard Production Notes Apparently there are also hidden extras but I 've not bothered to look so ca n't say what these are .Of the extras I 've only watched th Making Of feature and though it is n't anything special it is interesting enough to warrant a look .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "On the making of Snatch there was a similar hope building that we would be seeing an acknowledgement of a revival of respect for the British Film Industry , especially considering the cast of Hollywood stars who were present .As with spectacular first albums , the temptation to upgrade a signature style but with a safe and successful formula is understandable .Whilst the gritty wit and lo - fi charm of Lock Stock made it feel as Cockney as a grimy Underground station , Snatch always feels like a Hollywood remake .It is \" Apples and Pears \" and \" London Bridge \" , an awkward American view of the biggest city on this little island .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film itself was enjoyable and engaging enough the first time I saw it , back in 2002 , but having settled into my Twenties now the dialogue seems forced and stylistic , and the whole plot slow and staged .Between the original watch and now films like Usual Suspects and Oceans Eleven have shown me more comfortable , gripping and interesting examples of this comedy / crime / heist genre I 'm sorry to say .Comments .A brilliant film in every way !This film is as British as they come !With a solid cast including Jason Statham , Vinnie Jones and the one and only Brad Pitt , it follows the inter - twining stories of gangsters , pawnbrokers and pikeys !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Its whitty storyline and idiot side characters make it and hillarious trip of mishap and unlucky encounters .The plot of the film takes a winding viewpoint and you never really know as a watcher what will happen in the end until its happened .As always with guy ritchie films there is a brilliant soundtrack which perfectly compliments all the strange goings on and dealings within the film .In my eyes a true classic that would be a disaster to miss .\" You should never underestimate the predictability of stupidity \" ! !Comments .The formula still works .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Richie 's films have a gangster feel to them and are matey in a way few of us can relate to but he has a formula with this and its predecessor which really work and make for an exciting , funny and thorougly charming film .This is the follow up to the highly acclaimed Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and continues in the realm of shady characters and double dealing .Its a caper , a cockney crime caper and covers similar ground to Lock Stock but with a higher profile cast and a bit more creativity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
