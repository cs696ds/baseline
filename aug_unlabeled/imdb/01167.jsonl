{"text": "Toby Jones ( left ) and Philip Seymour Hoffman ( right ) as Truman Capote .Source : Guardian.co.uk .A recent revisiting of Truman Capote 's In Cold Blood sparked some interest in the two films about him that were released in quick succession in 2005 and 2006 - Bennett Miller 's Capote and Douglas McGrath 's Infamous .Being the first released , Capote stole most of the limelight , especially as Philip Seymour Hoffman 's portrayal of Capote won him an Oscar for Best Actor ( not to mention the Golden Globes , BAFTAs and SAGs ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On the other hand , Toby Jones , who played Capote in Infamous , won high praise for his performance too , and physically he was closer to the real life counterpart .Sandra Bullock 's portrayal as Harper Lee was also praised , but did not receive the same recognition as Keener .Infamous also had an arguably better cast , featuring stars such as Jeff Daniels , Daniel Craig , Sigourney Weaver , Hope Davis , and a cameo from Gwyneth Paltrow .But despite all of this , and the fact that most critics thought the film was pretty good too , Infamous could not avoid being compared to the earlier film , which they almost unanimously agreed was superior .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Capote was based on the biography by Gerald Clarke , whereas Infamous was based on the book by George Plimpton .Nevertheless , the story is essentially the same - Truman Capote is fascinated by a 300-word article about a family that was brutally gunned down in the small town of Holcomb , and decides to travel there to write an article .He brings his good friend Harper Lee with him , and after a lengthy investigation , decides to turn that article into the \" first \" non - fiction novel ( ie a non - fiction book written with fictional techniques ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Capote befriends both men , and is particularly drawn to the sensitive and artistic Perry .Despite becoming extremely close with the men over several years , Capote knows that the book 's ending can only be effective if they are ultimately executed for their crime .Both films were good , but in different ways .Capote is a classy production with a classy performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman , who really brings out the genius and the narcissism in the titular character .It 's a slow burning film full of pain and contemplation , where the pauses are long but meaningful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Toby Jones is a more flamboyant , less subtle Capote who is portrayed as a shameless gossip with the high society women in New York .Jones also makes Capote seem like a prick , though Hoffman 's Capote is colder , more reserved but definitely more manipulative .As good as Jones was , the edge goes to Hoffman in my opinion .Catherine Keener and Sandra Bullock both make fairly good Harper Lees - but again , Keener is more subtle whereas Bullock is more in - your - face .Not to say that makes her a weaker Harper , just a different one , though this was probably attributable more to the script than the actresses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I found it interesting that both films focused almost entirely on Capote 's relationship with Perry , even though Dick also played a very large role in the book .Nevertheless , I thought Capote handled this crucial part of the story better than Infamous did .As for Infamous , I thought getting Daniel Craig to play Perry was a bizarre choice .He 's a very good actor , but having read the book , he does not exactly fit the bill ( Perry 's supposed to be very short and half American - Indian ) .I did n't fully buy into the relationship , which lacked the emotional power of the earlier film , even though it actually depicted a physical relationship between the two men .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Share this : .Like this : .I stumbled across your site and in particular , your well written and interesting take on these two films .Like you , I had similar feelings about them , from the supporting roles to choices in casting , and in my case I actually saw the films backwards - meaning I saw Capote first and Infamous second .This was due primarily because of Phillip Seymour Hoffman who truly is one of the finest actors working today .He made the leap from obscure , theater actor and director to art - film standout to feature - film star in quick succession and rightfully so .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Over all solid points and criticism through ; I agree Daniel Craig was an odd casting choice , and while Infamous is well done in the final assessment it is obvious Capote is a superior film .On that note , I 'd like to invite you over to my movie review blog if you 're interested .I 'm just beginning to look around your blog but I 'll be back !Completely disagree with this review , and I 'm prefacing this post by saying that I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman .But , I feel if both movies were released at the same time as they were scheduled to , Hoffman would not have won the Oscar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anyhow , Infamous humanizes the Truman in a way that Capote does n't .You only see one side of Truman when portrayed by Hoffman ... the serious brooding type .In Infamous you get to see why Truman is so flamboyant , why he craves the attention he does , what he 's running away from , not to mention the relationship he develops with Perry Smith , and his devastation at his loss .There is just a range to the man that makes Toby Jones ' portrayal more relatable and believable than Hoffman 's , and that s ultimately what people seek in a bio - pic , in my opinion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In 2001 Winterbottom and Eaton were developing a project about illegal immigrants but could n't decide on a starting point .Then the 9/11 attacks happened , and within a few weeks Winterbottom and the writer Tony Grisoni were wandering around a refugee camp in Peshawar , looking for young Afghan men willing to play a version of themselves and do the trip to London for real .( \" I thought it was going to be in English , \" David Thompson , one of the executive producers of the film that emerged from the trip , recalled .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The year 2003 marked the high point of Winterbottom 's acclaim .In February , barely a year after Winterbottom had touched down in Peshawar , In This World - the asylum film 's eventual title - was accepted to show at the Berlin International Film Festival , where it won three prizes , including the Golden Bear .When it was released in Britain , the critic Sukhdev Sandhu , who was born in 1970 , called it the best British film of his lifetime .Soon afterwards , Winterbottom appeared in a Guardian critics ' poll of the best directors currently practising .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Peter Bradshaw , the Guardian critic who wrote that citation , has been less impressed with the films he has made in the past decade .\" It 's all very good letting narrative and all those traditional things go hang , \" he said recently , \" but it does make for a rather miscellaneous experience in the cinema .Eaton identifies misunderstanding in both criticisms .To the idea that Winterbottom 's work since around Wonderland has been lax or slapdash : \" Do you have any idea how hard it is to make stuff as natural as that , to have that flow ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thompson offered a more matter - of - fact reflection .\" That 's just the way he works -he does these things in a white heat , \" said .\"He 's finished them before you realise he has shot them .It 's like writing a song .Some film - makers spend two years fiddling with a film .Michael would go crazy .And I do n't think the result would be any better . \"( Bradshaw conceded that \" part of his mojo is to keep moving - something we critics do n't understand \" . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A few days after I first interviewed Winterbottom , I went to the Revolution Films office in Clerkenwell , central London , to meet Melissa Parmenter , the composer who is now his regular producer ( Eaton serves as an executive producer ) .Parmenter has a fondness for rhyme : \" totes mahotes \" , \" okey - dokey \" , \" good plan , Stan \" .Instead of \" meltdown \" , she says \" granny panic \" .She described Michael Nyman 's music for Wonderland , not inaccurately , as \" an insane score - the best score ever \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Where Winterbottom can be evasive , perhaps defensive , Parmenter is open and unguarded .She seems clearer about who Winterbottom is than he is .She is also more outwardly passionate .During my talk with Winterbottom , he used the word \" love \" twice - about Nyman 's music and Robert Altman 's McCabe and Mrs Miller .Parmenter , by contrast , said she \" loves \" , among other things , The Killer Inside Me , Genova , \" the melancholy bits of The Trip to Italy \" , Nyman , and \" the fact that Michael does what he wants \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It gets a bit much sometimes .[ As Winterbottom told me , \" When you 're a director , everything that happens is kind of your fault . \"] Yet it was clear that his heart was n't really in it : both films were well on their way to becoming past obsessions .He 'd been up at 6.30 that morning , doing rewrites for a new project , Russ and Roger Go Beyond , a comedy starring Will Ferrell , about the making of Russ Meyer 's camp musical Beyond the Valley of the Dolls .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He reminded me that \" developing a film from scratch comes with a burden of effort \" .Still , it turned out that his heart was n't really in that one , either .Just before the end of the year , he quit .Someone muttered something about creative differences .Burdensome or not , it seems he prefers success - and failure - on his own terms : working under the Revolution banner with a small , familiar crew and room for improvisation with actors he calls friends .It is said he 's getting ready to shoot The Trip to Spain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
