{"text": "In fact , the entire interview was just completely light - hearted and jokey .There is no connection .That 's why there are so many contradictions in what Kojima and Kitase said .The FFVII history is already set .It is specifically stated that ShinRa had no interest in the planet 's energy until a few years before Crisis Core , so that in itself is enough to cancel out the entire ' theory ' .As for Jenova ...She had been travelling the universe and destroying planets for god - knows - how - long before she landed on Gaia .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
