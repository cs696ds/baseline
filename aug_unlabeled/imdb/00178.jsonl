{"text": "The subject matter of Nelson Algren 's novel was still shocking in 1955 , and The Man with the Golden Arm was released without the seal of approval from Hollywood 's Production Code .The director , Otto Preminger , used the controversy to whip up interest in the film , and his championing of non - Code pictures such as The Moon Is Blue and The Man with the Golden Arm helped end the influence of the restrictive policy .For Frank Sinatra , the role was a high point ; his performance is searching , honest , and ( in long scenes of going cold turkey to kick the habit ) frighteningly naked .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sinatra was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar , but lost to Ernest Borgnine -- the same guy who beat him senseless in From Here to Eternity .The propulsive jazz score is by Elmer Bernstein .Even the credits sequence staked out new territory : the mod images created by Saul Bass were among his first in a long - standing collaboration with Preminger , and were highly influential on other designers .--Robert Horton --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title .Top Customer Reviews .Cutting edge drama , dealing with drug addiction at the time of conservatism in post WWII Eisenhower America .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not as good as \" The Lost Weekend \" ( 1945 ) , which dealt with alcoholism , but this film holds it 's own , even after a half century .After winning an Oscar in 1953 for \" From here to Eternity \" , Sinatra began taking on bigger and juicier parts .Once a bit actor , trying to be taken seriously in Hollywood , this is arguably the Tour de Force performance of his career .Sinatra plays Frankie Machine , coming off a six month stint in rehab .He returns to his old haunts , trying to go straight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not bad for someone who never had any formal training as an actor .The cold turkey scene in the movie , was supposed to be filmed as a rehearsal .Director Otto Preminger , used that scene in the final cut of the movie .This film was not given a stamp of approval by the censors back in 1955 , but was made anyway .Director Preminger , always walked close to the edge in his film , a maverick film maker .His 1959 film \" Anatomy of a Murder \" , was the first film to use the word , \" panties \" , of all things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Special featurette , The story Behind the Man with the Golden Arm .Theatrical trailer .Highly recommended .This has got to be one of the best movies ever made which has depicted the heroin addict and his predicament .McGavin is a wonderful portrayal of the neighborhood supplier who keeps baiting Sinatra and baiting him until the he can not say no any longer .Coupled with his own domestic situation , which I dare not give away , but only to tell you that the ensemble cast which makes up this movie is outstanding .The soundtrack is pulsating and keeps your adrenaline moving upward , and that is one of the most unnerving parts of the film , and one which keeps you on the edge of your seat , as the saying goes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sinatra once said he thought he should 've gotten an Oscar for this movie , and I agree .Highly recommended ! ! !Frank Sinatra received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for this performance , and its easy to see why .Playing a role that could have easily drifted into campish over - acting , Sinatra perfectly captures the desparation and hope that Frankie Machine felt as he was trying to get over an addiction that was obviously destroying him , physically and mentally .Hollywood lore says that Sinatra visited a rehab clinic while preparing for this film in order to see what a herion addict going through withdrawal really looked ( and acted ) like .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Judged against Sinatra 's other film performances , this certainly has to rank as the best ; the only other film roles that come close are Maggio in \" From Here to Eternity \" and \" The Manchurian Candidate \" .Its this performance , however , and the despiration of a man who wants to take control of his life , but ca n't , that has to be at the top of the list .In the end , Sinatra did n't win that Best Actor Oscar , losing out to Ernest Borgnine for his role in \" Marty \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As far as I 'm concerned , he should'a won it .Frank Sinatra impersonates a man who is the slave of his neighborhood in a big city that could be any metropolis .He is the slave of the powerful in this neighborhood because of his addiction to heroin , because of his being possessed by a girl who is in a wheel chair , though we know from the very start that she is acting the part of a handicapped girl .A small film , maybe , but powerful and faith - carrying acting .Dr Jacques COULARDEAU .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
