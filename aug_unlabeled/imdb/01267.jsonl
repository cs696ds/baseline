{"text": "Seagal and Wayans are partnered to investigate ( both cops ) .Seagal starts to think that there is more than one killer at work ( one using the original murders as an excuse to \" cover up \" some other killings and ends up shooting the original killer in what his Department considers suspicious circumstances .Wayans starts to suspect Seagal and discovers that his history is incomplete ( a bit like Seagal himself ) .However , after Wayans is blown ( literally ) out of his apartment and a joint visit to watch ' Casablanca ' they start working together to solve the case which includes the CIA and the Russian Mafia .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "2 Comments 9 of 10 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I ve heard this compared to seven a lot by fans and critics .I did nt think it was similar at all ! the only similarity is the gruesome murders , the rest of the story is totally different .Anyway I quite like seagal in these serial killer movies , kill swich was almost good too .This is similar to that movie but has a much better director who does nt try to be clever .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In kill switch they have the exact same scene ( early in the film ) but they show the stunt from at least 10 angles ! its very funny and I think the later version may be a homage to this movie .If it is then I take my hat off , bravo .Seagal is in crazy outfit mode in this one and the weird spiritual stuff is so odd that I liked it .It added to the comedy effect .I do nt take most seagal films too seriously and enjoyed this one quite a lot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Wayans is decent and while its not exactly gibson and glover , it serves the film pretty well .Good fight scenes , some cheesy but funny one liners , annoying villan .Does what you want from seagal .I am a real Seagal fan , an unashamed martial arts action hero , and Glimmer Man is a great example of this .It has much martial arts and spectacular action , but is contrast with humour between Seagal and Wayans and others making it a particular favourite of mine .I watch it maybe 3 - 4 times a year and for the blend of martial arts action and humour I commend this film to you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I regard this movie as the beginning of the first downward spiral of Seagal 's career .After the epic action of Under Siege 2 : Dark Territory [ Blu - ray ] [ 1995 ] [ US Import ] [ 2008 ] and Executive Decision [ Blu - ray ] [ 1996 ] [ US Import ] it was a bad mistake to sign - up for The Glimmer Man .When I went to the cinema to see this film on November 2nd 1996 they did n't even tear my ticket stub .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not even the employees of the long - gone ABC Cinema could be bothered keeping tabs on the audience .Needless to say that the film was n't screened for critics and every review in the papers that week was nothing but waffling on presumptions of what a typical Seagal film would be .I am making up for that now with a proper review .The fundamental flaw in The Glimmer Man is that it 's just far too contrived .The 80s ' mis - matched cops ' clich\u00e9 did n't help either .Plus , the film was yet another Seven [ Blu - ray ] [ 1995 ] wannabe , a sub - genre that flooded cinemas post October 1995 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The fight at the end is just fantastic it really shows what steven is like .He has no fear because he knows his ability to fight is second to none .The film is just packed with amazing quotes and i do like at the end where he says .\" when you wake up in the morning i think your pleased with what you see and that disturbs me , so i m going to take it on as my reponsibilty to make sure you never wake up happy again \" .I love the whole film and could watch it over and over again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
