{"text": "Inside the hospital , doctors and nurses are mysteriously dying ; outside , the place is under siege by Black Panther - type radicals .Then leggy Brit Diana Rigg shows up , and things get really weird .Now that this show has gone through a horrific network change from one of the best networks on Television to a downright laughable one , this show does n't even feel like Scrubs anymore .I just felt like I was watching a completely different show .I have nothing against Courtney Cox , and I loved her on Friends , but I 'm sorry , she does not belong on this show , nothing she said was even remotely funny .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I could n't help but feel bad for the Janitor when he gets FIRED ?A lot of changes , even with the last scene with credits , after the episode ends well , why do they have to have an \" extra \" scene .Something this show has never done .The plots were good , it just was n't Scrubs and that 's what got me angry .Monica on Scrubs baby !While J.D tries to get his new interns to pay attention to him and become doctors , the new chief of medicine ( Courtney Cox ) turns the hospital around .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Scrubs Season 8 Premiere My Jerks was a rlly good episode .It bwas awesome , with a bunch of comedy and rlly rlly cool .Courtney Cox ( who plays Monica on one of my fave Tv series Friends ) comes to the show and made the episode amazing !This is the beginning of the last season of Scrubs , and the season turns out to be awesome !There are rumors about a 9nth season without J.D and Elliot , but without them is not Scrubs .Awesome ep !Finally Scrubs is back !We have waited a long time , but eventually we had this great first episode of the season .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The new chief , played by Courtney Cox , is an extremely interesting character and she replaces very well the retired Dr. Kelso , who does n't leave anyway the hospital because he likes to spend time there every day .New young med students are introduced , each one with different and funny qualities and imperfections .I was pretty shocked when the Janitor loses his job , but I really liked the fact that after eight years no one knows his real name yet .Not bad the new look of JD .Fantastic !It looks like this is a fantastic start to a fantastic season , lets just hope they finish the series off well !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The characters are sharp and witty as ever before , with JD 's ever pursuit for Dr. Cox 's love .With a strange character revelation from Cox about his hate of fighting with Kelso over the many years that the series has run .It gave great depth to John .C. McGinley 's character .Elliot and Carla are just as hilarious as always and of course Turk brings that strong character through like the rest of the series .It was nothing short of perfect ... .Scrubs returns with more of a whimper than a bang .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many wondered what changes would be made with Scrubs now airiing on a different network .If this episode is a measure of what 's to come , these may not be positive changes .There were many ( what I would consider standard ) elements missing from this episode .Some of the main cast were also little more than observers ( Carla and Turk did not interact at all ) .The main plots revolved around JD struggling with his interns , Elliot discovering she is self absorbed , DR Cox being afriad of meeting the new chief and of course , the inroduction of Dr Maddox .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Only Dr Cox 's was slightly subtler , though he acted wildly out of character until the conversation with Dr Maddox .Dr Maddox is tough to warm to , but so far seems a solid character .Finally , there were no patients to focus on .One of the best things about Scrubs is the way the doctors intereact with the patients they treat and how treating these patients teaches them important lessons or reflects other events in the characters lives .( Not sure how I felt about the tongue - in - cheeks end credits sketch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A great opener for the show .I am so pleased to see that not only has Scrubs returned , but triumphantly at that .It reminded me of the Scrubs glory days in seasons 1 - 4 .Of course , some time had to be spent introducing Taylor Maddox as the new chief of medicine , Bob Kelso 's replacement .She was played extremely well by Courtney Cox , I thought .A new group of interns were also introduced who were as useless as the last lot .All the main characters were there and doing the show proud .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A great start to this season then with a lot of promise for the future .Scrubs is back ! !Scrubs is back with a bang .This episode made me laugh so much .Everything from Turk popping up saying your welcome because of the \" Blaire \" nickname lol . to Dr Kelso popping teds balloon and giving him a little smirk .The addition of Courtney Cox actually played out smooth .Seeing her on other shows and whatnot made me skeptical about her filling kelsos job but she did and wow she s even more heartless then he used to be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Either way Scrubs is back and i hope this season does well enough to make them even consider a 9th season .As long as they plan on keeping the janitor in the show they 'll be ok .The show is actually good again .It 's been a long time since I actually cared about Scrubs .It really started to go downhill in the fifth year .The characters all degraded into ridiculous stereotypes of themselves and the fantasy sequences became became steadily more ridiculous and started going on longer and longer until , in the last season finale , one took up an entire episode .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The characters behave like real human beings , it 's funny ( surprisingly so , in fact ) , and they focused solely on the hospital .There were some moments that fell a little flat ( the orderly whose a little too \" hands on \" ) , but it 's been a real long time since the show made me laugh like that .It 's nice to see that they 'll be ending it on a high note , with people wanting more .YES !Scrubs is back and its good again !My Jerks is a great episode of scrubs because it was like the old episodes not like the awful 7th season in which was cut short and supplied very few laughs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My Jerks had a lot of funny parts .Perhaps my favorite scene was where JD asked the janitor if he wanted a cell phone and he took it , sniffed it , and replied no and walked away .I love Scrubs and i m glad to see its back on the right track !Scrubs returns ! ! ! !Several months later and Scrubs resurfaces on a new channel and a new time for one final season .Or at least , if ABC has its way and continues the show after Zach Braff and Bill Lawrence leave , it will be the last season with those two .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only complaint I can think of that the premiere is a bit slow .In the first few minutes Scrubs shakes off the awkwardness of season seven and is back being laughably hilarious and uniquely dramatic at once .The ' last ' season shakes a few things up to the Scrubs residents .Dr. Kelso has been replaced by freshfaced Dr. Maddox ( Courtney Cox , Lawrence 's newest protege in his next show ) , a perky , devil - may - care woman that is way nicer than Dr. Kelso had ever been .Happy news for the Scrubs crew but not as comedically funny .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "JD gets a brand new batch of interns , everyone being annoying to soulless .The new interns are so useless and incompetent , JD walks away from them .Meanwhile , Elliot learns how mean she 's been the past season , especially in regards to Keith and she ca n't handle it .Cox ducks around Maddox because he does n't want to learn if she is a jerk because as he correctly states , the chief of medicine position attracts jerks .And if Maddox is a jerk , Cox will feel obligated to constantly tell her off like he did with Kelso .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maddox demonstrates how more competent she is than Kelso , even catching Janitor torture JD and fires him .Relax , Janitor wo n't go anywhere , he 'll just be somewhere else for a few episodes .In the meantime , it 's a brief moment of happiness for JD , no longer will he have to endure the Janitor 's wrath .Ted is shown post - Kelso and even if Kelso did a number on Ted over the years , the wounds are still present since Ted is still a neurotic , anxious mess .Elliot makes amends with Keith and apologizes for hurting him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And it might pave way for JD and her to get back together .Who knows ?It could happen .Cox , being in a rare kind mood , treats JD as an equal and explains how he should be patient with the interns .And finally , Cox has a chance to size Maddox up and it turns out she is a jerk .Not as a pompous jerk as Kelso but still a jerk .Cox still has his role to play .This episode does show a bit more \" darker \" humor than previous seasons if not as \" dark \" as season one or two and it shows how much Scrubs has grown as a show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's great to see Scrubs return in top form , place this season next to the others , and hopefully , will have a stellar finale .Suddenly Kelso is gone and replaced by a horrific self - centered woman who sucks all the life out of the show .She fires Janitor and basically took all the fun out of the show .The actress who replaced Kelso is pathetic .No sense of comedy and clearly a self - indulged , pathetic actress not worthy of this show .Otherwise , it was an \" OK \" return to the series .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They need to find a way to bring Kelso back for the final season .I liked the interaction between Sarah Chalke ( Elliot ) and Judy Reyes ( Carla ) and there were some real \" come to Jesus \" moments for the staff .Problem was , the episode was dominated by the overbearing replacement for Bob Kelso .BAD mistake , writers ...VERY bad mistake .For the premier of season 8 , we are introduced to the new Chief of Medicine , Dr. Maddox .J.D. deals with a whole new group of interns .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Because the show switched networks and entering its final season , I was a bit anxious to see if there would be any drastic changes .Instead , I was completely thrilled with this episode ... especially after the \" My Princess \" episode .It seemed to go right back to basics .I loved seeing Elliot finally offer a heartfelt apology to Keith , even though I am thrilled she did not marry him .Another great part of this episode was seeing someone else outwit the Janitor and give him a piece of his own medicine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
