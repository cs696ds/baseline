{"text": "The Movie Itself : Our Reviewer 's Take .During one of a few interview appearances in ' Nitro Circus : The Movie , ' Johnny Knoxville compared his MTV reality series and films to the antics of this \" action sport collective , \" which also had a brief television run .The ' Jackass'-extraordinaire says the two are born of the same mother but different fathers .There 's a bit of truth behind this statement .He 's right that both groups involve seeing grown adults physically punish themselves attempting a variety of dangerous feats for the sake of entertainment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Both camps come from the same below - average - intelligence father but born of different mothers , probably seduced while intoxicated with poor judgment and even poorer standards for a mate .If there 's one market in the war of the sexes that men have clearly laid claim to , it is definitely the area of aberrant stupidity , and things like ' Jackass ' and this movie are evidence of that .The other clear difference between the two shows and their respective movie spinoffs is that at least the Nitro Circus team is made from actual professionals of extreme sports .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One is purely out of a need for attention , which frankly lowers the standards of the human species , while the other aims to entertain to some measure with some kind of sports theme attached .Steve - O pretending to be shark bait is recklessly stupid with a good chance of bodily injury or death .Jumping a modified Big Wheel across two high - rises is equally stupid but obviously done so that each jumper intentionally overshoots their target , guarantying the safety of the person performing the stunt .It looks amazing , to be sure , but carefully pre - planned in advance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ninety minutes of watching the team doing some wildly crazy stuff while interviews of celebrities praise them should ideally offer at least the same level of amusement as the ' Jackass ' franchise .( In actuality , the show and films surrounding this sort of stupid behavior is the least bit amusing in my book . )The movie is not an \" EPIC FAIL ! \" by any means , especially when watching it in 3D , but it 's still kind of a fail because it does ultimately feel like the weaker , younger brother from a different a mother .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Audiences are even reminded of this live event numerously via a countdown and behind - the - scenes footage of spectators filling the arena and stunt performers preparing backstage .Directors Gregg Godfrey and Jeremy Rawle also give the impression that we 'll soon see the big circus - like show , if not at least a good chunk of it .When it turns out this was never actually part of the plan , it 's both disappointing and somewhat annoying we just spent 90-minutes of our time sitting through a very long commercial .Granted , the stunts performed in between the countdown are decently funny and a bit shocking , but as the filmmakers continuously rev up their viewers for some grand finale , we reasonably expect a big finish that would make the entire film worth remembering .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The introduction , which is a carefully choreographed spectacle on a dirt track that 's incredible to behold , offers a small glimpse of the team 's talent to put on a show , but do we get the same in the closing moments .No , we do n't .Other inherent problems come from the performers themselves .Led by motorsports competitor Travis Pastrana , the Nitro Circus team members spend little time in front of the camera , and hence , never give audiences an opportunity to know or care for them .Again , the stunts look spectacular , but not once did I fear for their safety .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Nitro Circus ' hits the 3D Blu - ray scene with a big , cannonball splash that puts viewers right in the middle of the group 's insane and asinine stunts .Shot entirely on the Red Epic digital camera system with a 3D rig , the 1080p / MVC MPEG-4 encode comes with lots of objects protruding from the screen , threatening to smack viewers at home on the face .Cars , dirt bikes , bodies , school buses and modified Big Wheels often appear as if flying across the middle of the living room .During each stunt , depth is astounding , with background objects in the very far distance generating an immersive three - dimensional space .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately , the 1.78:1 picture is also a bit inconsistent as a good chunk of it appears fairly flat and two - dimensional .I 'm not sure if it 's intentional to show only the wild stunts in 3D while the rest of the movie is 2D , but it definitely feels that way .Although the crazy things the group does look stunning because of the 3D , the rest of the doc fails to impress .There are also some minor aliasing and moir\u00e9 patterns that creep up , complemented by a tad of video noise , and ringing around several objects tends to distract .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The picture is really rather spectacular in this respect , adding a good deal to the overall depth and maintaining remarkable visibility .Colors are bold and vibrant , particularly in the lush , richly - saturated primaries .Facial complexions appear natural and revealing .Fine lines and textural details are razor - sharp , exposing every trivial blemish , tear and stitching in the wild outfits worn by the cast .Overall , and in spite of some negligible missteps in the video , the transfer pleases more often than disappoints and the 3D is fantastic when it really wants to be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ultimately , the audio department is where the documentary truly shines and impresses .Much of its success is due to a song selection that spreads smoothly and evenly to the back speakers , filling the room with annoying pop - punk and a couple good rock classics .With surprisingly good discrete effects and directionality , rear activity is much more satisfying than initially expected .The original design is n't exactly the sort to put viewers in the middle of the action , but imaging feels wide and immersive .Being a documentary , however , a great deal of the attention in this DTS - HD Master Audio soundtrack is in the fronts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Despite the team showing off their amazing skills to pull off some amazing stunts , the documentary is a bit of a disappointment and somewhat boring , feeling too much like a feature - length promo to the group 's live show tour .The Blu - ray comes with a great - looking 3D video presentation and even better audio .Supplements are kept very light and add to the level of disappointment , making the overall package one only fans and 3D enthusiasts could honestly appreciate .Technical Specs .Video Resolution / Codec .Aspect Ratio(s ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Having said that though , Jackass 3 is a humorous detour from the usual suspects to be found on Netflix Streaming , with some excellent cinematography in places - though be warned : there are many numerous scenes with intent to disgust .Beavis and Butthead ( aka Mike Judge ) initiate the proceedings with an introduction specifically for the 3D theatrical edition of the film .From there , we move to the opening credits and they are quite simply ridiculous , which is wonderful .The film , being devised specifically with 3D in mind , loses its depth and dimensional allure , but the cinematography is actually very colorful and beautiful and highly amusing during this sequence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The shenanigans are amusing and , at times , mindless .While many keep with the historical Jackass feel , there are many that play like comedy sketches , in sequences that could most likely make the Monty Python boys proud .The duck hunting stunt , Bam getting his tardy payback in the snake pit , and the hotel room gorilla are all stand - outs in this third installment .There are also a few adapted and amped up pranks that were originally from the first series , including the Poop Cocktail - longtime followers will be pleased .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's sweat , shit , farts , vomit , piss , and more , so be warned - if that kind of thing is something you can not handle then evade Jackass 3 at all costs .Alternatively , there are also the hardcore physical stunts as well , which does make you wonder how many injuries and hospitalizations these guys have all had to deal with over the years .They may be stupid for doing this to themselves , but they are as resilient as nails fearlessly heading into these stunts with the knowledge that it 's going to hurt like hell .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite his death being the result of an incredible stupid and selfish choice , and in the hopes his fans learn from this horrible blunder , it is actually wonderful to see him happy and enjoying these moments on film .Even the rage he displays while having his beard hair ripped with the aid of superglue , afterwards he sees the humor in it all .Which leads me to the comradeship the Jackass crew has : it really is quite remarkable .Despite the awful pranks they play on each other , they damage they expose themselves to , and so on ; they still display an open affection between them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Johnny Knoxville , naturally , dominates the movie - after all , Jackass has always been his baby .Wee Man and Steve - O are there putting in some solid physical and comedic performances as well .They work together even better though when the all - inclusive Jackass crew are altogether as one group - the immature teenage - like mentality spawns the scenes to get even more ridiculous .Like the introduction sequence , the closing sequence is some wonderful cinema work - filmed at a slower frame rate , it 's simply enjoyable to view ( though it 's all clearly staged ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The soundtrack is also spectacular , with a grand selection of songs that fit the film actually quite well - helping to make it an exceptional experience .As it always has been , Jackass is not for everyone .A lot of people will find it worthless , in bad taste , and idiotic - and that 's fair , because it is n't for them .This kind of movie is for the folks out there that can appreciate this style of physical comedy , akin to the freak shows and circuses of eons gone by - and also the ludicrous things many of us did in our younger years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , Jackass 3 is fun to a degree , though it does get to be overbearing in length .I enjoy and welcome movies that challenge me in different ways , whether it be intellectually challenging , morally challenging , or visually challenging .Jackass 3 most certainly fits in to the visually challenging class , so while I appreciate that challenge , it simply goes on far too long .It probably would have been better as a mini - series rather than a full length movie .Principally , Jackass worked well in its original format as a television series , but not so much in long form video style .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

Fields once warned fellow filmmakers to \" never work with animals or children .\"For Jackass Presents : Bad Grandpa , Johnny Knoxville and Jeff Tremaine opted to work with both .That is , if a Jackass - with a capital J - can indeed be considered an animal .Opening in theaters nationwide today , Bad Grandpa continues the story of 86-year - old curmudgeon Irving Zisman ( played by Knoxville ) , a recurring Jackass character since 2001 , who teaches his eight - year - old grandson Billy ( Jackson Nicoll ) the ways of the world on a cross - country road trip .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "What are the biggest challenges - legal , production or otherwise - in creating this kind of film with a kid in a starring role ?Knoxville : The hardest thing we do is public pranks .Like Jackass , you just have to keep doing them and doing them until you find that right person or persons .I was in makeup three hours a day , so that cuts a lot of your day out .Then with Jackson , you have a very limited amount of time you can shoot with him because he 's a kid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Tremaine : There were a few people who definitely did n't want to be in our movie after we filmed them .One pageant dad in particular had a great interaction with Irving and he hated us , so we were n't able to use it .But in general we usually make it pretty nice .We 're not out to be mean to people .We 're not trying to make people look stupid ; we 're just doing stupid stuff in front of people and trying to make them look normal .Is there a difference in the way that people react to being antagonized by a twenty- or thirty - something person versus an 86-year - old man ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "So if we 're shooting outside we have what looks like a plumber 's van , and it 's got two or three cameras shooting out of it at all times .And they 're big cameras on tripods that you ca n't see , because they 're behind tinted windows .But then if we 're in a location like the funeral home , for instance , that funeral home had a perfect place to build a fake wall .So we actually divided the space with a fake wall that had two cameras behind it .And we brought in these people who had never been in that funeral home , so they did n't notice anything different .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "As the film is partially scripted , was that all done ahead of time or as you went along ?Tremaine : No , it was an evolving story .The basic story from the get - go was definitely about Irving forming this relationship with his grandson .But we had all these other elements that we slowly pared out as we realized what was working best , which was really Billy and Irving .We dressed Spike [ Jonze ] up as a woman - he was going to be Irving 's love interest - and we shot some really funny stuff , but it sort of convoluted the story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
