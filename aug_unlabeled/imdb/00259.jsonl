Clarke 's books but I have seen ' 2010 ' and I think it is an puerile piece of rubbish .If ( as another commenter has said ) Clarke changed the monolith 's location Saturn 's orbit to Jupiter 's in order for his book to follow the film , this illustrates the extent to which he dwells in Kubrick 's shadow .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The fascinating thing about this film is that it fails on the human level but succeeds magnificently on a cosmic scale .Kubrick 's universe , and the spaceships he constructed to explore it , are simply out of scale with human concerns .The ships are perfect , impersonal machines which venture from one planet to another , and if men are tucked away somewhere inside them , then they get there , too .But the achievement belongs to the machine .And Kubrick 's actors seem to sense this ; they are lifelike but without emotion , like figures in a wax museum .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The pilots grow suspicious of the computer , HAL , which runs the ship .But they behave so strangely -- talking in monotones like characters from Dragnet -- that we 're hardly interested .There is hardly any character development in the plot , then , and as a result little suspense .What remains fascinating is the fanatic care with which Kubrick has built his machines and achieved his special effects .There is not a single moment , in this long film , when the audience can see through the props .The stars look like stars and outer space is bold and bleak .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
