{"text": "I 'm enjoying HBO 's Deadwood on DVD and while certainly not a conventional TV Western it has me pining for all those great classic westerns from the 50 's and 60 's .many of these shows are on DVD from the Minor League Publishers like Brentwood and the like but they are mostly the PD stuff .And the the major Players Like Bonanza , Gunsmoke , Rawhide , The Big Valley , High Chaperral , Wagon Train and Wild Wild West are absent .It was Nice Paramount is releasing Have Gun Will Travel because its a show I had heard about but never seen due to almost no syndication .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I heard that !I am wondering about the Westerns as well .I 'm a Big Valley fan and want that one bad .I have WWW thru Columbia House ( $ ouch ) because I could n't wait for the season sets .I 'm also waiting for \" Alias Smith & Jones \" .I only have the first 10 DVDs of Wild Wild West , Charles , because I have n't purchased 11 through 15 yet .Are there still 3 episodes on each disc for those ?And are they all 2nd season ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "46 out of 104 WWW episodes is almost half of the series on DVD already .I think it 's a sure bet that anything available via Columbia House will eventually be released as a season set .They already have the episodes transferred , and they have a reasonable sales forecast .I figure if a show was performing poorly for CH , it would be dropped before too many volumes were available .Add me to the chorus of those wanting to see more westerns .Have n't really thought about what I 'd want most ( \" Have Gun , Will Travel , \" one of my favorites , is actually being done ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There have been rumblings about \" Maverick , \" which is another gem .I 'd like to see \" Zane Grey Theater \" for its variety , and the fact I 've not seen too many episodes over the years .I met Robert Fuller last year , and it instilled in me a desire to see \" Laramie \" again .Do n't recall too much about it .One western series I 've never seen is \" Tales of Wells Fargo , \" which had a healthy run in the late-50s . \"Wagon Train \" would be nice to see , but I 'm afraid episodes from the first season or two can a bit too leisurely - paced , if my memory is correct .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Or \" The Rebel \" with Nick Adams ?Those would be nice .Heck , I 'm even forgetting \" Wanted : Dead or Alive \" with Steve McQueen .Surely that would be a good candidate .Ditto for the aforementioned \" Alias Smith and Jones .\" The initial season of \" Laredo \" was good fun , too .Oh , and another really neat Warner Bros. entry was \" Lawman , \" with John Russell .Lots of possibilities to wistfully mull over !Hope they are not as futile as I 'm inclined to believe .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Rawhide and Maverick were both released on tape from Columbia House in the mid 1990s , but I 'm not sure how far they got with Maverick .Rawhide is a CBS Video release , so it may already be on DVD in the same form as Wild Wild West .Their are few Maverick episode available in stores , and you might find them for as little as $ 1 on VHS in a clearance isle .On DVD the only episode I know of is \" Duel at Sundown \" because it guest starred Clint Eastwood before Rawhide .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Tales of Wells Fargo starring Dale Robertson was originally a 1/2 hour B & W show for the first 4 years .When NBC increased the budget , it expanded to 1 hour and was filmed in color beginning in 1961 when Jim bought a ranch and hired old timer William Demarest as the foreman , while he continued on assignments for Wells Fargo .The ranch setting and also a widow and her 2 young daughters who lived at a neighboring ranch did n't help the show , so it was also the final season .Ironically , I never saw any of the 30 minute shows , and only 1 of the ranch episodes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of the episodes that WB released , only \" Iron Hand \" and \" The Bundle from Britain \" did not duplicate any CH releases , the latter being the only Roger Moore Maverick episode released so far .I sincerely hope that WB makes good on their recent announcement of Maverick DVDs .I really love this show .I think \" The Bundle from Britian \" was the first episode of Maverick with Roger Moore as Beau Maverick .However , while still under contract to Warner Bros.Moore did guest star on the show two years earlier in \" The Rivals \" in a different role , and he appeared with both James Garner and Jack Kelly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Mainly , the TV Westerns that aired between , say , the mid - late 50 's up to the late 70 's .I did a \" sanity \" check of my collection and I see that I 'm a little thin in the Western series .The only one that I have at present is the \" Rifleman \" sets .I know that \" Have Gun \" and \" Wanted Dead or Alive \" is out but I 'm not sure about getting those yet .I see where Rawhide is expected out this year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Having said that , I have no idea how the \" Galaxy Rangers \" cartoon got on that list .Might as well put Firefly on it , too !I would love to see it as well .But unfortunately The Tick is of recent vintage and I assume is cartoonish or based on a comic strip so it therefore appeals to that crowd .Pistols appeals only to a much older crowd ( those of us with good memories ) and is really not something that would be in Universal 's plans .Dave , thanks for the reminder of the \" search \" by type function at TSoD. I forgot about that one I was surprised at how many westerns are out there already .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anyone readiing this have S1 of \" Wanted Dead or Alive \" ?That 's one that I 'm interested in getting but have n't \" pulled the trigger \" on yet .Yes , I bought it simply because of its reputation as a classic TV western ; I had never watched it before .And I can definitely say that I 'm pleasantly surprised , it does live up to its good reputation , at least IMHO .Picture and sound quality are fine , considering the age of the material .There have been reports that PAL masters were used to do this set , so there might be PAL speedup , but I never notice things like that , they are too subtle for me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Based on how much I like this show , I have now decided to get the first of the RIFLEMAN sets , too ( though I realize that those are n't season sets ) .I am also glad to report that the first season of BONANZA , which was released in Germany ( R2 ) just a few weeks ago ( surprisingly not by Paramount but by an independent company ) is a real winner .I have now watched the first four episodes , and only the first one was familiar to me , the other ones I had never seen before .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This review is for the 2001 single - disc MGM release of The Magnificent Seven .A newer two - disc special edition of this film is reviewed at This URL .John Carpenter said it straight : The Magnificent Seven is neither the best nor the most meaningful of the great Westerns , but it 's possibly the most fun .After a slow start in theaters , 1 it 's become one of the most popular television movies ever , and has remained one of the high points of the genre for its clean action , snappy script and wonderful music score .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The John Sturges remake is the perfect John Kennedy fantasy : a world where American knowhow and firepower reaches out to other nations with a good example and a lot of guns , rids them of their oppressors , and earns their eternal respect .Although the script preaches the nobility of the Mexican peasants , Yul Brynner 's statement that , \" Only the farmers win \" , is a bunch of hooey , even if it has remained gospel to the American male .Americans with guns , it 's been proven time and again , cross the border to defend American interests , and not for charity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Forget the farmers !We identify with the ultra - cool , narcissistic gunfighters , the dudes with the great threads and macho attitudes .At the end , they do n't stand forlornly over the graves of their fallen comrades as did the samurai , but instead ride away as heroes , with triumphant music lighting the way to new adventures .The dead gunfighters will have songs sung over their graves - they 're legends , superheroes , where the farmers remain clueless squares .Westerns really are about politics , and The Magnificent Seven were kind of a Peace Corps /Green Berets combo .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Poor Brad Dexter thinks he 's in a movie from the ' 40s , unfortunately , and Horst Bucholz is having fun playing Roy Rogers .After four years of television packed with Western shows focused on shootin'-iron talents , the Western had finally reached the stage where the star 's basic job was to be a mobile weapons platform , in boots .The Magnificent Seven is extremely well directed by John Sturges , an ' outdoor ' director adept at keeping his heroes laconic and cool .Most every setup could be hung on the wall as a painting ; when action happens , it 's fast , motivated and convincing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "MGM 's DVD of The Magnificent Seven is a good show .The anamorphic 16:9 picture is a huge improvement over the 1993 laserdisc in clarity and color .Savant has already read a lot of criticism of the quality of the transfer , some of which is debatable and some of which is just misinformed .The negative to Mag 7 had already faded way back when 1974 reissue prints were made , and up until the early ' 90s , the only colors to be seen on the bad television prints was brown , reddish brown , and a darker reddish brown .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are granier shots , but if you 'll notice , almost all of them are optical sections , adjacent to dissolves or other transitions .The 1960 film stock used to create these opticals faded at a different rate than the rest of the movie , and had a coarser grain structure .Timing negatives that have faded unevenly is almost impossible , on film or on tape .For color and sharpness of picture , Savant has no gripes with Mag 7 on DVD .It is frustrating to see all new transfers of older movies compared to the zowie job done by Warners on North by NorthWest , a title behind which must have been placed a tremendous restoration cash outlay .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is an extra expense , but it is true that Mag 7 could have benefitted greatly from this , especially in the title sequence .The second possible point of contention is the fact that some studios are using straight minimum compression bit rates on all of their transfers .Even when they get away with it , the authored disc can be left with a subtle , digitally grainy look , softening hard lines and lowering the contrast zing of the image .On a normal monitor , Mag 7 looks terrific .On a large projection monitor , it looks far better than any previous presentation , but not as snappy as the original digibeta tapes - almost , but not quite .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Robert Relyea .The track is an easy listen , does n't bog down in details , yet offers a constantly changing set of viewpoints and anecdotes on the making of the film .The disc comes with two trailers and has MGM 's insufficient 16 chapter stops .Savant participated in the production of the extra content on the Magnificent Seven disc , which should be noted in judging the fairness and objectivity of the following comments .The 46-minute docu was originally meant to be a minor reworking of a show already produced for the BBC in 2000 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So the original PAL interview tapes were brought to Los Angeles and the show recut from top to bottom , retaining most of the interview bites and replacing all of the clip sections with more exciting montages .The only major excision were an interesting couple of minutes spent on a close comparison of the Sturges and Kurosawa films , that had used unclearable Toho film clips .Cutting around these omissions without dropping mention of the Kurosawa version was a major difficulty - even showing a vhs box of The Seven Samurai on a video rack was a legal no - no .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The ending was recut , to soften some awkward claims that themes in the movie had never been seen before in Westerns .And the BBC show had overdubbed actress Rosenda Monteros ( Horst Bucholz 's love interest ) with an English translation , that had effectively inverted the meaning of her words in Spanish .These sections were retranslated and replaced .Also , the English crew 's tapes had a nice interview with the recently deceased actor / cameraman John Alonzo , but had not used any of it .He was an enormously warm and respected Hollywood veteran , and we found space for him right away .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Collectors with tape copies of the original English show , which was wisely shot 16:9 and had great art direction , should hang on to them .Lisa McGuire of MGM tech services was the agent who engineered the great film restoration of The Magnificent Seven .The very active Dolby Digital remix is actually a clever Chace Productions concoction , as the only track to be had in the vaults was a mono composite .Oh , and by the way , after watching the docu , in which Horst Bucholz admits to shooting himself in the leg with a blank , take a close look at the lightning - fast draw that Steve McQueen performs in the first faceoff with Calvera .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Check out trailer # 2 , the one with the gawd - awful title song , in the added value section of the disc .No wonder Mag 7 had boxoffice grief the first time around .The trailer 's a hideous piece of work that would sink any movie ) Return .P.S. : Savant actually has a suggestion for the MGM DVD producers who , for the sake of uniformity , are restricted to 16 chapter stops in the menu , even though a movie like this one really needs a lot more .The laserdisc had 43 !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
