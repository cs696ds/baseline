{"text": "A Little Princess - Frances Hodgson Burnett .The combination of snowy weather and watching some of a terrible adaptation of ' A Little Princess ' ( Frances Hodgson Burnett is not well served when it comes to adaptations ) over Christmas made me really want to read the book again .The otherwise helpful lady in there was surprised that the book was for me - I do n't think she would have had the same reaction if I 'd come in for a Twilight title and there 's something mildly depressing about that .Fairy tales are fluid things , even written down they evolve into different stories - ' A Little Princess ' is basically Cinderella with a bit of embellishment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It 's interesting that Burnett makes no attempt to make sense of Sara 's loss - one of the things I disliked about the film version is that her father turns up alive which is far to conventional a happy ending .Part of the point of ' A Little Princess ' is surely to help children understand that life is often desperately unfair and that you have to deal with it .Eventually Sara 's fortunes are restored - quite literally , and what pleases me most is that it 's not in the form of a handsome Prince .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I really like the idea that she gets her independence , that she intends to use it for philanthropic purposes is also pleasing - she 's a splendid role modal .I 'm curious about how Burnett felt about this particular book , of the 4 novels by her I 've read I 'm inclined to think this one the best .The value placed on Sara 's intelligence and spirit are encouraging .Even without the fairy god father the reader feels sure she would survive , escape from Miss Minchin , and make her own way in the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The value placed on education and an imaginative inner life are also encouraging .I think it 's my favourite too , though I might re read The Shuttle soon just to be sure .There 's so much about it that I like , and which I found helpful - mostly regarding the right attitude to take to work ... .Nothing breaks her , and she does keep putting Miss Minchin in her place .She ought to be a victim but I never feel like she is , and the big prize at the end is n't specifically love but financial security and independence which is quite encouraging .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "What I do expect from a literary adaptation is that the central arc of the story be preserved , with its relative emphases and central concerns intact .And of course I ask that , whatever changes the screenwriters decide to make , the resulting story must be believable on its own terms .As I see it , this film has two main flaws .It does not preserve the central arc of the story , and as a result it undermines the believability of the story that it does retain .Waugh said that the main theme of the book is religious in nature : it is about the movement of grace in the lives of his characters , and especially in the life of Charles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Charles remains ever on the outside , observing but not involved , and the final scene in the chapel at Brideshead has taken on a different meaning entirely .I expect that the decision to alter the ending in this way resulted from a deeper thematic problem with the film .If Charles is to be drawn into the life of faith , there must be something attractive about that life , and the film fails to tell us what that might be .Catholicism is reduced to one note : guilt .The scheme is almost comical in its simplicity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "( After all , this image is generally shown in negative scenes , most strikingly after Julian runs away from Charles in Venice . )Or perhaps it is just as simple as that since the Madonna and child is a common Catholic ikon , the filmmakers lazily threw it in .Of the deathbed scene , I will not comment except to say that without Charles 's participation , it loses its meaning : the faith becomes a purely private affair , and as portrayed , is practically superstitious .I would agree that Julia was very well acted , and I also liked that in this adaptation she and Sebastian were physically similar ( unlike in the Grenada production ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There was nothing particularly charming or attractive about him - what motivation does Charles , the intelligent artist , have for befriending him ?Finally , I think perhaps the film 's most serious flaw is the idea that Charles loved and desired excessively .He begins the film with the assured statement that \" he wants to be happy \" and that he wants not to have to look back on his life with regret .He is a confident atheist ( in the novel he is a rather conventional agnostic . )And by the end of the film , Julia leaves him saying that he wanted too much , and he asks himself at the end that very question .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But in the novel , through all his human relationships , he is learning how to love .Here , he starts the novel groping for human affection , \" searching for love \" , .with the faint , unrecognized apprehension that here , at last , I should find that low door in the wall , which others , I knew , had found before me , which opened on an enclosed and enchanted garden .The whole direction of his journey , as Waugh himself said , is towards grace .It is not through excess of love that Charles fails , but rather by not loving enough and not loving in the right way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He says to Julia that Sebastian was \" the forerunner \" , and indeed Julia is herself a forerunner to the culmination of the novel , where he kneels in the chapel by the lamp \" burning anew among the old stones \" .The good points of the film ?The photography , as you point out , is sumptuous .The score was pretty good , though a bit overbearing at times .Charles is presented as a budding artist from the very beginning , which I liked .Julia and Sebastian are physically alike , as I pointed out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I almost feel like a put - out Star Wars fan listing scene by scene ( with colour coding ) the flaws in The Phantom Menace .I guess if one is disappointed by a film , there is still pleasure in dissecting it .Thank you , Adam , for your thoughtful comments .You 've given me much to think about , with respect to both the film and the novel .I think you have drawn out two very significant problems with the film .The crude portrait of Lady Marchmain distorts her relationship to her children , which in turn distorts their motives for acting as they do .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's an excellent point that cuts right to the heart of the story .I like , too , your point about Charles ' motives .In the film he is basically a static figure - perhaps he develops a bit of back - bone and grows a little more jaded and resigned , but he does not grow in love .He is no larger at the end than at the beginning ; he is not seeking , much less finding , \" that low door in the wall \" .Because he is our narrator , this converts the whole drama into something that affects them , a curiosity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Certainly when I saw Charles turn and leave the room I clutched my hair and pulled .Yet we did see its effect on Julia , and for me that redeemed the scene a little .I do n't know what to think about the Catholic imagery in the film .I expect it was lazily thrown in .It might be worth noting something that my friend ( actually , Adam , our friend Mr. Elliot ) pointed out about the audience at the screening we attended .In the early going , we heard a number of snickers at the religiosity of the Flytes , and approving murmers as the film 's psychology of religion ( guilt , guilt , and guilt ) was unfolded .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
