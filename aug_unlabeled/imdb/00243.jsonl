{"text": "Anna Anderson is known as ' the best of of several impostors who claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia ' .Picture : The Age , Australia .DNA evidence seemed to have put an end to the the claims of American Anna Anderson and others to be the lost princess .Now a new book to be published in Yekaterinburg , scene of the slaying of the Russian royals , will challenge the view that all the Romanovs were shot in a dank cellar in July 1918 .Anastasia - the youngest of the tsar 's four daughters - was 17 when she was supposedly killed in 1918 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He became convinced Nicholas II 's remains had been found , but he is far less certain about Grand Duchess Anastasia 's , whose bone remnants are - officially - interred in St Petersburg .I do not assume presumptuously she was executed by the Bolsheviks , nor do I assume she remained alive ' , he said , reported Itar - Tass . 'This is for the reader to decide .On the basis of the archive documents discovered , and new Russian and foreign evidence I have seen since 1991 as a scientist , I have reasons to believe the royal family 's fate is not as certain as it has been believed for almost 100 years ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A lock of her hair and medical samples showed no link to the Romanovs , according to scientists .Yet the author of the new book - ' Who are you , Ms Tchaikovskaya ? ' - is concerned that she has been labelled an imposter too easily .Veniamin Alekseyev , pictures : Ural Institute for the Humanities and Natalya Zhigareva , ' Uralskiy Rabochiy ' newspaper .He argues against the sole reliance on DNA testing of remains discovered in the Porosyonkov log locality , near Yekaterinburg .Historians have ignored archive documents that cast considerable doubt over this version , he said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The former needed an image of an uncompromising new government determined to wipe out the old world without a trace , and the latter - a Great Russia without an emperor , ' said Alekseyev .Alekseyev admits he touches on a very delicate issue regarding whose remains were buried in the Peter and Paul Cathedral in St Petersburg .He hopes for new insights when documents pertaining to the royal family are released in 2018 .These evidently concern secret diplomatic contacts between Germany and the Soviet Union over the German born tsarina Alexandra and her daughters , and a possible secret exchange in the First World War .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Pictures : Zlatoust City Museum .Leading French historian Marc Ferro has long argued that the wife of Nicholas II and the imperial couple 's daughters were saved .Documents in Vatican archives are said to support this .Why such mercy on the part of the Bolsheviks ?After the leftist Social - Revolutionaries assassinated German Ambassador Mirbach , Wilhelm II could breach the Treaty of Brest - Litovsk , which would have ruined the Soviet regime .Therefore , they had to negotiate , ' said Alekseyev . 'All over the world this issue has been degraded for decades by unpretentious stage productions , garbage literature and films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Therefore , I am only publishing the documents .Where the truth lies , is up to the readers to decide . 'In 1995 Alekseyev discovered a document in the Siberian town of Tobolsk which convinced him the tsar 's bones had been discovered .Before I got my hands on these documents six months ago I had strong doubts that the remains were those of the Tsar .But today my doubts have vanished , ' he said at the time .One of Alekseyev 's documents belonged to a dentist , Maria Rendel , who examined Nicholas from late 1917 until mid-1918 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Decades later a medical expert studying what was thought to be the Tsar 's skull said it showed signs of the dental disease paradontosis .The historian has long argued that evidence hidden in Russian archives , and those of European royal families , can hold clues as to the fate of the Russian royals .Following Anderson 's appearance , the Soviet Foreign Minister Georgi Chicherin said : ' The fate of the young daughters of the czar is at present unknown to me .I have read in the press that they are now in America ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Being the son of Dr. Botkin , the tsar 's physician who was murdered with him at Yekaterinburg , ( Gleb ) knew the sisters well and was their playmate for several years , right down to their incarceration at Yekaterinburg .He recognised her at once as Anastasia , ' said Ferro .Anderson appeared in Berlin in 1920 .Originally she was labelled Fraulein Unbekannt - Miss Unknown - after refusing to give her identity .Later she used the name Tschaikovsky .An investigation by the tsarina 's brother concluded she was Franziska Schanzkowska , though she remained a focus of media attention .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Russian Orthodox Church has long expressed reservations over the authenticity of the bones .DNA tests conducted in several Western countries were said to match the bones to a number of royal relatives , including Philip , the husband of the British Queen , Elizabeth II .I have been advised what they and I have inherited is called a complex family line inheritance .I am not one to call somebody wrong but as to Anna Anderson been the lost Anastasia that proven wrong by DNA tests , if I may I would like to make my opinion known .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Seems the reason certain relatives and servants denounced Anastasia was because of -- drumroll , please -- money .Think about it : Anna Anderson had the same scars and defects as Anastasia ( scars on her forehead and finger , and the foot deformity ) .What are the odds of that ?The handwriting matched up .The ears matched up ( the PIK test done , I think it was in Germany ) .Peter Kurth has had pictures of a young Anastasia , as well as the old Anastasia , on his site .You can tell it 's the same person .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If it was prior to the killing of the other members of the royal family , then she would probably been un - injured and capable of making a long journey , eventually arriving in America .But all accounts report that she was in the basement at Ipatiev House .Therefore she would have been injured .Very few knew of the order to execute the family and there would have been no time for a rescue to be organised .Her rescuers were either staff or guards already present and probably acted spontaneously , taking advantage of the confusion which existed immediately after the killings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Its not that difficult .Then you have to read reports , plot a route , determine where along that route he could safely leave Anastasia .Somewhere secluded , with people he knew , outside of bolshevik influence .And the young girl would integrate into a new family , take a new identity , have children , but forever live in fear ' that the Bolsheviks were coming ' .What if there was a woman , older than a man , who had a child in 1922 , and that child had recessive genes , giving birth to a \" blue blood \" with white hair and azure eyes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
