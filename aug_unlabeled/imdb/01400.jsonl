{"text": "Been a fan for 36 years .Thank you for coloring my world .Love to you and family .Not Fade Away , Almost Famous & The Uneasy Marriage Of Rock & Film .Updated 12:02 pm , Sunday , May 5 , 2013 .The Sopranos creator David Chase 's first full - length feature film Not Fade Away - out this week on Blu - ray and DVD - is far from perfect .Sadly , it also did n't do all that well at the box office .But it is still probably the best , most lovingly crafted dramatic movie with a narrative dealing directly with rock and roll , since Cameron Crowe 's much more commercially successful , like - minded cinematic love letter , Almost Famous .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The stories themselves also tend to get a bit lost in their soundtracks , particularly in the case of Chase 's Not Fade Away .This features an absolutely killer , dead - on accurate , mix of ' 60s rock hits and garage - punk obscurities , assembled with the unmistakable attention to historical detail of musical director Little Steven Van Zandt .Another quality the two movies have in common is how personal they both feel , especially if you were actually there .This is n't surprising , considering that both scripts draw heavily upon the personal biographies of their respective directors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It certainly touched a nerve with me , particularly in the case of Crowe 's Almost Famous .Cameron Crowe 's nerdy and socially awkward autobiographical high - school rock journalist , who gets his big break writing for Rolling Stone , could just as easily have come from my own personal diary .Well , except maybe for the Rolling Stone part .I could even tell you my own true story of sharing a Seattle hotel elevator with Crowe , David Crosby , Graham Nash , and then Rolling Stone editor Ben - Fong Torres back on CSNY 's 1974 reunion \" Doom Tour .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Obviously , Cameron had a little more perspective than I did .He was already an insider , and I was just a teenage wannabe on the outside looking in .Which probably explains why he eventually married Heart 's Nancy Wilson and I did n't ( even though Nancy later signed my copy of Dog And Butterfly - sigh ! - to \" Mister Glen \" ) .I still have that autographed album .But that 's another story , perhaps best saved for another day , and another article .Likewise , the primary character in Not Fade Away is said to be based on David Chase 's own experiences as a teenager forming a dysfunctional rock band in 1960s New Jersey with some high school buddies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like that character , I too had some experience putting together my own questionably talented rock band , starting out as the drummer , and eventually graduating to become lead singer .The difference in my own case , was we just found a much better drummer lying right under our noses all along .In Not Fade Away , the character portrayed by largely unknown actor John Magaro gets the job because he can actually carry a tune .But since I was the 15-year - old guy who owned the drum set - we were all pals - and especially since nobody else could sing ( not that I could either ) , they handed me a microphone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But who is sweating the details ?At least the band members in Not Fade Away played a few cool gigs , and got to audition before recording legend Jerry Ragavoy ( an obvious Van Zandt touch , and a nice one at that ) .My own failed pre - high school rock band \" Furnace \" never made it past our lone paid gig at the West Seattle YMCA .These did n't just make me look cool ; they also made me look a bit taller , shortness of course being the secret curse of all aspiring rock stars .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I also remember that despite my Nazi capes and scarves , ( borrowed from a neighbor whose politics might have been somewhat questionable in hindsight ) , I definitely did not get any \" Satisfaction \" that night .So much for reaping the sexual spoils of playing bad Rolling Stones covers at the Y 's all - city teen dance party .Conversely , my still - in - progress \" career \" as a rock journalist has been slightly more successful , though I have yet to be able to earn a decent , full - time living at it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , you would be right in calling these movies nostalgic \" period pieces .\" Both unabashedly and unashamedly romanticize their respective ' 60s and ' 70s time capsules , and the great music that framed them .But in telling their stories about two young men growing up and coming of age during the \" classic \" era of rock and roll , both Chase and Crowe nail the mood of those amazing times perfectly .In that respect alone , Not Fade Away and Almost Famous can almost be viewed as companion pieces to one another .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But there have been some noteworthy exceptions .Two cases that spring immediately to mind are those of George Lucas and Martin Scorsese .Before Lucas ever directed the original Star Wars trilogy , he was responsible for what is quite possibly the greatest closing credits roll in all of film history with American Graffiti .This is where the Beach Boys \" All Summer Long \" follows that pivotal final scene of a young Richard Dreyfuss spotting that elusive VW Beetle - the one with the dream girl he had been chasing after for the entire movie - from his airplane window .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As for Scorsese , what would Goodfellas be without Eric Clapton 's \" Layla \" ?Or , for that matter , The Departed minus the Stones ' \" Gimmie Shelter \" ?The fact that Scorsese went on to produce great rockumentaries , like The Band 's Last Waltz , and his biopics on Dylan , George Harrison , and the Rolling Stones , speaks for itself .But for every Stop Making Sense in the history of rock and film , you 'll also find an equally matching piece of genuine dog - crap like The Bee Gees ' disastrous reboot of Sgt .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I mean , what were they thinking ?The amazing , Little Steven - curated soundtrack is what really steals the show though .Rife with all those period - perfect songs from The Beatles , The Rascals , The Kinks , and lesser - knowns like The Left Banke , it fits this film like a well - worn glove .Little Steven , aided by fellow E - Streeters Max Weinberg and Garry W. Tallent , also had a considerable hand in the original songs , all of which strike a perfect chord of ' 60s rock authenticity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not Fade Away pays the necessary lip service to The Beatles that it should .The authenticity of the film would no doubt be in question otherwise .But there is little doubt who the guys in the movie are really fashioning their fledgling little 1960s New Jersey bred rock band after .Which is a little ironic , given just how far the original , scruffy bad boys of rock ( that you would n't want your daughter to marry ) have come , to their current position of reigning , but aging millionaires mostly riding on past glories .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What can a poor boy do , indeed .As tempting as it might be to wallow in the nostalgia of movies like Almost Famous and Not Fade Away , and to wander just where rock and roll lost its way , I prefer instead to consider just how far we have come .Which is certainly miles beyond Hollywood 's earliest attempts at rock and roll cinema ( Beach Blanket Bingo anyone ? )In today 's corporate America , the term \" Rock Star \" has been reduced to something meaningless , or at least something which scantly resembles its original definition .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This past weekend , The Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College summoned its own mighty forces to resurrect a forgotten masterwork based on this trilogy : Sergey Taneyev 's opera , The Oresteia .If you 've never heard of the composer , you are not alone .In many years of attending opera and concerts , I do n't recall seeing his name on a single program .In fact , I had to look him up in the Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music , which notes his work is seldom performed outside of Russia .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He became a highly respected composer and teacher of harmony and orchestration ; his pupils included Scriabin and Rachmaninoff .Apparently , his most influential work was n't a piece of music , but a textbook - \" Invertible Counterpoint in the Strict Style .\" For a piece composed by someone whose forte was pedagogy , The Oresteia turned out to be a wonderful surprise - indeed , a ravishing work .It is modern - flowing continuously from passage to passage without recitative - yet traditional in its romantic tonal language .It is chock - full of melodic expressiveness and gorgeous orchestral writing , such as the beautiful ascending passages for the cello accompanying the duet for Orestes and Elektra in Act 2 , and the lush , inventive use of the harp in Acts 2 and 3 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Conductor and Music Director Leon Botstein , who anchored the production from the pit with his characteristic assurance , aptly described The Oresteia as a beautiful work .It deserves to be heard by a much wider audience .From the beginning , it was clear from the big , powerful voices on stage that the audience would be treated to some first - rate singing .All of the soloists - with the exception of American bass Andrew Funk - were recruited in Russia by producer Susana Meyer and director Thaddeus Strassberger .He told me they auditioned more than 100 singers to find their seven leads .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of the benefits of the Russian cast was their obvious comfort level singing an opera written in their native language .Especially noteworthy was Liuba Sokolova ; as Clytemnestra she used her powerful voice to sing with clarity and passion , and brought dramatic credibility to her character .Tenor Mikhail Vekua sang the demanding role of Orestes with great energy .Though small in stature , he projected a big , ringing sound for most of the night .In a few difficult passages , however , he seemed to hold back ; it was unclear whether he was having difficulty or just pacing himself for the long evening .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It features many stirring choral passages , all of which were sung with gusto by the chorus of professional singers recruited from New York , and ably prepped by Chorus Master James Bagwell and his team of Russian language coaches .The chorus provided a rousing welcome to Agamemnon , as he returned home from the war .But some of their most beautiful music was in response to Cassandra 's lament in Act 1 , and their comment on the deaths of Agamemnon and Cassandra , ending with a plagal cadence on the word \" Amen . \" The chorus members who played The Furies were especially effective .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But no , I was assured they were members of the chorus .Clothed in black lined with red , with red painted mouths , fangs , and spiked hair , they looked something like vampires , which is appropriate for creatures who are supposed to be sucking the life out of Orestes .This brings me to the production 's scenic design by Thaddeus Strassberger , whose work I 've seen before and admired .He chose to place this opera in imperial Russia , rather than ancient Greece .An engineer by training , he took his inspiration from a structure-- the Stieglitz Palace in St. Petersburg .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Holes both round and square are sunk into the stage floor , used throughout the opera as baths , fire pits , and what looked like a giant mirror .While various elements are added or subtracted , this is the set for the entire evening .Sometimes it worked , and sometimes it did n't .For me , the images of ruined mansions , cowed peasants , and imperious nobles worked best in the first two acts .Indeed , the set visually referenced the words of the chorus in The Libation Bearers , when it says \" Rise up , proud house , long , too long your walls lay fallen , strewn along the earth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In addition , the floor of the stage is ripped up in the last act , making it very tricky to walk on .The director told me this was supposed to signify an interior torn apart by The Furies looking for Agamemnon .But judging from the puzzled comments around me , the effect was lost on the audience .And the awkward movement -- the chorus had to walk , single file , around the perimeter of the ripped - up floor -- flattened the mood of the last act , instead of evoking a spirit of triumph and redemption .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "New York audiences are very discerning , and the gentleman next to me commented that the fussy set called attention to itself , at the expense of the singers .Indeed , throughout the evening , singers were tripping on the stage , or losing their footing on the giant wooden logs that were inexplicably strew about .These idiosyncrasies , however , did not derail an otherwise first - rate , musically satisfying production .I traveled from Washington , D.C. to upstate New York to see this opera .I overheard another member of the audience saying he traveled more than 350 miles to attend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
