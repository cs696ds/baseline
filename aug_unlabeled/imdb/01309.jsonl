{"text": "The never - ending question about Smith Ballew - was it really his singing voice that was used by John Wayne in RIDERS OF DESTINY ?One of John Wayne 's early Lone Star / Monogram films was RIDERS OF DESTINY ( 1933 ) , and he portrayed an undercover lawman named \" Singin ' Sandy \" .Forrest Taylor is the brains heavy and Earl Dwire is his gunslinging cohort .In the gunfight scene with Dwire , Wayne strolls down the street warbling \" There 'll be blood a runnin ' in town before night ... tonight you 'll be drinkin ' your drinks with the dead \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Wayne was dubbed of course .Many western film experts say the singing was done by Bill Bradbury , the son of Robert North Bradbury , Sr . and twin brother of Bob Steele ... and my understanding is that Lone Star producer Paul Malvern confirmed this years ago .Whomever and whatever , it was definitely NOT sung by tenor Smith Ballew ( who was on the road with his band during that period ) .Les Adams interviewed Ballew in the mid 1960s , and Ballew confirmed that he did n't do the singing for Wayne .You 'll find Les ' writeup on his interview with Ballew and others on the next page .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He was born in Palestine , Texas on January 21 , 1902 , attended local schools , and wound up at the University of Texas .It was there that Ballew formed his first jazz band .During the next dozen or so years , he became one of the more important figures of the big band era as he put together and fronted several orchestras , was the ' boy singer ' in other bands , and recorded scores of tunes .Around 1934 , Ballew dissolved his last band --- several of the Ballew sidemen , including trombonist / arranger Glenn Miller , drummer Ray McKinley and saxist / clarinetist Skeets Herfurt , joined the Dorsey Brothers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He even sang briefly with Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington .Ballew and Glenn Miller were close .In April , 1935 , Miller was working in the Ray Noble Orchestra as a trombonist , arranger , and even fronted the band on occasion .Miller had an opportunity to record some sides under his own name for Columbia records , and he assembled an orchestra that included trumpeters Charlie Spivak and Bunny Berigan , trombonist Jack Jenny , and pianist Claude Thornhill .The vocalist on two of these recordings , \" A Blues Serenade \" and \" Moonlight On The Ganges \" , was Smith Ballew .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
