{"text": "Like I said at the time , two things it has going for it are that the project reportedly has original Evil Dead director Sam Raimi 's blessing , and director Fede Alvarez says he shot it entirely without CGI .He also says that the raping tree is \" way more terrible than the original , \" for what that 's worth .Fede Alvarez : We did n't do any CGI in the movie .There 's no CGI in the movie .Everything you will see is real , which was really demanding .This was a very long shoot , 70 days of shooting at night .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Obviously agree with what you 're saying that making Evil Dead darker feels ridiculous because it 's supposed to be a sort of wacky horror .But also after Cabin in the Woods , it feels like this is going to be way less fun .The first Evil Dead was kind of bleh .The unintentional humor helped it along , but the camp off the scale in ED2 and army of darkness are what made them cult classics .If the remake does n't have the same vibe , why even bother ? hei the film is really good .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

I watched the remake of Evil Dead this week for the special screening and it was amazing not only was it scary and yes very gory but it kept me glued to the screen the entire time .One of the most suspenseful movies I 've ever seen .I 'm so excited for it to come out I think people will really enjoy it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
