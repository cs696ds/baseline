{"text": "Lemon Heights is a small unincorporated community located off of Skyline Drive and Foothill Blvd , just north of Tustin .When I grew up in Orange County , Lemon Heights was known to us an upscale community , where the \" rich folks \" lived , to get away from the noise and commotion of the city .It apparently was a much different place decades earlier .An OCThen reader named Steve ( no , a different Steve ) , submitted his memories of growing up in Lemon Heights during the 1950 's and 60 's .Eventually , he moved away from Orange County , and then just recently returned for a reunion , only to find a Lemon Heights that looks much different than what he remembered ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My folks had bought a new home in a small secluded neighborhood right in the middle of an orange grove !The area was Lemon Heights .I went to Tustin Elementary for seven and eighth grade and then to Tustin Union High School .The area was pretty much \" laid back \" to say the least !Seventeenth Street was a two lane road running east and west from Newport Blvd all the way to Santa Ana , alot of it covered over with giant fir trees .The area smelled of lemon and orange blossom , eucalyptus and weed oil !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The evening was filled of talk about Tustin , Newport Beach , Corona Del Mar , Santa Ana , Orange County history and rememberance .The next morning I drove to my old neighborhood and very slowly made my way from one street to another the houses were freshly painted for the most part , beautiful lawns and close cropped shrubs , everything looked as if it were from another era !There was not a person on the street or in a yard , almost as if it was deserted , stone quiet !I lingered for a while and finally drove out and headed for home , McCammon Idaho .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In 1975 my family moved to lemon heights so i could attend Mater Dei high school and play basketball .It was a fantastic move .Even in the 70 's and 80 's the tustin hills was so tranquil and yet there was plenty of shopping and entertainment just minutes away .I remember walking to the tustin hills tennis club and meeting friends , playing tennis , bbQ 's , parties at our house . still lots of empty fields around so it felt like living in the country to some extent .Late 80 ' and 90 's brought a big housing boom and developement all around with tustin ranch and orange hills . still a great place to live but i often remember how enchanting and fun and simple those teenage years in tustin hills was .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I still remember the scents and sensations of living in the orchards , of the incredible taste of white peaches that I took from a neighbor 's yard as the fruit was ripening .There were n't that many kids in our neighborhood so we became fast friends with who was there .I went to three different elementary schools because of the fast growing development and baby boom .I actually walked though the orchards to my last school , passing by the weeping willow and the \" scary house .\" When I was about 7 or 8 they started building the large tract development at Newport Ave and Foothill Blvd .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
