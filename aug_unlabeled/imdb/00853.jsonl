{"text": "In order to shoot at least 30 rounds in the time frame outlined by reports , most weapons would require that more than one magazine be used .The largest capacity , civilian legal firearms hold 17 to 18 rounds of ammunition .That means in order for the reports to confirmed , one round must have struck multiple victims on several occasions , a magazine exchange must have been performed , or the shooter was using a non - standard weapon or ammunition source .It is possible that the shooter was using either a Glock 17 with a Glock 18 magazine , or a Glock 18 itself ( or similar ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "If the crowd fired into was dense enough , it 's more than possible that rounds of this sort could have penetrated a second victim upon exiting the primary victim .Full metal jacket ammunition is designed to retain it 's weight and to not mushroom or pancake upon impact , unlike a hollow point or similar round .This design allows it to retain both mass and velocity , and to create a narrower would channel .The narrower wound channel means a more survivable victim requiring medical care in a time of war , which is , presumably , the reason the military uses FMJ or \" ball \" ammunition .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
