{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .Teens are kidnapped on a beach by mechanics to supply blood for aliens .The film used aging campy actors and adult film stars for the nude scenes .Typical 80 's stuff .In fact they could have added the Amber Lynn scene from another film as it was n't well connected .Connie ( G.T. Taylor ) and Heather ( Bridget Holloman ) were delightful .Low budget production .Outtake reel include senior actors forgetting their lines .Guide : sex and FF nudity ( Amber Lynn , Crystal Breeze , Jody Swaffold + one more ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As the two alien orderlies start fondling each other ( seriously ) , the kid decides this a good a time as any to escape .Passing an open doorway he sees three individuals , whom we later learn are named Dr. Kozmar ( Carradine ) , Dr. Zarma ( Newmar ) , and Cora ( Louise ) , babbling on about something .The kid makes his way outside , but not much further than that as he finds himself on the wrong end of an alien power ring .Now it 's daytime and we 're back on the beach by the river .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I suppose one could have fun with this film , given two things ... they know what they 're getting themselves into and second , their expectations are extremely low .Certainly many of these have large enough and dedicated followings to warrant the attention .This Media Blasters / Shriek Show DVD release features a fullscreen picture format ( 1.33:1 ) of the film .The picture quality is decent , but know there is some grain and a good deal of the film takes place at night and the lighting was less than spectacular during shooting .The audio , presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo , comes across okay , but again , it 's nothing spectacular .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's what makes it great and a lot of fun to watch .Anyone who watches the trailer or looks at the movie poster should have an idea of what to expect imo .The acting , the script , the effects , the production quality are all reminiscent of the Roger Corman classics we all ( well some of us including me ) loved from the 60 's 70 's .These are not films you critique , these are films you plop down with a bag of popcorn and few drinks and have some laughs and escape for awhile .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is a fun romp of a film , you do n't try to make sense of it ... you just sit back and roll with it ;) .That all said , B - Movies are not for everyone .You need a sense of humor and the ability to suspend critical thinking for a few hours .And remember , it 's not hard to make a bad film ... what IS hard is making a bad film that 's fun to watch !So enjoy the camp , enjoy the schlock , enjoy the 80s nostalgia and beach fun !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A group of aliens ( in what looks like a Toyota Corolla without wheels ) come to earth and take over a hospital on an island known for summer - break partying .They need platelets from young humans in order to elongate their own lifespans .The rest of the movie is your basic Friday the 13th ripoff .Rustam -- who never directed another big - screen feature ( for obvious reasons)--seemed unsure whether he wanted to make a softcore film or a horror film , and the end result does n't do either very well .There 's a rather surprising amount of full frontal nudity for a film made twenty years ago and given an R rating ; one wonders if they traded the nudity off for anything remotely resembling realistic gore effects .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately , the movie 's special - effect blood never does look much more real .Basically , if I 'd seen this when it came out , while I was still in my teen years , I 'd have probably been mad over it .( Badly ) simulated sex , ( obviously ) ersatz violence , and a real , honest - to - goodness porn star .Now , though , it has n't aged at all well , and was n't terribly fresh to begin with .Take one look at the cast and you know that you 're in for something painful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They are abducted by a race of aliens ( led by Tina Louise , Julie Newmar and John Carradine ) who remove their blood platelets which will increase the aliens ' lifespans .The aliens set up shop in an abandoned hospital and pay bumbling garage mechanics Neville Brand and Aldo Ray ( in career busting performances ) gold coins to help them with the abductions .The aliens need 10 people between the ages of 16 and 24 within the next two days to complete their experiments .The grease jockey duo kidnap and hold three teenagers in their garage while they wait for the aliens to contact them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She fights back and Brand power drills her through the stomach .He goes after the other girl and ends up crushed under an hydraulic car lift .This severely disturbs Ray , who grabs an axe and chops the hospital girl to pieces .The departing aliens kill Ray with a green death ray as payment for a job well done .EVILS contains plenty of gratuitous sex and nudity in its first 30 minutes , but goes for a deep slide after the story kicks in .It 's painful to listen to the actors speak such ridiculous line as : Brand : \" I sure would like to hump one of those girls ! \" Ray : \" Why not ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After Newmar finds Louise 's head caved in on the hospital floor she utters this immortal line : \" She 's been expunged ! \" Triple threat Mardi Rustam ( who directed , produced and wrote this mess and used the same bumbling / raping grease monkey premise in the piecemeal film EVIL TOWN [ 1974/1985 ] ) also executive produced Greydon Clark 's THE BAD BUNCH ( 1976 ) .One question : If the former Ginger , Tina Louise , refused to appear in the GILLIGAN 'S ISLAND reunion TV movies , why did she agree to star in this abomination ( and others , like HELL RIDERS [ 1984 ] ) ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Originally a Lightning Video VHS Release and then available on fullscreen DVD from Media Blasters / Shriek Show .Now available on widescreen DVD from Gorgon Video / MPI Home Video , which also contains the TV Version , which cuts out nearly all the gore and all the nudity , but has extra footage not seen in the theatrical release .Rated R. .This is easy to follow , low - budget , and is simply a trash flick that you can just turn off your brain and watch .It begins quickly with a spaceship landing , and the purpose of the film is just to keep the film simple with sex , nudity , and violence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They then recruit a couple of garage mechanics to help them capture humans .A lot of the film takes place at night , and I thought that the film was usually fast - paced and lively .The film has a good amount of violence , but it does n't have a lot of gore overall .I 've never read anything about this film being cut to receive an R - rating , but there 's a scene when a girl is killed by a drill that looks like it may have been shortened .It made me wonder if there 's more to this scene on the original negative .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , there 's some strong sexual stuff and a good amount of nudity .One scene that is worth mentioning is a lesbian type sequence when a couple of topless women are rubbing lotion on each other on the beach ; scenes like this were n't the norm for horror flicks around that time .The movie is well scored , has some decent locations , not much suspense , and does n't provide a lot of effective atmosphere .I thought the film has a quick pace ; the nudity , sex , and violence begin quickly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
