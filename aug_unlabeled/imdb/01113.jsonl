{"text": "Children 's books can scar you for life ... .Tomorrow would have been the 92nd birthday of author Roald Dahl , creator of such memorable tomes as \" Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , \" \" James and the Giant Peach \" and \" Matilda . \"He was also the author of a collection of short stories called \" The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More \" which absolutely , positively scared the living , breathing daylights out of me as a child and scarred me for months thereafter .I remember my mother accidentally gave me this book when I was maybe 9 or 10 and home sick from school .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's funny looking back at as adult at the types of things that scared you as a child , like a preview of all your future neuroses .That \" Swan \" story scared me not only because of its gruesome nature but because of the bullying ( no fun for a kid who used to get crammed in the occasional locker or two herself ) and the fall from great heights .( Hate heights . )This was a manifestation of my future ability to be an idiot and also my aversion to men in slightly gay capes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Other media also did the trick .I remember being terrified of The Abominable Snowman in \" Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer \" and also this gremlin dude from \" The Twilight Zone \" episode , \" Nightmare at 20,000 Feet , \" starring a semi pre - hammy William Shatner : .Today , I look at that gremlin and see a guy in a cheesy rubber mask but when I was seven , the sight terrified me to such a degree that I was literally frozen in place .I remember trying to scream for my parents to come and turn off the TV for me and not a single squeek emerged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I shake my fist at you , Mr. Serling , and your unsettling tales of the manifestation of 20th century anxieties !( I 'm pretty sure that 's what I wrote in my Hello , Kitty diary once I 'd calmed down ... ) .I ca n't be the only one with these kinds of childhood traumas , though , right ?What books , movies or TV scared you as a kid ?27 comments : .My most clear memory of something like this is of my younger cousin being afraid of the movie \" Ghostbusters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That one still seems creepy to me .I was terrified of ET ( the White room scenes are what did me in , I still ca n't watch that little penis with feet ! ) and Gremlins ( thanks to a bad encounter afterwards which involved a red bed tent and an over ambitious dog ( I thought it was stripe coming to get me in the night ) ) .The movie Fire in the Sky scared me so badly in the 5th grade that I still ca n't watch it to this day .I 've tried , during the day with every light in the house on , but I ca n't get past the abduction scene cos I know what 's coming .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Abominable Snowman , any Gremlin , Garbage Pail Kids , Aunt March from Little Women made me a little nervous , Heffalumps AND Woozles , the Evil Queen in Snow White , and Malifecent .But more than anything , DUMBO and those damn pink elephants scared the living daylights out of me .Oh , and the big flying dog from Neverending Story .Hilariously , I thought Cruella deVille was oh so chic .She was very fashion forward , even with all that fur .For me , when I was young , it was the The Red Pony , the first 5 mins of Jaws and the ' nothing ' that lived in the cave in the Neverending Story ( which also , coincidently , lived in my basement .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The chupacabra lived in my alley and I still cover up the red light from my alarm clock to ward off the moth men .And do n't even mention the Blair Witch Project .And I 've not grown out of my overactive imagination .Now I 'm haunted by Cormac McCarthy 's ' The Road ' .Should n't have read that one .I think I was 8 or 10 when I saw Psycho .I vividly remember being terrified of the bathroom .Showering with the curtain not drawn just so I would nt ' be stabbed to death was well worth having to mop up the bathroom floor when I was finished .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And , ugh , the maggots on the meat - I refused to eat steak for months !I was scared of this weird TV remake of ( I think )Through the Looking Glass .It was similar enough to Disney 's Alice and Wonderland that that was what I was expected , but turned out to have a slight horror twist .It gave me nightmares .I read tons of Roald Dahl when I was young .Strangely enough , I was never affected by his weirdness .After I read the Henry Sugar story , I started staring at candles in hopes of being able to see through things and move objects with my mind .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Last night I was lying down with my son and he points out the window -- there 's a scary man right there !We have to hide !Even though I KNEW that there was n't really a man , I was scared and I could n't look .Oh , I loved being scared as a kid .In fact , I had seen that episode of the Twilight Zone shortly before my first plane - ride when I was three or four years old .I remember being really disappointed that there was nothing hiding on the wing outside my window .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But my all - time most traumatizing movie was Invasion of the Body Snatchers , the version with Donald Sutherland and Jeff Goldblum .I saw it when I was about 11 , and could not even sleep in my room alone that night ( I crashed in my sister 's room ) .Also , I have a random fear of sleeping with my bed under a window that I 'm fairly sure is directly caused by one of those books .( Or possibly a fear of serial killers .Or aliens .Or velociraptors , but it predates Jurassic Park . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I keep reading and watching sci - fi and horror .Oops .I know Jaws has been mentioned but no other show , book or movie has left such lasting psychological trauma for me .My friend had cable and we watched it even though our mothers told us not to .Amanda and I hid behind the couch at the scary parts .Forget the ocean , lakes or other natural bodies of water .Imagine being a rational 30 year old woman who is afraid of the deep end of the swimming pool .Damn you , Spielberg !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of my first memories is her giant body on screen , and then me outside the theatre bawling my eyes out .This post was hilariously timely for me , because I just had a discussion with someone the other day about short stories , and I brought up Dahl 's The Swan .Man that was a disturbing story for sure , but I read it when I was older and thus not utteryly and completely terrified .Oh !Once my dad and I went to see a random dialogue - less movie version of the nutcracker ( no dancing either ) , and it freaked me out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Which freaked me out , and my father teasing me about it ( not seriously , just the \" boo ! \" kind of teasing ) just freaked me out even more .I 've since found a description of Reptilicus here and read a review here .What the hell was I worried about ?Sleestacks ( sp ? ) from Land of the Lost .The Dungeons and Dragons cartoon scared the socks off me when I was little .Just the idea that they could never get home .Sob .It unnerved me in Quantum Leap too ; adventures are good but being trapped and never , ever being able to get home , no matter how much you might want to , scares me silly , even now .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Two people would be wearing all black cat - suits , but their faces were masks that could be changed like molding clay .They would jump around like frogs or spiders , then reach up with their hands and remold their face .Freaked me out .Ran out of the room .Oh , an ET scared the living crap out of me .I was always afraid that he was hiding in MY closet in MY big pile of stuffed animals .Talk about trauma .I know I 'm dating myself with this post , but someone else mentioned the Sleestacks ( scared the crap out of me and gave me nightmares ) so I know there 's at least one other thirty - something posting here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "First one to get to me was the original Battlestar Galactica 's version of the Cylons .Those big scary metal guys with their mechanized voices .Holy Crap .But the worst of the worst was Golem .Golem in that cute little cartoon version of the Hobbit shouting about his precious and covered in goo .Blech and shiver .I could n't sleep for a week after my parents took me to see that movie .Remember The Electric Company on PBS ?Remember how Rita Moreno would scream out \" HEY YOU GUYS ! ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That scared me so much as a little kid , especially since it came on after Mr. Rogers and I 'd be all peaceful and mellow .Even though I knew it was coming , it 'd scare me every time .So as Mr. Rogers was changing out of his duds to go home , I 'd hide in a closet and wait for Mom 's \" all clear \" to come out and watch the rest of the show .Pinocchio , too .When the boys started turning into donkeys I was horrified .I still feel unsettled watching it as an adult .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Incredible Hulk tv show -- I very vividly remember being 2 or 3 and screaming and running behind my grandmother 's rocking chair when Lou Ferrigno in his sickly green makeup with his sickly green hair and INSANELY creepy eyeballs came on the screen .It still makes my tummy feel not quite right when I think if it .And Santa Claus .Yep -- I remember being about 5 when someone told me he was the \" spirit \" of Christmas .I 'm very glad that , for whatever reason , the fear left me by the following Christmas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think the Babar books contributed to my fear of mushrooms when I was a kid , since the previous king had died after eating bad ' shrooms .There was one that always grew in the same place in our back yard every year , and it scared me to death .There also used to be a series of commercials for Neo - Synephrine in which the bottle appeared on a nightstand and appeared to breathe .That , too , frightened the daylights out of me .If you 've ever read the book version of Pinocchio , it 's even more messed up than the Disney movie ... of course I did n't read it until I was old enough to dig the morbid parts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
