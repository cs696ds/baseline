{"text": "Kane , 39 , has expressed to WWE management that he plans on retiring soon , perhaps as early as January 2007 .Kane told management that he has accomplished all he can in his career .Should Kane retire , it wo n't affect his See No Evil film deal as he signed a contract for a sequel to the movie .One source within WWE said , \" Kane is the most respected guy in the Raw locker room .He carries himself very professionally and it would be ashame to end his career without a decent title run .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even though he 's technically on RAW , there was some thought to giving him a title win at Judgment Day or No Way Out , but those plans were nixed .Another source said that when Kane was asked about a possible future title reign he said , \" It 's time for the younger guys to shine .\" Before his departure , Kane would like to be involved with Bobby Lashley , Randy Orton and John Cena .He would also like to reunite with The Undertaker as a tag team .Additionally , The Undertaker has expressed to management that Kane could possibly be the one to end his undefeated Wrestlemania streak .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I always respected Kane and his abilities , but I respect him even more nixing his own title reign to let younger stars shine , and for keeping the Undertakers ' streak alive .It 's nice to know there are some selfless people in wrestling , and that Glen Jacobs is a really nice guy .Comments ?Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take , but by the number of moments that take our breath away .I 've been telling Kathy and Travis ( the wrestline newbies ) that Kane is maybe the best big guy ever , and it 's because of his ability to work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It ca n't breathe well .If he does hang it up soon , I 'd like to see him carry the belt for a true , full title reign .Nothing asterisked or buried in another star 's constant title presence .Wow , that 's surprising to hear .Raw would be rather odd without Kane there .Kane was one of my favorite wrestlers back as a mark and just hearing how selfless he is gives me a new respect for the guy .That and this man spent a solid four years in my hometown playing football and getting his teaching degree .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And it 's great to hear some positive press about a wrestler as opposed to the usual dreck that 's peddled as fact .I hope that , if he does decide to hang it up in January , they give him the send - off he 's earnt .To those who say people would n't look ; they would n't be interested ; they 're too complacent , indifferent and insulated , I can only reply : There is , in one reporter 's opinion , considerable evidence against that contention .But even if they are right , what have they got to lose ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This instrument can teach , it can illuminate ; yes , and it can even inspire .But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends .Otherwise it is merely wires , and lights , in a box .-Edward R. Murrow .I absolutely LOVE to hear about guys volluntarily retiring from professional wrestling .But when I read this story last night , I could nt quite wrap my head around this paragraph : .Kane has stated several times that his 24 hour title reign in 1998 does not bother him , however , many within WWE ( including Vince McMahon ) feels as though that Kane has been bothered that he has not gotten another title reign in his career .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So people , including Vince , feel that he HAS in fact been bothered by the 24 hour reign ?Or maybe people , including Vince , have themselves been bothered by his 24 hour reign ?Man that sencence is jacked up .And finally , I think Kane being the one to break Taker 's WM streak would be awesome .The dude sounds like a great guy & all ( which is extremely refreshing in this business ) , but I 'm not going to lie and say I 'll miss him , or that he needs a title reign , or anything .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He definitley should NOT break Taker 's streak .I do n't care for Taker , either , but they should n't waste that rub on a guy on his way into retirement .It 's very unlikely .An easily forgettable stipulation of that First Blood Match was that if Kane lost he 'd set himself on fire .Hot - shotting the title to him for 24 hours was necessary .WWE made the right call after seeing how WCW 's Human Torch Match played out in 2000 .Triple H 's Theme ---------------------- .Time to flame the lame ... time to flame the lame .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "..Man that sencence is jacked up .I knew something was nt right .Kane \" is not contemplating retirement ( in the story ) , \" Glenn Jacobs \" is .I do n't read the Torch or Observer or any other newsletter , but I 'd hope they would actually distinguish between the two .From what I have seen , they do , especially in matters like this dealing with behind - the - scene decisions .I think the Observer would look pretty foolish saying \" Kane \" is retiring .Originally posted by LanceJr You just do n't get it ... there are people who do n't know who Glen Jacobs is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
