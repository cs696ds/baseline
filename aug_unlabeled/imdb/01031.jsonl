{"text": "Product Description .Already a worldwide phenomenon with huge media coverage , COLIN is the first zombie movie told from the zombie 's perspective , it is a film truly like no other .Our hero Colin is bitten by a zombie ; he dies and returns as one of the undead .We follow him as he wanders through suburbia during the throes of a cadaverous apocalypse .Through his encounters , we learn who Colin was and more pertinently , what he has now become .Including a broad daylight zombie versus human street battle , an epic house - bound siege and bags of gore .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I had not heard of Colin before being seeing it at the Flyway Film Festival 's International Zombie Summit in October of 2009 .I was intrigued by the poster art , and the film 's rumored $ 70 budget - but mostly by the long overdue concept of telling this type of story from the inside out .You see , Colin is a zombie movie - but it 's told from the zombie 's point of view .A zombie named Colin .The best zombie films often make us think about what it means to be Human .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No one has really done this better than Romero , whose subtext is often social and political and speaks of The Big Picture .In the opening moments of this film we watch our protagonist die with no real sense of who he is .He shortly awakens - undead - with even less of a sense of his identity than we have .Colin is reduced to a relentless core of need that is nameless - but that drives him on an obscure journey to reconnect with the phantom limb of his humanity .However , as intense and enjoyable as these moments are , they often have little to do with Colin 's story , which is gradually told through flashbacks both intimate and personal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a strength that may alienate Colin from fans of horror culture junk food , but is likely to win new fans who just like good movies , and enjoy a little nutrition when faced with so many empty calories .In the world of horror cinema ( and especially within the zombie sub - genre ) it 's not often that a film this quiet and unique gets made , and somewhat shocking when it gets noticed .YOU ARE THE CONSUMER AND WE ARE THE EXPERTS AND YOU'LL WATCH ANYTHING WE MAKE EVEN WHEN WE INSULT YOUR VIEWING INTELLIGENCE \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The story of Colin is told as if you - the viewer - actually matter .Ultimately Colin - like its haunted score , written by Daniel Weekes and Jack Elphick - is modest and quiet and keeps to itself .It 's an hypnotic , lingering study in Zombiance that shows though the body may be dead - the soul does n't go so easily , making it almost more of a ghost story .He stumbles about lost , looking for pieces of himself to form a breadcrumb trail - more a victim of amnesia and long - term introspection than a shambling corpse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Wow , so many 5 star reviews !An example of a 5 star indie film in my opinion would be the EVIL DEAD , and not COLIN .At 5 stars you really have nowhere else to go as that is the summit .Do we really believe that these two films are on par with each other and that there is little room for improvement ?I think not .Although they have a similar pedigree ; indie / small budget / undead cinema fare , the EVIL DEAD is sooo much better despite its extreme vintage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are a number of films that portrayed that at least to some degree .One of them is I , ZOMBIE , ( 1999 ) , though it spent more time detailing the physical and psychological changes that afflicted the hapless victim as he turned .The same Director was also responsible for DEAD CREATURES ( 2001 ) , which told a similar tale of Zombie lifestyle , ( see my review on Amazon ) .COLIN is an extremely tedious and ponderous film .I continually found myself watching the clock as it never seemed to \" jump \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The undead victim in COLIN eventually turned into a half decent stage 3 Zombie , though the pay off was too little and too late .Lots of flaws , like after feeding there was no blood on his face , weird sub plots that did not work well, ... and the camera work stunk .For example , much of the film is under exposed and the action shots feature that irritating hand held filming technique which has been worked to death .All of this made the film fatiguing to watch , while it obscured the gore .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On the plus side COLIN is a serious attempt at Horror that featured the classic Romero shambler type zombies .Also , thankfully this was not a \" Zomedy \" , ( which would have totally sunk it ) .There certainly was a stab at making this a decent entry into the Zombie film field , though it comes up short .Stick with the above noted Andrew PARKINSON films , especially I , ZOMBIE ( though it also falls into my marginal category ) .Curiously , the keep case lists COLIN 's run time at 165 minutes though my DVD clocked it at a still bloated 137 minutes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nonetheless , I recognize the effort put into COLIN though there is no escaping the fact that it is a boring , poorly paced , marginal Zombie film .While many apparently disagree , I refuse to bow to the \" Emperor 's New Clothes Syndrome \" and pay undue homage to a film just because of the circumstances that surround its production .As the film maker decided to take the plunge , then take the heat and get on with it .I absolutely agree to give the film maker kudos especially when one considers what he had to work with , but please do not insult the intelligence of the thoughtful film community with all of these maximum ratings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I bought this film due to the very good reviews many provided .It is an interesting idea - a zombie flick told from the point of view of the Zombie .Unfortunately that is a concept that , while interesting , is entertaining for a short period of time .There are scenes that move SOOOO slowly that my friends and I were shouting \" come on already \" and several friends took a break and came back , and said \" what did I miss ?\" we replied - nothing , it is still the same scene .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Seeing the world from a camera that is shaking frequently ( to see things from the Zombie Colin 's point of view ) becomes an irritable headache in short order .The film dragged and the entire tale could have been told effectively in 40 minutes .It does have redeeming moments and I enjoyed watching the end of the film , a flashback to how he received his zombie - virus infection .That was lovely and gave the film and character more depth .The acting was quite good .The long sequences of shaking camera , extended zombie attack scene in a house with many people just doing zombie moaning and groaning and attacking uninfected humans for about 15 minutes was just silly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , if you have a good fast forward button , and can watch the key scenes and fast forward the ones that drag on interminable , it 's an okay film .Not great , but okay ( one of my friends walked out - not able to be patient with how slow the film was ) .Hope this helps some of you decide if the film is for you or not !As a huge fan of this genre , I have to give this movie top marks for a novel idea - the main character is a zombie ... slowly decomposing as he lurches through town looking for a bite to eat .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The main idea being NOT to feel any sympathy for the carnivorous corpses one encounters along the way .But in this case you do .I liked that .However , great idea aside , it needed more capable hands to pull it off successfully .The pacing plods , the lighting is inconsistent at best ( two long bewildering scenes are so dark nothing can be made of them ) , the sound at times is annoyingly mechanical ( on purpose or a mistake ? ) , the dialog is sparse , there really is n't a story , the flashback hurt rather than helped , and as for character development ... well , the main character is rotting before our eyes ( I do n't believe that counts ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
