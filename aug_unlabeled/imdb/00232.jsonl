{"text": "Rise of the Cybermen / The Age of Steel in Perspective .David Selby takes a trip back to 2006 to look at the first Cybermen story of the revival .On many occasions , I 've defended the divisive Cyberman revival story for the new series , which is often slated by fans - particularly those who were fans of the classic Cyberman design .Recently , I had the opportunity to re - watch Rise of the Cybermen / The Age of Steel .And , as with all previous viewings , I absolutely adored them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Parallel world - and my Dad 's still alive ... \" .For a sci - fi show , Doctor Who seldom explores parallel worlds .In fact , the last ( and only other time ) a parallel universe was ever featured on Doctor Who before Rise of the Cybermen was in 1970 serial Inferno , when the Doctor was thrown into a parallel universe where a drilling project had gone horribly wrong .Rise of the Cybermen actually inspired me to watch Inferno , which soon after became my second favourite classic serial .Whilst the Pertwee classic was a tough one to rival , Rise of the Cybermen in particular excels in its depiction of the ' alternate universe ' ; a world where everything is the same but slightly different .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Whilst it 's a lot like our world , this other Earth is hazardous and alluring , and this is apparent throughout the whole episode .I also admire MacRae 's attempts to experiment with the characters , their personalities and their motives in this story .What would Jackie Tyler be like without Rose ?What would her relationship with Pete be like if he was still alive ?How would Pete change with success ?They 've got more money than they know what to do with , but as the old saying says : money ca n't buy happiness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The scene where Pete reveals that he 's split up with Jackie evokes poignancy because it was expected by both Rose and the audience that they 'd live a happy life together - here MacRae is testing audience expectations and composition of a familiarly harsh reality .\" Skin of metal ... and a body that will never age or die .I envy it .\" I firmly believe that this is the closest portrayal of the Cybermen to Kit Pedler 's original concept : the result of surgical implants and the horrific consequences of humanity 's most terrifying survival instinct .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This approach allows for some imaginative twists to the original , it is a different world and thus does n't undermine the classic series , and moreover opens up the possibility that the Cybermen could actually do some damage .Inferno was so powerful because all of the characters from the parallel universe were killed in the end - it stresses the potential danger of the drilling project .The same applies for Rise of the Cybermen / The Age of Steel : without doing any physical damage to our world , we see how society can be torn apart by this kind of technological revolution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's the ' iPhone gone mad ' notion , and it 's quite a disturbing one .I liked the addition of the ' stompy ' boots , because it shows horrific uniformity , a lacking humanity , and completely programmed life - not even a life ; a half - life , because without free will , it 's not alive , is it ?It 's a shame that McRae 's brilliant two - parter is so heavily overlooked , because it could be the catalyst of some very deep philosophical debates .I also like the idea that the Cybermen pity us for our pain - they ca n't appreciate that it 's our most tragic days that define us and make us who we are now .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And that 's exactly it .With no imagination , there are no further advancements ; with no further advancements , the Cybermen will begin to regress .This industrial reform is its own worst enemy .\" I will upgrade only with my last breath ... \" .John Lumic was one of Doctor Who 's finest supporting characters , and one of the adversaries with the most depth .He was driven solely by his impending death .That 's why the Cybermen progressed quicker in that world ; Lumic was determined and did n't have long left .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It separates him from the rest of mortality .I love the idea that whilst Lumic had planned all of this , he was too scared to upgrade .And hence he had the best comeuppance : his own invention destroyed him .\" There 's no choice , Doctor .It 's got to be done ... \" .What a clever ending The Age of Steel had .The Cybermen were n't blown up by love , or killed by the Doctor - they just got their emotions back .It was a very tragic resolution to the episode , and quite distressing in parts , but was done just right for family viewing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Can we do that ? \" /\"We've got to .Before they kill everyone else ... \" ) beforehand , too ; it gave the story some realism .\" I 'm not an idiot !Have you got that ? \" The thing that I love most of all about this story is Mickey 's magnificent character development .It 's all quite sudden , actually ; by School Reunion , he 's racked up the confidence to travel with the Doctor , and then two stories later , he 's living his own life .It stems from the fact that Mickey knows he 's the TARDIS gooseberry , and that 's quite a sad thought .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And as Mickey explains to the Doctor , he 's always going to put her first .He 's tired of being the tin dog , and you can hardly blame him .There are a number of scenes where MacRae plays with the Doctor and Mickey 's dynamic : on the hill scene , Mickey surprises the Doctor with his newly - found confidence , but the Doctor grows to respect this later on .Would you do the same as Mickey ?I think I would .His decisions are fully merited - I know that if one of my loved ones was still alive out there , I 'd stay with them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As Mickey says goodbye , Rose finally comes to realise how much he actually meant to her , but knows that she 'll still stay with the Doctor .That 's the pinnacle of this unlikely TARDIS trio .Conclusion .I really love this story .It 's deep and poignant in meaning and grand and apocalyptic in scope .It 's hugely underrated , and I think even Gaiman will struggle to rival it with Nightmare in Silver .COMMENT GUIDELINES .Please be civil and keep article comments relevant and on topic .Flag and report any offensive / trolling behavior , or contact us with details .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "We know there are two Mickeys .We know about their Gran and about Pete Tyler being alive in this universe .\" Rise of the Cybermen \" set the pieces up , \" The Age of Steel \" knocks 'em down .And what 's more , it does it in style .I found the episode 's opening hilarious - after all that hype and all that build up the Doctor just uses that TARDIS battery or whatever it was to disable the marauding Cybermen closing in for the kill .What a cop out !It makes the sonic screwdriver look like a sophisticated plot device !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As with last week the surprises kept on coming , although unlike last week , I was quite disappointed them .Having Pete turn out to be the Preachers ' informant , working against Lumic , seemed like a bit of an easy way to get Pete over with the audience .I preferred him as an ordinary , money - grabbing Del Boy - a wide boy , but a wide boy with his heart in the right place .Moreover , having Ricky turn out to be London 's Most Wanted \" for parking tickets \" was equally disappointing , especially considering Noel Clarke 's intense performance in the previous episode .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just like that , he 's dead .\"Who ?\" I hear you ask .Exactly !I guess I was being a bit daft for thinking that they might kill Mickey off , but considering how some companions have fared in previous Cybermen stories it is n't unprecedented !When I saw Noel Clarke running down that road , I really did n't know whether it was Mickey or Ricky that had been ' deleted ' by the Cybermen .Thankfully , Mickey had n't ' done an Adric ' and from that point on we were treated to one of the most nail biting , edge - of - the - seat Doctor Who episodes ever .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Rise of the Cybermen \" was set primarily in daylight with night only falling as the Cybermen rose , and although last week 's visuals were technically more impressive , I found \" The Age of Steel \" 's darker , grittier look much more appealing .The Zeppelin hovering above Battersea Power Station is a particularly powerful image ; it looked like something torn out of the pages of a graphic novel .Even more disturbing were the scenes of London 's inhabitants willingly walking like cattle into the Power Station ; into their doom !As for the Cybercontroller - wow !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A gigantic dome on the top of a normal Cyberman 's head looks atrociously bad .A Cyberman with eyes of blazing light and his gigantic brain visible , however , is far more effective .It 's a pity that we did n't get to see as much of Roger Lloyd Pack in the flesh this week , but at least we had the consolation of having him voice the Cybercontroller that Lumic is ' upgraded ' to .\" Why am I cold ?Why so cold ?Where 's Gareth ?He ca n't see me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Ouch .As well as being an episode absolutely crammed full of action , \" The Age of Steel \" is also a very moving story .The Doctor realises that the key to bringing down these Cybermen is to find that code that deactivates their emotional inhibitor chips , driving them mad with the knowledge of what they have become .Of course , if he did that he would be dishing out immense suffering on what are , at the end of the day , innocent victims .It 's an intriguing dilemma , but in the end the Doctor has to save the world - no matter what .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's heart breaking .The story of Angela Price - Mrs. Moore - is equally sad .Mrs. Moore did n't do much last week , but in this episode she really gets drawn into the action and enjoys a fantastic adventure alongside the Doctor before her inevitable demise .My money was on Pete for the chop after Ricky bought the bullet , but in retrospect I can see exactly why MacRae killed off the alternate Jackie instead .Not only do we have to see her as a Cyberman - how weird is that ? - at the end of the episode we are left with a widowed Jackie in our universe and a widowed Pete in another .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the old Cybermen stories , whenever a character we knew became a Cyberman ( Lytton , for example ) we never saw them ' finished ' , for want of a better word .We 'd always see their face .Hear their voice .There would always be some clue . \"The Age of Steel \" comes at things from a completely knew angle - the \" which one was it ? \" angle .We met the Jackie Cyberman , and then she vanished into the crowd and could have been any one of their uniform number .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even your face .The ending was absolutely fantastic .It was so rewarding to see Mickey absolutely kick ass !He pilots a Zeppelin ( all those hours on the Playstation came in handy ! ) , baits a Cyberman , hacks into a computer and saves the world .On top of that , he even demonstrates a different type of courage , standing up to Ricky 's friend Jake and refusing to leave without the Doctor , Rose and Pete .And so the idiot saves the world .Of course , the Doctor helps - luckily his spiel about \" ordinary , stupid , brilliant people ... some idiot ... \" did n't fall upon deaf ears !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was sure Pete was dead , especially when the sonic screwdriver did n't work immediately ; it was so , so well done .I also enjoyed the shot of the Cybermen looking in the mirror and letting out a painful , mechanical howl .MacRae did everything right with his script .Doctor Who stalwart Graeme Harper , the first classic series director to return , did everything right and more .As for the actors ... there 's not a bad performance in there .Tennant , Piper , Pack , Dingwall , Coduri and Helen Griffin ( Mrs. Moore ) all give 110 % , Andrew Hayden Smith ( Jake ) is n't bad , and Noel Clarke completely steals the show - just as he should if this is indeed his swansong .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dad . \" \" Just do n't . \" Or Pete , for that matter .\" Nothing wrong with a van .I once saved the universe with a big yellow truck ... \" .Out of six episodes this year , half of them have ended on tearjerkers .I have no objection at all to pathos and such ' soap ' elements in Doctor Who ; I feel that the ' real life ' element they bring to the show only add to the magic and somehow make it all much more real .Rose obviously does n't want to leave Mickey behind because they 've been through so much together and probably because subconsciously , he 's her backup .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" We had something a long time ago , but not anymore .\" Gags about the Cybermen 's marching sounding like Wallace 's \" Wrong Trousers \" aside , this two - parter has certainly been handled brilliantly by all involved .To be fair , I was never a massive fan of the Cybermen in the classic series , but after a trip on this phenomenal roller coaster ride I can not wait until they come back .That final shot of the episode , the shooting star or whatever it was ... something following in the TARDIS 's wake , perhaps ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Again , Loose Cannon takes the telesnaps and the audio track and improves on them with animated Cybermen mouths , etc . to keep the viewer interested and the end result is very good .This is the second Cyberman story in the 4th season , the first being The Tenth Planet which introduced the Cybermen .While The Tenth Planet was Hartnell 's last story , it was still in the 4th season .Apparently the script for The Moonbase was commissioned while The Tenth Planet was still airing due to positive fan reactions to the Cybermen .It was originally written with just Ben and Polly as companions and the introduction of Jamie required the script to be reworked a bit so that Jamie spends part of the story in sickbay and takes some of Ben 's lines for the rest of it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , unlike many of the other recurring foes , the Cybermen have a slightly different appearance almost every time they appear with the \" handles \" on their heads remaining one of the constants .In this case , the sock puppet faces from The Tenth Planet have been replaced by more realistic looking metallic helmets / heads .Their voices are also quite different in this story and I found them a little hard to understand at times .Fans have explained the changes in the appearance of the Cybermen : they are cybernetic and are constantly upgrading themselves to be better .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": ":) The Cybermen in this story are certainly even more impressive and alien than the ones from The Tenth Planet .I said I was n't going to nitpick , but there are a couple of plot points in this story that do n't quite work for me : .Polly , upon first catching a fleeting glimpse of a Cyberman , tells everyone it 's the Cybermen .They comment that the Cybermen were all killed , then seem to forget about the Cybermen .It seems to take them a while to come back to the realization that it is indeed the Cybermen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many comments are made about the Cybermen being killed when Mondas was destroyed in The Tenth Planet , but there 's never really any explanation for how these Cybermen survived .The Cybermen want to destroy all life on Earth , not for revenge , but to eliminate all threats .That seems a little weak for a reason .I guess they need some reason though , unlike the Daleks , who just want to exterminate everything that 's not a Dalek .After the Doctor defeats them , the Cybermen ships are seen hurtling out of control presumably into the Sun , but I 'm not sure what 's to keep more Cybermen from returning and attacking the moobase ... perhaps these were the only two Cyberman ships in the area ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": ":) It was very suspenseful and had good pacing .Even with the minor points I mentioned above , it mostly worked and told a good story .:) Besides , the spacesuits in this story were at least a little more believable than what they used in The Web Planet .;) I also thought it was interesting that the Cybermen know the Doctor even though they 've never met this incarnation : \" You are known to us .\" The Daleks also seem to know the Doctor most of the time after a new regeneration .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
