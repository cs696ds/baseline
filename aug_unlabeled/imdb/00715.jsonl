{"text": "Pages .Lupe Fiasco 's song \" Bitch Bad \" has been out for a couple months , but the video has just been released , which has reopened the floor to criticism .The song follows two narratives , one of a girl who grows up watching video girls and is conditioned to emulate them herself .The other is a boy who grows up watching his mother sing along to songs about \" bad bitches , \" so he grows up to associate that with power ( and his mother ) .When the two meet later in life , the boy does n't see the girl as emulating the good parts of \" bitch \" that he 's grown up with , he just sees a BAD bitch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So if Lupe Fiasco or any other black male hip - hop artist takes the time out to say STOP ! , I 'll ride for that effort and hope that the fair criticism propels him to another level the next time around .I 'm not a huge fan of this song , but I think Fiasco is trying to come from a good place , and the subject definitely is prime for more discussion in hip hop .I am conflicted about my own uses of the word \" bitch .\" It is a word that I think , I use too often .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
