{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .That was the worst POS I have ever watched in my life .I thought that Yor , The Hunter from the Future was the worst film ever made , but at least it had genuine action scenes , a linear plot , and something vaguely resembling a point .Tales of the Ancient Empire fails at even the most rudimentary things that people take for granted , things that exist even in bad films .If I had bought this , I would have returned it and demanded my money back on the grounds that Lionsgate is fradulantly deceiving the public into believing they were buying a movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I believe that the filmakers simply ran out of money before completing the film and put together what footage they had .There 's no other explanation .Entire passages , including both the prologue and climax , are done through narraration and ink drawings , with the actors stepping in to deliver dialogue .Everything is out of sequence , but not in a cool Taratino sort of way , but apparently done because it was the only way to splice the footage together .The CGI is laughable .They apparently did n't have the resources or money to do a proper render on their sequences , so they just used the test renders instead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
