{"text": "Followers .Tommorow is Hallowe'en , so naturally my mind is on horror movies today .Of course , the thought of horror movies brings to mind the classic monster movies released by Universal in the Thirties and Forties .Most film historians and films buffs agree that Universal 's release of Dracula in 1931 marked the beginning of a Golden Age for horror films ; however , there is no such agreement as to when this Golden Age ended .Some believe that the Golden Age ended in 1948 with the release of Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

Cavanaugh as to what consulted a good \" thriller .\" The three men disagreed as to whether horror and black comedy could be included under the heading of \" thriller , \" whether graphic violence was necessary within a thriller , and nearly everything else about the show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Of course , the thought of horror movies brings to mind the classic monster movies released by Universal in the Thirties and Forties .Most film historians and films buffs agree that Universal 's release of Dracula in 1931 marked the beginning of a Golden Age for horror films ; however , there is no such agreement as to when this Golden Age ended .Some believe that the Golden Age ended in 1948 with the release of Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein .Others believe that it ended in 1936 with the release of Dracula 's Daughter .By this time horror movies had been banned in Britain and as a result the possible box office that the American studios could see from any horror movie was drastically reduced .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "With the success of Son of Frankenstein , Universal was back in the business of making horror movies .With 1940 , they returned to the subject of mummies .Contrary to popular belief , The Mummy 's Hand was not a sequel to 1932 's The Mummy .In fact , the mummy of The Mummy 's Hand , Kharis , was not even related to the mummy of The Mummy , Imhotep .Of course , the plots of the two movies are similar .In both an Egyptian tomb is disturbed and in both the mummy who resided in that tomb wreaks his vengeance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Unlike previous versions of the tale , the 1941 version did not depend heavily upon makeup to denote the difference between Jekyll and Hyde , but rather upon Spencer Tracy 's acting talent .Also in 1941 , Warner Brothers released The Hidden Hand , another film dealing with a spooky old house .In 1942 Twentieth Century Fox released Dr. Renault 's Secret , featuring George Zucco in the title role ( Zucco virtually made a career of playing mad doctors ) .In this film Renault has broken the evolutionary barrier and figured out how to turn apes into men .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Indeed , by 1944 it became apparent that Universal had mined the genre much too deeply .The days of upscale horror movies with quality production were over at Universal .Instead , the studio sought to repeat the success of Frakenstein Meets the Wolf Man by featuring its iconic monsters ( Dracula , Frankenstein 's Monster , and the Wolf Man ) all in one film .The first of these was House of Frankenstein , released in 1944 .House of Frankenstein featured Boris Karloff as scientist Gustav Niemann , who has been trying to revive the dead just as Frankenstein had , and Lon Chaney Jr. once more as the Wolf Man .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dracula , played by John Carradine , appears only in the first half of the film , while the Frankenstein Mosnter ( played by Glenn Strange ) spends most of his time strapped to a table .Despite this , House of Frankenstein is an enjoyable film , particularly for Karloff 's peformance as the mad Dr. Niemann and Chaney 's performance as the tormented Talbot .The success of House of Frankenstein led to a second \" monster mash \" movie , House of Dracula , released in 1945 .The film features both Lawrence Talbot and Count Dracula seeking out the kindly Dr. Edelmann for a cure to their conditions ( althogh Dracula does seem to have another agenda entirely on his mind ... ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

Cavanaugh as to what consulted a good \" thriller .\" The three men disagreed as to whether horror and black comedy could be included under the heading of \" thriller , \" whether graphic violence was necessary within a thriller , and nearly everything else about the show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
