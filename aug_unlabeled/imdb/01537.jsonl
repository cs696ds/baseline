{"text": "The main cast comprises a scientific team charged with recovering an off course test rocket .The cast of fairly well - known actors does little to stem the pain of the film 's padding accomplished through endless rock climbing sequences , but those elements did elevate this episode to a kind of cult status both within the show and among the MST3 K fan base early on .References to rock climbing and other elements of this film abound throughout later episodes of MST3 K for years to come .Every fan of the show should see this episode for that reason alone , but do n't let me forget to mention that it 's absolutely hilarious .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And did I mention rock climbing ?So is the evil dictator , Cleolanta ( Patsy Parsons ) , who in this episode is scheming to destroy another inhabited \" moon \" before it collides with her own planet .The wayward moon is ruled by the affable Bavarro , played by John Banner , later of Hogan 's Heroes fame .Read more ' .10 Comments 81 of 87 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .July 13th is another big day in the life of all MST3 K fans as Volume 18 hits the stores .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Let 's take a look at what we have EPISODE 208 # THE LOST CONTINENT - This was a great surprise as most of us thought Robert Lippert movies ( this one , Rocketship XM , Jungle Goddess , etc ) seemed like they would not be attainable .For those that have seen it - this was exciting .For those who have nt this is a great episode in the 2nd season .They track it up a mountain on a plateau .They need to climb a mountain to get to the rocket .We get to see every second of what is called by MST3 K fans & well as Dr. Forrester and TV 's Frank as ' Rock Climbing ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They harp on it so much that Joel does n't get to do his invention exchange .This invention would turn up in the next episode Hellcats actually .Rock Climbing is actually worse than the sandstorm theme in Hercules vs the Moon Men as the Rock Climbing scenes last for a long while during the movie .When the cast reaches the top they find the ' Lost Continent ' with some pretty cool Dinosaurs .The black & white film turns to a nice greenish color when the dinosaurs appear .The 2 female characters are hardly in it - Acquanetta & Hillary Burke .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This episode also contained the \" Cool Thing \" which would n't be revealed until the 3rd Season .I personally love this episode and is my favorite from this set ...Read more ' .5 Comments 41 of 43 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I am buying this mainly for \" Beast of Yucca Flats .\"The other ones are all very funny too , but Beast is classic .You wo n't believe how it 's filmed .You never see any of the actors talk , whenever someone speaks the camera turns away from them from what I recall .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also , \" Progress Island USA \" is a great short , one of my faves out of all of the shorts .It 's a travelogue about Puerto Rico , and you 'll be saying , \" OK !We 'll move there ! ! \" for days after you see it .For newbie fans : these are hilarious .Watch with a group ! 2 Comments 13 of 14 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .This MST3k box set of four episodes has the balance I most like to see when the episode titles are first announced .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Further more , the movies themselves illustrate the grand variety of bad film - making tackled by MST3k : the impenetrably dull , the silly , the mind - bogglingly strange and the over - the - top goofy .LOST CONTINENT ( 1951 ) .This film is infamous among MST3k fans for its seemingly endless scenes of characters slowly ascending the side of a mountain .Rock climbing , Joel , rock climbing .On the surface , this looks like it would be a fun B - movie to watch .It 's got Cesar Romero , Hugh Beaumont and John Hoyt ( the ship 's doctor in the first Star Trek pilot ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But LOST CONTINENT is not a lot of fun .Some MST3k episodes feel like a crazy adventure .A goofy movie with a fast and witty riffing track can make the hour and a half fly past in no time .But then there are other episodes .Episodes where - even with the distracting and entertaining soundtrack - you feel like you 're stuck in the writing room of Best Brains , unable to leave the movie and resume your normal and happy life .LOST CONTINENT is such an episode - an episode that 's a test of endurance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
