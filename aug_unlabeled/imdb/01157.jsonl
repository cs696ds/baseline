{"text": "Darlene was no stranger to illness and pain .She had rheumatoid arthritis , an autoimmune inflammatory condition affecting the joints , for more than 30 years .When the disease first struck her , she lost 40 pounds and was forced to stay in bed .She could n't dress herself , hold the phone receiver , or get up from the toilet unassisted .From her book : .I became isolated from everyone I knew by my pain and fear and ultimately even by the consuming effort I had to make to do any little thing - like get up from a chair , pick up a cup of tea .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As I turned each page I felt as if Darlene was speaking directly to me .I finally felt that someone understood the struggles I had faced living with a chronic illness .When I found out she was based in the Bay Area , I was ecstatic .I was already a student of Zen meditation , but was at that time without a teacher .I contacted Darlene and asked if she was accepting new students .She said ( with characteristic candor ) \" It depends .\" We had our first meeting about a week later .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Mostly , we laughed .That happened a lot with Darlene .Before I met her , I did n't know it was possible to be irreverent and sincere in the same moment .She was serious about ending suffering , but never took her suffering seriously .This was nothing short of liberating for me .From her book again : .How do we live through unbearable situations like a catastrophic disease without being destroyed ?How do we deal with the mundane anguish of our everyday lives ?How do we continue to live under crushing stress ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is the question Darlene dedicated her life and her Zen practice to answering .She taught me ( and many other students around the world ) how to find joy in the heart of pain .How to stay present in circumstances that seem unbearable .And , most importantly , how to love and forgive ourselves through it all - whether we stay present or not , whether we are sad or happy , frustrated or at peace , sick or healthy .A common pitfall on the spiritual path is the idea that meditation practice should produce a state of perpetual equanimity and acceptance - one in which negative feelings like anger , frustration and despair are never experienced .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact , one of the greatest gifts I received from her was learning the value of distraction .She had a special name for it : \" down ' n ' dirty comfort \" .Here 's how she explains it in her book : .Even though it 's an ideal time to \" embrace the suffering \" or learn to \" dance with disaster , \" you do n't care .Furthermore , you do n't care that you do n't care .You 've had it with trying to expand your consciousness .You hate your life and everybody in it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You 're at the end of your rope .It 's time for down ' n ' dirty comfort .What you need is whatever will get you through the next few hours .It might sound strange to hear a Zen teacher talk about the importance of distracting yourself .But that 's one of the things I appreciated most about Darlene : she did n't fit the mold , and she did n't try to .She constantly challenged conventional ideas about what it meant to be a spiritual practitioner and teacher .One of my favorite stories she told illustrates this well : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I had worked hard all week , and it seemed to me that nobody appreciated me .Clients canceled their appointments , and nobody was taking any of my advice .My \" poor me \" tape started running , and my joints hurt .Although we were out of cookies , there were two Hagen - Dazs ice cream sandwiches in the fridge .I put them on a plate , curled up in bed under the thick comforter just the way I was , with my clothes and shoes on , and clicked on the TV .Geraldo was having a celebrity gossipfest with tabloid reporters telling all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was actually pretty transported , feeling much better about life , when the phone next to my bed rang a half hour later .Since I did n't want to go back into being - available mode , I had absolutely no intention of answering the phone or even listening to the message , but habit was stronger than gossip bliss .After the answering machine 's various clicks indicated someone was beginning to record , I muted the TV at the last minute .A woman I did n't know began telling my machine she had heard me lecture and was very moved and impressed and wanted to study with me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She left her phone number .I clicked the TV mute button off and went back to Geraldo .In a few moments , I was laughing out loud .Here I was , the pain guru , the person people in pain want to emulate .This really is my teaching . \" Darlene 's authenticity was refreshing .She was real .She let her students see not only her wisdom and strength , but also her humanity and pain .She taught me to continue to draw the circle of acceptance wider and wider , until it included everything - especially the \" unacceptable \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have similar feelings about her passing .I am glad she is finally free of her pain , after so many years of living with it .Yet I will miss her compassion , her insight , her sense of humor and , most of all , her humanity .This morning I pulled out her book and read a few pages .I laughed out loud and I cried - all within a few minutes .That was Darlene .So full of life .So uninhibited .So immediate .As I put the book away , I felt a strong sense of her presence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But , I 'm sorry to learn that I may never see her again , at least not in this life .I find the response of \" Happy \" unsettling .Sometimes , I think , people universalize their own experience and draw conclusions based on their own personal limited experience w/o any clinical training or understanding .Ignorance , arrogance , and immaturity allows us to believe we have all of the answers and that we can extrapolate our experience to all .Very irritating .Lovely tribute - so sad that she suffered so long from a disease that can be easily treated .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
