{"text": "This review , however , is not a side by side comparison , that said , I wish Amazon would please separate the Standard Def , Instant Downloads and Blu Ray reviews from each other .It would make it that much easier to find a review that fits your needs and interests .VIDEO ....Extraordinarily clean transfer with no artifacts that I could see anywhere .Grain did not seem to be present nor was there any haloing saw during CGI scenes .Blacks were extremely deep without sacrificing details in even the darkest of shots .Contrast is excellent throughout the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is one of the better transfers to Blu Ray I have seen with Mbps rates generally averaging in the low to mid 30 's .AUDIO ....The audio is a lossless 5.1 DTS MA HD which I wish also came with a 7.1 option .Dialogue was clean and transparent throughout and there was no need to reset your remotes volume control due to audio roller coasting ; it stayed consistently set .Armageddon , in its own way , comes with one of the very best audios to be found .Read more ' .3 Comments 45 of 51 people found this helpful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
