{"text": "More on Bruce Campbell Fighting Zombies !Hey folks , Harry here ...If I were ROGUE , DIMENSION , NEW LINE , LIONS GATE or REVOLUTION - I 'd sign up with DARK HORSE on this immediately and produce the living dead out of it .You 've got an absolute Icon that 's sold more DVDs than Mickey Mouse - Has two Best Selling books - and is a genre god ... fighting Zombies .With the correct marketing and push ... and Bruce on every talk show in America - this movie could be 5 times as big as STEALTH or THE ISLAND !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Call this , \" HI ! I'MBRUCE CAMPBELL , YOU MAY REMEMBER ME FROM ... \" heh .Here ya go ... .Hey folk , Drunk - ass Steve here .This is a week and a half late , but I 'm a busy guy .Bruce Campbell had his book signing and Man With The Screaming Brain showing here in Minneapolis last week and I happened to make it there .AICN has had a couple little bits about an upcoming Campbell movie where the world gives him a shotgun and a chainsaw to take on zombies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So here 's the fucking score ... Bruce said to me at the signing that it is not the world , it is a small town in Oregon ( the state in which he lives ) .At the premier of The Man With The Screaming Brain , I asked nearly the same question but asked for more detail ; partially for the AICN crowd , but also for the crowd there that probably had no idea it was in the works .He said the movie should be shooting sometime fairly soon this year by Dark Horse Comics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In short , he said , \" the whole town mistakes me as Ash , and I 've never shot a gun , nor used a chainsaw .\" Bruce commented on this saying something like , \" and I do n't know shit on how to use either one , so I actually cause more deaths than the zombies .\" I mostly asked this to get a title out of him 'cause this would be bigger news , but for now it is \" Bruce Campbell Untitled \" I think , or something close to that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For those of you still planning on hitting a Bruce Campbell showing , I do highly recommend asking about Sam Raimi 's car that is used in every movie he has done .Bruce 's story and plans about that are fucking hilarious .If this actually gets used , I may share what I remember in the Talkbacks .As for The Man With The Screaming Brain , I 'd review it , but I do n't have reviewer skills .It was funny as hell , definitely worth a watch , but I did n't have as high opinion of it as I expected .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Wow , that 's something to aspire to .Yes , it does sound like a rehash of Galaxy Quest , which was a rehash of a Star Trek short story but as far as modern filmmaking goes , that counts as original .Unfortunatly the humor requires that people outside of the hardcore geek film community know who the hell Bruce Campbell is .But good luck . ... but the truth is , Campbell is beyond cool , and he 's not a bad actor , as long as you 're asking him to play that one character he does well , which , essentially is variations on Ash .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I bet you ca n't do it without losing consciousness at least once .Then , go listen to the Bruce Campbell commentary .Now that 's some funny shit , and it 's why he gets all the love around here .Oh , wait .He 's also the best actor of his generation at playing geriatric Elvises .Sorry , Bruce .Okay , NYK , who 's your favorite actor ?I 'm not trying to be a dick , just think of your favorite actor .All right , now ask yourself , does this Actor come to screenings and do Q&As with his fans ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Probably not .That 's why Bruce earns so much love on this site and from the geek community .Yes , the \" Evil Dead \" movies are a gas .And yes , Bruce does n't often get a lot of respect and great roles from Hollywood .But the fact that this guy goes out night after night to towns all over the country and connects with people , that makes him a god in many geeks ' eyes ( including mine ) .Have you seen Bruce in action ?Go see him when he comes thru your town , and you 'll get it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And he was hilarious .And generous .And truly appreciative of his audience .John Turturro sat behind me , and howled during the movies , and was heard to say , \" Man , I love this guy .\" It 's hard to explain if you have n't lived thru the ritual .But go see Bruce in person some time , and you 'll understand .At the moment mainstream cinema is damn uninteresting .We got sequels ( as well as the dreaded prequels - do n't make me come out there Berman ) and remakes coming out our butts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He is a real gentleman .That being said - he does not respond well to dumb questions and sometimes his sense of humour rubs people the wrong way .He 's ok by me and damn fine to look at up close .I watch an awful lot of film , tv , anime and read when I can .I guess that I am saying I try to watch quality and we live in a time when a ton of stuff is available so whatever I spend my money on is going to have to be different .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He stands up for independent film and B movies .He speaks for increased creativity and an influx of new ideas into Hollywood rather than rehashing old ideas and acting like they are new .He is n't afraid to call a movie where one dresses up like a bat , where aliens from Mars attack , where people have space wars in ships B movies , whatever the budget .And , have you seen his cameos in Spider - Man ?Do you know another actor who would push to get a geriatric Elvis and a black JFK to fight a mummy in a movie ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He responds appropriately to idots and fans .This movie sounds too good to be true , I like the idea of him killing more people then the zombies .It could really be a funny critism of media influence .And having the Coen Brothers and Sam Raimi involved would be exciting .The Coen 's have been doing other people 's stories lately , ie Ladykillers and Intolerable Cruelity , so why not ?Apparently Hal Sparks is going to be filming a flick with Bruce .It may be this one but I 'm not sure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was brought up at Comicon , so I 'm assuming it 's gon na be the Dark Horse flick .I completely forgot to mention above ( yes , that 's me ) that Bruce also said this will start filming this fall .Also about the car for those interested ...Sam Raimi has used that car in every movie he 's done .Apparently Bruce 's goal is to destroy that car .Sam has been hiding that car and has three other decoys .Bruce 's theory is that Sam got laid in that car so takes it with him for every movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , this is the same idea as Galaxy Quest , but it 's Bruce Fucking Campbell , it 'll be a fun movie .From what I understood at the Q&A , he never mentioned writing it , but it is at least his idea .I 'm not sure if he 'll be the only script writer or if others will work on it as well .For what it 's worth , yeah , all his roles are the same , but that 's called \" character acting \" .Sometimes it 's good to do what you 're good at and go with it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He was better as Elvis than Elvis himself was IN HIS OWN MOVIES .Bruce , IMO , is fully capable of better , but chooses not to , and I think he 's better for it .I betcha fanboys would call him out for selling out if he ever tried for more .I personally like the fact that he likes who he is and where he 's at , and does n't act like he 's above the little people who give him fame .Okay , yeah , that has nothing to do with his acting , but it has everything to do with his career as an actor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He has aged so well , and he 's friggin ' hot .Actually , Galaxy Quest was a rehash of A Bugs Life which was a rehash of The Three Amigos which was influenced by The Magnificent Seven which was a remake of Seven Samurai .Oh and Raimi 's car was n't in ALL his movies .For obvious reasons he left it out of The Quick and the Dead .Actually , from what I remember , they took the panelling off the car and used it as panelling in a shack scene somewhere ( in Quick and the Dead ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm not so sure this is really so much a revisitation of The Evil Dead .After seeing his responses to the obviously overasked questions about The Evil Dead , I really think this is more a slap to the face of the fans that only recognize him as Ash .I think he 's trying to get people to realize that he is not Ash , hence showing the blatant differences from Ash and Bruce Campbell .If it is at least partially a slap in the face to those fans , all the better because some of his fans really need that reality check .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I first \" met \" Bruce Campbell when The Adventures of Brisco County , Jr. hit the air .I loved the show , watched every episode , and am still waiting for the series on DVD .I then discovered Evil Dead when Evil Dead II played on cable TV one day , and I recognized \" Brisco \" .I became obsessed with finding out more about these movies , eventually finding old copies on VHS to watch .I absolutely loved them , and instantly recognized that Bruce Campbell was , for better or worse , the star in two of the shows / movie series that I consider my favorites .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Talk shit about him all you want , the fans he 's made he 's made for life .So it does n't matter whether or not you like him or his movies .I guarantee you that this \" Bruce vs. Ash \" movie will make more than Land of the Dead .I think Bruce probably is a really cool guy .He certainly seemed cool and loves his fans at the signing , whether it was an act or not , I believe it to be genuine .I think he is happy with his level of being a celebrity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have a touch of this myself from being in bands and love it .The people who know of my work are great fans and hanging out and partying with fans is a great experience .Bruce even said somewhere ( maybe on here with Capone I think ) that he enjoys touring and bringing his movie and talking to fans .That 's very admirable , and I feel the same .You do n't see Brad Pitt ( or anyone of that caliber ) going around and saying he loves fans and talking to them , if he did say so , I 'd be willing to bet he 's lying .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And Chastain-86 , I really hope this is what this movie turns out to be .Alot of his fans are goddamn annoying for only recognizing him as Ash , they deserve the slap in the face .I must also say , very cool that my very first tip to make it on this site is # 2 in Talkbacks so far ( for the day anyway ) .And so far , most are actually being civil , which I have n't seen since the Star Wars contest to combine the old trilogy with the new .I sent off a new tip , not sure if it 'll be used , but it 's about the upcoming Mortal Kombat III movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hal Sparks speaks Mandarin Chinese and has several black belts in many martial arts .While Bruce Campbell is stuffing up and failing to save anyone because he 's not Ash , Hal as himself saves the day and everyone goes \" What the hell ?The guy from Queer as Folk is saving us \" .That 's assuming they 've heard of the show let alone seen it in Oregon .Blue State , right ?Or are the small towns the red parts of the Blue States ?I saw Mr. Campbell here in Denver and there was no requirement for you to buy his new book to get items autographed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I realize other actors do this ( especially at cons ) but it 's not happening on the \" How to Make Love The Bruce Capbell Way \" tour .I agree with po - mo .Sounds too ' meta ' for me .The only thing that can save ' high concept ' like this is blood .Lots of it .Enough so that , in Joe Bob 's words , the ' plot does n't get in the way of the story . 'In the trailer , they should say , \" A B - Movie character in a world gone horribly wrong .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ash is ... Bruce Campbell in .... \" .Also lame are the people who keep saying he needs to move on from The Evil Dead .Are you fucking me ?--COME ON !This is gon na be the best friggen B movie since ... well ... maybe since the last Evil Dead flick .And yes it 's galaxy Quest Redux .But that means nothing .Eeverything has been done before .How many buddy cop movies have you seen where at least one of the cops is a silly black man ?Like a million !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dear god in heaven , no one has ever , nor ever will copy anything from that piece of shit Dr. Who telefilm , get real ......This will be such a funny movie .Bruce parodying himself while parodying the Evil Dead movies ?You got ta be kidding me ! what about much love to old ideas ?I admit I kind of blanched when I heard the set up explained .Potential for comedy ?Yes .Hijinks ensue ?Sure .Fresh ?Not so much .Still , it 's Bruce and zombies so how would that not motivate me to buy a ticket ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He talks to you .He signs autographs .He loves B Movie making .BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE HIM A GOOD ACTOR .To say he is an icon is going WAAAAY overboard here .John Wayne is the icon of B - movies ... and even he rose to something better later in his career .I wish fanboys would stop reveling over him because he was in the Evil Dead movies .That 's pretty much his career rememberence right there .Tell me something else of true quality ... and not just his turn in the \" cult hit \" ( not so much ) Bubba HoTep .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I respect what he 's done and the contributions he has made by being so \" open and honest \" .But stop putting him on such a pedestel .There 's a BIG difference between being a nice guy , and being a good actor .He 's wooden .His delivery is poor ... and is the same in every movie he is in .Tell him to take a chance on something not so schlocky ( is that a word ? )Let 's see if he CAN do something better ... and raise above the poor quality acting projects he has taken on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Until then , he 's no more than fanboy hype gone crazy ... as far as his ability .How about Hudsucker Proxy ?How about all of his television work ?What about Sky High ?It 's hard to say what his range as an actor is since he is n't given many roles with range .However , he is a master of physical comedy , that much is clear .Would n't you love to watch Jim Carrey and Bruce chew up scenery in a comedy together ?That movie has been begging to be made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You have classic lines and amazing cinematography to be sure .But try picturing that stuff clicking with any other B - movie actor in the role .It just ai n't the same .That argument is mute .If Jeff Bridges ( off the top of my head ) would have starred in EVIL DEAD , everyone would be saying , \" Who else could have played Ash but Jeff Bridges ? \"So there 's no way you can argue that .I 'll give you HUDSUCKER PROXY .The only reason I think he worked in that was because his dialogue delivery suited the cheesy 30s style of quick talk .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No .As far as physical comedy goes ... not so much .His comedy is the kind of \" woops , look what I 'm going to do ...I 'm falling ... hahahahahah .\" Carrey is spontaneous and his comedy just comes out of nowhere .The reason Bruce is n't getting the roles is because he has n't taken a chance .I guess it 's now a catch 24 because he ca n't get good roles without proving himself , and he ca n't prove himself without getting good roles .But choice is a BIG part of an actor 's career .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He 's settled with schlock for the most part .That 's why a guy like Freddie Prinze Jr. is no match compared to someone like his counterpart of sorts Ryan Phillipe .Ryan has been making good choices of late .Prinze Jr. chooses to do teeny bopper movies and Scooby Doo .If Bruce ca n't get the good roles , why not write , produce , and direct something since he has such a stronghold on Independant film making ?Just an idea .I 'm not saying you ca n't enjoy the guy ... but this constant appraisal is just a bit over the top .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There really is n't .AND Jim Carrey stole from ( or payed homage to ) Bruce with his \" fighting the hand \" scene in LIAR LIAR .You do have a point about the catch 24 ... except it 's a catch 22 . catch 24 is something FOX tells you to do on Mondays .You 're right on that one .My bad .Brain fart .As far as Carrey being no different than Bruce Campbell .Now I know you 're crazy : ) BIG difference here .Ca n't really fathom how someone would think that Campbell could head a film like Jim Carrey could .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sorry .This is that moment where your clouded brain blocks your view .You love Campbell , so you think he 's capable of such a thing .As far as the claw thing ...I doubt Carrey even really knows who Bruce Campbell is .It was n't until you just mentioned that where I actually remembered Bruce doing that .I guess we agree to disagree . ... it is SAD that he is still holding onto this Ash character .If you 're going to revel in that past D - Level character , make Evil Dead 4 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
