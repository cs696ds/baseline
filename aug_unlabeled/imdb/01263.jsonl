{"text": "Spacey stars as Buddy Ackerman , a high - ranking production executive at Keystone Pictures .Frank Whaley plays \" Guy , \" a young man who has the extreme misfortune of becoming Buddy 's newest assistant .( Buddy 's former assistant is played , via a brilliant extended cameo , by Benicio Del Toro . )Now ... to say that Buddy Ackerman is the world 's worst boss is like saying that molten lava is a mildly unpleasant material to wade through .Ackerman 's abusive , demeaning , cold - hearted and cruel -- and damn if he does n't make for one entertaining bastard to visit with !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are hundreds of unemployed USC grads who 'd slap six grandmothers to be the assistant to uber - producer Buddy Ackerman !So Guy suffers in relative silence , intent on getting his work done while bowing to Buddy 's every whim , wish , and tantrum .But when a pretty lady producer drops a \" hot property \" onto Guy 's desk , things start looking up for the beleaguered and abused assistant .Or maybe not .With a hateful jerk like Buddy Ackerman as your boss , you can never let your guard down .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( Aside from the last five minutes , that is . )Spacey 's Buddy Ackerman is simply too amazing of a jerk to be a fictional construct .Create this character from scratch and he 'd come off as cartoonishly evil .But just when you think Buddy is a one - note villain of the most despicable kind , you start to see a few cracks in the facade .Or maybe not .One of the true joys of Spacey 's performance here is seeing the method to Buddy 's madness .But , again , maybe not .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Regardless of the reasons behind his cruelty , Buddy ultimately goes way too far and forces Guy to snap under the pressure .As Swimming with Sharks opens , Guy is taking Buddy hostage inside his own palatial estate ; the film flips back and forth between Guy 's gradual introduction to the movie biz and the merciless revenge he chooses to take on his professional tormentor .For a comedy , it 's pretty darn bleak .And I for one happen to think that 's a very good thing .Swimming with Sharks feels like real - life angst and well - earned frustration as poured out into screenplay form .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We all have , and those who suffer in silence can live vicariously through a movie like Swimming with Sharks .It 's darkly hilarious , smoothly entertaining , and almost sinfully cruel .And the final\u00e9 packs a real stinger .The DVD .Video : It 's a more than solid widescreen anamorphic transfer , which I 'm fairly certain is a marked improvement over the previous DVD release .( Sorry about the vague comparison ; it 's been a few years since I 've seen that old copy . )Audio : Choose between Dolby Digital 5.1 , DTS , or 2.0 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Regardless of which audio track you choose , expect to hear Spacey 's bombastic bellowings in fine aural form .Optional subtitles are available , albeit only en espanol .Extras .Previously released by Trimark in a bare - bones - ish affair , Swimming with Sharks now hits the shelves in a full - bore and supplement - laden Special Edition .Actually , the DVD case calls it the \" This is a Special Edition You Schmuck \" edition , which I think is considerably more amusing .Between the three commentaries you 'll get all sorts of insight into the filmmaking process , the characters , the real - life stories behind the madness , and endless amounts of Shark bites .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Easter Egg Alert : Click left from the \" Shark Tales \" prompt and you 'll find some old video footage of George Huang from when he was still working as an assistant to producer Barry Josephson .What 's even cooler than this little treat is that it was shot by filmmaker Robert Rodriguez -and- Mr. Rodriguez even provides audio commentary to the footage !And as the cherry - on - top , click enter on your remote during this hidden featurette and you 'll be treated to a piece of artwork that 's quite hilarious .Yes , it 's an easter egg hidden inside an easter egg .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And the Sharks fans will also love the amusing menu scenes , the slick slipcase packaging , and this trio of Sharks -related featurettes : .Overall a rather excellent featurette , I must say .Shark Tales : Life as a Hollywood Assistant runs 9 minutes and features some rather hilariously unbelievable anecdotes from several former assistants .Funny stuff , both the stories and the featurette 's clever approach to the material .Let 's Do Lunch !But with this many participants , why is this illuminating featurette so darn short ?Final Thoughts .So few movies choose to revel in true black comedy , and even fewer are able to pull it off as well as Swimming with Sharks does .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
