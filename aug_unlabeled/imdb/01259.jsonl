{"text": "In a world where a blog is created every second does the world really need another blog ?Well , it 's got one .An irregular set of postings , weaving an intricate pattern around a diverse set of subjects .Comment on culture , technology , politics and the occasional rant about life .Alan ... in Belfast , Northern Ireland .Gates of Gold at 2011 Belfast Film Festival .There were ninety and nine that safely lay In the shelter of the fold .But one was out on the hills away , Far off from the gates of gold .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Away from the tender Shepherd 's care .But this afternoon , a Play for the Day written by Northern Ireland born author and producer Maurice Leitch and originally transmitted on the BBC in 1983 was dusted down and screened to a packed audience in Broadcasting House .Gates of Gold is set in rural Co.Antrim back in 1959 .Fourteen year old Grace lives with her foster parents on a farm .She has a learning disability , but helps out on the farm .Her Dad has allowed a travelling tent mission to set up in one of his fields .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's real attention to detail that reminds me of visiting relatives ' homes in the Glens of Antrim : the farm house clock ticking away loudly in the background of every downstairs conversation .Intrigued by the sound of an organ , Grace explores the \" canvas cathedral \" and is befriended by the youthful George McQuiston ( Bryan Murray who later played Brookside 's Trevor Jordache ) , even joining in to sing along as he practices his playing .On the mission 's first evening , Pastor Eric Kells speaks to a full tent .He cites the 100th anniversary of the 1859 revival in the region .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The rhetoric 's emotion is turned up along with the accompanying organ music and singing in the background as Pastor Kells begins the altar call .Grace stands to go forward but her parents restrain her and make her sit down .But she 's a changed girl , tackling her tasks around the farm with renewed enthusiasm and a smile on her face .There are numerous tensions throughout the well - crafted 68 minute television play .Grace 's mother is very hard on her foster child - \" I 'm determined the while that child is in my care she 'll be protected from herself \" - and clashes with her more laid back husband .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kells is found of \" the devil 's buttermilk \" and George is passionate about more than just music .And finally , the straight - laced local Presbyterian minister is unimpressed with the \" lurid import \" from across the Atlantic that is leading his congregation astray .As I watched , I was challenged by the emptiness and joylessness of most of the religion being portrayed on the screen .The tent crusade had emotion and music , but it drove people to faith more through a message about hell than expounding the \" laundry of love \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Or perhaps the old fashioned ways continued to bore people senseless and accurately relate to so little of their lives and communities that your message continues to bypass them and leave them uninspired ?Possibly the most Christ - like character in the programme was Grace 's foster dad .Hard working and hen pecked , he was generous with his land , appreciated his daughter 's help , understood the need to make allowances for her , encouraged her , and tried to keep her out of trouble .He could sense her change in attitude after her tent experiences , and it did n't frighten him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
