{"text": "A few months ago , just as I was finishing the manuscript of my book , Sujewa Ekanayake swung through Fayetteville to interview me for his forthcoming documentary , Indie Film Blogger Road Trip ( IFBRT ) .Now , just as I am finishing copyedits on the book , Sujewa has been kind enough to allow me to be one of the first people to screen a rough cut of the film .I wo n't pretend to review IFBRT .Obviously , I 'm not an objective observer .Do my hands really move like that ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I now know why so many actors find it difficult to watch film clips of themselves when they play at awards shows .And I was watching the film alone on the very futon where I was interviewed a few months earlier .But after watching my scenes again , I felt a little better .Yes , my fingers seemed to be twitching madly during certain moments , but not as much as I initially remembered , and I ended up chalking up the appearance of a gut to a bad shirt choice .Not much I can do about that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I liked the messy hair , though .I 'll also admit that I was surprised at the answers that Sujewa chose to include .But for whatever reason , I spent a few minutes talking about the role that blogging had played in organizing documentary filmmakers and artists in protesting new rules instituted by Mayor Michael Bloomberg that would have severely restricted the right to film in New York City .Which brings up a question for me .I wonder how other interviewees make sense of the experience of watching themselves onscreen , or about the kinds of things that make it into the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But as I watched the last few minutes of IFBRT tonight , my fully copyedited manuscript sitting neatly in front of me on my coffee table , I found myself thinking about the place of a document such as Sujewa 's film in the current media landscape .One of the questions that seemed to persist was whether blogging would continue as an important cultural form in promoting and consuming indie films , and the consensus seemed to be that it would , in fact , persist .Jenny asked a really useful question about this media transition recently : \" What 's your social software of choice right now ? \" Other bloggers complicate the perception that the indie film community is a completely inclusive , utopian space .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Melissa Silverstein , for example , took the time to challenge the \" all boys club \" tendency of many blogging communities , while Armando Valle pointed out that indie festivals often have less room for genre pics such as low - budget horror films .To Sujewa 's great credit , he took great care to ensure that he presented a multi - faceted and diverse portrait of the blogging community , while also acknowleding the ways that we sometimes fail to be fully inclusive .Obviously , because I am in the film , I ca n't fully distance myself from it , and I have to wonder how it will play for people outside the circle of this specific slice of indie film culture .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Another might be what counts as \" blogging . \"Perhaps because these questions are impossible to answer in any concise way .No matter what , I very much enjoyed being a part of the project and hope that Sujewa has success with it .Even if my hands were manically twitching the entire time I was onscreen .I have n't read Wajcman 's book , but I really like that quote you pulled out .For my site Bad Lit , I decided to focus it exclusively on \" underground \" films because a )I love them ; and b ) there did n't seem to be any other websites covering a certain type of indie filmmaking in detail .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also , although I use WordPress to create the site , I 've never thought of it as a \" blog . \" To me , it 's a news and review site .Is the term \" blog \" a frame of mind or the description of the software used to create a site ?Maybe \" blogging \" as a frame of mind will become obsolete because of Twitter and such , but \" blogging \" by using certain softwares wo n't .For the doc a blog was basically an internet journal - in this case journals / blogs that focused on indie film & related matters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hopefully the doc , & discussions about it , will also benefit sites & blogs that deal with indie film but are not featured in or mentioned in the doc - I think that will happen - due to the magic of linking , comments , etc . .Chuck Said , .The Wajcman book is pretty good .She does some of the more interesting work I 've seen on technology and gender .The vagueness with which blogging is defined is something that has bothered me for a while , and it goes well beyond this film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And I 'm a little skeptical of characterizing writing on the web associated with major publications , such as the New York Times blogs as blogs .Arguably , part of it is the editorial process ( i.e. , having an editor ) , but that lack of precision can be frustrating ( even when I 'm guilty of it myself ) .I 've a fancy I 'll feel the same way seeing myself on camera , Chuck , my thoughts too noting every instance of now blush - introducing effervescence , candor or random arm flailing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As for your notes here , they 've made me more than excited to see the film soon myself .There are always unanswered questions in this field .I 'm hoping the rest of you have at least a handful of the answers .Thanks for the kind words about the post .Now that I 've adjusted to seeing myself on screen , I think I 'm more preoccupied with the general question of how documentary subjects experiences themselves as \" authors \" of the film .Or how their ( our ? ) image of themselves converges or diverges with what they see on screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
