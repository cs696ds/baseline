{"text": "Early on the morning of August 20 , 1986 , a 44-year - old mail carrier named Patrick Sherrill arrived for work in Edmond , Okla. , armed with three handguns .The previous day , Sherrill , a shy , solitary Vietnam - era veteran who lived in the house he had shared with his mother until her death eight years before had been warned by his supervisors he could lose his job if he did n't shape up his work habits .Now , dressed for work in his blue mail - carrier 's uniform , Sherrill walked up to one of those supervisors , Rick Esser , and shot him dead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He said nothing during the entire episode , according to surviving witnesses , just made a quiet circuit of the building , carefully shutting doors behind him to prevent anyone from escaping .By the time Sherrill turned his weapon on himself he had killed 14 people .Twenty - five years after Sherrill 's rampage in Oklahoma , Anders Breivik , another gun - toting loner with a close attachment to his mother , set off a series of explosions in central Oslo , Norway .Then he drove 19 miles to a youth camp run by the country 's left - wing Labor Party and opened fire on defenseless campers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dressed in a police uniform , he told campers he was conducting a security check following the Oslo attack . \"He was standing just by the water , using his rifle , just taking his time , aiming and shooting , \" one survivor told the New York Times .\" It was a slaughter of young children .\" By the time Breivik surrendered to police 77 people were dead .On the surface , there would seem to be little connection between these two incidents .Sherrill was a classic sad sack , a lonely , middle - aged man who spent his spare time reading Guns and Ammo and talking on ham radio .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yet when the horrific news came from Oslo last month , one of the most disheartening elements of the attack was how familiar it all seemed .In this country , we have become so inured to stories of men going on inexplicable killing sprees we 've coined a name for it : \" going postal .\" Every few months , it seems , some crazed gunman opens fire on a quiet college campus or shoots a congresswoman outside a suburban supermarket .As we approach the 25 th anniversary of the massacre that gave us the term \" going postal , \" lone gunman sprees are not only frighteningly common in the U.S. , but have spread overseas , even to countries with stricter gun laws and placid , homogenous societies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In Lone Wolf : True Stories of Spree Killers , author Pan Pantziarka cites Howard Unruh , a World War II vet who in 1949 went berserk and killed 13 people in his hometown of Camden , N.J. , as \" the father of modern mass murder . \"Another famous example is Charles Whitman , who climbed a tower at the center of the University of Texas ' Austin campus in August 1966 and shot 16 people with a high - powered rifle .A suicide bomber goes into his operation knowing not only that he is going to die , but that he is going to die first .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No quiet satisfaction of hunting people like vermin .No thrill of playing a video game with live victims .Still , in the quarter century since Sherrill 's 1986 rampage , spree killings have ticked notably upward , both in this country and abroad .In the quarter century since the Sherrill incident , the U.S. Postal Service has seen at least a dozen more episodes of gun violence involving disgruntled employees at its offices that have resulted in 24 deaths .Overseas , in August 1987 , a year after Sherrill 's spree , Julian Knight , a disgruntled former Australian army cadet , positioned himself behind a billboard at a busy intersection in Melbourne and opened fire , killing seven people and wounding 19 more .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Since then , men with guns have gone on killing sprees at work places , at schools , at tourist sites , on busy streets - essentially anywhere large numbers of people are likely to congregate .If you look at the records of lone - gunman mass shootings over the past 25 years , Americans still top the list , but killers have come from around the globe , including England , Australia , France , Switzerland , South Africa - and now Norway .If spree killings are a kind of social epidemic , then the strongest single strand in its DNA is the proliferation of firearms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In a 2010 Harris Poll , 32 percent of respondents reported having at least one gun in the home , and depending on whose statistics you believe , there are between 190 million and 280 million guns in circulation in America today .But you do n't have to be American to buy a firearm .According to the Small Arms Survey , there are roughly 875 million firearms in circulation around the globe , with up to 900,000 more being produced every year .Many of the countries seeing American - style spree killings have strict gun laws , including , in the case of Norway , complete bans on automatic weapons , but with careful gaming of these laws men like Anders Breivik can amass more than enough firepower to do the job .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And , of course , all cultures have their loners and losers , the sad , angry , mentally unstable guys living at home with their mothers , fondling their weaponry .But these factors speak only to the conditions that enable killing sprees .They do n't take into account the crimes themselves , the unique modus operandi that sets American - style massacres apart : a single , frustrated man with a gun blowing away as many people as possible .The killers are most white and from middle - class backgrounds , and almost without exception male .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In this country , by the way we raise our kids , the TV shows we watch , the video games we play , the political ideals we express , even the very clothes we wear , we exalt the individual .We expect to be treated as unique and special , free to act as we please .We demand to be shown respect in the workplace and at the cash register , and if we are white and male , we are told in myriad ways by our culture that this respect is deserved .When we do n't get that respect , we sometimes snap .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some people , though , those dangerously reclusive men nursing their resentments in their parents ' homes , can one day simply gather up their guns and start shooting .To recognize how American this form of violence is , think for a minute of the other headline - grabbing mass murderers of our time , the al Qaeda - style terrorists carrying out their martyrdom operations .Al Qaeda bombers use violence to make a political point , but their modus operandi is different from that of Breivik and other politically motivated spree killers .A suicide bomber goes into his operation knowing not only that he is going to die , but that he is going to die first .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No quiet satisfaction of hunting people like vermin .No thrill of playing a video game with live victims .In a suicide bombing , the attacker kills himself along with as many bystanders as possible , in order that others of his kind may someday gain power over the enemy .None of this is to suggest that either of these forms of murder is more or less morally bankrupt - murder is murder , no matter the modus operandi -or even that we should stop exporting our free - market democratic ideals .We are right to champion the right of every citizen to liberty and personal dignity , and to offer people the world over the means to attain those goals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We must find ways to make clear that these are rights to be earned , by taking part in and contributing to the wider culture , not merely entitlements .Getting rid of dangerous guns is important , but to a certain extent gun - rights activists are right : Guns do n't kill people ; people do .We as a society owe it to ourselves and to the world to build a culture that encourages these murderers to emerge from their hidey - holes of culturally reinforced resentments and disarm themselves .Michael Bourne is a staff writer for The Millions , and has published fiction and poetry in numerous journals , including Potomac Review and Orange Coast Review .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
