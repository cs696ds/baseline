{"text": "When Edison developed the light bulb there were already several types of electric lights in use .Later in his life he really bought into the whole \" you have brought light to mankind \" demigod bull that he was being fed .Many of the people we consider \" Great Inventors \" had some serious personality flaws .Ford was a huge anti - semite and early fan of Hitler , Alexander Grahem Bell almost certainly stole the design for telephone outright and do n't even get me started on the Wright Bros. .I reserve the right to despise Edison for screwing over the Lumiere Brothers , driving the movie industry out of New York City , and entering into a conspiracy to turn the nascent movie industry into a patent - driven monopolistic trust .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In short , Edison was not present at Topsy 's death , and the episode had nothing to do with the battle of the currents .In act , it was the ASPCA that recommend use of electricity to kill Topsy .If I may repeat a comment I left on boingboing a few weeks ago : .Topsy the elephant was indeed electrocuted in 1903 , and an Edison company made a film of it , but Edison himself was n't involved .( Edison was involved in the killing of dogs and horses at his West Orange lab more than a decade before - tests related to the development of the electric chair . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Topsy 's death had nothing to do with the debates over AC / DC or the electric chair .Here 's what happened : Topsy was a rogue Coney Island circus elephant , and her owners decided they had to kill her .They proposed hanging her from a scaffold with a rope and pulley , but the ASPCA claimed that would be cruel .Instead , Topsy was fitted with copper - lined wooden sandals on her right front and back left legs , and the sandals were wired to a dynamo at the local Edison lighting plant .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "@entropymd - Yeah , I 'm sure .DC is no safer then AC .You 're right , it 's the current that kills , not the voltage .The reason people think DC is safer is because most of the DC they come into contact with is the low voltage , low current variety .For instance , electrical power on a USB bus is around 5volts/500mA. Yeah , Edison was a twat .He used strong arm tactics sending thugs to physically threaten filmmakers in the East Coast if they did n't pay him what he considered motion picture taxes on technology he created ( which he did n't ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not that this particular example suits that end ... however , many of the objections to this seem to bleed over into any killing of animals for any reason whatsoever .While we should try not to be so cruel , we must exploit our lordship over dumb creatures in order to advance .That 's a simple fact .They proposed hanging her from a scaffold with a rope and pulley , but the ASPCA claimed that would be cruel .If I understand , the proposition was that electrifying an elephant would be less cruel than hanging it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Electrocuting it may have been fast , but takes on a \" performance \" element that seems repugnant .I ca n't condemn Edision for being a victim of his times .Yes , what he did was wrong by todays standards ; in many many ways .But 105 years ago , it was considered \" cutting edge \" .I suppose that the ASPCA did n't reccoment shooting the elephant because there would be no way to ensure that it would be an instant death .Though the poor thing was already dying at the time , having been fed cyanide .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Shooting things is harder than you realize if you 're trying to kill them quickly , especially for an animal that has a brain not much bigger than ours that 's hidden in the middle of a thick , heavy skull .They very likely would have missed , putting the animal in extreme pain .It would have been crueler than hanging or electrocuting it .A substantial portion , if not all , of the Edison Co. film \" Executing an Elephant \" can be seen in the Errol Morris documentary \" Mr. Death , \" which follow the career of Fred A. Leuchter Jr. , an electric - chair engineer and Holocaust denier : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is the amperage that kills , not the voltage .The minimum electricty needed to electrocute a person is 0.07 amps if it directly passes through the brain or heart .However , at the same time , Specialist is right about needing a certain amount of volts and amps to kill .Ohm 's law comes to the rescue and shows that the maximum amps passing through a circuit is proportional to potential divided by resistance .Hence if you do n't have sufficient volts even if you have a lot of amps , you ca n't get a lethal shock .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
