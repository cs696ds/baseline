{"text": "Interview : Boondock Saints II 's Norman Reedus .After chatting with Sean Patrick Flannery last week it was obvious that there was something special about Boondock Saints .I 'm not referring to the fact that the film , which barely got a run in the theaters , managed to grow into a sensational cult classic ; rather that the success of the film had a profound effect on the actors that made us love it .Norma Reedus emphasized his gratitude for Troy Duffy casting him as Murphy McManus in the 1999 hit , but it 's moviegoers that should be thankful for it let a talented actor share his craft with the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
