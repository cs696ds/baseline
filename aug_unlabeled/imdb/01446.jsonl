{"text": "Starring Stellan Skarsgard , Javier Bardem and Natalie Portman .Directed by Milos Forman .( R. 114 minutes .At Bay Area theaters . ) \" Goya 's Ghosts , \" the latest from Milos Forman ( \" Amadeus \" ) , is an oddly structured tale about Francisco Goya and the Spain that he lived and worked in .It 's a portrait of an era more than it 's a portrait of a man , yet Goya is at the center of the story , and Goya carries Forman 's message -- that art , and not politics , is the worthy pursuit of an honest person .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Bardem is probably the biggest star in Spain , and to persuade him to play a fictional priest and let a Swedish actor ( Stellan Skarsgard ) play Goya no doubt took some doing -- including the pretense that Lorenzo is the star of the film .Whatever it took , it was worth it , because both actors are brilliant , and with the fiery Bardem as Goya , it would have been a different picture .Skarsgard makes for an older and more placid Goya , and when we meet him in 1792 , he is already in his late 40s and an established master .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As the court painter , he navigates various political mine fields with a combination of geniality and nerve , though his skill seems instinctive , almost unconscious .He is focused on his art .He wo n't compromise it -- even if it means making the queen look even homelier than she is -- but at the same time he poses no threat to anyone .He has no ambition but to do what he 's doing , and thus he seems to float a bit outside the world .Bardem , as an ostensibly withdrawn priest , presents another picture entirely .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His light voice seems mannered .His mild and modest gestures ca n't fully suppress the ambitions and passions struggling to break out .Goya is a man at peace with himself , while Lorenzo is a man in turmoil , and because of that , and because the emotion of Goya 's art speaks to Lorenzo in a subterranean way , he finds himself drawn to Goya .Lorenzo likes Goya , and yet never enough that we can stop worrying about the artist when the two men are in the same room .The dynamic , which would not be present if the actors ' roles were reversed , is fascinating : Lorenzo 's personality structure is built on a lie , and Goya sees through him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lorenzo is a dangerous man who has found , in power , compensation for some essential lack of authenticity or character .Yes , they had them then , too .In this setup , it 's usually the innocent who end up suffering , and in \" Goya 's Ghosts \" that fate befalls Ines ( Natalie Portman ) , a wealthy merchant 's beautiful daughter who is the model for several of Goya 's paintings .Wrongly accused of being Jewish , she is tortured by the Inquisition until she confesses , and is left in jail until Napoleon ends the Inquisition 15 years later .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's no more believable and considerably less palatable than what MGM might have done in the old days : They would have left Portman beautiful but put a white bride - of - Frankenstein streak through her hair .We would have gotten the idea without getting sick .Rich in color and period detail , the film attempts an epic sprawl it never quite achieves , but the movie is always enjoyable and interesting .Forman 's depiction of the aftermath of a public execution is nothing less than masterful .The clash between Goya 's effortless decency and Lorenzo 's effortful self - promotion loses none of its fascination , and the political background , in which the French \" liberate \" Spain in order to exploit it , allows Forman to express his healthy cynicism about political movements .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
