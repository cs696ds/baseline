{"text": "# 2 Mae Whitman Despite the deaging of the character , I actually quite like how April was portrayed in the 2010s series , and of course , Mae is a natural choice for that particular incarnation .Even though she 's a bit typecast for this kind of role , she does very well as young but strong - mannered young women / little girls , and even though it takes some time to get used to , she 's definitely growing into the role over time .Much like Rebecca , I do think that Mae would be much better - received as a more comic - accurate April and more material to work with .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
