{"text": "With this group , Chao easily destroys the Ching Te school and all of their businesses , leaving everyone dead except for Tien Lung who loses his right arm .Tien Lung vows revenge and begins his training to destroy anyone and everyone who stands in his way .This is my all time favourite Kung - Fu movie .Everything about it is bang on and it hits all the right buttons .There s no messing around in this film and it does n't take very long for the first dust up to happen , you know it 's about to kick off every time someone walks into a tea house .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You get an array of different styles and the fights ( of which there are many ) and are well choreographed and great fun .Also a special mention to the head fighters random pointy long teeth .J'aime bien : le fait qu'une horde de m\u00e9chants compl\u00e8tement typ\u00e9s et improbables se joigne aux ennemis \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 , \u00e0 titre de mercenaires .Ils ont des trognes et des styles totalement oppos\u00e9s , tr\u00e8s pittoresques , et assez amusants \u00e0 voir .L'interpr\u00e9tation est sympa , tout comme la gestion du 2:35 et la bande sonore .J'aime moins : un sc\u00e9nario tr\u00e8s mince , qui n'est qu'un fil conducteur entre diverses sc\u00e8nes de combat .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Le film alterne donc entre des petites surprises agr\u00e9ables et des moments plus laborieux .C'est sympa \u00e0 regarder , mais pas marquant .This is my all time favourite Kung - Fu movie .Everything about it is bang on and it hits all the right buttons .There s no messing around in this film and it does n't take very long for the first dust up to happen , you know it 's about to kick off every time someone walks into a tea house .The bad guys are proper weaselly but for me it 's the fighters that they hire that steal the show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also a special mention to the head fighters random pointy long teeth .i first saw this at the drive - in on a double bill with fists of fury in 6th grade .when i saw it it was under the title the Chinese professionals .i talked my mom into taking me to see it on a school night .i failed to mention that it was rated r. i invited what seemed like half of the boys in my class to go that night .the car was packed with my class mates .half to wynnburg where the drive - in was my cousin tony let it slip these two were rated r .. and we almost did not get to go .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "my ... .A kickass Kung Fu classic with some amazing fight choreography , colorful characters ( the vampire - like Okinawa Chief was the shit ) , and a slew of bone - crunching battles that were all fun and simply jawdropping to watch .Recommended highly to fans of hardcore fight scenes or unapologetic Hong Kong cinema in general .With a great influence on other films that will come later , One - Armed Boxer starts from a simple and classic story , fights between two clans : the good guys and the very wicked .When good lost , the only survivor will seek revenge .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also the dialogues are reduced to a minimum .The interesting thing about this movie is that it really goes all by the spectacle of the fight .Enter to a large collection of minions each master of a different martial art : From Muay Thai to Judo happening even Yoga .By the way , the look and personality of these thugs deserve almost a spin - off of each .Also the level of violence is increasing becoming so exaggerated that is funny .Special mention here to One - Armed Boxer and its genesis .Another interesting detail is the use of some edition sequences using music and frames to advance development .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
