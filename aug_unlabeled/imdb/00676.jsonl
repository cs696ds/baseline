{"text": "Europa Report adopts a few different genres to give us a thought provoking sci - fi film exploring the possibility of life within our solar system .Being part drama , with a little suspense sprinkled on top , I found that the film is capable of immersing a viewer thanks to its approach .Europa Report is going to be remembered for its very specific use of camera because a majority of the film is viewed through an interesting fixed 8-camera system that records simultaneously throughout the \" ship \" .The movie relies on the performances of the actors portraying the mental and physical stresses , risks , and dangers of long term space travel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie plays with your expectations a bit .The story is actually quite touching and managed to immerse me more than I expected , which was a pleasant discovery .Sharlto Copley was good in this film and gave the sense of a person with separation anxiety from his family .I enjoyed Copley enough in this movie and he easily steals the scenes featuring his character James Corrigan .Another stand out for me was Sweden 's own Michael Nyqvist .Nyqvist portrays Andrei Blok .The rest of the space crew relies on his character since he 's the person with the most time and experience in space , although the amount of time traveling to Europa is much longer than his combined time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I liked a lot of the performances .Some were better than others but none were bad .Some of the characters are hard to judge because they 're space explorers , so the characters are perceived as brave and motivated to complete their mission , but on other aspects they 're idiots because they should have headed back to earth at the first major catastrophe .It could be , in some ways , a credit to the writing because I see them as both brave and foolish .I like how the story forces me to rethink my initial impressions and offers a subtle depth of engagement not often seen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Possibly due to the visual tone adopted by this film whenever a character was left alone toward some shadow .Another film the movie occasionally reminded me of was Prometheus , except this movie is much more compact than the Ridley Scott sci - fi extravaganza .This film also has a much smaller budget .You can feel the inconsistency , with some scenes seeming terrible and others seeming mediocre at best .To be frank , they just seem like they may not have been fully completed which is jarring considering the fact that a lot of the environments in the film are gorgeous and are fully CG generated .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Europa Report is something that 's slower paced and I think it 's comparable to Star Trek TNG , using the premise of Prometheus , with the added wit of a good Sherlock Holmes mystery .It pains me to point out the faults with Europa Report because I genuinely walked into this film with some excitement and anticipation based on its premise and cast .The CG is at times inconsistent but it 's interesting to see the mental collapse of the worlds finest astronauts on a deep space mission .I do n't think it 's too much of a revelation to admit that bad things happen to these characters in this trip but there 's a sense of understanding acceptance to seeing their stories unfold .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This movie takes that curiosity and exploits it into success .My primary detraction 's from rating Europa Report better are mostly technical , with a few other story qualms , but I believe Europa Report has a touching story that I would certainly recommend to those interested in an alternative , patient , sci - fi film .Letterboxd is a social site for sharing your life in film .Doppelg\u00e4nger .You will meet yourself face - to - face when Earth meets its duplicate in outer space !A planet is discovered in the same orbit as Earth 's but is located on the exact opposite side of the sun , making it not visible from Earth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "When a unseen world is discovered on the far side of the sun , a European space agency launches a mission to explore this new planet .With music by Barry Gray , effects by Derek Meddings and appearances by Ed Bishop and George Sewell it 's kind of hard to distinguish the look and fell of this from an episode of Gerry Anderson 's UFO .The difference is how surprisingly slow this movie moves .It begins with 40mins of budget talks , a tedious spy sub - plot ( with an incredibly long scene involving a hidden camera ) , and a training session .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
