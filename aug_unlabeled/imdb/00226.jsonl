{"text": "Jodie Foster adds more drama , and the the Indian slapstick is rib - tickling .The only thing that makes the Italian westerns any good was Eastwood .... to me they are more notable for contrived plots and gimmicks and corny acting .Red River is a glaring ommission as are Fort Apache and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon .Guys , I m looking for this movie ca nt rem the name no r the actors .story i rem vaguely .cowboy sorta after robbery the gang moves thru some cloudy spooky dawn on horses . end up in a small town peacful , but this gang spoils the peach . later one gang member realises these town people are once dead and to be some known gunmen cowboys etc ..", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With Kurt Russell , Val Kilmer , Sam Elliot , and Bill Paxton ?I guess maybe in 20 - 30 years this one will be on the list of new \" Old \" classics !I agree , you forgot many pictures ; high noon is one of the best , red river , the professionals .I find this : in the long history of the movies , only three have been honored with the Oscar as Best Picture : Cimarron ( 1930 ) , Dances With Wolves ( 1990 ) and Unforgiven ( 1992 ) .I breathed a huge sigh of relief when I got to the top of the list and found the best western movie so far : The Good , The Bad , and The Ugly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Red River has always been my favorite western .The interplay between John Wayne and Montgomery Clift with John Ireland in between trying to make peace between father and son is dramatic .Surprisingly , it is JoAnne Dru who steals the picture with a dress down of the proud combatants .The picture has everything a movie should have : sound dialogue , a riveting story , a build up to a famous action scene at the end , and John Wayne as a renowned rancher .It grabs your heart and does n't let go .BRAVO ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Women 's Temperance Union get s involved as well as the Indians .It 's hilarious but we do n't know the title .Could you help us , please ?Thanks !Jan .Western movies are among my favorites , I have seen them all ... something I used to do with my Grandpa growing up .You 've got a pretty good list there , but I think the # 1 spot should have been Red River ... Eastwood is a great actor , but he 's no John Wayne .i am a lover of western movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
