{"text": "Pre - teen daughter crying ALL the time .Ok .So , my daughter is n't a teenager yet but I am hoping somebody has gone thru this and has some advise .She is 10 yrs old .She 's pretty mature for her age .I am sure she 's getting ready to start her period like any minute now .All 4 of my sisters and I started when we were 10 .So I know this is probably a hormonal thing .I jsut do n't know what to do to help her .She is crying herself to sleep almost every night .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She says she does n't know how to put her feelings into words to tell me what 's wrong .I 've asked her if somethings going on at school or anywhere else in her life .She says no , there 's nothing that 's making her cry .She 's just sad and ca n't stop crying .I hold her .I 've had her take a hot shower with a candle going trying to get her calmed down .I 've tried making her a nice warm cup of tea .These things seem to make her feel good for the moment but she just ca n't stop crying .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Cuz let 's be real , we can all be drama quenns from time to time .Especially young girls ! !But it 's really heartbreaking !Any advice ? ?MOST HELPFUL POSTS .My 12 year old daughter has n't started her period yet and has always been sort of dramatic and emotional .But over the last month or so she has all of a sudden stopped wanting to play sports , refuses to go to school , begs me to homeschool her , can not sleep at night and ca n't stop crying .I 've asked if there is a problem at school and she says no , she just hates it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Any suggestions ?So glad I came across this post .My daughter ( age 11 ) has been going through this crying thing off and on for a year now .Just last night she had another .She got up out of bed and came to me crying saying \" I do n't know what 's wrong with me I just feel like something is wrong and ca n't stop crying .\" She swears everything is fine at school and with her friends .Her grades are great , she just made the cheerleading winter squad , and is making more friends .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I hope that this is hormones and Pre PMS .I 'm afraid that she is going to be bi - polar 2 like me .She is very dramatic and I do n't want to get her freaking out about me being bi - polar .How do I just comfort her into believing that it IS just hormones , that other girls have the same issues , and get her through this stage ?Wow this is EXACTLY what I 'm dealing with with my 12 yr old ....She is Happy and NOT DEPRESSED at all but has the Crying spurts that she ca n't handle or stop and do n't know why ? ? ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am setting up councilling for her and a horomone test and I hope we can figure this thing out SOON !I know there is Alot of changes going on on our planet and its affecting everyone so I 'm thinking this is alot of it !For anyone who wants to know what i m talking about Google Earth changes in the human body for more info ! ! !Hope all gets through this in peace and our babies are well ! ! !hi i am 13 and this happens to me all the time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My mom is a huge help to me when it happens to me .I cry after every soccer practice and ca nt stop , my mom would do every thing to get me to stop .What helped me was when she held me and we would hug and we would pray .I love having tea , chocolate , and ice cream , those are very calming to me .I would always watch a sad movie just to cry and get every thing out .Just the other day i said mom i need you and she knew what to do we would curl up together and watch a movie or play cards .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "so what i m saying as a 13 year old be there do nt get mad bc she says something mean .Alot of what i say when this happens to i do nt mean so try to be as understanding as possible .All your daughter may need is a nice comforting time with her mama .Crying is a type of response to the hormonal balance in your daughters body it is perfectly natural , and it will help to relieve tension .I hope you found this helpful :) to all those teens like me stay strong you have your moms shoulder to cry on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have a 15 soon to be 16 year old daughter that is still very emotional .I even had her put on birth control pills thinking it may be hormonal , but that did nt help .she was a very emotional child as well .Just might be something we will have to deal with til they grow out of it .I have been told from friends that have older children , that they went through the same thing .it is normal :) .Hi I am 12 and I have an idea what might be going on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My mom did nt know this though .I mean my mom was very nosy .She used to chase me around the house when i was a little girl with a belt .But I ca nt remember if she ever hurt me :( I think your daughter is just feeling insecure .When I am asked about school , I always say things are fine , when 2903812093892 things are going on .Especially love , I have so many sad stories , I still cry about them .I am very mature , and understand so much .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I just felt so insecure about myself for a while , and still am .My mom is n't supportive at all .She likes to get into the talk to much .And when she starts that talk , I freak out .Because she gets personal and starts to hurt me with comments .She always puts me down .My daughter and niece both were going through this phase .Their hormones were all over the place .I felt helpless and did n't know what I could do .It felt like everything I was doing was wrong .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am so happy to have found this company and feel every mother should at least try this service .I found my daughter opening up to me more to show off all her goodies in the box .No matter how much your child wants to be alone and resist as a mother we should never give up .My daughter did the same thing when her hormones were changing and she started her monthly .Her hormones may be changing .Just keep being there for her and hold her .Just insure her that your there when ever she wants to talk about anything .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "i have taken her to the dr where we were fobbed off and told it was to soon to diagnose , just watch the food that she eats and make sure she sleeps enough ..... this just gives her more time to dwell in bed ! ! ! !would really appreciate if you could let me know how you have got on , as i hate to see her like this .I tend to agree to Jane McNally , her pediatrition , would be my first move .If the crying is n't discused then she may feel that it 's not okay , or if too much attention is given to the \" Drama Queen \" type she may keep this behaviour up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hopefully it is hormones .Just to be safe you will need to exclude all other possibilities .Good luck to you , my daughter had the same problems , and unfortunately @ 15 she did try to commit suicide ...Was it drama , yes and no .She is currently receiveing intense outpatient treatment through the state .It has helped tremendously .Encourage her to write in a journal .Just putting it down visually helps her realize how big or little her woes are at her age .Also , by writing her changes , she can see that things get better .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Keep her trust by keeping your promises and do n't read unless she says its okay .Be there .Let her know that she may not have words now , but she will .Let her know through a card or note , or verbally that when she is ready to use those words , you will be there to listen and not judge .My daughter had a really hard time her middle school years .This is a time when everyone that was your friend or classmate now decides who they \" like \" for whatever reason they decide .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Problem was , she was alone .I did n't hear about it until it was over , but she cried every night then too .Hi Genevieve , I have a 13 year old and she would go through spikes in her emotions that started when she was 10 and became so regular that I could time them by the weeks and time of the month .I had her start a journal and I also had her speak with a therapist for a year or so when it became very difficult .I wanted to make sure she was not suffering from depression due to the life changes that we were going through as a family .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When the mood swings became very regular I started having her take some Midol with her daily vitamin during that week ( she still had not started her monthly cycle yet ) .She just started her monthly cycle in Jan and like clock work it is happening at the same time as her mood swings were .She now asks me for the Midol because she understands more now how it helps .If your daughter is crying nightly then I would take her in to speak with your pediatrician or if you have the insurance for it seak out a therapist or counselor that specializes in children 's behavior .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "ya know what , I have an 11 year old son who will be 12 very soon and he recently started going through the same things .He would be sad , depressed or even cry for no apparent reason and it was really bothering him .We talked to his pediatrician and the doc said it is a hormonal thing that all kids go through about this age and to just do our best to be there for him .We also informed the counselor and teachers at school and they talk to him to make sure he 's ok .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He also does nt have the same friends cause some have moved away or went to different schools within the district .I would suggest letting her know its normal and you totally understand and ask her if there 's anything she can think of that you can do to help her .That way she feels a part of the process and she is trying to help herself with it .Good Luck , I hope this helps .when my 12 yr old was around 10 she started her period and I knew it was coming because she started getting headaches all the time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Honestly , I 'd talk to her pediatrician .While this could be hormonal , typical pre - teen behavior or , as you said \" drama queen \" type behavior , it could also be some form of depression .I 'm certainly no expert except I have a 20 year old daughter , but I can say , while hormones , pre - teen stuff and drama queen things occurred in my home , it was n't all the time .Crying all the time would be concerning to me .Take her to the doctor ! ! ! ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am not sure why but for some strange reason it is easier to write your feelings than to speak out loud , have her write it and reassure her that you wo n't judge .Let her know that you will love her no matter what .Believe me it works now my daughter and god daughter talks me to death .give her lots of time with just the 2 of you without asking questions . sometimes just being quite doing something simple can make the other person feel they have to fill the silence and she may just choose to talk about what is on her mind .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "i hope things get better , good luck .That 's a tough one .Teen girls can be all about the drama and it does seem to start as soon as they hit double digits .Have there been any changes in your daughters life ?How long has this been going on ?When did it start ?Sometimes it is difficult for any child to be able to talk to their parent if there is something that is making her sad and cry .They do nt think that we can relate .Like we have nt already been through being a teenage girl .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
