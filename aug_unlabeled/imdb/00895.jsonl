{"text": "So when you find this evidence , it reinforces the negative opinion / stereotype , and probably justifies a whole bunch of other stereotypes as well .Now , to be fair , this kind of thinking is human nature ( IMO ) .Our species has a nasty habit of forming opinions first and seeking information to support the opinion later , and rejecting information that would contradict that opinion .This is why Europeans once believed the Earth was the center of the universe , for example , to the point of persecuting Galileo when he found evidence to the contrary .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now , if we are wired to think this way , you might ask , what 's wrong with following our brains down that natural path ?Simple answer : if your initial opinion is based on poor data ( like a stereotype ) , it 's probably wrong .And all the information you find to support that opinion is just digging you into the wrong deeper .So let 's examine mike as an example .Mike seems to believe that all , or most , black people are \" loud and disturbing . \"He certainly thinks it 's common enough that he does n't question the inclusion of a ridiculously loud black character in Transformers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anyway , it only takes one example to make a stereotype \" true \" , and mike sees several examples , so mike thinks , \" Whoa , looks like there 's something to this stereotype .\" If one stereotype is \" true \" , why not believe all of them ?Put a bunch of stereotypes together , and you 've got a prejudice .Use that prejudice to exert power over the group in question , or to support this kind of power abuse ( by not questioning prejudices when you see them , for example ) , and you 've got racism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Okay .And even though white people are sometimes loud and disturbing - probably more often statistically than black people , since there are a lot more white people in this country - mike has n't absorbed any negative stereotypes about white people from the media .So he does n't conclude that the loudness of white people reflects on the whole race .So he knows enough of reality to avoid forming any sort of Asians Are Loudmouths stereotype .Or he may have absorbed a different stereotype , and one I 've heard often : Asians Are Quiet And Passive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So here 's the thing .-If you believe a stereotype about a particular race , you 're supporting racism .-If you fail to question or protest that stereotype when you encounter it , you 're supporting racism .-If you make excuses for stereotyping - i.e. , \" Well , everybody got stereotyped , so what are you complaining about ? \" or \" Come on , it was just a fun movie , you need to lighten up ! \" or \" Well , my Indian friend liked it ! \" - you 're supporting racism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sorry , it 's taken me so long to show up , but I 've stayed away because of the spoliers .I still have n't read Nora 's post , but I did read the proceeding racist , immature , dumbass comments left by juveniles who have obviously nothing to do until junior high is back in session .I try to only break out the disemvoweler for repeat offenders who are n't doing much more than trolling .I have n't read all the comments so I 'm not sure if anyone qualifies yet .however , Nora has the power to squish people , too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well Nora , ( ABW ) I read your argument and I have a few responses that I hope you will take the time to look over .Firstly , Bernie Mac is a comedian .He is supposed to play ridiculous and rude characters .He always has .That 's as far as I think I need to go with this ( also , do you really think that Bernie Mac would deliberately endorse racism ?Do you think he is so mindless as to participate in something like that ?Perhaps the vision of the \" mindless black servant to the entertainment industry \" is a stereotype that you yourself should have grown out of by now .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Tyrese Gibson played a noble character , and you seem to have conceded that point in your original assertion , so I wo n't expand on this further .Anthony Anderson 's character was a genius .The film emphasized this throughout .In order for a genius to be believable , he has to have an eccentricity .This is commonplace in modern cinema .Your complaints about the feds busting into the house of Anderson 's character are also silly ; they were after stolen information , and traced it to his house .As for Jazz , his dialect was , as you said , an 80 's homage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He did not die a like a \" punk \" , he died nobly defending the human race .He paid the ultimate sacrifice , and in hollywood cinema , there is no greater honor ( think about the movie Armageddon ... is the real hero Bruce Willis 's character or Ben Affleck 's guy ?Death for a just cause is Hollywood 's way of distinguishing heroes ; separating the ' men from the boys ' as for as glory goes ...Jazz was written to be the noblest good guy ... not the other way around ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While you seem intent on insisting that Hollywood is intentionally creating a racial divide , I think that the person who is really doing this is you .Wow !I ca n't believe that stupid people are making a fuss over racial sterotpes in a movie that featured giant robots .The guy was just letting out we he feels about issues that we face like outsourcing ., etc . .Geez woman do n't you have something better to do than call a sci - fi movie racist like fix your weave , pop locking and updating your ebt card ... hmmm .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So , while we 're all being so evenhanded with the discussion , why do nt we include any stereotypes , generalizations or racism perpetrated against whites ?I d say the biggest disservice in America is the fact that whites are still held accountable for the actions of their ancestors , and blacks in general are allowed to feed off the fact that they feel \" owed \" something .If we want to get into the evils of our ancestry how about all the ( millions of)white slaves captured by the Moors in the 15th-17th centuries ?Never hear a thing about that , would nt want the nation of Victems to lose the last leg they have to stand on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Most of the stupid is coming from one - time drive - bys .I may have the power to squash , but I do n't have the patience .Rather than waste more time teaching Racism 101 to these people , I think at this point that I 'd rather just shut the whole thread down .I prefer not to give racists another podium from which to vent their spleen .They 've got so many other podiums , after all , so let them go to those .Apologies to the folks here who actually wanted to have a reasoned discussion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I did n't even know 9 1/2 Weeks had sequels .Honestly , I had no idea what to expect from 9 1/2 Weeks .I know it was nominated for 3 Razzies .Aside from that , I had no idea what this movie had .The conclusion ... 9 1/2 weeks is not only boring but an empty shell of a movie .It 's one of the movies that only focuses on one plot component and nothing else about it is ever explored .The story is boring , the characters are boring and the film even has a boring soundtrack .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This leads to a relationship of ups and downs along with lots of four play and sex scenes that get old really quickly .Firstly , I still have no idea what the point of this movie is .I 'm guessing it 's trying to be sort of like \" Love Story \" where they 're just showing drama as it comes naturally in life .However this movie does n't know how to do that .You need to have interesting characters in order to pull that kind of thing off .Elizabeth , John and every other character are just tools to a plot that make no real sense .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The acting for the most part is just okay .Mickey Rourke plays a confusing and terribly written role well .Kim Basinger on the other hand is a different story .I mean her acting is n't outright awful but it 's very ... sporadic .Whenever her character is required to feel something , she usually goes to a major extreme of the required emotion .She 's either really quiet and vacant or really , really loud .It 's just very distracting .Maybe if her performance was consistent , I would give her a pass .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is a huge pet peeve for me because Sex can only take you so far in a film .There has to be something else about the story and the characters that the audience cares about .We do n't know much about our main character aside from Elizabeth is a divorced Gallery owner while John is just a freaky weirdo .Everything revolves around their sexual relationship and I can care less about that .The film really is just a boring , empty film with some sex scenes to show how hot Basinger and Rourke are .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would watch this movie than Gigli again .At the same time , this movie is a boring affair for the eyes .The characters are one dimensional , the story is not that interesting , the music is a real snore and even our main stars look a little awkward when doing their sexual scenes .9 1/2 Weeks is just a boring flick .It 's going to be hard to review this movie based on the fact that it 's almost a flawless film .The Lego Movie has comedy , heart , great characters , beautiful animation and a great voice cast .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With a lot of bad movies that came out this year , Lego Movie was a great breath of fresh air .Emmett ( Chris Pratt ) is a regular Lego figure who pretty much is like every other Lego .So much so , he feels left out a lot and has no real friends .Then he is mistakenly gets identified as the key to saving the world .With the help of \" Wild Style \" ( Elizabeth Banks ) and Batman ( Will Arnett ) they will take down the Lego Tyrant President Business ( Will Ferrell ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Practically every joke in this movie works and gets a laugh every time .For instance , Batman in this movie is pretty much a Dick .But you know what ?It 's funny a lot of the time .It never comes off lame or insulting to the Batman Character .It 's hard to say which character I love the best , Emmett or President Business .Both are very great and colorful characters that are not only funny , but are thoughtful and heart felt characters too .Chris Pratt gives Emmett both great comedic deliveries and great humanity to a plastic talking toy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only real Nitpick I have with this movie is the fact that the Animation can be a little too fast paced .Do n't get me wrong , this probably the best animation I 've ever seen but there are times when I do feel the film can slow down a bit .There were some scenes where I did ask myself \" What just happened \" ?But like I said , it 's a nitpick issue .This might be the best movie of the year , it really is the great .The Lego Movie really can be enjoyed by both children and adults .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just check it out if you have n't already .I now only have this to say ...EVERYTHING IS AWESOME !I 'm just ... speechless .Where the hell did this movie come from ?Why were these five morons given a movie anyway ?There is literally no plot , rhyme or reason to Spice World .It 's a painful experience from Beginning to End .I would 've been a little bit more easier on this movie if it was just a direct to Home Video release but no , this waste of time actually got into theaters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So Spice World is about ...oh screw it , THERE IS NO PLOT !Seriously , there 's not even one shred of story in this awful excuse of a film .Every scene is just random and all the characters ( especially The Spice Girls ) are as flat as a freaking board .To put it simply , this movie is just an hour and 32 minute commercial for The Spice Girls .And when I say every scene is random , I mean it !There are Aliens , a Dance Boot Camp , A Pregnant friend , A Documentary subplot , a villainous Paparazzi guy , Roger Moore and lots of other elements that make no real sense and have no proper place in the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It does n't matter if we 're talking about the supporting characters or The Spice Girls themselves .No person in the cast even tries to give a decent performance let alone a good one .Still The Spice Girls take the cake on the whole \" Ca n't Act \" scale .Every time one or more of them opened their mouths I was in serious misery .They are just ...IRRITATING !I know what a lot of you are thinking , \" Oh Brad , what were you expecting ?It 's a movie about The Spice Girls .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I do n't have anything else to say about this movie .Yeah this might be the shortest review I 've ever written , but I do n't care to be honest .Spice World is just ...STUPID .It has stupid writing , a stupid execution and a really stupid idea .I even hesitate to call Spice World a movie because it 's just a really commercial and addition to a singing group that nobody remembers .After watching North , I only have one question ...What is the point of this movie ?I seriously have no idea what purpose this movie has or who it was made for .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Okay ... but where 's the comedy ?Along with that , how can any family enjoy this worthless piece of cinema ?I totally agree with the late Roger Ebert : \" I hated this movie , HATED IT \" !Let 's examine this weird movie known as \" North \" .North ( Elijah Wood ) is a kid who is very obedient , polite and very \" smart \" .However this prodigy kid is not appreciated by his parent ( Jason Alexander and Julia Louis Dreyfuss ) so he divorces them both .North then sets out on a journey to find a new set of parents around the globe .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well you would be very surprised .Let 's discuss the comedy first .NONE OF THE JOKES WORK !In fact , a lot of the jokes in North sound more bizarre and scary than funny .It 's almost like this movie is filled with people who should be put into Mental Wards or something .The film also has a lot of racist stereotypes that pretty much the butt of the many jokes in this picture .It 's actually quite disturbing and offensive .Honestly , it felt like I was watching Movie 43 again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Another jarring thing about North is how many reputable actors and actresses there are in this movie .Alan Arkin , Dan Aykroyd , Kathy Bates , John Ritter and Bruce Willis .Let 's not forget this bit : they all give terrible performances .Granted , they have a terrible script filled with jokes that make no sense but really ?I guess the only person that came close to giving a good performance was the late John Ritter .Also it 's hard to really pick on Elijah Wood considering the fact that he plays a really bad role very well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And you know what ?That 's saying a lot !This kid is supposed to be a brilliant and intelligent boy .But he 's not !He 's judgmental , he 's self centered and by the time the film ends you wonder if North himself is clinically insane .I 've been racking my brain to answer one simple question : what is the worst thing about a movie that is filled with such horrendous things anyway ?Well North is missing one thing : Heart .There is no emotional connection or any real family bonding in this movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact , his parents comatose for more than half the movie .No situation or person in this movie seems real .I still have no idea why this movie was made or what the purpose of the film actually is .It 's just a very confusing and offensive film .It has bad acting , bad writing , terrible direction from Rob Reiner , offensive jokes and of course jokes that sound bizarre instead of funny .I just have one question for Mr. Reiner : What were you thinking Meat Head ?( if you know where that line is from , 10 bonus points ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's , without a doubt , one of the most underrated movies ever .I 've mentioned it in a lot of my reviews during past Horror Movie Months .Here 's what I 'm reviewing : .Caroline Williams : Williams plays Stretch , the designated female victim of the film .She 's a lot better than most designated female victims from the ' 80s and a billion times smarter than most too .Williams gives a pretty good performance .The black comedy : Tobe Hooper said that people missed the black comedy in the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre , so he ramped it up so people would notice it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
