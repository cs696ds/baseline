{"text": "THE FIVE MOST OVERRATED ACTORS .Most of my top five lists are of my personal favorites , but I thought it would be interesting and thought provoking to make a list of something more negative .I made a list of who I believe are the top five most overrated actors in classic Hollywood .Now , all of the actors on the list have much more talent than I do .I am not saying they did not have talent , but in my opinion they were just overrated .Let me know what you think ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think the problem I have with Errol Flynn is I do not care much for the swashbuckler type film that he was famous for in the late 1930s and early 1940s .He was the bad boy Russell Crowe of his day , but I just could never get into Flynn .His personal life and problems I think were much more interesting than any film he ever made .JAMES DEAN ( 1931 - 1955 )This may be a controversial view to have , but I feel that actor James Dean was famous because he died .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , he made four popular films , but I still prefer other actors of his day like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen much more .Dean had a look that is forever frozen in time because of his death .He had the look , but I did not see the ability so much .VICTOR MATURE ( 1913 - 1999 )Again , I feel that Victor Mature was another actor who made it because of his looks .He made some interesting movies and some pretty bad movies .Has anyone ever seen \" Red , Hot , And Blue\"(1949 ) with Mature and Betty Hutton - a real stinker of a movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He was perfect person to play Samson in \" Samson And Delilah\"(1949 ) with Susan Hayward , but I could not see Victor Mature playing Hamlet .WARREN BEATTY ( born 1937 )I have seen interviews through the years that Warren Beatty has done , and personally I just do not like the man .I have tried to sit through a Warren Beatty movie - everything from \" Bonnie And Clyde \" ( 1967 ) to \" Dick Tracy\"(1990 ) , and I just can not do it .Beatty looks like he does not care what the audiences think .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Maybe it 's for the best , if his personality is anything I think it is like - he probably does not want to be viewed as an aging actor who once made it big in tinsel town .RICHARD BURTON ( 1925 - 1984 )There are people I see in my every day life that make my skin just itch .Richard Burton is one of those people on the screen who when I see him , I feel dirty and have to itch .Burton just looks simply dirty to me .Even just seeing him on film , I picture his breath smelling like the dinner and booze he had the night before .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like many of the stars I picked for the list , Burton was very popular in Hollywood , and his marriage to Elizabeth Taylor was more legendary than any movie he made .However , I do not understand his appeal .Yes , he was British but there were much better British actors out there from Laurence Olivier to James Mason .That is why I picked Richard Burton as the most overrated actor I know ... .27 comments : .I agree with your comments on Dean .However , Burton did some great work in the 60s , along with some dreck .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Too often he is bombastic though .I 'm not sure anyone thinks that highly of Mature or Beatty as actors though , so I do n't know if one could consider them over - rated .Mature was self - effacing about his talent .But Beatty strikes me as someone very full of himself . H'm .I 'm on board with Beatty and Dean , and on the fence about Burton .I disagree about Flynn and Mature .In fact , far from being overrated I think both are rather underrated as actors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Victor Mature could bring it in the right circumstances such as \" Cry of the City \" , \" My Darling Clementine \" and \" Kiss of Death \" .Totally agreed Errol Flynn was underrated .If you watch him in the Thank You Lucky Star as cameo , you will see he could sing and dance .And as a fun - loving guy , he was a natural comedian .But he was typecast and never had chance to develop his potential .His fencing coach Ralph Faulkner stated , \" Many people underrated Errol ... but he never failed to amaze me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The way his brain worked and the way he handled himself with a sword , made it clear to me there was more to him than met the eye .There 'll never be another quite like him . \"According to Faulkner , Errol made those hard fencing scenes look easy .Except for Burton , the other four actors were rarely given challenging roles ( and Dean was n't around long enough to get a chance at being versatile ) .That said , there 's no doubt Burton did squander his talent .I say your list is solid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "David , I always enjoy reading these kinds of list .Actually , I think Flynn was underrated -- he was highly versatile , having done swashbucklers , comedies , war films , Westerns , and drama .He gave some fine performances , too , as in THE FORSYTE WOMAN .Until he started slumming in the late 1960s , I think Burton was one of the best actors of his generation .I agree vehemently with all 5 .Perhaps especially Dean .He mumbled and stumbled and his performance in Giant was pathetic .His popularity astounds me ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Errol was a natural born actor and one that could out - flank any of the actors of today !Just watch a Flynn film and you will understand .I totally agree with you on all of these especially James Dean .He acted like a child in my opinion .I have seen all 3 movies he made and the only one I can tolerate is Rebel without a cause but the rest I ca n't stand .I doubt he would be huge if he lived , he did n't have talent like Clark Gable and Cary Grant .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

' are two examples .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As far as James Dean is concerned .All of his roles can be summed up in one sentence .\" Inarticulate punk plays inarticulate punk .Errol Flynn was the original Bad A$ $ on and off the screen .As for Dean he struck deep emotions in his performances that you obviously could n't fathom .Another thing not only did Dean get the Tony on Broadway , he was considered for Steiger 's role in \" Oaklahoma \" , but he was too lean .Burton had good diction in \" Shrew \" .Beattys Clyde was a likeable anti hero .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I found the composition of many of these shots to be groundbreaking and well before their time .The set design , with the use of the staircase and the garden to convey psychological tension and anguish , was inspired and also quite modern for the use of these techniques in a historical drama .The costumes were not only beautiful but also worked so well to convey the story .Olivia 's gown in the final scenes is breathtaking , dovetailing beautifully with her personal transformation .And I ca n't even begin to tell you how much Aaron Copland 's Oscar - winning score adds to this film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Olivia De Haviland is so thoroughly believeable as Catherine , it 's almost , no , it IS very painful to watch her being taken in by Morris .I kept hoping , like Catherine , maybe Morris is sincere but I knew that was n't to be .I found myself so emotionally involved with the story until I felt it as deeply as Olivia 's character did when she realized she had been deserted by her suitor .The scene where she breaks down in tears is an incredible example of how a good actress can affect the viewer with just the slightest motions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
