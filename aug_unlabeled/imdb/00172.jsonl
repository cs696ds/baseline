{"text": "Great review .Making a sequel to the original Halloween is an awful idea ; it just ca n't be done , no matter how hard you try .It 's really annoying when there are sequels to a movie or book that ends on a perfect cliffhanger .The series would have been better if they had used Carpenter 's original idea , which was to make each new movie be it 's own separate story , and the only bond between them would be that they all take place on Halloween night .They made a mistake in having Michael Myers be in Pt .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
