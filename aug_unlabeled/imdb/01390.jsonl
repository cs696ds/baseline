{"text": "When Curly was 12 , he accidentally shot himself in the left ankle while cleaning a rifle .Moe rushed him to the hospital and saved his life .The wound resulted in his leg being noticeably thinner , and he also suffered a slight limp .Curly was so frightened of surgery that he never had the limp corrected .While with the Stooges , he developed his famous exaggerated walk to mask the limp on screen .Curly was interested in music and comedy , and would watch his brothers Shemp and Moe perform as stooges in Ted Healy 's vaudeville act .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
