{"text": "so i ve watched hostel last night and while i ve got to admit some of the ideas in that film are good i think it is just TOO violent .i m still shocked about some scenes and surprised it was nt really cut on tv .so my question is : do we really need such violent movies ?i personally think a movie can be pretty good without displaying all that violence and it is kinda sickening .Ca n't say i need them , personally , but i do enjoy them - the gorier the better !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

Amber Heard ) , which I thought failed ( partly ) because it was n't shocking enough .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
