{"text": "This week in TV Guide : May 9 , 1964 .T his TV Guide came out the day after my fourth birthday , but that 's not why I picked it up .No , I ran across this isolated copy in an antique store and , despite the fact it was somewhat battered and missing a page , I bought it to find out just what that outlandish TV spoof was that fooled a nation .After all , how can you pass up a teaser like that ?Somewhat to my surprise , it turned out the answer was the classic British series The Avengers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you 're been a regular reader , you know The Avengers is a favorite of mine , particularly Patrick Macnee 's dapper John Steed .( Of course , there 's the beautiful Honor Blackman , the painfully young Diana Rigg , and the shapely Linda Thorson , but that is a topic - or two , or three - for another day .Or week . )I 've got the complete boxed set at home , and after having gone through the whole series once , I 'm feeling as if it 's about time to start from the top once again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Considering the leather catsuits that Honor Blackman wore , could you really have thought this was straight drama ?Apparently so , based on the frustration expressed by producer John Bryce , who after two seasons has finally admitted that \" The Avengers was conceived as a satire of counterespionage thrillers , but the British public still insists on taking it seriously . \"To be fair about it , the early episodes when Steed was partnered with Ian Hendry , John Rollason and Julie Stevens , were of quite a different tenor .The series was in black and white back then , and shot on tape rather than film , giving the shows a somewhat stagebound feeling Cathy Gale , Blackman 's character , was smart , independent , and tough - every bit the equal of her male counterparts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Seeing these episodes in isolation , one could understand how viewers could have seen The Avengers as pretty much of a straight drama , albeit with some lighthearted moments .The straw that broke the camel 's back , apparently , came a year or so into the run when critic Lionel Hale , appearing on a television panel show , expressed amazement that people did n't realize the show \" was being played for laughs .\" The others on the panel protested - The Avengers did n't bill itself as satire , so how could this be the case ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After this little exchange , producer Bryce started looking back at past episodes , \" moodily wonder[ing ] what more he could do in the realm of wild unreality to get the idea over . \" Bryce even contemplated \" a program in which Mrs. Gale would be tied to the railroad tracks with the midnight express swiftly approaching .He said this was bound to give the game away .\" By the time The Avengers made it over here , it fit in perfectly with shows like The Man From U.N.C.L.E. , Batman , and other over - the - top adventure series .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So perhaps we were already well prepared for the joke by that time .Still , I have to admit that the hook for this article turned out to be something of a letdown .I guess the joke was on me this time .During the 60s , the Ed Sullivan Show and The Hollywood Palace were the premiere variety shows on television .Questions : I wonder what Mary Tyler Moore was doing on Sullivan 's show ?She would n't have had a standup act , would she ?The Van Dyke show was in full swing so doubtless she was promoting that , perhaps with a clip ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jackie Mason was a regular performer on the Sullivan show , at least for a few more months .I 've written before about Dale Robertson ; he 's my kind of guy , but I 'm not sure that even Dale can help the Palace out too much .I was never a fan of Betty Hutton ; thought she was too much over the top .Paul Lynde is good , but I think he 's got to be playing off of someone else .The rest of the show does n't do a lot for me , which means that though it 's not his best , I 'm giving the nod this week to Sullivan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the fourth part of a continuing series , TV Guide 's editors have asked celebrities what they think of the current state of TV : has programming improved , what kinds of shows would you like to see , and what is the medium 's greatest need .In general , the consensus seems to be that TV has improved technically and in its ability to cover news and sports , but that the overall quality is either stagnant or has actually gone down .Vidal sees television with an \" enthusiastic commitment \" to producing junk , while Shulman blames a lack of talented writers and interference from network executives , and Baskin describes programming as \" essentially pap . \" , and Schulz talks of the need for the \" artist to be able to record his work without its being torn apart and put together again by a host of others in authority .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Vidal comments acidly that television needs \" a sense that getting people to buy things they do not need is morally indefensible , \" and Halsman looks back with nostalgia \" of the time laughter came out of me and not out of a can . \" In many ways , we could be having this conversation today .You 'd see some of the same complaints about commercials and commercialism , you 'd read comments about a need for more serious coverage of the news , you 'd hear calls for more creativity and less interference .And yet this is n't really a situation where we look back at an era that was never as good as we thought it was , one that 's been burnished by time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anthologies , the lifeblood of early television , were mostly gone , being replaced by sitcoms such as The Beverly Hillbillies , and by the middle of the 60s there was a general consensus that TV was being dumbed down dramatically .Though I have many favorite shows from this time period , it 's not particularly an era I 'd be anxious to return to .Those three would turn out to be Tina Louise , Russell Johnson and Dawn Wells .I do n't know that I 'd ever have considered myself a big fan of Gilligan , but I liked most of those people on it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He was competing with himself .Hard to imagine that nowadays .I 'd tell you more of the Teletype news from New York , but that 's one of the pages ripped out of this issue .Someone thought a coupon for Kraft mustard was more important .They were probably right .Despite the notation above about the diminishing quality of television , I offer you , without comment , another installment of this week 's lament on the decline of television .The 1963 Emmy Award nominations have just been announced .The categories are a bit different from what we 're used to today ; in addition to best comedy , drama and variety series , there 's an award for \" the best program of the year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The shows were quite different in many ways , but they shared a similar structure , that of a young doctor paired up with an older mentor ( Vincent Edwards and Sam Jaffe on Casey , Richard Chamberlain and Raymond Massey on Kildare . )Each of these series features plotlines this week that I think would be told differently were they on TV today .In Breaking Point , the subject is autism , in the story \" And James Was a Very Small Snail .\" Autism was n't a very well - known or understood condition in 1964 , so the material was probably much fresher than it would be today .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thompson 's burden is to con vince Petey 's parents and older brother that Petey 's only chance at making progress is if he remains at the clinic .In each of these episodes , we 're presented with something of an existential dilemma that in my opinion would be missed by today 's television .Kenneth Newell , the biochemist in Eleventh Hour , is emblematic of a man driven to succeed , so much so that he 's willing to jeopardize his own life in the quest for an answer that may save many other lives .Breaking Point is , I think , even more fertile ground .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The issue would be the legal rights of the family vs. the health of Petey , which I think overlooks the heart of the drama : the mystery of existence , the depth of the human mind , what \" quality of life \" really means .Once again , without watching the show I ca n't tell what the producers did with the story , but given that it 's not an episode of Ben Casey , I think it 's safe to suggest that some of these deeper issues might have been explored .My point here ( and , as Ellen used to say , I do have a point ) is that in the 60s , \" issue \" drama was a big deal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By reducing the storyline in , say , Breaking Point to a legal , rather than an existential , point would be to miss that point entirely .If anyone out there has seen either or both of these episodes and can show my theories are full of hooey , by all means please do so .It would n't be the first time , trust me .But in reading these storylines , I could n't shake the idea that there was something about them that was different , richer , from what we might see today .If I have n't put you to sleep completely with that last section , a brief mention of this week 's cover story should be a good way to wrap things up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( It also did n't hurt that all but the last season was done in B&W. )The stars , Vic Morrow and Rick Jason , more or less alternated leads each week , though they also could appear together in stories .Morrow is probably the better known of the two , but Jason was thought by many to be the likely star of the series when it began , and he 's the focus of the unbylined profile .Jason reminds me a bit of a similar profile of Jack Lord that was done a few months before ; both come across as men trying just a little too hard to show everyone what Renaissance men they are .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Makes me tired just to type that .The typically unnamed friend concedes that Jason probably does \" most , if not all , of these things \" but adds that \" he 's not as much of an expert as he 'd like you to think . \"His first wife says \" he is very handy - but he never finishes anything . \" Like Lord , he 's seen as something of a throwback to Hollywood 's larger - than - life stars of its glamorous past - \" Vic is more of an actor , \" another unnamed source says , \" Rick is a star .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" I was n't particularly impressed with Jason 's character as presented in the first episode of Combat ! , a show that for some reason I remembered from its last seasons , but like Jason the man , he grew on me as the series progressed .It 's never dated , because it 's frozen in time as a moment in history .However , I can promise that after I 've watched an episode featuring Rick Jason , I 've had no particular desire to get up and do some woodworking , fix the plumbing , whip up a gourmet meal , train a dog , study Chinese , . . . .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Musel 's beat mainly consisted of British shows that were making a splash over there , usually because of their controversial content .It was in Musel 's stories that I first read about That Was The Week That Was , a couple of years before NBC aired the JFK memorial show that won TW3 its American version .Musel also wrote of British dramas , sitcoms , variety shows , as well as certain American performers who 'd found success on the other side of the pond .When ABC in America picked up The Avengers for summer filler , nobody was more surprised than I was .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It surprised the British producers even more .British ABC ( Associated British Corporation , formerly Rediffusion ) , which had only started filming the series , quickly upgraded to color ( sorry - colour ) production ; some purists still believe this \" Americanized \" ( read \" wrecked \" ) the show .This debate continues to the present day .I 'm still poking around in the \" Lost Month \" posts ; I do n't know if anybody 's been checking those out ( I only got around to The Untouchables a few days ago ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
