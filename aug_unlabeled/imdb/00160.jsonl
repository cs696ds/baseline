{"text": "Agent Manners - FBI with the normal smug personality .I 'd like to see him and Moulder argue about killer snowmen for an hour .Dies of \" frostbite .\" Stone - Scientist who created the genetic acid which bonded Jack Frost to the snow .Ends up filled with snow .Jill and Tommy - Shannon Elizabeth and um , some guy !Two young lovers , and she really needed to get naked .I could sleep at night if she had gotten naked .Anyway , he gets an icicle through the head and she dies from a case of horizontal hypothermia mambo .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jake , Sally , and Billy - The rest of Jill 's family .Billy 's head is removed by a sled , Jake has an axe jammed down his throat , and Sally is strangled with Christmas lights .Chris , Joe , and Marla - The rest of the police force .Jack Frost runs over Chris with his own cruiser .Jack Frost - Killer who is accidently melted down with a genetic acid .He becomes a deadly snowman !Dissolved in antifreeze .A killer snowman , ( I 'll let that sink in for a few moments . ) created when a serial killer is melted by genetic acid , which combines with snow of course .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Okay , so it does n't work , you explain the damn thing .Jack is pretty annoyed with Sam for capturing him in the first place , getting melted probably did n't help things , so he begins killing off the rednecks , um , townspeople .Scary thing is we are constantly bombarded with AWFUL puns .Hurray for the film 's creators , they never attempt to be serious - smart move when you 're dealing with killer snowman movies .Poor Sam makes every attempt to stop the murderous snow cone , high powered bullets , blowing up the police station , even using hairdryers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Finally Ryan 's oatmeal proves effective , it 's secret ingredient is Antifreeze !I never said Ryan was a very good cook ...One of my favorite parts is when Jack strangles Sally with the Christmas lights and smashes her face into a box of ornaments , though Jill undressing to sexy Christmas music worked nicely .All the absurdity you can ask for , Badmovies.org 's must see for the Christmas season .They just finished blowing the police station to kingdom come , hoping to destroy the evil snow cone in the process of course .It looks like the blast mixed up Jack a little bit , I wonder how many snowmen like this are built near places \" the short school bus \" makes its stops .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I love the sassy cop , who has the best lines in the movie .That snowman in this movie is one hell of a lot less scary than the one in the Michael Keaton Jack Frost .Now that is a movie monster if I ever saw one .And one other thing : why was n't the cop concerned that his son was trying to poison him with antifreeze ?I mean , it did n't disturb him one bit .I watched this a while back because of the catch phrase thing : \" He chills , he kills \" and the hologram thing on the cover .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My fave part was when the teenage boy is looking around for what made that weird noise and jack 's white oven mitt / hand punches him .The teenager goes \" who the hell are you \" or something to that effect , and jack goes \" wel it ai nt f - ing frosty \" he does n't actually say \" f - ing \" , but i m not gon na do that to the little ones out there .Reply # 5 .Possibly the greatest film ever created .I seriously doubt that the intention was to create a classic , nor should I waste my time with analyzing how it could have been better .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's why I think analyzing how Marlon Brando and Dustin Hoffman could have made the movie better is a waste of time and effort .You ca n't beat the intense high quality animation of the acid reacting with him to create the monster that is Jack Frost .And what about when he 's in the back of the truck , he could n't possibly know the truck will crash and allow for his escape , yet he looks directly at the camera and exclaims \" Oh ya ! \"Seriously , I do n't think you can look at this movie any other way than by viewing it as a good source of laughter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ahh , APIX Films strikes again .Still , this was funny enough to enjoy .The scene in the bathtub with the carrot will probably go down in history , but not a whole lot else from this movie makes it stand out .Watch it because you know it 's stupid .Dude , you OBVIOUSLY did not give this movie the attention it deserves .There is SO much more to be learned from this film then what you put down .For starters , backwoods teen couples REGULARLY choose to make out in their locals sheriff 's house , even thought they 're not related to him or anything .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You also forgot how easily it is to make several huge snowmen even though there 's very little snow on the ground ( not to mention how easy it is for roads to be blocked off cause of snow ... ) .Heck not to mention that anytime you tell an avergae hillbilly to \" fill up the back of their truck with anti - freeze \" they 'll actually think you mean to POUR it into the back , rather than just stock up on a bunch of bottles .You also should have learned that flying icicles can easily pierce right THROUGH someone 's skull , ( not to mention a house wall . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
