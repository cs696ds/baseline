{"text": "I believe Chronicle is the best found footage film ever made however , Cloverfield is the most realistic .The way these actors portrayed their reactions to an unknown extra - terrestrial being was done very well and you can actually tell that they are terrified unlike all the other alien movies out there where their characters do n't even look that scared at all .As for the ending , people should not criticize it just because it did n't turn out like they hoped .I do n't want to spoil anything for anybody who has n't seen this yet , but there s a reason its call a \" found footage \" film and not a \" given film \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Of course people will be watching this movie for the visceral pleasure and Colverfield delivers .Many thrilling visual and sound effects wowed me ( there were a few times I yelled out in shock at a sudden scare ) .Any horror film will also benefit from a sense of entrapment and this movie pulls off the seemingly impossible feat of making New York City seem claustrophobic because there was seemingly nowhere to hide from the monster .What is the monster ?Whatever it is clearly is meant to be an allegory for the carnage 9/11 inflicted on New York , much the same way Godzilla was meant to be an allegory for the damage inflicted on Japan by the atom bomb .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Touching upon real life horror , plus creating characters that we can relate to and care about , and assaulting our senses with incredible sights and sounds leads to entertainment worth watching many times over .Perhaps the 80 minute run time will bother some people , but on the other hand I think that 's better than a film wearing out its welcome .Great job J.J. Abrams and company !This film was n't too bad and I guess they used the camcorder as a means to capture that mockumentary view of the movie .The storyline was interesting and icould of used a betterview to see what the creature was and why all of this was happening .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At this point , I do n't think I 'm telling any secrets or revealing anything that is n't already known about this film : producer J.J. Abrams , director Matt Reeves and writer Drew Goddard have constructed a spare , seemingly low - budget concept movie .That this is a creature movie -- and what a creature it is , replete with nearly impregnable skin and spouting offspring that 's much smaller but nasty and plentiful -- seems to be somewhat of a subject experiment .It is n't until the more intimate , scary and tangential moments of the later film does it seem that there 's much reason to have any interest into their fates , and by then , it feels like too little and too late .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The hand - held effect of filming a movie , particularly in a horror / sci - fi sense , is something of an work in audience endurance .Since there is a premium on audience fear , confusion and apprehension in any scary film , the objective of the filmmaker is to make that fear roundly and emotionally real .If one can stomach(Literally and figuratively)the bouncy , disjointed and shaky filming process -- which seems fairly credible given the circumstances -- then the movie 's creators have done a fantastic that said viewer will be impressed .Overall , I'd say this movie is certainly worth a look , though I would n't give any grand superlatives for how brilliant or great it is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "NO more , no less .I 've gotten tired of the gimmicky \" found - footage \" style of filmmaking , especially in horror films .I love the horror genre for many reasons , and these films ... they have plagued it with the same old approach .However , \" Cloverfield \" , in spite of its premise , offers something new for movie - goers .Think of is as \" Godzilla \" , but if it had been filmed with a piece - of - shit camcorder .Also , the monster here is n't Japanese .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The creature , on the other hand , is a character of its own .It does not have a personality , but the FX used to create it looks fantastic .This film needed to be handled by people with money , because you ca n't have a shitty looking monster unless you do n't intend on showing it .And that 's not what happens here ; even if the monster is kind of scared of the camera to begin with .But that 's what makes it all work . \"Cloverfield \" is an experience and a ride .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It 's very disorienting , which adds to the experience ; you never figure out what the hell is going on but you 're so into survival that you put it past you .You 're placed with a bunch of characters whom you get to know and eventually must join in their frenzied search for a friend while being subjected to some horrifying imagery and new threats .The effects look great and realistic thanks to the hand - held camera , which is n't too bad - looking if you manage to get a seat further from the screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you 're bound to be upset over seeing a movie with a lack of music , then stay for the credits , during which a fantastic suite of music composed by Michael Giacchino titled \" Roar !( Cloverfield Theme ) \" plays .All in all , a fantastic time at the movies .A little more background on the monster would be nice , though the absence of this information is intentional .Everyone in the theater was rooting for a sequel ; maybe a second set of footage is found elsewhere ?Or perhaps there is more the the viral marketing -- what exactly were Slusho and Tagruato ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
