{"text": "Also , why lump in the 3D format with regular BR when 3D requires special equipment for viewing ?In my opinion , a 3D disc is something that makes sense to have to purchase separately .They 've really gone off the deep end on this decision and I sure hope it will make them wake up and realize that they are actually losing money in sales ..... since money is clearly all they are interested in !LOL , I'M COMPLAINING WITH THE CAPSLOCK ON BECAUSE I'M TOO LAZY / UPTIGHT TO TURN IT OFF .HERE 'S WHY , DISNEY - MARVEL GOT MORE OF MY MONEY WHEN I BOUGHT THE WINTER SOLDIER ON BLU - RAY FROM WAL - MART WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT A DIGITAL COPY CODE WAS INSIDE .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Secondly , my birthday is next month a I 'd told my wife I 'd like the Bluray / DVD / Digital Combo .She could n't find it , so I searched and found this page .We 'll just RedBox it and buy the Bluray when it 's cheaper .The one is a thousand with a 3D Blurayplayer is n't worth pissing the rest of us off . jeez , you people are worse than my 4 year old .Itz that simple .thatz what i did with thor 2 and spent about as much as i would buying the blu - ray / dvd combo on past sets of mcu movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Technology is moving away from 3D , not toward it , tech experts are calling it a trend , get with the program and let us pick .Give us the option .If you want to make more money , give plenty of options .I wo n't be buying this .Are you kidding me with the combo pack ?After the backlash from Thor 2 you seriously thought you could force that garbage on people again ?More money I 'll be saving .You keep screwing yourself , because I do n't know a single person who has or wants a 3D - Blu Ray player .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I know some people do n't care and that 's fine , but MarvelDisney guess what , you 're alienating people .I remember commenting on the Thor 2 combo pack debacle , and nobody I know has cracked on buying the inferior combo pack or overpriced plain DVD with no extras .One person DVR'd it on cable one random night while flipping channels and figured that everyone could just goes over there if they feel the need to watch it .Nobody has , because it just reminds people of your BS . @wraithkelso I have been wondering the same thing for the last few weeks , come on Marvel you said . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Looking forward to the film on Blu - Ray Disc this September ! ! !If we do n't like the fact that they 've decreased our options , we should let them know .We have the right to voice our displeasure at the new business model .Why not buy the single - disc BR or DVD ?Because there 's no digital copy , because there are no extras , and because we are getting less than before even if we buy both the BR and DVD .The combo packs made it worth it because you could get the 3 copies you wanted in one box , and there were the extras included on one of the discs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , I know , boo hoo , there are worse problems in the world ( which is glaringly obvious in this day and age ) .Nobody is taking this so seriously that our lives will stop over it .But we are allowed to tell MarvelDisney that we are n't happy about the money grab .Honestly , complaining about other people complaining is more annoying than the original complainers .At least the complainers are leaving feedback about the product .You , however , are just swearing and putting people down for daring to not just smile and nod and go along with things they do n't like . @ twojayz it looks like amazon and Disney are having some sort of argument , where amazon is not taking pre - orders on 2 Disney movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So it is more than likely it will be an itunes version based on company ties . @TemTem1 @damicus2099 You would n't have to by 3 separate copies .If you by the 3DBR , BR , DC combo pack , that gives you 2 of the 3 items you wanted .You can also buy just the DVD at Walmart .So at most you have to make 2 purchases .But why would you want a DVD anyway ?If you 've got Bluray and the Digital copy , that 's all you really need .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "jlwaters1 @ TemTem1 @damicus2099 Some of us watch the DVD more than the blu - ray .For example , I take DVDs with me when I travel .Typically I only use the blu - ray disk to watch the extras on the blu - ray when I first get the movie , and on the rare movie night at home .My DVDs see a lot more use than my blu - rays .However , I do n't want to buy just the DVD because then I would miss out on the extras that are only on the blu - ray . @ twojayz @ dabrry0523 If you remember with Thor TDW 's B;u release Target had an exclusive slip cover of the loki poster .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
