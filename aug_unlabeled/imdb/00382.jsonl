{"text": "The same old story lines and the same kind of triangles .I wanted something different ... something that would shake up our characters from the get go and give them a chance to show who they really are deep down inside .So I began something that would contradict everything that was supposed to have occurred in the show between graduation and four years later .These are my lost years .The time between then and now .I 'll probably only update once a week but I hope you enjoy .Disclaimer : I own nothing except my hope for a BL reunion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Background : This story takes place after Karen gave birth to Lily .Two important changes , though .Brooke was never going to spend the summer in California with Peyton .Brooke never made any comments about how lonely it was to be Lucas Scott 's girlfriend .Summary : \" I was wrong about you , \" Lucas once said .\" It 's okay ... most people are , \" Brooke responded .Since that day , Lucas learned not to underestimate the tempestuous brunette who continues to show the world , him included , that there is more to her than meets the eye .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The surprise instead comes in the realization that the love they shared was one that had not altered despite the heartache , hurt and sadness that came with a breakup neither truly wanted .Not even six months had passed and again , Lucas Scott found himself standing in front of a fresh grave .There was a new person beside him and a new name on the headstone , but the sadness inside his heart was the same .And this time , he was n't sure if he 'd get through it in one piece .\" We should get Lily inside now , Luke .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yet her touch , the feel of her skin against his , offered him no comfort .Lucas barely resisted the urge to shrug her away and instead ignored the sound of her voice in his ear . \"Luke ....Lucas ? ! \"\" Then go .Take her to the car .Go back to the house ... whatever , \" he said in a voice that had been roughened by tears and disuse .Peyton had no idea how to respond and appeared visibly surprised by the coldness of his words .\" We 'll take her , \" a quiet voice offered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lucas did n't see the concerned expression on her face or the look she shared with her husband .Did n't watch them walk away carrying their son and his new sister .One by one they all left the cemetery until only three remained .Brooke Davis resisted the urge to step forward and wrap her arms around the grieving boy who had been through too much heartache in such a short time .She had a thousand words on her tongue but her mind screamed that it was no longer her place to say them .He would n't need her now like he did after Keith was killed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Everything fell apart , she and Lucas were non - existent and on the worst possible terms .There should have been no reason to know Karen afterwards ... but that too changed .Because even with their jaded history between them , Brooke and Lucas finally found their way to friendship and Karen came through where her own mother failed .Her son asked her to , so Karen gave Brooke a place to stay and then proceeded to ground her for coming home drunk .She cared enough to do it , Lucas had once said .But most of all Brooke could n't forget the smile on Karen 's face when she first announced her engagement to Keith .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "When she felt his shoulders sag a little in response , Brooke knew he remembered that night they spent in front of the fire .\" I 'll see you back at the house , \" she added when she slowly released Lucas from her embrace and noticed Peyton staring at her strangely .Alone , the couple continued to stand in silence , each lost in their own thoughts .\" You should go too , \" Lucas eventually said .\"No , I 'm fine .I 'd like to stay here with you , \" Peyton stated while her hand once again found its way to his .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Look , I know you 're trying to help but it 's not working .Truthfully , its only making me feel worse , \" he declared roughly .The wounded expression his words placed on Peyton 's face only angered him further .\" Do n't you get it ?This is n't about you , Peyton .It 's not about how you got through it ... this is nothing like what you went through .And I do n't need you telling me every few minutes that it 's okay or that you understand what I 'm feeling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The one who gave advice and listened any time someone needed to talk .Since the truth about Dan came out , it was obvious that Lucas ' friends and family had done a poor job returning the favor .For them , there were other things to worry about and deal with while Lucas did n't have that luxury .His entire life had changed with his mother 's death and for him , there was nothing else to focus on .\" Maybe he went to a bar , \" Haley suggested with obvious hesitance in her voice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "\" Nodding , Haley agreed .\" That 's a good idea .\" Peyton was ashamed to admit it , but she did n't want to ask Brooke .Mostly because she did n't want to acknowledge that her best friend might know her boyfriend better than she did .The truth was that Peyton prided herself on being closer to Lucas than anyone .She felt like they had a connection he had never had with anyone else before .Like they were kindred spirits .However , the reality was n't nearly as sweet for Peyton because there were things that Brooke knew ... places , conversations and stories ... things that Peyton would never be able to touch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
