{"text": "The Dark Art Of Seduction : Femme Fatales From Noir To Horror , And Back .The history of cinema is positively strewn with ' femme fatales ' - alluring , seductive and dangerous women whose advances usually belie wounded psyches or bitter cruelty , who ensnare their lovers through sexual conquest , often leading them into compromising and deadly situations . 'Femme fatale ' is French for ' deadly woman ' .Quite often these women were portrayed as somehow wronged and whose vengeance decimates all those who have scorned them .An archetypal character of literature , cinema and even art , the femme fatale is most frequently associated with Film Noir .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Typical Film Noir stories usually revolved around some sort of criminal investigation carried out by a private detective or amateur sleuth .Characters are usually presented as flawed and alienated .Certain archetypal characters reappear throughout many film noirs - one of which is the figure of the femme fatale .Sometimes these women were also portrayed as victims of circumstance caught in situations from which she can not escape .Other actresses who portrayed notorious femme fatales in more modern takes on film noir ( often referred to as neo - noir ) include Sharon Stone ( Basic Instinct ) , Linda Fiorentino ( The Last Seduction ) and Kathleen Turner ( Body Heat ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Predatory female sexuality is rife throughout world mythologies ( the sirens of Greek myths ) , early Western literature ( Oscar Wilde 's Salome and the Marquis de Sade 's Juliette ) and art .Towards the beginning of the twentieth century , femme fatales were portrayed as vampiresses - hence the term ' vamp ' - and succubae - and her power was her allure and charm and with these she drained , figuratively speaking , the metaphorical life - force of her lovers .Indeed , one of the first cinematic representations of this vampish femme fatale was Theda Bara in A Fool There Was - way back in 1915 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These depictions of strong - willed , dangerous , untrustworthy and highly sexual women would have a huge influence on cinema and sure enough , it was during the 1940s and 50s that the femme fatale we recognise today began to flourish and become cemented - particularly in American cinema .As film noir grew in influence and popularity , so did the traits and distinctions of the archetypal femme fatale .Nowadays the femme fatale is not just a stable of the film noir , she is a figure that has also become synonymous with the erotic thriller - an off - shoot of the neo - noir sub - genre .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This saw the return of the femme fatale in films such Body Heat , Single White Female , and perhaps most importantly , Fatal Attraction .Fatal Attraction is the nightmarish tale detailing the dark implications of a one night stand gone wrong .Very wrong .Daniel Gallagher ( Michael Douglas ) is a successful , happily married New York attorney .He sleeps with his business acquaintance Alex Forrest ( Glenn Close ) while his wife and daughter are out of town .Bitterly regretting his passionate tryst with Alex , events soon become worse as Alex forms a maniacal obsession with him , placing herself , Daniel and his family in great danger .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film is also significant and highly controversial because of its depiction of the femme fatale as a mentally ill woman .It is also interesting because it sporadically evokes sympathy for both Daniel and Alex - though conservative morality wins out ultimately and Alex is eventually dispatched like some sort of salivating slasher villain .Glenn Close 's performance won her an Oscar nomination and Michael Douglas also received critical accolades for taking on such an unsympathetic role .Fatal Attraction also belongs to a group of similarly themed films that came out in the early Nineties .The ' cuckoo - in - the - nest ' films featured the plight of middle class American families whose idyllic white - picketed lives and lushly furnished homes have been shattered by the invasion of a deranged outsider - usually with severe mental health issues .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This cycle of ' psychological thriller ' titles were essentially big budget blockbuster variations of slasher movie conventions .Titles included Single White Female , Pacific Heights , The Hand that Rocks the Cradle and Unlawful Entry , and most of them featured variations on the femme fatale .One of the big erotic thrillers of the Nineties was of course Basic Instinct .When a former rock star is brutally stabbed to death with an ice pick , during sex nonetheless , Detective Nick Curran ( Michael Douglas again ) is sent to investigate .The main suspect is writer Catherine Tramell ( Sharon Stone ) , a devastatingly beautiful and somewhat mysterious young woman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Notorious for the scene in which Stone 's character is interrogated by a roomful of burly male cops , only to silence them and gain the upper hand by simply crossing her mini - skirted legs revealing her lack of underwear underneath .While certainly not as box office friendly as Fatal Attraction or Basic Instinct , another erotic thriller from the early Nineties is camp cult favourite Poison Ivy .Starring Drew Barrymore and Sara Gilbert , Poison Ivy features Barrymore in provocative vamp mode and attempting to move in on Gilbert 's father and become the new matriarch of her friend 's family .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Whilst the sequels all headed straight to DVD they were still a massive hit amongst fans that were still obviously salivating for more .The series ' knowing campness and highly charged scenes of sexual prowess combined with overwrought revenge schemes and sociopathic anti - heroines appears to be a winning formula .The last instalment , Poison Ivy : The Last Seduction featured the exploits of Violet - sister of the original ' Poison Ivy ' from the first film .She has her sights sight on destroying the family of her childhood friend Joy , whose father Violet holds responsible for tearing her own family apart .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The success of the series is undoubtedly due to its unabashed willingness to be as daring and trashy as it can be and still have fun .According to film editor John Rosenberg , who worked on the third instalment of the series , as well as on titles such as The Convent and Body Count : \" They reinforce the risk and potential bad consequences for men who get involved with seductresses . \"( See below for full interview ) .The femme fatale has also found her way into contemporary pop culture in the guise of the various heroines and anti - heroines of comics , films , books and video games .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She gets what she wants by turning on the charm and lurking in the shadows , ready to pounce .She is ruthless and cunning and will stop at nothing to get her own way .Most recently Cody Diablo penned Jennifer 's Body - another ' seduction horror ' flick that wears its erotic influences on its bloodied sleeve and generated the next incarnation of the femme fatale as demonically possessed school girl .Proving to be one of cinema 's most compelling archetypes , she has what it takes to slink along with the times , making herself irresistible to generation after generation ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I caught up him to ask him about the ongoing fascination cinema audiences have with the mysterious and alluring figure of the femme fatale .Can you tell me about your involvement and role as editor on Poison Ivy 3 ?Rosenberg : I 'd worked with the director , Kurt Voss , on a previous film , Horseplayer , which became a popular selection at the Sundance Film Festival .Kurt and I got along great - I really liked his edgy , offbeat style and he appreciated my editing , so he gave me free rein in cutting Poison Ivy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't think either of us imagined it would become this cult film that people would still be watching years later .In terms of the editing , the film revolved , for me , around the pool scene where Jaime Pressly strips naked and goes for an early morning swim while her childhood friend 's father watches from the upstairs window .It was a perfectly erotic femme fatale moment because you knew she knew the father was watching and he had no idea that this is the beginning of his end .I decided to cut the scene more as a montage joined to music than a strict narrative sequence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I found an 18th century aria , a quite ethereal piece , to place against the scene .It evoked a sense that the father , for a brief moment between his coffee and heart medicine and scurrying off to work , was experiencing his version of heaven .At one point he 's distracted by the maid and Violet leaves the pool unnoticed .When the father looks back expecting to see Violet , she 's gone .Except there was no shot of the empty pool .So I combed through a bunch of takes and found one where the camera was lining up for the shot of the pool with Jaime Pressly , but she had n't found her mark yet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I grabbed the shot and stuck it on the end of the scene , before the final shot of the father 's disappointed face .When I showed the scene to the director and producers they loved it .I do n't think we ever changed a frame of it , which is rare .The composer , however , went a different direction with the music .A fourth instalment of the series was recently released .Why do you think the series is still on going ?What do you think the appeal is to fans ?Rosenberg : Frankly , I was surprised to see it resurrected after so many years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But I guess there 's always a new crop of teenage boys who 'd like to see a film like this .I think Jaime Pressly was terrific in Poison Ivy 3 .When I teach at UCLA or The Art Institute many of the college guys tell me it was one of their favourite films growing up .Why do you think the figure of the ' femme fatale ' is still so captivating and compelling for audiences ?Rosenberg : Because there is some truth in it .And it incorporates two elements that moviegoers seem to like - sex and violence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They reinforce the risk and potential bad consequences for men who get involved with seductresses .And visa versa for the women who play that role .Rosenberg : Other than Poison Ivy 3 , my favourites include Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice , Barbara Stanwyk in Double Indemnity , Kathleen Turner in Body Heat , and Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct .One of my top votes for femme fatale however , is Kim Basinger in L.A. Confidential - a wonderful performance played , for the most part , contrary to the genre 's stereotype .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Rosenberg : I 'm writing a book about modern film editing which will be published later this year by Focal Press ( Poison Ivy 3 will surely be mentioned in it ! ) and editing a feature documentary for a company out of New York .The doc is full of fascinating and quirky characters , which I like .And the city plays a significant role as well .A bit of a departure from the thriller genre !Behind the Couch is a term used as a humorous metaphor to describe the actions that a state of fear may drive someone to : for example , a young child hiding ' behind the couch ' when watching a scary film or TV show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
