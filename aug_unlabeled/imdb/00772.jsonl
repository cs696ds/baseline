{"text": "when your talking about the splinter puppet i decide to look it up and i found this website that has pictures of the pre mutant splinter in the first teenage mutant ninja turtles movie . and by the way , i was in Wal Mart and i saw a bundle that had the original 3 movies and the 2007 CGI one as well , and the third one for some reason was call Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III : Turtles in Time . that was the 1st time i ever saw that .I never watched any of the movies ( because I never understood why the movies had to be played by people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "o.o ) I watched the Cartoon series and oh we had some of those action figures too .I 'm in total agreement with you having been about the same age at the time .Sadly the movies were based on the original comic and not the cartoon series .There was no Krang , Beebop , or Rocksteady .All 3 characters were made specifically for the cartoon .When the idea of the movie came around I guess the creators wanted it based on their original concepts(which by the way were extremely violent with turtles lopping off heads and killing people ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Haha this review is hysterical , but I ca nt lie , as bad as the movie was , I still have a soft spot for it .Like everybody else , the Turtles were a big time part of my life growing up , I could nt get enough of them .From toys to Halloween costumes to the movies , if it was the Turtles I was down .Except that is for the shitty live action show they had out .Now that was pure garbage .What were they thinking ? ? ? ?You know , they 've actually added the subtitle to this movie as \" Turtles in Time \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So much for consistency .But at least they recognize the title as relating to the game somehow , but perhaps that was more of a marketing ploy to promote the Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network remake of it .This is one of my favorite reviews .I 'm 15 and I loved the reboot TV series of TMNT they used to show on Saturday mornings as a kid .Too bad I was n't around during all this Turtle craze I actually found out that in the 25th Anniversary Blu - Ray Box Set , that contained the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie , then Secret of the Ooze , and then this horrible abomination .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The one thing that still drives me crazy about the 1stNinja Turtles movie is how they abbreviate their names .Leo , Mikey , & Donnie are bad enough , but \" Raph \" is the equivalant of nails on a chalkboard to me .In the cartoon , Michaelangelo was intelligent , but the voice actor made him sound like an air - head California surfer .In the movie , I found I could relate to him much more because he spoke with a voice that was n't unusal .Yeah , um ...I fully agree that TMNT 3 sucked .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
