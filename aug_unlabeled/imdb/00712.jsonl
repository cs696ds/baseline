{"text": "Pages .KWEENY 'S FAVORITE HORRIFIC MUSIC VIDEOS !Horror just is n't the same without good music backing it up .Be it a strong soundtrack or a cool band playing in the background , music and horror go hand in hand .I 'm a pretty big music fan myself , and I really enjoy a well done music video .Now , a music video with horror influences that tells a story REALLY gets my blood pumping , even if I normally would n't listen to the band or I outright LOATHE the band .But sometimes , I can ignore a terrible song if the video they present it with is REALLY FRIGGEN ENTERTAINING .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This sparked an idea for a post where I collect some of my favorite music videos with horror themes .Even if the music is n't particularly my favorite , I have to give a hat tip to these awesome videos for at LEAST trying .Especially if the video tries to tell a story , which is a hard thing to do in the medium of music videos .Sometimes they get it right on the nose , and sometimes even the music works with the visuals .Fail or not , these are my favorites , and I wanted to share / subject you to them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A Boy band ?Are you cooking meth again and sniffing the fumes ?But honestly , the video is good .You could turn the sound off and STILL be entertained watching this silly , tongue - and - cheek tribute to old horror icons .The makeup is really well done , and they clearly had an affection for the old classic monsters .When I was 13 or so and saw this , I was amazed that a BOY BAND was doing such a fun tribute to things I loved .At least you can say the Backstreet Boys have good taste in movies , if this is a true indication of their tastes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It does a fine portrayal of a combination of zombie films , black and white horror , and the Frankenstein 's monster story .The style is what is the most striking , and it has more of a cohesive story than some of his other videos .I think it 's a fine tribute to classic monster movies .Again , I turn to the horror shock rockers , but this time it 's my old pal Alice Cooper bringing the darkness in horror videos .His older songs have more of a horror feel , but the videos were pretty terrible and not really horrific enough for this countdown .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This video off of his newer album not only has a song I can rock out to , but the video is AWESOME .Who does n't love a crazy asylum video , with ALICE COOPER in it !Disturbed is n't for everyone , especially harder heavy metal fans , but I find their songs great for things like working out .When I need to pump some energy up , I put their stuff on and it helps .This song though , OH FUCK YES I LOVE IT .I love it not only because it sings to my wilder side , but it has friggen WOLVES and WEREWOLF imagery in it !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With a mad scientist at the beginning drinking potions , putting him in a straight jacket and locking him up , a horse drawn carriage with his lifeless corpse inside , to him turning into a wolf itself !OZZY KNOWS WHAT I LIKE !I remember when I first saw this video and how excited it got me .Not really a fan of most of their work , but this song and video won my heart .The whole thing is shot like a re - imagining of The Shining , and fans of the movie ( like myself ) will love it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Plus , I actually enjoyed the song to the video , which is a nice treat when both meld together well .Yup , it 's an old school pop video from the early 80 's !This one is really well done , and feels like a serial killer is stalking someone throughout the video by the way it 's shot .We get ghostly apparitions dancing , half naked dudes in grave yards , you name it .It 's actually a little creepy at times , and makes me think of Jason or Mike Myers stalking someone they will kill .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This one is probably my favorite on the list , not just because the story is haunting and actually chilling , but the song that accompanies it is ghostly as well .It gets stuck in my head when I am having a dark mood , and that 's because the video / song combo is just prefect .It has a voodoo / obscure cult feel , and really watch what 's happening when you view this one .You just know the kids on the boat are being led to their doom by the dark feel of this video .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You knew this one was going to be here .I do n't know a horror fan who has n't seen this video .It was so wicked when it first came out , with a great song to accompany the fun video .It had a plot that was easy to follow , just like the other videos here , but what it had that the others did n't was the wonderful VINCENT PRICE narrating in the middle !You want cred in your music video with horror fans , put VINCENT PRICE in it !So that 's my list .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
