{"text": "In 1972 , Elvis Presley was still riding high from the commercial and critical rebirth that started with the ' 68 Comeback Special and continued with his return to live performances the following year .His previous documentary , Elvis : That 's The Way It Is was a success , showing the King at the height of his physical and vocal ability .Hoping to recapture some of that magic , directors Robert Abel and Pierre Adidge followed Presley on his 15 cities in 15 nights 1972 tour , the results of which became Presley 's 33rd and final film , Elvis On Tour .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not just a concert performance , Elvis On Tour gives a behind - the - scenes look at Presley 's tour with plenty of backstage moments .We see Presley just before he hits the stage , candid moments with the Memphis Mafia in his limousine , studio footage and footage of Presley and his band singing gospel songs on their off hours .A true highlight comes when Presley leads them through a rendition of \" I , John . \"Gospel music moved Presley and it shows in these scenes .There are also a number of complete live performances , filmed in Hampton , VA ; Greensboro , NC ; and San Antonio , TX including the first - ever performance of Presley 's last U.S. top-10 hit , \" Burning Love . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Elvis On Tour also features a career - retrospective montage supervised by Martin Scorsese and the middle of \" Love Me Tender \" is intercut with love scenes from Presley 's movies .Keen fans may notice the intro to the movie is different and that 's because Chuck Berry 's classic , \" Johnny B. Goode \" has been replaced by ' Do n't be Cruel . \" Seems Presley 's people could not get a hold of Berry 's people and they were unable to get the licensing for the song .As \" Do n't be Cruel \" is shorter , one section of the lyrics had to be repeated , making for a clumsy intro .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The DVD is also included as part of the Elvis 75th Anniversary DVD Collection , while the Blu - ray is in the Blu - ray book format , featuring 40 pages of photos , quotes , biography , and set lists for the shows filmed .While both discs feature remastered video and audio ( The standard DVD has Dolby Digital 5.1 while the Blu - ray has DTS - HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround ) the content is identical .The picture and the sound quality are fantastic , especially on the Blu - ray , but there are no extras included on either version .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There would have been plenty of room on either disc ( the Blu - ray especially ) to include commentary , cut scenes , behind the scenes footage or even the new 20 minutes of footage shot for the recent theatrical rerelease .Instead , all fans were treated to was a bare bones version of the film .The film itself is great - something any Presley fan would do well to have in his or her collection - but for such a big release , the presentation disappoints .Note ElvisNews : .We underline most of the review .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Most disappointing was the fluctuation in sound .Especially close to the endings of showstoppers ( Bridge , Proud Mary ) it sounds like the sound is squeezed , as if a limiter is involved .Reactions .Hello Santa .Yes , you are right !I have seen this black thin lines through Elvis 's face during \" Separate Ways \" and a number of other scenes too .I only have the Blu - Ray .But you are right .Bad recording , \u00e4h , bad quality .The on stage scenes are in good quality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To be honest it was great getting this finally released , well almost released , as you ca n't buy it in UK shops yet !The high was getting it in Blue - ray disc , which is very nicely packaged with a stunning cover to stand out in the shops - When it gets to the shops .The content - We all know and love \" Elvis On Tour \" so nothing i can say to add how great this release is .The sound is very good and the picture is an improvement on anything \" EOT \" released before .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is Not !All could have been better .The opening credits was ok , but lost the feel of the original .Not a second of additional performances !We could have at least had the lost performances tagged on as bonus .A small making of as a bonus would have been nice and it would n't have hurt to have put at least an hour of unused footage on as a bonus !I 'm pleased to have this at last .But ca n't help thinking what could have been ............. .and it 's not ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "it simply is NOT bad .no way but to each his own period .I 'll stand by what I said before the website went down .I am glad this was released , but it is a shoddy release to say the release , from the opening of Do nt Be Cruel , to the black line , to no extras , not even a trailer .Even $ 5.00 DVDs contain a trailer !As for the quality , I think its better than VHS but not by much .To think otherwise is talking yourself into believeing it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was released to appease the fans and that s it .Anyone else have this black line through Elvis 's face during \" Separate Ways \" and a number of other scenes ?I have the Blu - Ray but also realized it on DVD .This is very disturbing for me .I never saw this black thin line before and I wonder why nobody mentioned this error .Another minus .along many others ... in my opinion .well i most definately see improvement of EOT and just for the record ? my eyes are perfect there are so many fans who are amazed by the sound and picture of EOT i can not even count the comments on that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I must say that I am really disapointed .The sound is fine , but I could not see any improvements in the picture .The much discussed openeing sequence is not my cup of tea .The cuts in Do n't Be Cruel are amateurish and do not fit the picture very well .Ok , I must admit that I am used to JBG for 25 years when I saw the movie for the first time .To me it 's a cheap transfer from the VHS version with no additional benefit .I 'll stick to my previous DVD edition .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
