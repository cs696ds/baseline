{"text": "The Stax Report : Script Review of Troy Stax looks at the script for the upcoming historical epic starring Brad Pitt and Eric Bana , to be directed by Wolfgang Petersen !November 14 , 2002 - Stax here with my reaction to the screenplay for Troy !This 157-page draft by David Benioff ( Stay , The 25th Hour ) is loosely based on Homer 's The Iliad .Brad Pitt , Eric Bana and Orlando Bloom will star for director Wolfgang Petersen .Recent reports suggest that Claire Forlani ( Meet Joe Black ) , Emilio Estevez ( Mission : Impossible ) , and Oscar - nominee Michael Clarke Duncan ( Daredevil ) are also in negotiations to join the Village Roadshow / Warner Brothers project .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Troy is only loosely based on The Iliad , Homer 's classic tale of the Trojan War .Deleted from this account is much of the Greek mythology that peppers Homer 's story .The gods , although often mentioned , are not characters here at all ; gone , too , are such famous episodes as \" the judgment of Paris . \"Instead , Troy offers a realistic depiction of a historical event - the Trojan War - long thought to have been a mere myth until Heinrich Schliemann proved otherwise .While staying as the guest of Spartan king Menelaus , Trojan prince Paris ( Bloom ) enjoys an affair with the king 's wife , Helen ( Forlani ? )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Paris subsequently \" abducts \" Helen when he and his elder brother Hector ( Bana ) sail for Troy .Paris refuses to return Helen even after Hector protests because he knows what Menelaus will do to her .This love affair between Paris and Helen ignites the Trojan War .Menelaus ' brother is Agamemnon , king of the Myceneans , whose thirst for conquest knows no bounds .While Menelaus wants to wage war on the Trojans over wounded pride , Agamemnon sees the fall of Troy as the latest and most prized addition to his collection of conquered civilizations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Greek warrior kings who join the campaign against Troy include the legendary Odysseus of Ithaca , Ajax of Salamis ( Duncan ? ) , Diomedes of Argos , and the greatest fighter of them all , Achilles ( Pitt ) of the Myrmidons .Achilles ' prowess on the battlefield has made him famous even amongst his fellow Greeks .Although he has no true loyalty to Agamemnon , the laconic yet deadly Achilles agrees to fight the king 's new war simply for the glory of it .Accompanying Achilles on this campaign is his adoring , beloved teenage cousin , Patroclus .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Greeks believe if they can kill Hector then the Trojans ' spirit will be broken and they 'll soon buckle .The Greeks try to convince Achilles to challenge Hector to a duel but Agamemnon has offended Achilles ' honor and now he intends on departing the war .It is only after Hector ( unwittingly ) personalizes the war for Achilles that the Greek warrior ruthlessly confronts the Trojan prince with tragic results for all involved .Troy was a sweeping yet intimate epic chock full of spectacle , romance , tragedy and action .I was surprised at how poignant it turned out to be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For such a mammoth tale , there 's surprisingly little exposition and the characters are sketched out in simple yet insightful detail .I was particularly taken with the relationship between Hector and Paris .Hector 's \" Achilles ' heel \" , if you will , is his honor and loyalty ; Paris ' is his infatuation with Helen .Paris matures during the course of this story as he realizes the far - reaching implications of his impetuous decision .He must also come to terms with his own cowardice .The theme of brotherhood also extends to Achilles ' relationship with Patroclus , as well as to sibling bad guys Menelaus and Agamemnon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was surprised at how dark and unsympathetic Achilles was ; I think this is the first time since Twelve Monkeys that Brad Pitt has played the closest thing to a villain .Achilles is this story 's Darth Maul or Boba Fett , the cool , kick - ass antagonist who was , in his own words , \" born to take lives .\" Some readers have complained to me that they think Pitt is too slight to play the mighty Achilles .I must admit that the thought has also crossed my mind but Pitt has the intensity necessary for the role , and Fight Club proved he can handle his own in a brawl .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I appreciated the ambiguity and restraint with which Helen was portrayed here .Scholars still debate whether Helen was a femme fatale who caused a needless war or if she was a victim .This draft 's Helen falls somewhere in between .She understands the carnage that her affair has caused and this guilt plagues her .Still , she truly loves Paris even after he shows all of Troy how flawed and unworthy a man he is .Helen also has great respect for Hector , not just because he 's more of a man than Paris is but because he fights ( without complaint ) a war that she helped spark .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While parallels between the Trojan War and Vietnam are nothing new ( after all , Oliver Stone 's Platoon was heavily influenced by The Iliad ) , Troy illustrates how vile and pointless war can be when its goals and motives are so questionable .Although , like Petersen 's The Perfect Storm , Troy is ultimately a downer , it still manages to end on a note of hope .This is all the more impressive when one recalls the tragic inevitability with which the story progresses .Expect Troy to be a major awards contender when it opens in 2004 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
