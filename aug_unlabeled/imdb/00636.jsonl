{"text": "He learns that she died the night she gave him that watch ; and that she was interested in time travel , and owned a book about it by one of his professors .A visit to the professor reveals an incredible story of a trip to the past -- momentary , uncertain , but an experience that may have been time travel .The film suggests a type of time travel which would be entirely by force of will , that is , the traveler would will himself into the past by convincing himself that this is where he was .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Obviously , Richard Collier goes back in time , and this causes a change in history .He eventually comes forward in time , and we find that whatever he changed has resolved into that which was known to have happened anyway .This seems perfectly reasonable .But when he goes back in time , he takes with him several objects , and one of these he does not bring back .Watch the watch .It is critical to the analysis .It would appear that we have an uncaused cause in this film , a story in which everything happens because it happens .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Richard Collier finds McKenna because she finds him ; she finds him because he found her .Everything depends on everything else ; nothing can be said to have happened first and so caused all else .This type of anomaly is rather commonly used to show the absurdity of time travel ; that is not its intent here .But it can be resolved by creating an original history , that which started everything but was since erased .In the original history , there must have been another young man .He was tall , with dark hair , and a name similar to Richard Collier .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We can not fully guess what he promised , but he gave her his pocket watch , left from the hotel and never returned -- and she waited a lifetime for him .Then , when she was near death , she heard of a young man producing a play just up the road whose name was Richard Collier .Could it be him ?She went to see him , and he was tall , dark - haired -- it could well be him .It must be him , she thought .She gave him the watch , and made her cryptic comment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "No one can say .Perhaps he lied to her , and thought the watch a small price to pay for her affections .Perhaps he left to seek his fortune , and became entangled in some activity that landed him in jail ; thereafter he was too ashamed to return .Perhaps he met with an accident .Whatever it was , McKenna never left the area around the hotel , hoping that he would return .The watch is given to Collier , who does not understand it .But when he sees the image of the young McKenna , he falls in love , and determines to make the trip back in time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "History is confirmed , and we have an N - jump termination .There is in the film a very important photograph .It was taken backstage in the small theatre near the hotel , and is the photo of McKenna with which Collier falls in love .She has a glow on her face and a light in her eyes , a look of love about her that is irresistible .We discover that at the moment that photo was taken , she was in fact gazing at him , as he stood near the photographer back stage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I regret to say that the original version of the picture had her gazing at the man he was to replace .He was not there .However , once he has made the trip , the picture is of her gazing at him -- and it probably is very much the same picture , as he and the man he replaced are very similar .There is some difficulty about the register books .These in some ways play a critical role in the story .When Collier is attempting to travel back to the past , he goes into the attic and finds his own signature in one of the old register books , along with the date , time , and room number .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The lesser issue this raises is the matter of whether the name could have been there .The answer is that in the original timeline it could not have been there .When McKenna hands Collier the watch she was given by the stranger , Collier 's name is not yet in the book .However , he is going back in time , and he will write his name in that book , and someone will give him a room key and enter the time , date , and room number then .He had already picked his target date before he saw the register entry ( the day before ) and did not change it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It changes only his knowledge .On that first trip , he does not know his room number until they assign it , nor the time of day nor the date on which he was to register .Time will repeat with these changes , minor though they are , once .It changes our simple N - jump to a three - segment sawtooth snap with an N - jump termination .The more difficult issue is whether not finding his name in the register could result in his failure to make the trip at all .Our perception from the film is that finding his name in the book gave him the encouragement needed to keep trying , and so eventually to succeed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We overreact .Collier has already determined to try , and he has already determined how to try .He has begun , and he is still working on the bugs .He wanted a bit of encouragement from the logs ; but had he not gotten it , what would he have concluded ?Having made the decision to make the trip , he might still have made it without that discovery .Besides , had he not made the trip , this would not be a time travel story .Everything presupposes that he was able to travel back in time at the proper moment the first time the opportunity arose .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately , the pocket watch which passes from McKenna to Collier and back to McKenna is fatal to the story .It throws us from a simple N - jump to a sawtooth snap with an infinity loop ending .Let us suppose that the watch was fairly new -- five years old -- at the time our unknown stranger gave it to McKenna .It must then be with her for sixty years before she gives it to Collier .He then owns it for a decade , and takes it back in time to give to her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "When the watch deteriorates , it breaks the chain -- McKenna has nothing to give Collier , and nothing to prove he was ever there .Collier loses part of his motivation for going to her .It is more likely that without the watch , Collier will not travel back to McKenna , and so McKenna will instead meet stranger , get the watch from him , and restart the entire sequence .Either way we have a sawtooth snap .If they still find each other without the watch , it is an N - jump termination ; but if the watch is as important to the story as it seems , they are thrown into an infinity loop .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He , like everyone else , ceases to exist at that moment .But if we suppose that somehow an N - jump termination is achieved , he is back in his room .The nagging question is , why ca n't he go back again ?You would think that having done it before , he would find it so much easier to do again , for he now knew it to be possible from his own experience , and he knew what he had to do to get there .He could dispose of the penny and return to McKenna , waiting at the hotel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He found his name in the register , and so proved to himself that he could do it before he did it .But if that is so , then there is no causality -- that is , particularly in this case , we see that what we do is not relevant to what happens .Richard Collier put his will into carrying him back in time , and he made it .Then , knowing with certainty both that it could be done and how to do it , he tried again and failed .How hard he tried seems to have had nothing to do with it -- he was certainly the more determined the second time , for he had tasted the joy he desired .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Why try ?Everything is fated , and the amount you try has nothing to do with the outcome .I offer no explanation for why Collier could not make that second trip .My only guess is that he was too tired to do it and too desperate to rest .The fans of the film are not going to be happy with me .I have said that their movie is possible , that it could have happened much as we see it ( notwithstanding the rather fantastic means of time travel ) ; yet I have taken from them the one part that matters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have suggested that they came together in a case of mistaken identity -- that McKenna loved someone like Collier , and took the one for the other , leading to the replacement .It is very like offering them the wrapper in which the candy came .I think some have not thought well about this story .Even if taken as suggested , McKenna has a few days of fearful anticipation , one night of love , and a lifetime of loneliness .Collier has it better and worse ; he dies of disappointment when he realizes he 's lost her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
