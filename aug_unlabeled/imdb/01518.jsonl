{"text": "Ark Park to break ground this month .Grant County News said today , with some exaggeration , \" Ark construction begins . \" In fact , Ark Encounter had a \" Hammer and Peg \" ceremony last week ; actual groundbreaking will begin later this month .I watched the ceremony for 40 excruciating minutes in real time .You can see it here on YouTube .I thought it would have been a very nice ceremony , but for the fact that they were talking nonsense .Indeed , the video begins with a picture of Noah or one of his sidekicks driving wooden pegs into the Ark.

{"text": "The board and pegs in the picture are entirely ceremonial .They were fabricated from some trees on the property ; I forget exactly what he said .I think , though , that if you go to the YouTube link , within the first minute or two , you will see some animations of Noah ( or someone ) using similar tools and pegs , and admiring his Ark through a window .I wondered , in addition , how they would get such an enormous structure from the construction site into the water .I saw no sign , for example , of a drydock .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
