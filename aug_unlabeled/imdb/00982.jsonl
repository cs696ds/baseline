{"text": "However , Eon itself opened the door with SPECTRE .The 24th James Bond film includes a torture scene based on the one in 1968 's Colonel Sun novel .So much so , there 's a \" special thanks \" credit for \" The Estate of Kingsley Amis \" in the end credits .Generally speaking , it 's easier to use a novel as a starting point .The movie You Only Live Twice did n't have much in common with its namesake novel , but characters , names , situations , etc .did figure into the movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At this point , there are plenty of continuation novels to choose from .Worry about the script first , actor second : Various \" making of \" documentaries about 007 films discuss how scripts are tailored to their lead actor .How about this ?Write a James Bond story first , tweak it later after your actor has been cast .James Bond is the star .The series has seen six different actors play Bond .Some day , there will be a seventh .Albert R. Broccoli , co - founder of Eon , always felt 007 was the star , the rest came later .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Or , put another way : story , story , story .If you have a good story but it conflicts with continuity , go with the story : Let 's be honest .Continuity is n't a strong point for the Bond film series .Michael G. Wilson said Quantum of Solace took place \" literally an hour \" after Casino Royale .Yet , Quantum could n't be bothered with the slightest effort to tie together with Casino .Casino took place in 2006 .Quantum in 2008 .Only if Bond and Mr. White are idiots .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you have a great Bond story but it does n't match up with earlier films ?Go with the story .If fans exit the theater thinking , \" That was one of the best Bond movies I 've ever seen , \" nobody will really care about the continuity .Have a great Bond 25 idea that does n't immediately tie in with SPECTRE ?Go with the great idea .You can always bring Blofeld back later , even if he 's not played by Christoph Waltz .But what about the \" Blofeld Trilogy \" ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That ship has sailed .It was a lost opportunity .Meanwhile , you might find the part of the You Only Live Twice novel that Albert R. Broccoli , Harry Saltzman and their cohorts did n't use might make for difficult filming .Do n't twist yourself into a pretzel trying to recapture the past .Put yet another way : How many people leaving the theater after seeing SPECTRE really thought Daniel Craig 's Bond loved Lea Seydoux 's Madeleine as much as George Lazenby 's Bond loved Diana Rigg 's Tracy in On Her Majesty 's Secret Service ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The new James Bond film SPECTRE has given the fans many nods to On Her Majesty 's Secret Service throughout the promotions , either by the bars of John Barry 's instrumental theme on the trailer and by the snow scenes .Some people even suggested that the 2015 film could be a remake of the 1969 Bond adventure .It also showed , for the first time , a more emotional Bond .\" This one is different .This one has heart \" , the trailer narration claimed .Just like in Dr. No , From Russia with Love , Thunderball and You Only Live Twice , the enemy is once again SPECTRE and its leader , Ernst Stavro Blofeld .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Previously played by Anthony Dawson and Donald Pleasance , Blofeld is now portrayed by the charismatic Telly Savalas , who would be later known as TV 's popular detective Kojak .SPECTRE 's Number One , this time , is calling himself Balthazar , Count de Beauchamp .His intentions seem quite less lethal in comparison to his previous demands : to get his title validated by the College of Arms and amnesty for his crimes .Blofeld turned himself from a criminal mastermind to a snobbist blue - blooded aristocrat .Yet , nobody should be fooled by his image : if his demands are not met , he 'll unleash the virus omega providing total infertility to the world 's livestock .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By hypnotizing the ( young , female ) patients of his clinic atop Piz Gloria in Switzerland and , once on their homes via radio transmission , order them to unleash the virus , as \" part of the cure .\" Blofeld is certainly not less lethal this time , as he can fistfight 007 himself towards the film 's climax and engage on a shootout with him .He also has a taste for beautiful women , as he tries to seduce the imprisoned Tracy , Bond 's girlfriend and future wife .In a way , he is more of an equal to Bond and not an authority figure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In OHMSS , Number One has turned into Bond 's counterpart .As for the SPECTRE organization per se , not much of it remains .Blofeld still has a bunch of troops capable of firing machine guns while skiing at high speed as well as a female agent Irma Bunt .This time , tough , she 's not a young sexy lady in the scale of Fiona or Helga , but an old and authoritarian woman in the style of Rosa Klebb .Even when in the novels we learn Bunt has married Blofeld , not even a glance of a romantic interaction between the two is given in the 1969 film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His character will always be remembered for one thing : he had James Bond 's wife , Tracy ( Diana Rigg ) , killed minutes after the wedding , leaving the secret agent for the tears .Next up , in 1971 , James Bond takes revenge on Ernst Stavro Blofeld : a different Blofeld , in terms of personality , looks and ambitions .As part of a redesign that will be unveiled next March , the print edition of Playboy will still feature women in provocative poses .But they will no longer be fully nude .Its executives admit that Playboy has been overtaken by the changes it pioneered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" You 're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free .And so it 's just pass\u00e9 at this juncture .\" This is obviously a big change for Playboy .Its first issue included photos of a nude Marilyn Monroe .The magazine 's circulation has plunged to 800,000 from 5.6 million in 1975 , according to the Times .We mention it here because Playboy and 007 have a long history .The magazine serialized some of Ian Fleming 's original Bond short stories and novels in the 1960s .In the 1990s , the magazine also presented short stories by then-007 continuation author Raymond Benson .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In that story , Bond event chats with Playboy founder Hugh Hefner .Bond and Playboy came together in 1969 's On Her Majesty 's Secret Service .Bond ( George Lazenby ) casually reads a copy of Playboy while a safe - cracking machine ( one of the few gadgets in the film ) is at work .After Bond has copied the documents he needs , he takes the magazine 's centerfold with him .Also , in 1971 's Diamonds Are Forever , it 's disclosed that Bond ( Sean Connery this time ) has a membership to a Playboy Club .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To read the entire Times story , which has a lot of detail about the Playboy revamp , CLICK HERE .On Her Majesty 's Secret Service has a special place in the James Bond film series .It 's the film closest to its source material , Ian Fleming 's 1963 novel of the same name .It 's also a movie whose reputation has improved over the years .Yet , fans keep pining for things that can not be .If only the movies had been made in order of the novels , instead of reversing the order of Majesty 's and You Only Live Twice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Here are a few thoughts on that : .OHMSS would have been a lot different if it had been filmed in 1966 instead of You Only Live Twice .The fan argument about the filming the Fleming novels in order ( Majesty 's first , followed by Twice instead of the other way around ) assumes we 'd have gotten essentially the same movie as the one released in 1969 .As stated in Majesty 's , \" I would n't go banco on that . \"Charles Helfenstein 's The Making of On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , published in 2009 , provides a rundown of various Majesty 's treatments and script drafts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The book includes a table ( pages 38 - 39 ) summarizing the differences of 10 different treatments and drafts , from 1964 through the 1969 film 's shooting script .The main thing in common is Tracy , Bond 's doomed wife , dies in all of them .Peter Hunt , making his directing debut in Majesty 's , was one of the driving forces to keep the movie faithful to the novel .Had Majesty 's been after Thunderball , Hunt would n't be the director .We might have gotten a similar film , but it 's likely we would have gotten something with more gadgets and a different tone ( probably closer to Goldfinger ) than audiences received in 1969 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For many , the answer is \" of course . \" Lazenby had no real acting experience before the film and Connery was , well , Connery .But not everyone subscribes to this conventional wisdom .Here 's an excerpt .I have often heard film critics and fellow Bond fans acknowledge the superior script and technical work in OHMSS , but then say , \" It would be the best James Bond movie if only Sean Connery were in it .\" I reject that .( snip )But let 's pretend a younger , amenable Connery was cast in an OHMSS directed by Hunt .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For the story of OHMSS to work , particularly the ending , Bond must be vulnerable .From Goldfinger onward , Connery 's Bond was invulnerable , Superman in a tuxedo .I 'm not saying Connery did n't have the ability to play Bond as vulnerable , but after Goldfinger I doubt the audience would have accepted it .For many reasons , OHMSS required a new actor as Bond ....Lazenby 's athleticism in the fight scenes can not be matched , and his acting improves as the film progresses , reaching its fruition in the proposal scene .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( emphasis added ) .The thing is , there is no right or wrong answer to all this .Without a time machine to go back to change events , or the ability to travel to an alternative universe where things occurred differently , there 's no way to know .At the same time , real life is more complicated than what we want .So it is with On Her Majesty 's Secret Service .The only certainty is the movie remains - perhaps flawed but still one of the best entries in the Bond series .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
