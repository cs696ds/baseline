{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .Who would have thought that Bob Goldwait was capable of writing and directing such a tender movie ?Not me before watching this movie about what is takes to sustain a real relationship .The movie starts out with an extremely disturbing sexual incident that thankfully takes place off camera and then watch Amy move past this youthful mistake and end up engaged to a young man who keeps asking her to share her dirtiest little secret .Amy wants to tell him since he has bared his soul to her and she does n't want there to be any secrets between them but she 's afraid he 'll be disgusted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The final scene between Amy and her fiance and how she is treated after the truth comes out by the man she loves is heartbreaking .This movie seriously addresses the issues faced in all relationships .How much do you share with your partner ?Are certain secrets best left buried ?These and many more questions are answered in a thoughtful manner by none other then a comedian ( Bob Goldwait ) , go figure ....This movie is worth viewing for its moving message about love and relationships but be warned , it contains crude sexual discussions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .\"Sleeping Dogs Lie \" is not a bad little romantic comedy .It 's sort of in the vein of a Kevin Smith ( \" Chasing Amy \" ) or Judd Apatow ( \" Knocked Up \" ) movie : lots of gross , over - the - top humor which cleverly hides a fairly sweet story .The movie probably would have done better , however , if the cute woman 's big secret involved something that maybe one in a thousand women might try , as opposed to something one in a million might undertake .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At least for the character we get to know here .But the movie 's basically a goofy comedy , so goofy should n't be a deal breaker , right ?The movie 's bargain basement budget is somewhat apparent in the production values , though things never get close to shoddy looking .In fact , the movie is generally well shot , acted , and lit , as well as sensitively directed .There 's a nice little soundtrack , too .Definitely not bad for the twelve cents they had to spend .On DVD , \" Sleeping Dogs Lie \" features a solid picture and good sound .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "No behind - the - scenes featurettes , however .Comment 11 of 12 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Why make actions that do n't affect anyone , let alone adversely , your business ?What compels people to admit things they may be sorry they told you ?And , in a world of unspeakable injustice , why does relatively meaningless behavior trouble so many people ?Writer - director Bobcat Goldthwait 's SLEEPING DOG LIES raises those questions but leaves it up to the viewer to answer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you have yet to learn about the premise of SLEEPING DOGS LIE , I hope you 'll avoid other reviews until after you watch this gem of a movie the public missed .The need to communicate , by definition , means taking the risk of being truthful to the point of revealing what others do n't need to know .Maybe the only thing trickier is listening to understand , but not to judge .See SLEEPING DOGS LIE . 1 Comment 6 of 6 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
