{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .As in Hard Target(/93)and his more recent Until Death(2007),Van Damme once again bases his character in or from New Orleans in The Shepherd - Border Patrol(released March 2008 ) .This taut action film shows us an area of topic of which Hollywood usually does n't often touch on;the people who patrol and maintain border security along the US - Mexican line .Read more ' .1 of 1 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .In \" The Shepherd \" ( 2008 ) , Van Damme plays a Texas border cop battling former member from an elite U.S. military force who now turned their past expertise into running a proficient drug smuggling trade from Mexico into the US .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Van Damme 's trademark fight scenes highlights an upcoming martial artiste , Scott Adkins whose zeal nearly turns the staged studio fights into a legitimate match between the two with a visual delight jammed with innovative techniques and true - to - life kicks .Reality slips into the fights forcing and inspired and newly invigorated Van Damme to truly draw on his own genuine fighting history to legitimately weather his younger rival .By way of irony , Adkins in real life while growing up was inspired by Van Damme .I must say , I was really looking forward to this movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My expectations were high ( even for a ridiculous b - movie like this ) after what Issac Florentine and J.J. Perry did with Undisputed II .The movie was n't spectacular and it did n't quite reach my highest hopes , but I was n't disappointed .Van Damme played his usual laconic self - this time with a bunny .Scott Adkins ' character was n't very interesting either ( and the main villain was a bit annoying ) , but you ca n't have it all with these kinds of movies .With the exception of the final showdown , the fight scenes were very well shot and choreographed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Scott Adkins was excellent as usual ( although his skills are best displayed in the director 's other films ) , but it does n't seem that the writers gave much attention to Adkins ' character , or the plot .My chief complaint is about the poor editing and screen effects used in the last fight scene between Damme and Adkins .It would have been an excellent fight if the editors had just left the fight alone and not tried to enhance it .And so the last fight was disappointing because of the editing .On a five point scale , I 'd give it a 3.5 , but amazon does n't give you half points to work with , so I decided to give it a 4 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's certainly Van Damme 's best martial art movie of his direct - to - dvd career , at least until this point .The Shepherd : Border Patrol is a very good film !Van Damme 's best and most action packed since Wake of Death .Seriously , all the good ingredients are in there , guys .There 's plenty of hand to hand fighting in The Shepherd , even the gratuitous bar fight .There 's a likable chemistry between the lead and supporting cast , and the villains are well picked .There 's also a lot of good soundtrack work done in a style familiar to spaghetti westerns .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This , however , is n't too bad .It 's more polished and the dialogue more believable .But like so many others of this genre , it relies too much on formula .It 's very predictable and making Bulgaria look like New Mexico was a bit of a stretch .In the end , though , it was entertaining .I like Van Damme and I hope he does more , but it would be good to see some surprises for a change .I 'm quite torn , after all , this movie , directed by Isaac Florentine , has some silly dialogue and obvious set - ups .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "An action flick with a martial arts twist movie such as this is really quite average and should be 3 stars ; however , Van Damme delivers a more than adequate job and he is back kickin ' and punchin ' !That is the primary reason for the four stars , he is kicking again and unlike \" The Hard Corp \" or \" The Order \" where he was kickin ' too , this is more stylish and rugged .Vam Damme , while no Oliver , has developed into a moderately decent actor .Time cop was probably the first movie to showcase this , but he was inconsistent in bringing out a fine acting performance ( For example , Sudden Death - good , The Quest - bad ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
