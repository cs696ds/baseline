{"text": "Of all the Tarang Houseful Telefilms this one has to be my favoritest one so far .Aesthetically sound , well - directed , a tightly knit narrative , the story a lovely blend of romance , humor and melodrama , fabulous acting by all , and well produced to boot , this one ensured that I was thoroughly entertained throughout .Loved it !First of , like all good masala films this one too had a very predictable beginning , middle and end , so no surprises , nothing out of the box there .What gave it the extra edge though was the tarka of what is now fast becoming recognizable as the Vasay Chaudhry brand of dry humor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While that was an out and out comedy , and an enjoyable one at that , Armaan now leads the list of my favorites because of the way humor was blended in with romance , giving an age old love story a fresh contemporary appeal .As far as the mass - appeal of the movie goes , we need to look no further than Fawad Khan .He was the reason why this was the most anticipated movie in this series of remakes , and to his credit Fawad did carry the movie across the finish line .To begin with , he looked fantastic and acted superbly , a much appreciated departure from his now overdone HUM TV shohar avatar , as he took to this very fun character with great relish .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Full marks to the stylists Maram and Aabroo for giving Fawad a very different look - loved the ode to Waheed Murad , with the longer hair and lock across the forehead .What I could n't get though was the strange lighting setup , wherein both Fawad and Aamina looked gorgeous but ghoulish on several occasions .At Cecil 's wedding for instance , both looked stunning and I 'm sure were saying important things , but it was hard to focus on words when their chalky faces were so distracting .Here , I loved Fawad 's chemistry with Vasay - now there 's a new jori in town if someone is thinking in terms of pushing the envelope and looking for out of the box plot lines to fully utilize our supremely talented actors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Loved her full on filmy heroine bit in the Ko Korina song .Following in the tradition of all the great heroines of yesteryears , Aamina too happily strummed away on the piano ; loved her in the Akele Na Jaana song .While I thoroughly enjoyed Aamina 's performance as Zarnab , as a romantic pair Armaan and Zarnab did nothing for me .From the get - go , while the screenplay was prepped to set the screen on fire - he is enamored by her but she outsmarts him making him swear revenge and they eventually fall in love - there was no heat between the lead pair .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The getting wet in the rain and sharing the umbrella should 've been a memorable moment but fell flat ; all I could think about was how cold Fawad looked in that scene .Among other actors , Vasay was a standout as Danny , and if I may say so actually outshone Fawad in quite a few places .The Zartab- Salman pair was okay , though Mahnoor did look very pretty throughout .Among the seniors , its always a delight to see Lubna Aslam , and Manzoor Queshi was his usual impeccable self , the perfect indulgent dadaji .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Among these , the two versions of Akele Na Jaana were the best in terms of effective placement and utilization .Shreya Ghoshal 's version was beautifully used to highlight the increasing closeness between Armaan and Zartab , while the male version was a good device to highlight the drama of the moment , as Armaan frantically searched for his MIA lady love .The classic Ko Ko Korina song had been a huge disappointment when I first heard it and while it sounded a little better once I saw the picturization , the original still wins hands down .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As for Fawad , after having seen him perform various dance routines in ads , I am just glad that he did not do any more than he did .As for his yellow - green outfit , the less said the better .In the final analysis , I thoroughly enjoyed the whole package .Anjum Shahzad 's direction was spot on , be it the humorous bits , the drama , or the romance , the evenly paced narrative flowed smoothly without any hiccups .The overall production was beautifully designed , and the outdoor locations were well - chosen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I just wish some money had also been spent on buying Fawad a few more winter clothes and boots .The poor guy was literally shivering in a few places and looked like he was freezing to death in the choti - e aashqan scene .While the overall look and feel of the final product was very slick and appealing , full marks to the producers for that , the one thing that struck a very jarring note were the wrong spellings of names of people integral to this project .Fawad 's name was spelt wrong in the opening credits , and fixed later at some places in the end credits , which is ironic considering that he is a co - producer here and also shares credit for the screenplay .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps someone could fix these before the DVD versions are shipped out ?I missed it yesterday because of my preps for exams but thank you so much for this detailed review .I caught a few scenes and out of which the ' akeley na Jana song ' stood out for me !I loved , loved and loved it !Amina looked sizzling hot !Will come and share my views on Armaan , after I watch it :) till my exams end I will have tasali because at least I have read your review ; ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I would give full marks to the director for making a typical love story very interesting and giving it a new flavour .Armaan was definitely the best product from all of the Tarang Housefull telefilms so far .The screenplay , the cinematography , the dialogues ; it all blended together well .I personally just wish Aamina Sheikh could 've been replaced with another actress , because she was simply just not completely fit for the part .Her performance was just a notch above average , especially considering how talented she is and keeping in mind the amazing performances she has delivered in the past .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She did manage to look gorgeous though , just a bit too white though , but great effort by Maram and Aabroo .Coming to the chemistry .Wow , there was no heat , no sizzle , nothing .No offense to any fans out there but I found the chemistry to be very dull and dry , the rain scene resulting in the biggest disappointment .There was like no passion in Aamina 's eyes ... it all looked , well , acted and not natural at all .I agree how Aamina and him looked more like buddies instead of lovers , especially prior to the interval .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Fawad Khan on the other hand was simply brilliant .In each and every scene .He executes this effortless charm and managed to carry the film well .There could n't have been anyone better suited for this role than him .And Vasay as Danny was equally brilliant .Their bromance was much better than Armaan and Zarnaab 's scenes .This was a different role for Fawad and he was so successful at it .I 'm so tired of seeing every drama or telefilm being led by female characters , so glad to see a refreshing change !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
