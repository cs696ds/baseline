{"text": "Top positive review .Judging from the clips of Hendrix 's Isle of Wight performance that I 've seen in other documentaries , I always thought that this 1970 show in front of 600,000 people represented the sad end of Jimi 's career .True , Hendrix wrestled with numerous technical problems and an audience obnoxiously yelling for hits , but that 's only the half of it .The other half , to my delight , consists in moments of humor , a great set list and a relentless series of \" jaw meet floor \" guitar moments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Since this is a complete concert , you get a real sense of Hendrix 's ability to shape the otherwise chaotic energy of a 1960s rock show into a series of peaks to which he gingerly leads the assembled and just as carefully brings them home from .It 's not just the rapid - fire blues scale runs that impress ; witness his driving rhythm playing in All Along the Watchtower , his fluttering double - stops and tasteful dominant - chord comping throughout .Jimi 's blues at that time were very real ; the hellhound of death was on his trail , and his only refuge was another hotel room in another of his endless tour stops .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This is an amazing show , it starts out with Hendrix doing his rendition of God Save The Queen , it 's very entertaining I might add .But the one song that made my jaw hit the floor was MACHINE GUN , sure I was amazed when I heard it , but actually seeing it is another experience .Electrifying .I love seeing Hendrix play Ezy Ryder , Freedom , and Dolly Dagger , since they were n't released during his lifetime .I 'm not sure whether the crowd was more into the concert or I was , but this one blew my mind as far as Hendrix performances go .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "That said , he had enormous respect for the people who had paid money to see him and so tore into this concert with enormous brio .His fingerwork is among his most dazzling .The camera crew captures three men feeding off each other with visual ques that also point to how sober , clean and focused Jimi was by this time .He and Mitchell were as in sync with each other as Coltrane and Elvin Jones .Cox has been unfairly glossed over in music and this film and soundtrack illustrate that he was the best bass player for the best guitarist of all time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
