{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .Brothers Andy ( Phillip Seymour Hoffman ) and Hank ( Ethan Hawke ) are in desperate need of money and come up with a fool - proof way to get it : They 'll rob a small jewelry store .The catch : It 's their parents ' store .Wow .I 'll say it again : Wow .This movie is the most powerful and exciting film I 've seen in a long time .The acting is outstanding , the script is clever and full of surprises , and the direction by Sidney Lumet is superb .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They are both excellent .The story reminded me a lot of A Simple Plan which also had two greedy brothers with a can't - miss scheme that quickly and tragically becomes a nightmare .This movie is so intense , I was often saying , \" Yikes ! \" to myself and holding my breath a lot .It 's that good .The only thing I did n't like is the way the story constantly goes back and forth in flashbacks ; I do n't think that added anything and was a bit frustrating for me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Hoffman 's got problems and so does Hawke , but they 're different problems , although both have their root in money .Money drives this sucker and leads to greed , murder , despair , fear , and retribution .This is one of the darkest of noir tales in a long while ; it 's a noir family drama that 's so unrelenting your chin drops further and further as the movie progresses and by the whopper of a tragic ending , it 's definitely on the sidewalk .But this is what makes it so compelling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hawke and Hoffman both needing money leads to a plan to get said money , and , of course -- this being a noir film at its blackest heart -- to get it completely illegally .Watch this movie to see how noir is REALLY done today , in the 21st century .This is a real kick in the teeth movie .Serious punch , powerful acting , a director with real chops at the age of 83 , and one you wo n't forget for a LONG time .First time screenwriter Kelly Masterson ( with some modifications by director Sidney Lumet ) has concocted a melodrama that explores just how fragmented a family can become when external forces drive the members to unthinkable extremes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale , we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong .Andy Hanson ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) is a wealthy executive , married to an emotionally needy Gina ( Marisa Tomei ) , and addicted to an expensive drug habit .His life is beginning to crumble and he needs money .Andy proposes a low - key robbery of a small mall mom - and - pop jewelry store that promises safe , quick cash for both .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Grady Harp , April 08 .\" Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead \" is one of the best movies to come out of 2007 .It 's involving , thrilling and even at times terrifying to see how normal everyday people can do terrible and unimaginable things .It 's also a film that shows you that nothing is ever simple and even what seems to be the most simple or \" victimless \" crime can lead to devastating consequences that can shatter lives . \"Victimless .\" That 's exactly the term Andy uses when he explains to his brother how they can get some easy cash .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Not a minute went by where I could predict what was going to happen next .That 's a real treat when you are in the presence of a confident film that wo n't resort to the usual cliches or predictable twists and turns .The writing and performances are outstanding .Ethan Hawke , Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney are also terrific and deserve high praises .There is a risk that comes with a film like this , and that is the fact that there will be a lot of people who wo n't like it .It 's very dark , depressing and even gives you a sense of hopelessness that things can ever be good for these characters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The DVD includes cast and crew commentary , a theatrical trailer and a making of featurette .I have seen this film many times now , and it never loses its power and emotion for me .True , \" Before the Devil Knows You 're Dead \" is not for everybody , but it is a remarkable film that deserves to be seen .If you 're looking for a crime story where you actually care about the characters , as flawed as they may be , then this may be the one for you .-Michael Crane .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Two brothers ( Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke ) plan to hold up a jewelry store in a strip mall ... and the store is owned by THEIR PARENTS .I also knew it bounced around in time a little .What I did n't expect was such an unrelenting look at a whole bunch of magnificently screwed - up people !WOW !I was left almost breathless by the new depths to which these folks could sink .It was a family tragedy , but there sure was n't anything noble about these characters .Hawke is the younger brother , and he works for the same company as his brother , but in a fairly lowly position , and he can barely make ends meet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In particular , we see their relationships with their father , Albert Finney .He 's an old man now , but we get the idea that when he was younger , he was pretty tough old bird , difficult to please , lacking in affection and just a real poor father .Scenes with mother Rosemary Harris are fewer and less illuminating .It 's really a story about how men in a family can screw each other up .BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD takes this idea to EXTREMES .Towards the end , the actions of Hoffman in particular become almost monumentally deranged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He is truly a completely broken and desparate man .All sympathy we might have had for him is gone ... just like any sense of a moral compass he might have had .And Albert Finney arguably goes even one step more off the path of righteousness at the very end .Anyway , I hope you get that this is not a happy , light film .But it is powerful , astonishingly well acted and written , and an absolute must - see .It 's a riveting time at the theatre ! ! !Hoffman is brilliant ... pure and simple .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do n't know if the film will be an Oscar contender , because it has such a small audience ... but it should be and absolutely Hoffman should be up for Best Actor .Hawke is also very good ... he is a complete coward and makes up both sympathize him and despise him .He could be up for Best Supporting Actor .Finney is always an imposing presence ... and he 's very good here .Again , I ca n't tell you too much without spoiling the plot line , but let 's say he goes very convincingly from distraught to enraged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The tense , fragmentary screenplay fills us in bit by bit as to the robbery , the events leading up to it and its aftermath , showing us not only the brothers ' growing desperation but the family rivalries and character weaknesses that made the final tragedy inevitable .The final scene , a grotesque mockery of the perfect crime the brothers envisioned , suggests that apples never fall far from the tree .Like a crazed , three - way cross between \" Memento , \" \" The Asphalt Jungle \" and \" Death of a Salesman , \" \" Before the Devil Knows Your Dead \" keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from beginning to end .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
