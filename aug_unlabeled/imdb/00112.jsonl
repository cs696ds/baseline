{"text": "MOST HELPFUL POSTS .[ deleted account ] .Witchcraft & gay ! ! !Give me a break !There is nothing wrong with Barney .My 17 year old son loved it when he was little .People really need to get a grip .Barney , gay !Teletubbies , gay , and Bert and Ernie are gay !People are nuts !My children are now 20,17 , & 13 .When they were small I heard much controversial commentary about Barney .I Wrote to \" Uncle Charlie \" at children 's Bible Hour radio program about a comment he made on air .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His advice was to watch with my children , teach them about Jesus in every activity and talk to them about anything they saw or heard that might be unbiblical .It was a great way for me to obey the command in Deuteronomy 6 to repeat the commands of scripture and talk about them at home and away , while lying down and when getting up .The truths of scripture were permanently impressed on each of my children 's hearts .All three of them love the Lord with all their hearts , souls , minds and strength .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is not what shows our children watch , but how we interact with them and how we teach them to discern the things of God in everyday activity .Children will meet all kinds of people in their lives , teach them God 's truths and how to live by them and they will be ok .I am not sure why people have a problem with children using their imagination .It ' s given to us by our heavenly Father .Everything he gave us is good and to be used to the fullest .I do believe that with Barney , like with any other television program , parents should be right there in front of the television training their children .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Since television is \" someone telling their vision \" .Parents should be there to show them the correct way to do everything , including how to use their imagination .I think our biggest problem is that most parents do n't know how to use their imaginations .God gave them to us so we can see beyond this earth 's realm and to think and dream big .For some people , their imaginations are the places they go to escape their bad realities .But for us it is a tool we use to bring heaven on earth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We are kingdom citizens governed from a more excellent realm and not subject to this worlds system .I agree with Jennifer Henning , although I think the station she is trying to trefer to is TBN ( trinity broadcasting network ) , not TBS(turner broadcasting system ) .I have had LOTS of experience with Spiritual Warfare ( which is VERY real ... read Ephesians in your BIble ) , and I can tell you from personal experience that you must coose carefully the shows , books , and music that are brought into your home .They all originate from a source , and as the Word tells us ... there is no such thing as sitting the fence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "On the secular side ( I do n't know if you are a person of faith ) , there have been many accusations from secular parents about subliminal messaging inserted into the show .Trust yor spirit .If you get a bad feeling ... pay attention .Well I think there is alot better Childrens TV out there than Barney .I am in Australia and we have a real gem called Playschool , Do n't know if you can get on cable in the states but try and search it out it is amazing .Also on DVD .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Imagination needs to be encouraged in Kids as that is where they learn and develop .In our house we have seals and princesses , Knights , pirates and shops all played in the dirt downstairs .my son absolutley loved barney , he was not obessed , but he did enjoy watching it ..... he has a wonderful imagination and is now five years old and can make up the most vivid , imaginative stories ever ( he 's much better than I am , .LOL ) .From reading all of this , I can see why so many people think Chistians are crazy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It brings creativity and uses so many parts of your brain .Gay ?You better really know what you are talking about .I am so tired of verses taken out of context being used to make a point .It is all or nothing .Jesus never shunned ANYONE , who are we to decide who can go to heaven ?Our collective prayer should be Father , forgive us , we are such idiots to deem that our knowledge is more than yours .Wo n't be back here .God lives in all our lives , not just one or two .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Imagination and Children go together .My kids are now 12and 10 and they have a good imagination .Yes his voice is annoying but he was a positive influence and my kids would clean up to the clean up song .The kids in the show were clean and wholesome .What 's the alternative Miley Cyrus and all those other so called kid role models .I rather have my kids singing sweet song than jirating to the so called kids music available today .It wo n't hurt them so do n't worry about what other people say .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Trust the holy Spirt .If you get a bad vibe , it 's your spirt giving you that discernment or telling you somthing .I personaly did'nt get Good vibes from Barney .Do you have Cable ?There s a couple stations that have Christian cartoons ect . for children .One of the stations I know of the top of my head is TBS which I think stands for the trinity broadcast system .It 's the same station they have joyce meyer on .Blessings to you .My daughter loves Barney .She likes the music .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Most young children do n't understand that one minute this is real and the next we 're using our imaginations .That 's for the older kids , and the older kids use their imaginations all the time .If we want to talk about the morals of people behind the scenes , I do n't know of many that would be safe to watch .Even Winnie the Pooh is acid - inspired .Walt Disney would certainly be off - limits .I do n't know that he was gay , either .Barney was an African - American male .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My daughter absolutely loves Barney .When she was a baby she would only watch Baby Einstein videos until she met Barney .3 years later and Barney is still going strong in our house .She has learned so many ways to make learning fun from Barney .I teach her the alphabet and counting and such , but Barney has many ways to make learning interesting for children .Also there are good lessons , such as sharing and feeling .I do n't believe that Barney is gay .I think that he gets that reputation because some people could not possibly believe that a straight man would want to dress up as a dinasour and teach children .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do agree he is VERY Annoying .But I think it is the magic that is used in the show that would be a concern to a lot of Christians .I never liked that part of him .But I would watch it with the girls when thy did watch them .The were not big fans .We would talk about the magic and how it was not real , and did not help our Christian life .It 's all very confusing as to the details of what happened .I ca n't say the cop was wrong or right at this point .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I can tell you a lot of hearsay , but what good would that do .The thing that we should be doing as human beings is giving our sympathy to the family who lost their child , grandchild , brother , cousin , or even a friend .I feel for the parents of this man the most , as parents we are n't supposed to have to bury our children .Despite whatever may have happened yesterday morning he was still their child .So my deepest sympathy to the family .My deepest sympathies to all the families involved too but , an armed person charging at two officers with his weapon pointed directly at them ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
