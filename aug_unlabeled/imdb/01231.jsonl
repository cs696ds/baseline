{"text": "Welcome to DragoArt again .Today we will discover how we can teach ourselves to \" draw a Hydra \" .This beast is common in Greek mythology .A hydra would first begin with three heads .As each head was hacked off , the hydra would replace the hacked spot with three more heads .Remember the Disney movie Hercules ?Remember the purple monster that would keep growing heads no matter how Hercules cut them off ?That monster was a hydra .Hades summoned it from his gates of the underworld to attack Hercules .The hydra was also the guardian of the underworld or a servant guardian for Hades .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One breath of this poison and you would die instantly .The hydra was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna .Typhon was half man with three serpent tails and bird wings .Echidna was half a nymph and the large body of a serpent .That sounds freaky .When drawing your Hydra , you can start it off with three heads , nine heads , or one hundred heads !It does n't matter .I started off my hydra with the basics .That means it has n't met Hercules yet , so therefore , it starts off with three heads .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While he was in the beast 's belly , he hacked the whole inside of the creature with his sword .It 's pretty similar to the Disney Hercules movie .That movie is my personal favorite because of the endless Greek monsters that Hercules defeats .There 's Cerberus , Nemean Lion , Erymanthian Boar and the Stymphalian birds .These Greek mythology monsters were featured breifly in the Disney Hercules movie .Anywho , the Hydra is my favorite monster out of the movie because of its awesome duplicating heads !I also colored it purple just so you are familiar to what a hydra is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It took me a while to get what I wanted on the hydra .I then scanned the image into my computer and imported it to Photoshop CS .After that , I colored the beast and added some cool features to it .This is my personal view on how the hydra looks .I made it more draconic then monsterous .So yeah , this is the mighty hydra !So I hope this tutorial was very helpful .If there 's any comments or suggestions , please feel free to leave one .This tutorial took me a total of three hours .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
