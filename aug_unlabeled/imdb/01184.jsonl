{"text": "Whether you viewed in back in 1995 or now , where the threat of viral attack does n't seem so unlikely , this film should be gripping on the basis of the material .At points it does have good moments but generally this generally suffers from trying to do too much and having a script that can not control its subject .For most of the film the virus is almost a concept rather than a real threat and it talks a lot without really delivering .Even when an entire town is quarantined and dying , it all remains very calm where really it needed fear and panic to seep into every character and every scene .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Another reason that this does n't live up to its potential is the sheer numbers of faces in the film .Hoffman makes a strange action star but he does OK with what little he is given .Russo is no good at all and happily has little to do but deliver the personal ' involvement ' that the film can not manage to deliver any other way .Gooding is pretty good in a semi - action role and Spacey has some good lines before he too becomes a cheap emotional device .Sutherland gives a by the numbers performance as he has nothing to really work with , but Freeman is more interesting because he does .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "An aside that was interesting to me was that Dale Dye has a minor role in the film while also serving as military adviser to the film .Overall the potential is there but it is unrealised .The cast are great on paper but have nothing to work with in a script that delivers average dialogue , no real characters , no moral ambiguities , no real involvement and no sense of scale or threat .It does have some pace at times and it has enough ' OK ' moments to be worth watching maybe once but I was annoyed that the potential of the material alone was missed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
