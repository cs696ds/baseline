{"text": "The cruel but funny Le d\u00eener de cons ( 1998 ) is given the title The Dinner Game in English , but it really means The Asshole Dinner .It was the most recent film I had seen by legendary French comic director and screenwriter Francis Veber ( an even better site on Francis Veber , although only in French , is at Ecran Noir ) , and I thought it was merciless and delightful .( For an appreciation of Veber 's work , see my review of his older movie Les Comp\u00e8res , back on November 4 , 2003 . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In this film , Pignon is the awkward businessman , common , depressed , and risible .He wears a red tie to work on the day of the big company photo , only to be shoved out of the frame by his pushier coworkers .Everyone in his office knows that he will lose his job that day , everyone except him , until he overhears a conversation in the men 's room .( You 're annoying , physically ugly , you have no future , and you 're quite an asshole : there , you feel better , right ? )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When Belone agrees , saying that even the best actors trying to camp it up come off as fake and vulgar , we can not help thinking of Veber 's own La Cage aux Folles and its American remake , The Birdcage .The point of this kind of comedy is to skewer the hypocrisy of society 's attitudes , in this case , homophobia .Pignon 's boss is outraged when someone suggests that the photos were sent because Pignon will sue , claiming anti - gay discrimination , if he is fired .First , the boss ( Jean Rochefort ) complains with great sympathy , \" Je n'ai rien contre les homosexuels , moi \" ( I have nothing against homosexuals , myself ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( This faggot is pissing me off ! )I howled at that juxtaposition .A big rugby - playing homophobe named Santini ( G\u00e9rard Depardieu ) , frightened by the lies of coworkers who say that his pronounced homophobia will get him fired next , tries to be nice to Pignon in a series of overtures that become increasingly ridiculous .Pignon ends up on the company 's float in the Paris Gay Pride parade , wearing a pink condom hat ( the company makes rubber products , especially condoms , which is fodder for a number of jokes ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have already written about how many American remakes have been made of Veber 's French originals , mostly terrible .An article from July 2001 , The Nerdcage , by Peter Keough for the Boston Phoenix , includes the following fascinating information , with the quotations coming directly from Veber : .Hollywood seems at a loss when it comes to Veber .Take his current attempt to remake his last big French hit , Le d\u00eener des cons , which was released here to little notice as The Dinner Game ( 1997 ) .A wealthy publisher invites strangers to his dinner parties ; what the guest does n't know is that he or she is an \" idiot \" brought in to entertain the rest .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" It 's difficult to remake .I 've discovered through the process how much the comedy has strong cultural roots .There are things here that are very different than in Europe .I understand that .I arrived too late to become an American .Billy Wilder was helped by [ Charles ] Brackett ; he had great writers with him that were American .\" Of course , some aspects of comedy are universal .With his modest but brilliant comedies and his knack for casting big stars ( in addition to Auteuil , The Closet features French topliners G\u00e9rard Depardieu and Thierry Lhermitte ) , Veber can be compared to Woody Allen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" I was in Los Angeles and he was showing Sweet and Lowdown .I said how much I liked what he was doing and told him that I was the writer / director of The Dinner Game .He said , ' I was your biggest publicist in New York ' .Then he paid me a magnificent compliment when I arrived back in Los Angeles a couple of months ago .I had a fax from my producer that said Woody Allen wants to be the idiot in The Dinner Game , in the remake , and what do you think of that ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Because he does n't have much box - office clout .And it 's sad because he 's such a genius .But box office is the key word here .Is anyone else as disgusted as I am about this ?Why ca n't studio executives get the hell out of the way of people who know how to make movies ?If you are like me and want to see Veber 's latest film , Tais - toi , according to one recent source ( Leonard Klady in Movie City News on April 22 ) , there is no still no American distribution deal for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
