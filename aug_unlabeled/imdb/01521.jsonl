{"text": "6 Again , where one book shows an overall picture , the other concentrates on a detailed portion .7 Wilks mentions the seamy side of life that existed in England in Austen 's time , which is left untouched in some biographies .In this sense he presents the author in a broader context .I liked Wilks ' defence of Austen 's apparently frivolous , sometimes malicious , comments in her letters to Cassandra .However , Wilks ' biographical narrative is at times confusing because it is not always chronological .Also , I found it difficult to accept such a sweeping statement as \" All her life Jane Austen had feared being poor , as she had feared the plight of the single woman without means .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If she were so concerned with money and success , why did she not turn out romances and epic poems for the public taste , rather than \" keep to my own style and go on in my own way \" ?10 I feel that any anxiety over poverty that Jane Austen may have felt was no more than what any normal woman would have felt at that period in history when the choices for women were so limited .More serious still are obvious errors found throughout the book .To begin with , the portrait of Jane 's youngest brother , Charles , and the view of Chawton Manor are both reverse images .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Here he makes a further case of the supposed lack of warm feelings between Jane and her mother saying , \" there is no mention of any present for her mother .Halperin also makes a big case about Jane 's dislike of noisy children .So what ?I do not like noisy children , either .The only person I know who derives great satisfaction out of being surrounded by noisy children is Mrs. Musgrove !To quote Mr. Darcy , Halperin seems to \" willfully misunderstand \" many biographical details .He was too precipitate in searching out negative signs with which to create a false image of our author .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , what seemed in Austen criticism a new insight in 1940 and its creditable development in 1952 , can not apply to Austen biography where accurate information and unbiased observations are of utmost importance .One major scholastic disadvantage of this book , apart from its copious inaccuracies , is that Halperin chose to lump together all notes at the end of the book without reference numbers .This makes it difficult for a reader to trace the source of his information .I can not do better than to quote Deirdre Le Faye who states : \" A writer of Jane Austen 's quality deserves the compliment of a biography of equal precision and sensitivity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
