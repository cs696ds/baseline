{"text": "And let 's face it , the writers having to hold us to the end by only having Jack and Allison 's morals quuestioned for a few episodes , while it was n't a bad idea , ended up being a little flat .I should probably rewatch it again before coming to a real conclusion , but I 'm going to go ahead and say that I did n't think it was bad , but it was very dissapointing and average .In the long run , people will defend this season , even though 7 was a 100 times better , but this one was average .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
