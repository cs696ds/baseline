{"text": "Top 5 Epic Gore Scenes .Horror movies are infamous for their depiction of violence ; many times it 's used to add dramatic effect and others it 's just used gratuitously .The level of enjoyment one gets out of the moments of violence usually depends on the quality of the effects whether they be CGI or practical .Cheesy horror movies generally opt for comedic levels of blood and guts spraying across the screen , but these moments are n't limited to the cheesy movies alone as there are several horror movies that use the realistic portrayal of gore to shock and appall viewers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lists will vary from person to person but certain moments are just so unforgettable that they remain universal , that is unless of course you 're dealing with someone new to the genre , and then it 's our job to help them discover these juicy pieces of cinema .I 've witnessed my fair share of over the top gore scenes in my day , but I know that I 've got a long ways to go before I 've seen it all let alone seen many of the more obscure choices other people might come up with .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also ... assume there are spoilers afoot .The Spring Break Buffet ( Piranha 3d ) - The most recent of my choices , Piranha 3D is far and away from being the best horror movie anyone will encounter , but it is a whole lot of fun from beginning to end .The events all lead up to an incredibly brutal beach scene with college partygoers being attacked by the bloodthirsty piranhas .While they are trying to escape their fate at the razor sharp teeth of the fish they also cause horrible violence upon themselves in various ways and the practical effects are really something to behold .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Shortly after they arrive and the locals are extremely hostile an altercation leaves one of them bleeding and sends one of the strippers into a bloodthirsty rage and she turns into a vampire .Then the rest of the bar workers and strippers also change into vampires and start slaughtering all of their paying customers in a scene that 's very violent and also very funny .Choke On It ( Feast ) - A very underrated film that came out of Project Greenlight was FEAST .It 's a hilarious and violent monster movie that might take a couple viewings to really appreciate , but I nearly ca n't get enough of it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The scene in question also comes at the end of the film when the characters need to make one last final stand against the monsters to try and survive the ordeal .When all the carnage is coming to an end there 's one very glorious moment when the waitress of the bar jumps on top of one of the monsters and shoves her entire arm down it 's through screaming \" Choke on it .\" It 's one of those moments where you just have to clap with a huge smile on your face .One Word , Inside ( Inside ) - My first exposure to French horror was this little home invasion gem known as INSIDE .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The killer 's weapon of choice happens to be scissors and she uses them in terrible ways , ones that were burned into my brain for days after initially watching it .The events are all capped off by a gory and disturbing final kill that is at once memorable and disgusting ; therefore the film gets my nod of recognition for being epic , on a disturbing level .When Lawnmowers Attack ( Dead Alive ) - Before Peter Jackson was making trips with hobbits and remaking a certain classic giant ape he was toiling in the world of a virus originated by a diseased rat monkey that turns those bitten into zombies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Agreed .Do n't forget Frontier(s ) .Inside was the first ' new ' French Horror movie I saw and GOOD LORD .Martyrs is brutal as hell , but Inside horrified me so much I almost started to cry .My jaw was just hanging open by the final scene .Gave me nightmares ... so did Martyrs .Those French horror movies not only do n't pull any punches , they shoot you in the face and leave you to bleed out !Okay list , not knocking it ... cheers on DeadAlive ending , pure bloodbath .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you have n't seen it , love zombie flicks , and can get through the set up ... get it .Perhaps it 's just nostalgia but I prefer the ' vomit \" scene from Gates Of Hell .Watching her throw up her intestines , then stomach , etc ( not to mention how realistic the drill bit scene was ) esp considering the level of SFX back then .I feel it at least deserves an honorable mention .A Lucio Fulci film , thumbs up !Although I prefer his The Beyond and Zombie Flesh Eaters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And in that scene you mentioned , the actress Daniela Doria actually had to swallow fresh intestines that Fulci had gotten from a slaughterhouse and vomit them back up , so it was n't even a special effect at all !It was real , except the end of the scene when her head was replaced with a dummy 's head .You are all forgetting the grandaddy of them all , \" Day of the Dead .The original , of course .Dude gets pulled apart at the waste while he 's still screaming .Best zombie movie ever made , and one of the best horror movies ever made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "EPIC FAIL for the lack of The Sword And The Sorceror .In which a man has his head aliced in half by being pushed into a grindstone .And the hero de - crucifies himself then fights with the nails STILL in his palms .fail fail fail .august underground .horrible movie , all torture , include sucking on a castrated penis then raping the mans wife with it . cannibal holocaust , guinea pig series , nekromantic ( girl cuts off a penis ( shows it ) then while having sex with another man cuts his head off and puts a rubber band around his dick to keep it hard and replaces his head with her dead lover .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "the only movie i respect on this list for gore wise is inside that is disturbing .There 's a movie which I do n't remember it 's name , where a guy gets his head half chopped with a shovel smash and his tongue and jaw remains hanging while the body is still standing , pretty bad fx but great and hilarious idea there .Also Starship Troopers is pretty gory and funny , I was laughing more than stressed when soldiers get chopped in half , limbs get ripped off , or brains sucked up , awesome !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some great choices on the list .I like the inclusions of Feast and especially Inside .For those who have n't seen it there are a few shocking unexpected gory scenes .I went into it expecting not much and got one of the best horror flicks in recent years .You really ca n't argue the # 1 choice ..... that lawnmower scene from Dead Alive is a splattertastic classic !FEAST WAS A REALLY GOOD MOVIE DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT MUCH FROM IT BUT GOT ALOT .TO BAD THE SEQUELS SUCKED .THEY JUST KEPT GETTING WORST AND WORST .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The thing is , each of them is starting to die quickly and if they do n't get out alive , their weekend is going to be a total bummer .( Here I go again ) .Needless to say , SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE is a fantastic film .The idea of using a portable drill is great and the fact that the killer actually talks is a breath of fresh air from the \" quiet , stalking , killing \" murderer .Filled with enough humor to fill a whole ' nother movie , SPM rocks .Pure and simple , it rocks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are some minor specs and grain but nothing too overbearing .THE AUDIO QUALITY : 10/10 2 .Read more ' .2 of 2 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I bought this movie fully expecting nothing but T&A and maybe a little gore .It delivered on those two expectations , with enough of the cheesecake to keep it interesting but going surprisingly light on the gore , with some of the killing actually taking place off - screen .Of course character development is given low priority , which hardly comes as a surprise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , the whole atmosphere of the film was done quite nicely , and it worked well enough to make me a bit uneasy .While watching it , my cat was sitting in the window , and he suddenly jumped back and ran out of the room - so I went over and somewhat cautiously closed the window and locked the door !LOL .Overall , if you 're looking for a nice slasher flick with all the things teenage boys most enjoy , or maybe you just want to relive those memories of drive - ins in the early ' 80s , you 'll probably be quite satisfied with this little gem .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... . ...There 's not much plot , not that we really need one .Basically , there 's a madman on the loose .His name 's Russ Thorne and he 's stalking and slashing a group of girls who are having a slumber party .Yeah , that 's about it for plot .But what part of what makes Slumber Party Massacre enjoyable schlock is the fact that it 's written and directed by women , feminists no less .And the movie they 've crafted is really no different than anything a male director would have come up with .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But that 's expected in a slasher , and as long as the movie 's entertaining and not that poorly made , than it 's passable , which is the case here .Heck , there are even a few suspenseful moments here and there , amazingly enough .Halloween or even Friday the 13th : The Final Chapter this is not .But they 're reasonably effective for what they are , thanks to tons of blood and gore and some good jump - in - your - seat shocks .The movie runs at a pretty fast pace , and at 76 minutes , runs quick without being too big a waste of time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
