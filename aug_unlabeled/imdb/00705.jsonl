{"text": "How to Shoot a Feature Film for $ 9,000 and Other Filmmaking Tips from Actor / Director Edward Burns .The great thing about the DSLR revolution is that it has put professional - looking images within reach of almost anyone .You can now spend a few hundred dollars on a camera and it will get you quite a bit of the way there , and let you focus on everything else to make the best movie possible .In an interview with Sheri Candler , and in the online Q&A session below , Edward Burns talks about his career , low - budget filmmaking , screenwriting , and how it 's possible to make movies cheaply .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not everything he says will apply to all movies , but Burns is one of those people I think it 's important to listen to because he is out and actively producing these movies , living by the advice he 's giving to filmmakers .It should be noted that Burns spent much more money on post - production than he did on actual shooting , but the point still stands that he was able to shoot these films for basically no money ( in Hollywood terms ) .As he says above , connections are key .The only way you 're going to make a movie for no money is by getting as many favors as possible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Henry comes completely from a \" sell a product \" point of view instead of a \" make art \" point of view .When you make art , there are people that will work for free , not all of them , but some will , and they will do it because they believe in you as the one force driving the movie , and they believe in the movie itself .Some will do it just to add a project to their reel so they can have something to show to get other jobs and build a carrer , and other will work free just because they 're your friends .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I agree with Henry and Ben 100 % .It kills me every time some filmmakers do another kickstarter for more money for all the lavish production expenses ( Fisher dollies , HMI 's master Primes ... whatever ... etc .. ... and then do n't include money for the crew .I just talked a director out of shooting a feature on film ...I ca n't believe I found myself in that position, ... but the bottom line is , if you can afford film , you can afford to pay your crew better .As a DP , this would be a great opportunity for me ( my only feature credit as DP was also shot on film ) , but the bottom line is the bottom line .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
