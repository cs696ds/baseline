{"text": "November 2005 .November 11 , 2004 .TSS is DEAD ... .Well I 've officially been let go ... along with a bunch of other people from TSS and three other shows .Kevin and Sarah are the only ones left on screen and I do n't know what they are planning to do with them .The Screen Savers as you know it is GONE !You , the fans of TSS , really made me feel like a million bucks .I know it was hard for some of you to see Patrick go , but I really appreciate you all giving me a chance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "- Alex Albrecht .It 's been a pleasure .I hate to see it go down like this , but unfortunately that 's the way the industry works ...I guess .You were great ; certainly did n't expect you to be an exact copy of Patrick .Make sure to keep us abreast of what is next for you .Take it easy ... .Alex , you ruled .I liked you as much as I did Patrick .I wish it was April 1st , and this was all a joke .I ca n't believe G4 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now 2 out of 3 are gone .Not to mention the only people that I can stand on G4TechTV are from the old TechTV ( and you ) .I will check back here often now .Duuuuude .That sucks .I 'll admit , it took a while for me to adjust to the new format .and , ahem , the new co - host .But honestly since the move to LA I thought that TSS had become a truly fantastic show .The friendship between Alex and Kevin was awesome , it was like hanging out with two geeked out friends and hearing about tech .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Good luck with all you do ...I guess I 'll have to start watching for Dell commercials ! ! !Alex this is a crime you were great as Screensavers cohost .When I had a bad day at work I knew turning on The Screensavers and seeing you would cheer me up .I really hope to see you on tv again soon .Good Luck we will dearly miss you .Alex i m sorry to hear about what happened .You were awesome and the show was all the better because of you .You will be missed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wish you the best of luck .God bless , you will truly be missed by all .Please excuse my language .But that sucks .G4 does not care anything about Tech .And this proves it .I am here by finished with this network .You guys were great and I liked the new TSS .Yes , I mess the old .But I can live with the new .Fuck G4 .What they have done to TechTV , its viewers , and its employees , is pure bullshit .Alex , you were better than Pat and Leo .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Good luck in your future .dude , i just posted on the TSS board in response to your commenting on the show how no one liked you .you were doing great .you and kevin , yoshi , sarah , and dan had just started clicking .i loved the bit with the karaoke pc thing .and now you 're gone .i 'm sorry you got screwed .i sent my email of protest as i 'm sure a buch of others have , but it 's obvious that g4 has little interest in what the fans of the show want or else they would n't have done what they did . best of luck .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You were awsome as host ! ! !you made tv fun .Good luck with whatever and Thanks for so many laughs .WTF HAS G4 DONE ? ! ? ! omg this is n't some little change , they have literally took techtv and burned it down .Alex , you are gon na go off to much better things , do n't worry .And a message to any G4 repersentitive , FUCK YOU . straight out .You guy 's have ruined the only good tech show in all of TV History .I repeat , fuck you G4 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
