{"text": "While it may work as a live - reading and better yet , maybe even as a short film , when given a larger - budget and more time to work with , the movie comes off incredibly meandering , ponderous , and overall , stale .For instance , we literally get a ten - to - fifteen - minute flashback with Wallace and his girlfriend where they 're not only sharing an intimate moment together ( meaning blow - jobs ) , but are even revealing certain depths of their characters that we probably would n't have gotten otherwise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Consensus : While it 's nice to see Kevin Smith trying something new , Tusk is a poorly - done , overlong , and just plain stupid movie that hardly goes anywhere funny , interesting , or even entertaining .Simply put , it 's boring , but it never knows it well enough to just cease what it is doing and get to the point already .You might just hear yours truly talking to a personal hero of his .Not all small towns get along , but especially this one that seems to be located somewhere in the heart of Texas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Oh , I guess that was a spoiler .This was the second flick from Australian filmmaker Andrew Dominik and it 's pretty obvious where he gets his inspiration of movie - making from , and that is Mr. Terrence Malick .Dominik focuses the camera on these long , sweeping shots of beautiful farmland where it almost feels like you 're there in the 1880 's with Jesse James and Robert Ford .Every shot is handled carefully , with just the right amount light and color added to it , to get you involved with the stark wilderness that these characters surround themselves with .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What I liked about Dominik , was that aside from his beautiful art direction , he was able to make a genuinely tense and unpredictable story out of a fact - based history lesson , and always being able to surprise us .May sound like a complaint but it 's not , mainly because Dominik is able to take his time with the story .Actually , whenever the violence did rarely show - up on the screen , it felt deserved and made sense to the story but also felt realistic in a way that these people are actually dying from real - life bullets and whatnot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "From everything I heard and read about , James was one violent son of a bitch and one that could n't be contained because of his wits and determination for violence when needed .This is an idea that Pitt plays up perfectly , giving us a very iconic figure to begin with but also show something else that lies deep down inside of him .Pitt 's great , but Casey Affleck is just about as perfect playing opposite of him , as Robert Ford .Affleck plays the little boy - version of Jesse James , as he is constantly made fun of by his family and treated like he does n't know shit about shooting guns and robbing banks / trains .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
