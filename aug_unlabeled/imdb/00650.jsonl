{"text": "I read somewhere that they would actually remove just a frame or two just to make punches have more impact and other action move faster .We will never know if Lazenby would have gotten better had he made more Bond films .The problem with Lazenby is that in the movies Bond WAS Connery ; our idea of the character comes from him more than Fleming , and no one could equal that ( though Daniel Craig comes closest to reinventing it for his own personality ) .He was a brute and could pull that off in an attractively roguish way ; when Roger Moore stuffs a dwarf in a cabinet , he just seems like a snotty preppy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lazenby quit .He was n't really interested and did n't quite understand what he 'd gotten into .Went off to live the ' hippy ' life .John Gavin was signed to play the role until Connery returned , then was dropped and paid his full fee .Connery demanded 1 million , in Brit pounds not US $ , and gave it all to the Scottish Boy Scouts , at least according to press accounts at the time .DFA is near the bottom of the Bond barrel , imo , but then again I 'm one of the very few that think Dalton 's ' License to Kill ' is the best .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
