{"text": "Steve Coogan 's legendary chat show host and broadcaster finally receives the big screen treatment in this comedy directed by Declan Lowney .Occupying a career stasis - defining role as a mid - morning DJ on North Norfolk Digital Radio , Alan Partridge ( Coogan ) 's hopes for one last shot at the big time suffer a severe setback when it emerges that his employers have been taken over by a giant media conglomerate .Alan soon finds himself back in the spotlight , however , when newly - sacked fellow DJ Pat Farrell ( Colm Meaney ) returns to the studio with a shotgun and begins taking hostages .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .I did n't like this at first , but I 've re - watched it a couple of times and now I really like it .What you have to accept straight off is that ALL half - hour comedies which attempt to transfer to 90 min movies suffer for it , and they necessarily have to make changes to the pace and which characters are used and how .On my third watching I 've begun to really appreciate all the small jokes which are really rammed in everywhere they can go , too many to recall .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's good bits , but overall it probably would have helped with a few stronger jokes just to get it going , because there are some really good moments later on .Coogan shows his strong acting ability , and he can be very subtle .His stress - nose - whine makes him sound like a wounded dog when he has that bust up with Lynne , which is a nice touch .If you 're a Partridge fan and watched this once and thought it was crap , I recommend having a couple of cans and watching it again and then perhaps again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's good , and in places brilliant .Comment 5 of 5 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Confession time ....Having never seen the tv show this was n't high on the must watch list .However with good critical reviews and generally good word of mouth I was pleased when the opportunity to watch it came up .Whilst not entirely my sense of humour there was a lot of entertainment to be had .As you all know by now Alan finds himself in a pickle when an disgruntled ex - employee decides to take revenge on the radio studio that sacked him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Cue endless mishaps and dodgy quips as Alan uses the situation to bolster his flagging career more than making sure his friends make it out in one piece .The jokes come thick and fast and are generally well written and witty .There are moments where it feels like things are done just for a crude laugh such as Alan losing his trousers at one point , but you ca n't help but snigger at his misfortunes .Overall generally a funny film .If you like Alan Partridge then I am sure this will be well up your street .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Comment 2 of 2 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Steve Coogan 's Alan Partridge is one of the greatest comic creations of the past 20 years or so .TV sitcoms transferred to the big screen rarely work ; there is usually a broadening and cheapening of effects which invariably offers diminishing returns .This is not quite the case here , where , the occasional \" slow \" passage notwithstanding , it actually works as a film .This is in no small part thanks to the excellent supporting cast and , in particular , the performance of Colm Meaney in the pivotal role of Pat Farrell ; he is by turns funny , touching , dangerous and entirely believable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To sum up .Did I enjoy the film ?Yes .Did it make me laugh ?Yes ( the scene where Alan loses his trousers made me weep with laughter ) .Was Steve Coogan brilliant as ever as Alan ?Of course .Would I recommend it to Alan - lovers ?I do n't need to !Would I recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable , funny movie ?Absolutely !Comment 1 of 1 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Classic tv comedy stretched out to movie length is usually a bad idea .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Alan Partridge is bordering on the edge of a successful transfer .It has some great visual jokes and some funny cringey scenes but then there are other parts of the movie that are sttretched out too thinly and some aspects of the film are a little too ridiculous .Saying that though it was stillm more enjoyable than most tv comedy transfers and worth at least one watch if you 're a fan .Comment 1 of 1 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .I have been a huge fan of AP since he was first created on \" On The Hour \" I own everything Alan , from book to CD and DVD and I quote him daily .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Almost every TV episode of AP are classics and hilarious .The problem is that Alan lives his world in a shoe box and it is his mundane life and his outlook on the world that makes him ideal for TV .Just watch \" Mid Morning Matters \" for example , every episode takes place in a small room with Alan being a DJ and that is where Alan is at his best and it is one of the funniest DVD 's out of all the series .Now to get it to work on the big screen you ca n't have Alan just being a dork for nearly 2 hours , you have to create a huge story around it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
