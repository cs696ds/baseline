{"text": "When she finds the bear in Toby 's room she shouts at him , causing the baby to cry and further infuriating her .She begins to read passages from Labyrinth to her baby brother , telling tales of a young girl granted special powers by the Goblin King , and Sarah herself wishes that the goblins would just come and take the screaming infant away .When Toby abruptly stops crying a worried Sarah enters his room to find that he has vanished .Suddenly , an owl flies through the open window and transforms into the Goblin King , Jareth ( David Bowie ) , who tells her that he has taken Toby as she requested .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jareth tells her that if she can solve his labyrinth in less than thirteen hours she can have Toby back , but if she fails the baby will be turned into a goblin and forced to remain with Jareth forever .Sarah faces many perils in her journey through the labyrinth , and along the way she befriends a curmudgeonly dwarf called Hoggle , a giant , fury beast named Ludo , and Sir Didymus , a chivalrous , fox - like knight who rides into battle atop a sheepdog called Ambrosius .I think it 's fair to say that I had a bit of a crush on Jennifer Connelly when I was a kid , based solely on her appearance in this film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Plus she was , like , the older woman ...Anyway , I had a thing for her , you get the idea .I think that 's where a lot of my love for this film comes from , as I was probably a little bit older than the film 's target audience when it was released in 1986 ( I was eleven at the time ) .It 's actually a film that I got to know on home video and TV over the years , plus it was the one - time favourite film of an ex - girlfriend , so I watched it quite a lot in my early teens and again in my early twenties .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Firstly , the acting is n't great .Connelly 's performance is a little wooden ( particularly at the beginning of the film ) and Bowie delivers every line like a bad impersonator doing his best David Bowie impression .The pacing is also slightly off , and as an adult I could have done with getting to know some of the characters a little better .This is particularly true of Sarah , who is such a spoiled brat at the start that I felt it difficult to connect with her at all .Thankfully she matures as the film progresses , learning life - lessons as she moves through the labyrinth , but I still think that the filmmakers should have fleshed out the conflict with her stepmother to provide some justification for her childish tantrums .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For all intents and purposes Hoggle is just as real as Sarah , such is the quality of the puppeteers ' performance , and the big , hairy giant Ludo is a sort of cross between Sully from Monsters Inc. and Neil from The Young Ones .The various goblins are also beautifully designed and provide most of the comic relief .However , my favourite character is the manic , hyperactive Sir Didymus , who reminds me of Basil Brush on speed .Save for a couple of suspect shots where the puppets have obviously been superimposed on the image , the effects also hold up remarkably well and the various song and dance numbers are all pleasurable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As a slightly amusing aside , my wife is so scared of this film - or more accurately of David Bowie - that she flat - out refused to be in the room while I was watching it !This phobia actually led to a quite hilarious moment during The Prestige , because I neglected to warn her of his impending arrival .I do n't think I 'll be showing her The Man Who Fell to Earth any time soon either ... .Video .Prior to receiving this Blu - ray the best version of Labyrinth I 'd seen was the original region two DVD release from way back in the early days of DVD , so I was expecting a big step up in visual quality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The 2.40:1 ( 1080/24p AVC ) widescreen transfer is quite grainy at times , which causes the occasional bit of shimmering , but that 's eminently preferable to having the grain digitally scrubbed out of existence .Detail is surprisingly strong throughout , especially in comparison to the DVD version .The film has a warm , natural palette - particularly when the action transitions to the realm of the Goblin King - and the exterior shots have an inviting golden glow to them that made me fuzzy with nostalgia .It 's hard to gauge the accuracy of the skin tones when so many of the characters are puppets , but they look reasonably accurate for the most part ( although there is a hint of red on occasion ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All things considered this is a very pleasing presentation of an ageing film , and one that 's sure to delight fans .Audio .The original DVD release offered only a limited bitrate Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround audio track , so the presence of a TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack here is most welcome ( although it would have been nice if the original soundtrack had also been included for the purists ) .The disc also includes TrueHD 5.1 soundtracks in French and German for those non - English - speaking individuals who are inclined to listen to dub tracks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Labyrinth does n't entirely escape this fate , but it 's not as bad as some films from the same era .The chief offenders are Hoggle and Ludo , whose dialogue is of a lesser quality than most of the other characters ( human or otherwise ) , but other than that things are n't too bad at all .The track is heavily biased towards the front of the soundstage and there 's not a whole lot of directionality , but the surrounds are occasionally used for effects during the livelier scenes or to add a bit of ambience in the quieter moments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact there are moments when the bass is just that little bit too powerful , almost hurting my eardrums during periods of prolonged low frequency noise .The various Bowie songs all have a strong presence in the mix , especially ' Underground ' and ' Dance Magic Dance ' , which sound better here than ever before , and the score warbles away in the background as a solid accompaniment to the action .This is n't the most impressive eighties remix I 've ever heard , but it is definitely the best I 've heard Labyrinth sound on any format .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Audio Commentary by Conceptual Artist Brian Froud : Brian Froud was responsible for Labyrinth 's conceptual artwork , but he also designed costume , creatures , and worked closely with director Jim Henson and writer Terry Jones to develop the story .He covers a huge array of topics with very few periods of dead air , and he does so in a manner that holds your attention throughout .This is definitely a track worth listening to .The Storytellers : This is a BonusView feature that offers new interview clips from people like Cheryl Henson and make - up artist Nick Dudman via a picture - in - picture window at the bottom right of the screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfortunately the PiP segments are few and far between , and in fact it 's a good eight minutes before the first one appears .Still , what little there is happens to be fairly interesting and is usually pertinent to the on - screen events .Making of Documentary : Inside the Labyrinth ( 00:56:27 SD ) : Ah , they do n't make 'em like this any more !This is the original making of as found on the first DVD release of the film , and it 's one of those incredibly nostalgic eighties featurettes that presents the behind - the - scenes footage in a very straightforward manner .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Instead , what we get is a lengthy piece that features plenty of interviews with everyone from Jim Henson , David Bowie and Jennifer Connelly , to Brian Henson , Brian Froud and Terry Jones ( of Monty Python fame ) .The more observant among you might also notice George Lucas lurking behind the camera in one scene , and Star Trek fans will get a kick out of seeing Cheryl ' Gates ' McFadden earn her ' Dancing Doctor ' moniker .There 's a lot of on - set footage with Bowie rehersing the various song and dance numbers , some amusing scenes of Henson trying to direct the baby and a group of chickens , and footage of some of the amazing puppets and animatronics created for the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Journey Through the Labyrinth : Kingdom of Characters ( 00:27:58 SD ) : This featurette features interview footage with Brian Henson , Brian Froud , George Lucas and a number of the film 's puppeteers .They discuss the creation and operation of all of the major puppets , from Ludo and Diddimus , to the junk lady and the giant robot .There 's also some exploration of the metaphors used to explore Sarah 's journey from adolescence to adulthood .Journey Through the Labyrinth : The Quest for Goblin City ( 00:30:04 SD ) : In this featurette Brian Froud , George Lucas , Brian Henson , Gates McFadden and some of the crew explore the origin of the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "BD - Live : The usual Sony BD - Live link is included , but as with most of their titles it 's just features a load generic trailers rather than anything specific to Labyrinth .Overall .Labyrinth is n't my favourite eighties movie , but it was still a part of my childhood and as such it will forever have a place in my heart .It 's been some time since I last sat down to watch the film , but that allowed me to approach this review from a relatively fresh perspective .The flaws are more apparent when viewed through adult eyes , but I still found the film entertaining and the wonderful production design and enchanting creatures are as impressive as ever .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
