{"text": "What makes a bad movie enjoyable ?The Conversation is exactly what it sounds like : two or more Dissolve staffers chatting about a specific film or film - related topic , and inviting readers to come weigh in .Looking back , there was a lot of blurring between those categories .I think we picked up TNT Jackson , my first exposure to the blaxploitation genre , because it looked weird .But by the time the movie was over , we felt like we 'd seen something kind of awesome , and that kicked us off on a long stretch of watching blaxploitation films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There are a lot of factors that make a terrible film fun to watch , but I 'd argue that the primary one is the company in which you see it : For most people , bad - movie watching just is n't as much fun as a solo activity .It 's a shared experience in \" Can you believe what we 're seeing here ? \" Here 's my evidence that it is n't just age : When I was in college , I had no interest in deliberately watching schlock .College was where I discovered great cinema , and I bonded with other film fans over our self - piloted film education .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But as I 've gotten older , that sense of youthful urgency over seeing all the great films has faded somewhat , and I 've come to appreciate the joys of terrible movies as party fuel .Over the past few years , I 've even had a little Crap Cinema Club spontaneously form around me , to my surprise .( Hi , Kevin , Noah , and Sarah !CCC for life ! )With that in mind , I 'll say that yes , you are missing out on some glorious bad movies of recent vintage : One of my favorite \" watch this with friends \" experiences of the last decade was M.

{"text": "I 'd be there faster than you could say , \" Wait , is Frankenstein 's monster wearing a hoodie ?\" This is surely why a list of bad movies that became cult classics ( Plan 9 From Outer Space , Road House , The Room ) is also a list of midnight - movie favorites ; because midnight movies , no matter their quality , are a communal experience .Nobody 's favorite midnight movie is the one they saw alone in a quiet , reverent theater ; it 's the crazy oddity they enjoyed while passing around a bottle of cheap champagne someone smuggled into the theater .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Besides Frankenstein 's monster in a hoodie , obviously .Keith : Quotability has to figure into it , right ?Cheapness does n't hurt .A film where the seams show is innately more hilarious than one a slick one .( Now , even the worst films that see wide release more often feel deadeningly professional rather than endearingly slapped - together , which has made this sort of film something of an endangered species of late . )Outr\u00e9 performances certainly do n't hurt .Without the over - the - top acting of Judge Reinhold , Nicolas Cage , Marissa Tomei , and others , Zandalee is just another early-'90s erotic thriller .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Plan 9 From Outer Space , the Wicker Man remake , Kiss Meets The Phantom Of The Park -they all drip with a seriousness that suggests the filmmakers thought they were creating masterpieces .A lot of bad films have a noticeable gap between their ambition and their execution , but in a really great bad film , that gap is immense , and the creators often do n't seem to realize that they did n't bridge it .The more ambition a bad film has - the more the filmmakers are trying to do something really huge and daring - the more likely that it 'll be daring enough to be entertaining .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Films like The Apple , The Forbidden Zone , Death Bed : The Bed That Eats , Zardoz , The Room -they're all so much fun because they 're so phenomenally weird , with nothing following logically or sensibly from what came before .An ordinary bad film is boring and draggy ; a great one keeps surprising the viewers .Matt : I 'm not sure anyone has ever described a good - bad movie better than Susan Sontag 's definition of camp from her famous 1964 essay on the subject .\"The essential element , \" she said , \" is seriousness , a seriousness that fails . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Anyone can churn out mediocre trash ; Hollywood aims low dozens of times a year , and most of the results are not worth wasting time on .As Tasha says , it 's ambition that separates the wheat from the chaff .The thing that guys like Edward D. Wood Jr. and Tommy Wiseau have in common ( besides embarrassing filmographies ) is that passion to communicate something profound .Okay , so maybe their execution leaves something to be desired .They 're still trying really hard .The filmmakers who reach for something far beyond their grasp are the ones that wind up producing bad movies that exceed their flaws .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Tasha : Well , the ambition to be funny is still an ambition .In theory , what makes a film \" bad \" is the gap between intention and execution , so I 'd like to think a comedy can be so bad at what it does that it becomes hilarious .( And no , that does n't wrap it all the way back around to good .I think we all have some idea of the line between unintentional and intentional comedy . )But at the same time , I ca n't think of a single pure comedy that hits the great - bad - movie sweet spot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Because the more I think about it , the more I think a great - bad film is one that fails so much at doing whatever it 's trying to do that it perfectly becomes its own opposite .My absolute favorite terrible films ( The Happening , for instance ) are failing so hard at being serious and scary that they become laughable .But a film that fails really hard at being funny is more likely to be boring than accidentally grave and serious .( Dragon Wars is a hilariously fun terrible movie with some fairly well - managed dinosaurs - vs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But a film ca n't do tragedy well without deflating the mood entirely .Real , believable suffering takes the fun out of laughing at a bad film .The experience of laughing at a bad movie is predicated on schadenfreude and contempt , both of which are hard to maintain in the face of characters you actually care about , or feel for .That suggests to me that seriousness - whether it comes from competent drama direction , or incompetent comedy direction - is more than the fragile great - bad movie experience can sustain .Matt : If a horror film scares you , is n't that a \" good \" horror film ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'd have a hard time saying a horror film that terrified me is so bad it 's good .The question of so - bad - they're - good comedies is a tougher one .I 'm racking my brain trying to think of one , but nothing 's jumping out .Maybe it is the fact that comedies rarely have the sort of grand ambition that defines most camp classics .Their aims are smaller , and their failures are too .Tasha 's formulation that good - bad movies attain greatness by achieving the opposite of their intended effect seems plausible to me in this context , because there 's nothing more tragic than an unfunny comedy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
