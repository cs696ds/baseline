{"text": "For one thing , think about the case where you think E is not strong enough evidence for p , because there is a just realistic enough alternative explanation for E , but your ( apparent ) peer is simply dismissive towards these alternative explanations .He ( and it 's easiest to imagine this is a ' he ' ) says that only a crazy sceptic would worry about these alternatives .The equal weight view now says that you should firmly believe p , and agree that worries about the alternative , although coherent , are inappropriate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( Nor does it seem rational , which might be why we never see much discussion of the equal weight view 's use in dismissing seemingly legitimate doubts . )For another , think about things from the perspective of the irrational agent .For example , consider a case where a rational agent 's credence in p is 0.8 , and an irrational agent 's credence is 0.2 , and antecedently they regarded each other as peers .I say that both of them should move to a credence of around 0.8 - or maybe a touch less depending on how strong a defeater the irrational agent 's judgment is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
