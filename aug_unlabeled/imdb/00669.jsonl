{"text": "Credits .It 's all there in the title : Day for Night , or La nuit am\u00e9ricaine .Taking a cynical attitude , one could assume that the title is pointing to a certain \" phoniness \" inherent to the medium : film is always marked by the tinkering of post - production and can never be an accurate reflection of reality .Even the cinematic artifacts that purport to be reality - investigative documentary , IMAX nature movies , the latest YouTube sensation - are all suspect of being altered by editing , coloring , audio manipulation , digital effects and multiple takes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Instead it is an effusive but sober love letter of a film , and its title speaks to the magical exoticism of the seventh art form .Day for Night depicts a film crew setting up in Nice to produce a mid - sized romantic drama about family and infidelity .As a movie about moviemaking , it observes the confusion , calamities and couplings that occur on the average film set .Truffaut himself co - stars in the large ensemble as Ferrand , a half - deaf director with an exterior fa\u00e7ade of total composition but an interior plagued by insecurity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His character here , Ferrand , does n't meet his lead actress , Julie , until the day she arrives on set .Played by real life movie star Jacqueline Bisset , Julie is a mentally fragile beauty who recently walked off another production following a psychological breakdown .The casting of Bisset , an Englishwoman , offers insight into the need for foreign productions to hire commercially viable actors , even at the expense of efficiency - a practice common during the 70s and reflected in Truffaut 's Fahrenheit 451 .There 's a marvelous moment in which we hear Julie 's internal reflection that she 'll have to practice her French after shooting her first scene .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He also has to deal with the petulant young actor Alphonse , played by Jean - Pierre L\u00e9aud .Like Bisset , L\u00e9aud 's casting is another bout of self - reflexivity , as L\u00e9aud played Truffaut 's most famous character , Antoine Doinel , in The 400 Blows and beyond .His portrayal of a wishy - washy actor pays homage to the fickle Doinel that accelerated the careers of both him and Truffaut .His casting in Day for Night could have been a crass wink - wink if L\u00e9aud was n't such a fine actor .As for plot , we have Alphone 's misguided love affairs , first with disinterested script girl Liliane and eventually with Julie , as well as Ferrand 's battle to keep everything on schedule . , and the sudden death of a beloved and essential cast member .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The opening five minutes of Day for Night alone are so densely packed with filmmaking minutiae that it might inflict a migraine upon the unsuspecting viewer .But anyone who has ever toyed with the idea of becoming a filmmaker - even for a second - should seek out Day for Night as soon as possible .The film explicitly illustrates the complexity of the process of filmmaking and the madness of the industry to which it belongs .In an interview on the DVD special features , film theorist and historian Annette Insdorf notes , \" there were plenty of movies about movies before Day for Night and have been far too many since .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But even though this niche genre is in a sense oversaturated , Truffaut 's film sets the standard for its ability to capture both the sheer joy and the melancholy of filmmaking .The balance between adoration and expos\u00e9 is so delicate that the only film to come close to matching this kind of unconditional love of cinema is Frank Oz 's Bowfinger .Like Truffaut , Oz captures the unrivaled excitement of making a movie , even of one of questionable repute , as well as the level of conniving involved , qualities that lead both films to walk the fine line of simultaneously exalting and dispelling the magic of cinema .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The problems begin and I aim lower .I hope to make the movie , period .\" Day for Night is one of Truffaut 's funniest films with plenty of his trademark rapid dialogue and his ability to navigate from broad set - ups into specific punch lines .The wrong door sequence is emblematic by showcasing not only the broad conceit of the same mistake being made multiple times but also the humor and poignancy in the different reactions of the various crew members .It 's also one of his most joyous films .Few sequences in all of cinema match the ecstasy of the score - only sequences in which we see the film - within - the - film coming together .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's hard to imagine Truffaut making a movie about movies that is anything other than an unabashed love letter to the art form .Two Undercover Angels .But the reason I like looking at Franco 's non - horror films is that , within the realm of horror , and certainly within the more narrowly defined realm of European horror , there is already a lot of incompetence and weirdness and a tendency to abandon logic .So the fact that his horror films are often so weird , and more times than so awful , really is n't all that impressive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In other words , a weird horror film is just another weird horror film , but a weird spy or caper film seems much weirder because it does not take place in that bizarre world of horror where the bizarre is the point of the genre .Instead , you have to deal with Franco 's weirdness as applied to a more recognizably real world ( or as real as the world of spy films ever is ) .Granted , Eurospy films are packed with weirdness and nonsense , but they are also rare and often obscure even to fans of the genre , where as the weirdness of most horror films is a mainstream given .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "If you worry about anything else , the film gets increasingly incoherent .Of course , if you ever go into a Jess Franco film expecting it to be the least bit coherent , you 're going to be sorely disappointed and horribly confused .And even if you do pare this film down to a comprehensible high concept , what you have left is still pretty daft .Actually , I only have the vaguest of ideas regarding what Interpol actually does .I 'm an American , and we 're protected by Walker Texas Ranger , Dog the Bounty Hunter , and Jack Bauer , so we do n't need Interpol .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So for all I know , Interpol 's mission is n't to arrest terrorists or combat piracy , and they really do spend the whole day tracking down missing go - go girls and helping out Jackie Chan .It occurs to me , in fact , that everything I think I know about Interpol has come from the Kommisar X films and Jackie Chan 's Police Story III : Supercop .And now Two Undercover Angels .So yes , Interpol 's mission in the world is to find missing models and go - go girls , slap dames on the bottom , drink cocktails , and put Jackie Chan in a giant metal ring and roll him around a warehouse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "For my money , you never need a real reason for inserting random striptease and go - go dancing scenes into a movie .Any movie .Also , ninjas .Two Undercover Angels is pretty solidly packed with go - go stripteases , all of which are set in that magical nightclub that exists in every Jess Franco film .Much of the second half of the film seems to play out in such a setting , when we 're not on the beach watching Diana 's boobs fall out of her bikini while some guy dressed as either a gaucho or a gondolier plays the guitar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In Jess Franco 's universe , nothing has to make sense , and everything is accompanied by a snappy cocktail jazz score .So while I may not want to watch many Jess Franco films , I certainly would n't mind living in one .Speaking of sense , the plot of Two Undercover Angels starts to make less and less of it as things progress .We soon learn that the Red Lips themselves , specifically Regina , may be the true target of the mad artist and his hirsute companion .When the final credits role , you may have no idea what just happened , but like a wild night out drinking and carousing with beautiful women , you 'll still know you had a good time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Not coincidentally , this is the era in which he was involved primarily in making crackpot spy and caper films .Also nestled in there quite nicely is Kiss Me , Monster , which also features Regina and Diana as the Red Lips on another assignment that makes even less sense than this one .Most of these films contained at least some air of the 60s spy craze about them , though few of them could really be considered actual spy films .His work is tangential to the spy film , most of the time , possessing many of the trappings but never being flat - out espionage thrillers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the end , they simply play out like unrestrained comic books .Franco 's direction on Two Undercover Angels is a microcosm of everything that is good and bad about Franco .And Franco does have moments of brilliance , which is why he 's such a hard director to write about .I 'd liken him in some ways to Lucio Fulci .Both directors , when they were on their game , could create incredible images .If you simply took stills or small passages of film , it 's easy to see how truly inspired some of their visions were .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Franco often operated without any sense of self - restraint whatsoever , which is why there 's so much good stuff in his films , but is also why there is so much tedious , mind - numbingly awful stuff .It 's in the editing , in particular , that Franco most often fails .His scripts are nonsensical but often fun , especially within the realm of his spy and caper films .His cinematography is often quirky , but it 's also full of interesting angles and framing and bright , vibrant colors .But the editing !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Franco never saw a mundane process he did n't like documenting in its entirety .So you get a lot of scenes of people walking and walking ... and walking .Or sitting .Or doing other things that just are n't interesting to watch .I think his spy films like Two Undercover Angels are much better edited than his horror work , much of which I find unwatchable .In fact , Franco 's A Virgin Among the Living Dead has the honor of being one of only two films I turned off and have never bothered to finish watching ( the other is the Japanese film Casshern , and Ultraviolet came pretty damn close ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Two Undercover Angels boasts all of Franco 's negative traits , but hey seem far less noticeable in the film this campy and playful than they do in his drearier horror films .If I had to compare it to anything else , I would say it sports an attitude similar to the later Matt Helm films starring Dean Martin .They ai n't all that good , but ya ca n't help but love 'em .Well , I ca n't , anyway .Franco is helped in delivering a fun movie by the cast , who all perform admirably .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Franco had recently worked with her on the film Succubus , and liked her performance so much that he immediately set about making another film to feature her .I do n't know if she ever played the muse the way Soledad Miranda , and later Lina Romay , did for Franco , but he has a long and steady history of building whole periods of filmmaking around a single leading lady .Reynaud already had several Eurospy films tucked into her dayglo bell bottom jumpsuit , including Mission to Caracas , Special Code : Assignment Lost Formula , Agente Logan - missione Ypotron , and Mission Casablanca .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She also appeared in a couple saucy sexploitation films from Max Pecas , as well as the superb Sergio Martino directed giallo The Case of the Scorpion 's Tale .She seems to disappear almost entirely after 1973 , though I do n't know the reason .Her work in Two Undercover Angels is exceptionally enjoyable , though , played with a wink and a quick kiss , but never annoyingly so .She 's joking around , but she 's also being friendly and warm about it .Her co - star , Rosanna Yanni , looks kind of like a transvestite sometimes , but I do n't hold that against her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Unlike her Two Undercover Angels co - star , Yanni would continue working well into the 80s , and still makes the occasional appearance .Although she looks a little mannish here , she 's still an able performer , and more than willing to do at least half a dozen scenes where Morpho sneaks up and grabs her from behind .She has great chemistry with Reynaud , and while only in a Jess Franco film could these two ditzy dames ever successfully solve baffling international crimes , both Yanni and Reynaud are likeable and , within the context of this loopy film , perfectly believable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's even a bit of moustache twirling , just in case you were worried .The show really belongs to Yanni and Reynaud , and to Franco 's elaborately staged go - go striptease sequences .Everything else , including most of the plot , is superfluous , at best , and most of the time it just gets in the way .The Red Lips detectives made their first appearance in 1960 , in a black and white Jess Franco film called , simply , Labios Rojos , starring Suzanne Medel and Ana Castor as Christina and Lola respectively .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's the pair of 1969 films starring Yanni and Reynaud that define the concept , for anyone who would happen to have a definition of such concepts , that is .Franco would resurrect the Red Lips during the 70s , in two fairly awful films starring Lina Romay , and although I love Lina , those films possess none of the charm of the 60s films , but do contain all of the really bad attempts at comedy .Of course , a positive review of any Jess Franco film has to be issued with some serious caveats .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If your most outre experience with spy or private eye films is You Only Live Twice , then it 's unlikely you will get much out of Two Undercover Angels .Wading through the copious amounts of nonsense , bad comedy , and offbeat pacing is more than the average film fan will endure .If you watch a lot of Eurospy films , however , you 're a little bit better suited for watching Two Undercover Angels and enjoying it , because you 'll be accustomed to quirky spy films with crazy fashion and convoluted plots .Similarly , if you waded into the sillier waters of spy films from other countries - Black Tight Killers from Japan , for instance , or Dino 's Matt Helm films - you 'll probably be better suited to roll with a film as oddball as Two Undercover Angels .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The lack of blood , coyness about nudity ( there is some , but it 's mostly flashes and teasing ) , and overall light - as - a - feather mood of the film might put them off .I mean , Morpho has bad facial hair , and may even qualify as a monster , but that 's not much .I really enjoyed Two Undercover Angels , though .It 's fun and completely weird .It has major flaws , as most Jess Franco films do , but I find them pretty easy to ignore when everything else bops along so breezily .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
