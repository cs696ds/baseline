{"text": "Rubens was a great , great , great supporter of Caravaggio and Rubens took Caravaggio paintings to the low countries .So there 's an absolute straight line of influence .Without Caravaggio , the whole of Dutch painting would look utterly different .I mean , if you look at , for example , portrait -- such as his portrait of the Maltese knight , Martelli , it is a late Rembrandt portrait painted 50 years before Rembrandt had dreamed of his own style .GRAHAM - DIXON The drama , the lack of decorum , the cutting through of the ordinary sort of as it were well - mannered rules .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Without Caravaggio , there 's no Spanish painting .Think of Ribera , think of Velazquez .Without Caravaggio , French painting would look completely different .Think of Jericho , think of Jacques - Louis David .GRAHAM - DIXON It 's no coincidence that the French Academy in Rome is bang in the middle of where all those Caravaggio paintings are to be seen .His influence is -- you know , Pasolini , Martin Scorsese , his influence has always been deep and profound and immediate and it 's purely through the eye and through the heart .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He never had any disciples .It 's just people seeing his pictures and thinking wow .REHM All right .To Dayton , Ohio .Good morning , Anne .ANNE Hello .REHM Hi , go right ahead .ANNE Hi .So I actually studied art history and teach art history and Caravaggio has always been one of my favorite painters to talk about .So my question is that when speaking of this doubt that Caravaggio had in terms of his faith and religion and God , of course , and how much that may be the reason and the way that he painted his religious subject matter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They look like they 're people dressed up as people acting out a certain scene instead of kind of emanating any kind of divine sense to them .If your guest would have some thoughts about that .GRAHAM - DIXON Well , visually speaking , Caravaggio refuses to have a supernatural imagination .He refuses it .He refuses the language of the Baroque .In a Baroque painting , if a miracle takes place , a fricassee of angels will appear stage left , possibly carrying the Madonna aloft in their arms .Caravaggio does not paint miracles like that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "GRAHAM - DIXON Think of \" The Supper at Emmaus \" in the National Gallery in London .It 's a painting about those who see and a painting about those who do n't see .Everything looks exactly as a normal supper scene might look .Three men are seated at a table .An innkeeper looks on .The innkeeper has his hat on .Two of the men realize that a miracle is taking place .How do they know ?They know because God has arranged things in the form of a shadow play .The innkeeper 's head casts a shadow on the wall behind Christ that gives him a halo .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The fish being the ancient mnemonic sign for Jesus Christ .What Caravaggio is saying is if you had been there at that miraculous moment , would you have seen what was happening in the shadows with the light ?It 's a miracle , but you have to look to see the miracle .It 's not that he does n't believe in the possibility of the miraculous .It 's just that he believes if it were to happen , things might look almost exactly as they do right now .REHM Thanks for your call , Anne .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Good morning , David .DAVID Good morning .I 'm not sure what I love more , Caravaggio 's work or the stories of his life .I have a technical question .REHM Go right ahead .DAVID I have read that Caravaggio made use of , oh , it 's sometimes called a camera obscura or some kind of projection methods onto canvas which he traced and then painted .Can the author verify that ?Has he found any evidence of that ?GRAHAM - DIXON Sure .It 's a red herring .It 's not true .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are -- there 's evidence to suggest when you look at Caravaggio 's work that he may have been interested in lenses and in the kind of images that lenses can produce .Galileo who experimented with lenses was a fellow guest , if you like , at the Palazzo Madama .Galileo would probably have known Caravaggio because they were both being supported by Cardinal Del Monte who was a great patron of the arts and the sciences .GRAHAM - DIXON However , it would be entirely wrong to think that Caravaggio composed and created his scenes using a camera obscura .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact , the invention of chiaroscuro , which he invents so brilliantly and uses so brilliant , it 's entirely done in order to get away from a narrow focused realism .It enables him to throw everything that he 's not interested in into darkness and merely to spotlight those whose faces , those whose emotions he wants us to see .You try doing with a camera obscura , you 'll see how surely difficult it is .GRAHAM - DIXON And my clenching evidence is that when the landlady who locked him out of the house for smashing a whole in the roof of the house , when she did that , she was obliged by law to have an inventory taken of everything that he owned .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Obviously he was n't much of a cook .But he definitely did not -- this list goes on and on and on and on .It 's incredibly detailed .He had a pair of eagles wings .He had a capuchin robe .He had five large unfinished paintings .But he did not -- and this inventory list was very conscientious .He did not have an enormous lens driven contraption ... .REHM Yeah .GRAHAM - DIXON ... for the posing of models .So I think it 's absolutely just not true .But , you know , there 's as it were an element of something about the supposition that is n't totally mad , but it 's not actually true to answer your technical question .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To Battle Creek , Mich.Tom , good morning to you .TOM Oh , good morning , Diane .My wife in her office has a beautiful reproduction of a Caravaggio work .I believe it 's titled \" Flight into Egypt .GRAHAM - DIXONYeah .TOM And I 'm wondering if your guest could perhaps shed some light on the story behind that painting so that I could share that with my wife who 's working diligently right now .GRAHAM - DIXON Right , right , right , right , right .Well , it 's an early picture .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's one of two in the Doria Pamphilj Gallery .And it shows this beautiful angel coming down .And Joseph ca n't see the angel , but Mary is aware of the angel .And it 's just this very , very beautiful depiction .It 's a very soft , sweet , early Caravaggio .It 's in many respects a rather uncharacteristic picture .It 's untroubled by questions of religious doubt .GRAHAM - DIXON I mean , in a sense it 's not one of the pictures that electrifies me , but I do love it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And there 's this lovely sense I think of Caravaggio does always make it real and you feel that family aura .Or a family of refugees , you know , with their bare feet and the way that they 're nestling against each other , you can almost feel the cold .REHM Does that help , Tom ?TOM Yes .REHM Does that help ?TOM Yes , it did .It certainly does .It is a very charming painting and we both came upon it actually at an exhibit of reproductions of Caravaggio which was at Loyola University , Loyola University Gallery in Chicago .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "And it is very obsessing .GRAHAM - DIXON And I did find it obsessing when I finally realized , I told my publisher I would n't be able to solve the mystery of his death .I did n't feel I would be able to do that .But I was just gon na leave it open .And then one night just at the end , it 's 3:00 in the morning and I was sitting there .And I 'd been looking at the dates of some correspondence and I suddenly realized that in the dates lay the answer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And I realized exactly what had happened to Caravaggio .And I did -- without out being too sentimental about it , I was probably tired and overwrought , but I did shed a few tears .
