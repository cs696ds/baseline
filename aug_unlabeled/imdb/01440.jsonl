{"text": "When the authorities came to shut down the office and take his medical license he had already disappeared .A general practitioner was performing awake breast augmentation in Northern California and advertising it on roadside billboards .Complaints were filed on the basis of the false advertising on the billboards .When some of his patient records were examined the evidence was so damning that he lost his medical license .The ex - wife of one of my patients underwent an awake surgery facelift in Beverly Hills and told him the pain was excruciating .In the 1950s the death rate from anesthesia alone was 1 per 10,000 and more people died from anesthesia than polio .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Since this is less than the rate of death from car accidents the patient has taken a greater risk driving to surgery than undergoing the anesthesia for surgery .General anesthesia remains the most utilized form of anesthesia for all elective cosmetic surgery .Awake surgery is not safer than surgery under general anesthesia when overdoses of lidocaine local anesthesia are given and/or the procedure is performed in a non - accredited operating room that does not contain the requisite safety equipment in case of an emergency .July 22 , 2011 Addition : An Arizona emergency - room physician , certified as an internist , but who had never done a residency in plastic surgery or anesthesiology was convicted last week of murder and manslaughter for the deaths of his liposuction patients .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "A tribunal then restricted the license of the doctor so he is now prohibited from performing cosmetic surgery .Addendum July 18 , 2012 : Today I received a notice from a group of non - plastic cosmetic surgeons ( academy ) advertising a course for doctors to learn how to do abdominoplasty under local anesthesia alone .The whole premise is unsound because the vast majority of these patients require suture tightening of the midline abdominal muscles .You can not get adequate anesthesia under local alone to do this and you can not get effective tightening without first paralysing the patient .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
