{"text": "Anyone remember this show ?I seem to remember the intro having the train - car traveling amongst some barren mountainous terrain .I seem to remember that each section of the car - train had a different purpose , like the medical car , and the weapons car , etc . .And that 's about all I can remember .I do n't think it ran for more than a season , possibly not even completing a full season .Was this animated ?Live Action ?In English ?Any details you can provide will help .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hey guys ... this was clearly a story - ident question , even if the new user did n't know to tag it that way .Cool it with the VTC , it 's uncalled for . -John O Mar 4 ' 14 at 4:07 .@JohnO VtC : duplicate is valid for story - identification as well , as far as I know ( although not entirely uncontroversial ) .I do n't know if that was the original reason for the V'stC , though . -SQB May 28 ' 14 at 10:24 .4 Answers 4 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In their hi - tech RV , the titular Ark II , they study the land and help out those in need .Note : If it is n't \" Ark II \" either , could you try and describe the show a little further ?For example , what did the cast / crew look like ?What was the colour of the vehicle ?Any extra information would be really useful !I 'm thinking yours is the correct answer ... the asker mentioned jumpsuits .Good answer . -John O Mar 4 ' 14 at 15:05 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But with the additional info , yeah , \" Ark II \" might be the one .Have my doubts though .I mean , how does one forget a talking chimpanzee ? - rumandwrite Mar 4 ' 14 at 15:28 .This is almost certainly The Highwayman .It was another cheesy Glen Larson series from the late 1980s or so , and depicted two quasi - law enforcement officers who drove trailer trucks that ( I kid you not ) could convert into helicopters .One of them had this ridiculous Australian accent , but I am uncertain if this was just acting or if he was someone famous from that continent or whatever .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It was on US television , and I do n't remember any accents , so I am guessing it was American .I 've been googling for a while now , and the closest thing I came up with is the \" Mammoth Car \" from Speed Racer .It was very much like that , except not animated .At least I think that 's what I remember .I saw \" The Highwayman \" in my Google searches , and I do n't think that 's what it was .This is driving me nuts .Making me question my sanity and my memory .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "David Mar 4 ' 14 at 4:10 .It was only the one actor with the accent ... like I said , it was a Larson show ( Battlestar , Knight Rider ) .This is it .Go watch one and you 'll be convinced . -John O Mar 4 ' 14 at 4:13 .Oh snap , I remember that show !Well I never watched it but I recall it being made fun of somewhere along with Manimal ( which I 've also never seen ... man , maybe I should watch those shows ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "@22ndCenturyFza This was about on the level of Manimal ... even as a 13 yr old it seemed kind of stupid .A science - fiction - starved 13 yr old . -John O Mar 4 ' 14 at 4:47 .Yeah .I 'm pretty sure that 's not it .I seem to remember the occupants of the \" mammoth car \" were a crew , not a single guy .And they were less \" Mad Max \" and more futuristic jump - suit kinda garments . shrug Regardless , thanks for the link .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is the Overlander from Terrahawks .It 's function is \" an automated all - terrain vehicle similar to a rail - free train with multiple , articulated sections that brings supplies to Hawknest . \"( Wikipedia ) .I remember exactly that TV Show and still looking for it .The Train was actually composed of a pickup truck that connected to the trailer and could be removed to use just as a normal vehicle .Think the main character was someone like Dolph Lundgren and i believe he was from the future and used to hide the trailer so no one could see it ( kinda in a back to the future way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
