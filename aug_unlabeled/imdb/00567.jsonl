{"text": "Before going to work for Troma , Gunn received a creative writing MFA from Columbia .He purportedly tried to write Tromeo and Juliet in iambic pentameter before giving up , which is just the sort of unnecessary yet amusing formal constraint that an MFA student would attempt .There 's a smattering of actual Shakespeare in the film , and used sparingly it 's oddly effective .The meet - cute between our heroes culminates in a touching recitation of the \" holy palmer 's kiss \" exchange .The couple spins on a Lazy Susan in front of a chintzy backdrop of stars , and the camera rotates in space , and for little money and textual faithfulness , Tromeo and Juliet captures the vertiginous joys of love at first sight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "As Tromeo spends a lonely night looking at pornographic CD - ROMs , he cries as he climaxes over a fantasy of domestic bliss , repeating \" I love you \" as he hyperventilates .Later in the film , Juliet is so taken with her passion for Tromeo that she dials a phone sex line , her operator played by the morbidly obese and dispassionate Michael Herz .Herz sends her into ecstasy while he , bored and possibly hungry , eyes a Famiglia pizza box on his desk .That ugly yet honest desperation is all over the place in Super , with Rainn Wilson and Ellen Page as two psychotic and lonesome goofballs looking for approval and acceptance , sublimating their desire through grim vigilante justice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Tromeo and Juliet could technically be counted as Gunn 's first work as a director .According to an interview on Gunn 's official website ( not updated since December 2012 ) , he associate directed the film while Troma 's leader Lloyd Kaufman was the credited director .In an odd inversion of job duties , Kaufman handled the camera and the extras while Gunn got to work closely with the actors and supervise sets and special effects .If Gunn 's fingerprints are on the performances like the screenplay , he gets a good amount for what he had , which was very little .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The best performance , however , is William Beckwith as Cappy Capulet .He vamps around , devouring scenery , shooting stuff with his crossbow , and he plays his role like Robin Williams on crack trying to be Shakespearian .Beckwith was a \" real actor \" ( i.e. , SAG ) , so he worked on Tromeo and Juliet under a pseudonym in order to get around union rules .Comparing Tromeo and Juliet to later Troma films like Terror Firmer and Poultrygeist : Night of the Chicken Dead , there seems to be a shift in overall tone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That tension might be present in Tromeo , with the younger Gunn 's writing merging with but ultimately succumbing to the sensibilities of Kaufman .At least the scenes are tasteful for Troma , for what that 's worth .I tend to come back to the idea of misfit love stories since those are the best kinds of romances and the most meaningful .Rather than having two lovely people just like everyone else , the misfit romances have two oddballs against the world .That sense of opposition is obvious here in Tromeo and Juliet ( even in the snotty and youthful demeanor it projects ) , though maybe it 's also what 's at play in Super and Guardians of the Galaxy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "So the idea of Joss Whedon gathering together all his favorite actors and making my favorite Shakespearean play into a movie was better than almost everything ever .It 's easy to report that Shakespeare 's writing still stands the test of time , and a pleasure to report that Whedon has put together a fantastic interpretation of the play .Shooting entirely in black and white and in his own home over the course of a week in what the cast has basically described as a party , Whedon creatively interprets Much Ado About Nothing into a darker and more sexually charged story than we 're use to .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'll eschew plot description since you should already know the classic tale of absurd misunderstanding and quick witted dialog .In case you were confused there 's plenty of great lines here that are still hilarious despite having been written many , many years ago .Whedon imbibes them with new life , however , turning even some of the most banal scenes into either comic wonders or powerhouse dramatic sequences .There are some seriously impressively done scenes throughout the film that lend a new depth to the play and a bit of fun .It helps that the cast is clearly having a blast .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Most of the cast does admirably , though for some it 's pretty clear that Shakespeare is n't their forte .The most surprising successes are Fran Kranz , who busts out of his typecast nerdiness into a surprisingly strong romantic lead ; and Nathan Fillion , who is beyond hilarious in his role as a bumbling police office .Acker and Denisof are also perfectly matched as the constantly bickering Beatrice and Benedick .The most disappointing is Sean Maher who does n't seem to get comfortable with the evil Don John until halfway through the film , though he does get one of the best sight gags .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie was shot in a week , andthat is pretty clear .It 's a simple fact that you need a bit more time to get Shakespeare down , especially with the majority of the cast having never performed it professionally .What this leads to is it being very obvious which scenes were shot early and which were shot later .The cast clearly got into a rhythm as the shoot went on and it makes some scenes far better than others .It 's hard to fault them for not mastering Shakespeare right away , and once they do get into a groove and during some of Whedon 's more impressively done scenes , it is easily some of the most enjoyable Shakespeare you 'll see .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What 's obvious here is that Joss Whedon is a great director , Shakespeare is a great writer and if you get a cast together that really clicks you 're going to make a fun movie .While it 's easy to interpret Shakespeare in a variety of ways that I would n't deign to call any version of a play the definitive version , this is definitely one you 'll want to see .Hubert Vigilla : There 's a strange and undeniable joy in Much Ado About Nothing .From scene to scene , from beginning to end , there 's a sense that everyone involved in the production was having a great time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The two couples -- Beatrice ( Amy Acker ) & Benedick ( Alexis Denisof ) , Hero ( Jillian Morgese ) & Claudio ( Fran Kranz ) -- are well cast and serve as solid examples of Shakespeare 's parallelism and contrast when romantic pairs are used .Nathan Fillion bumbles about and steals his scenes when Dogberry arrives .I think my only gripe is that some of the score sounds like it 's from a made - for - TV movie , but even this helps feed into the quick and playful spirit of the film .Much Ado About Nothing is a source of constant delight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
