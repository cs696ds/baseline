{"text": "That means these people sorted the trash .They sorted the compost , recyclables and trash that goes to a landfill .The people talked about how things can be used more than once .In science class the teacher asked the kids if they wanted to volunteer to sort the trash .The people showed us a slide show and one of the slides was the Pacific Ocean .It had a lot of trash .It was the size of Texas .The science teacher asked the students if they wanted to sort the trash and 4 or 5 students helped to sort the trash with the people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Our grade did an earth day web cast .The full time it ran was twenty four hours , but our grade only talked for I think about an hour or two .What we talked about was well earth day of course , and also how the Earth is a great place to live and how we should treat it with some respect , and how it is getting trashed by pretty much everyone on this planet .How this worked was we all had a meeting with our science teacher and she gave us our jobs for the web cast .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When the time came our class went into the science room and started our broadcast .We interacted with our listeners , because people would type in questions into the chat room and they would ask us questions about what we learned .It was very interesting and fun to participate in , I would do that again if I had the choice .Last month , April 22 was earth day .We ( the students of the 7th grade ) did a live webcast about earth day and the changes being done , and that can be done to help save the planet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But the what I thought was the most important to talk about was the landfills .Landfills are just big hills filled with trash that ca nt be reused or recycled .The landfills only last 30 - 40 years !Which means that the landfills that we have now will only last a about 15 more years .Then what do we do with them ?They seal them up and have then covered with grass and dirt to make it look like a field .But there are pipes coming out of the landfills so the methane and other chemical gasses can come out and into the air .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There was one thing that really surprised me on where some plastic is .The North Pacific Gyre .the North Pacific Gyre is a big part of the ocean where plastic just goes around in a circle .Also people wanted to test the Inuits to see if the mothers milk was contaminated .They thought since they eat so healthy and they are far away the it would n't .But they found out that it was the most contaminated .Because they eat seafood like seals , and the seals eat plastic that goes in the water , or that was in the food that the seals eat .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

That 's a lot of toxins that are being let out into the air .The landfills take up a lot of space and also there using up to many resources .Company 's make an item that is good , then they make a better and more expensive one , so you throw out your old one and get the new one .They would destroy the Earth for money .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are people called Freegans .Freegans are people who go looking around in garbage for food that is still good .They sometimes find food that has n't even been open yet .There are three important things to do to help the Earth and they are the 3 R 's , reduce , reuse , recycle .Reduce is the most important out of the R 's .Its the best because you stop using as much and you wo nt pollute the Earth as much .The second most important is reuse .Reuse is the second most important because if you did buy a lot of stuff you can keep using it again and not just once .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You should still recycle even though its not the most important it still helps the Earth a little bit .Kids have a lot of power of what the parents buy .They can use two things , one is called purchasing power which purchasing is having the money to buy it , and the second is called purchasing influence which is where kids nag their parents so much until they finally give in and buy it .Company 's use these things as an advantage for them to sell items .Company 's put ad 's in movies and on boxes of food and other things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There can be advertisements for many different things other than food .When they put ad 's on boxes of food they could take a famous character from a movie or cartoon then the kids will want that because one of their favorite characters is on the box .The reason this hurts the environment is because the company 's make things that are using up too many resources on things that will be used once .These last two or three weeks were based on the environment and the world leading up to April 22nd , which is Earth Day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They would say all these crazy facts and just put it out that might not even be true .When it was talking about the buying of goods they blame President Bush about how he told everybody in America to go out and shop .And of course , that is n't true it is just the same old people that think it is all our fault that the trash is building up and nowhere to go .I thought and how I always think , \" that it is the people telling us what they think not what we think .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then the people in the video had to blame someone so they blamed the companies of making things so bad .I say , \" the companies are n't to blame because all they want is to make a better product , and that is their job . \"The next thing that we got to do is have another group of helpers come in and pick trash out of our garbage of the last two days .What we did is break the trash into groups Landfill , recyleables , or compost .There was a total of 85 pounds that our school would have thrown away .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "After we did that , we sorted the trash into three bins , one bin was compost , other bin was recycle and the last bin was landfill .After we sorted the trash we had about 25 pounds of landfill trash left .The second thing we did was watch some movies on a lot of different things about the earth .One movie was on the story of stuff which was about buying stuff and then once it breaks to get another .Another was about tv ads and want kids to get their parents to buy things for them and the last one was landfill .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then last we did a webcast for earth day , which i was not here for .Now i will end my story .Thank you for reading .We went to the cafeteria .We looked at our trash .We collected the trash from lunch for two days .There was a lot of trash .There was about 85 lbs of trash total .We opened up the bags and dumped them on the floor .Then we looked for things that we could recycle or compost .Then we weighed the trash that would go to a landfill .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That really surprised me .We did all of that so we could make sure we found everything we could recycle .I liked the activity .Some things that could be recycled are : plastic bottles , plastic containers for yogurt , soda cans , and aluminum foil .Some things that could be composted are : milk cartons , eggs , leftover chicken , and leftover pizza .I learned about how our trash goes to a landfill .They haul all of the trash away in big trucks .I was really surprised at how much we were wasting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Note that we have actually IMPROVED this as we have become more advanced .As far as criticism of the government , at one point they say that government should be symbolized by a tank , because over 50 % of our taxes go to military .There was no source that stated this , and it is semi - common knowledge among taxpayers that most taxes go toward medicare and social security .Also , there is a point where this video says that after 9/11 , Bush told us to shop , and not pray .This is utterly false .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now is n't that a little bit anti - republican ?I will end this paragraph stating that these people thought that there were more unions and company organizations than government organizations in the U.S.This is irrelevant because unions and company organizations have absolutely NO power or influence in U.S. Government .Besides the irrelevant , stupid , and untrue comments made in this video , the actual point of it is to portray us Americans as fat , uncaring , stupid Americans with only one purpose : to shop .This common idea plays on so many stereotypes , it is the equivalent of saying that all Hawaiians wear flowers , coconuts , and leaves for clothes , or all Chinese wear robes , are bald , and spend their whole day in a temple .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The second video we watched centers around consuming children , and how ad companies are poisoning and brainwashing our children into buying buying buying , and how something must be done .First of all , in America the government can not control companies or people , beyond making sure nothing illegal is going on .Any other form of control is communism .So when this video is stating that the government should learn and control companies to make sure they do n't brainwash children .If the government starts to control businesses in one way , then that is the first step to a communist government , along with universal healthcare and one sided videos being shown to children .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Wow , two republican presidents blamed in two videos .Does n't that seem like brainwashing , which these videos are against .Interesting .Here in America , the land of opportunity , it should be the companies ' choice of how to do business , not someone else 's .It is not the government or the advertiser 's job to tell the child or parent what is an actually good product , that is the job of the educated parent .Taking away the rights of companies is standing against everything that this country lives for , and has lived for for almost 300 years , and taking away those rights , forcing companies into how they do business , and what is there business , is pure communism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The main example that is given is the Pacific Gyre .This is basically an area in the Pacific Ocean where there is supposedly a lot of trash .It is also stated that it is as big as two United States .First of all , is this the area in which there is trash to be found , not where there is always trash .This means that there are large gaps and areas where little or no trash can be found .But once again this video is being used to spin the truth into something much worse than it actually is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
