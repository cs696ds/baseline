{"text": "Animals Run Amok Week 2 : Day 1 .Have you ever picked up a movie and thought \" Oh my yes , this movie is speaking directly to my soul !\" You know what I 'm talkin ' bout , Willis : those rare times when reading the plot synopsis can be likened to reading a singles ad and feeling an instant rapport with the person placing the ad-\" What ?You enjoy reading and talking ?So do I !You also dislike ' emotional baggage ' and feel one should save the drama for one 's mama ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" I tell you now , it was all fireworks , the laughter of babies , and little birds flying around my head when I read the plot summary for Bug ( 1975 ) and learned that it 's about big cockroaches .Big cockroaches that can start fires .I read that and immediately suggested that Bug and I meet up for a grande latte half - caff frappucappamochachaiachino somewhere- and this without asking for a photo first !That 's how smitten I was right off the bat .Sadly , my relationship with Bug ended just as most relationships do , whether they begin Desperately Seeking Susan -style or not : with a sad shake of the head and an \" Oh .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , at least we had some fun , though , eh ? \" Like all the best movies , Bug begins with an earthquake .( I assume)- come ...THE BUGS .The bugs waste no time in getting down to business .Within moments of their reaching the surface , Farmer Tacker 's truck explodes .The camera slowly pans from the licking flames to a big antenna - wiggling cockroach and from this the audience can only assume that the bug has started the fire , right ?Right !Before long , fires are popping up everywhere as the bugs set everything ablaze- more trucks go up , a cat is set on fire , and in a moment of wicked total , like , symbolism , we see a burning bush .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "but I think on a deeper level it can also be read as a warning to you skanky types out there to behave , you dig ?See ?Bug is a movie by the people , for the people !At this point in the proceedings of virtually every animals run amok movie , it 's time to meet our resident scientist expert , and Bug is no exception- in this case , Professor Jim Parminter ( Bradford Dillman ) .Parminter heads to the Tacker Farm to study the bugs and quickly deduces a few facts- the roaches start the fires by rubbing their chitinous rear antennae together .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "According to my science calculator , that 's fascinating !The professor continues to study the bugs and wait for them to die ; sometime during the course of his travels between the University and home , however , some of those rascally roaches hitched a ride in his car 's tailpipe .One bug makes his way into the house and sets Mrs Parminter 's hair on fire- on her birthday , even .How tragic .While watching poor Mrs Parminter 's hair smoke and burst into flame , I could n't help but notice that the kitchen she was frantically running around looked awfully familiar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "According to my trivia calculator , that 's fascinating !With the death of his wife at the ... err , flame - shooting rear ends of the roaches , the battle between Parminter and the bugs becomes personal .The grieving biologist goes a little bonkers and holes up in the empty Tacker farmhouse .He stops shaving , stops bathing , and develops a bit of a God complex as he mates a firebug with a regular household cockroach .His experiment pays off and a new super - aggro breed of firebug is born- stronger , faster , better !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's not only the late - night nibbling that makes Parminter think that he 's gone too far in his quest for ... whatever he 's questing for , however .It soon becomes apparent that these bugs are operating with a hive mentality- a super smart hive mentality .From Rosebud to \" You talkin ' to me ? \" to \" She 's my daughter !( slap )My sister !( slap )My daughter !( slap ) \" to \" We 'll always have Paris \" , these moments have made audiences laugh , cry , or simply stare in wide - eyed wonder at the screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Has there ever been anything in the history of ever that 's better than big fat cockroaches scrambling over a wall and spelling out WE LIVE ?I mean , it took Victor Hugo , like , 1500 pages of Les Miserables to say the same thing- those supercockroaches spelled it out in five seconds .Does it not speak to us all ?Do n't we ALL live , man and super flesh - eating fire - starting cockroach alike ?Yes , we do .We ... do .Anyway , Parminter realizes far too late that he 's become a victim of his own hubris .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , there are now flying carnivorous , fire - shooting cockroaches capable of spelling out pithy sayings ! \"Parminter and the Superbugs \" sounds like something from The World of Sid and Marty Krofft , does n't it ?Bug is really unlike any other animals run amok movie I 've seen .Sure , it starts out with a plague of roaches setting the town afire , but it takes a drastic turn in the last half as Parminter gets his experimentation on .Bradford Dillman does a decent job as the professor- he makes the best of some boring material , anyway .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The lack of thrills is all the more depressing when you consider that Bug was co - written and produced by shockmeister William Castle , the man who brought audiences such gimmick - filled funfests as The Tingler and House on Haunted Hill .Do n't get me wrong-I found this straying from the typical animals run amok formula refreshing .In the end , however , I wanted more-I wanted the flying , carnivorous , fire - shooting cockroaches to wreak some havoc , dammit !Just when things were really starting to heat up ( har ) , the movie was over .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
