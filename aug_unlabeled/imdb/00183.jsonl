{"text": "A.K.A. Un gatto nel cervello / Nightmare Concert Directed by Lucio Fulci 93 Minutes ( uncut ) / Screen Entertainment ( U.K./PAL / R0 ) / Unmatted Full Frame .Horror film maestro Lucio Fulci seems to be suffering from some work - related stress .Troubled with horrible visions of slaughter encroaching upon his everyday life ; he seeks the help of a local psychiatrist .The only problem is Fulci 's sick delusions intensify after the twisted doctor hypnotizes him in an attempt to cover up his own nefarious acts .Interesting curiosity that squeezes every last drop of usability out of several prior , mediocre Italian gorefests .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film goes long way to humanizing the director to the viewer .The veneer of the hype and myth is broken down and we 're presented with a \" character \" that most likely is n't too far from reality .There 's something a bit disarming seeing him walking about the famed Italian studio Cinecitt\u00e0 and rural Rome .Fulci 's acting is limited , but he does n't embarrass him either , supposedly stepping in the role after the casted actor could n't for whatever reason .It 's doubtful the film could have worked as well with any other person as the lead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Much of the \" film - within - a - film \" bits barely make sense and there 's many instances of characters being in all - too convenient places .There 's no build to anything , with the latter half feeling like an assemblage of sequences just to fill out the runtime .Yet the film is better than the others it \" borrows \" from and includes the best gory chunks from them .The last bit before the credits is nicely inspired when considering everything Fulci and his work mean to horror fans across the world today .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film ( under the \" A Cat in the Brain \" title ) was effectively banned in the United Kingdom when the board rejected it for classification in 1999 .A mere four years later , the board passed it fully uncut with an 18 certificate under its original Italian title .I guess they actually watched it the second time .Film : 5/10 DVD Picture : 7/10 ( despite some encoding issues , the source is outstandingly film - like ) DVD Sound : 7/10 ( English Stereo ) Giovanni Lombardo Radice .Giovanni Lombardo Radice is an Italian film actor , better known to audiences as John Morghen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I knew of his movies , seen pieces of them , but never really sat down to fully embrace the filmmaker 's offbeat sensibilities and knack for unrelentingly disturbing gore .When it came to Fulci 's 1980 ZOMBIE , it was one of those films I completely overlooked it .In fact , it was n't until the last year that I finally saw the film in its entirety .My loss .Now , the film has been completely remastered in high - definition and it looks better than ever .Storywise , ZOMBIE is a bit of a mess .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "ZOMBIE starts off when a ship floats into the New York harbor containing a big , fat zombie who apparently ate the entire crew and was waiting for lunch to arrive once again .From here , we are introduced to a reporter ( Ian McCulloch ) who wants to get to the bottom of this .The daughter ( Tisa Farrow ) who owned this ship wants to know what 's going on as well - so they travel to the Antilles .There , the undead have risen form the ground and are hungry .The movie 's tagline \" We Are Going To Eat You \" is legendary , as is the iconic zombie from the poster .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes , this is unrated horror that would have earned the movie an X in its time for violence .Yet , even though it 's graphic , it does n't reach the uncomfortable ickiness of the SAW or HOSTEL films .There 's elegance and beauty to the gore especially in the wooden beam to the eye gag .Fulci knew how to make his audience squirm - and this film has endless amounts of squeamish moments .The widescreen transfer also shows off what a great looking film this is .Sergio Salvati does a wonderful job as director of photography - giving the film a much bigger look and scope that most low budget films would kill for .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It has to be seen to be believed .The disc edition imports many special features over from the DVD release from a few years ago .The new stuff though is extensive including a featurette and intro from filmmaker Guillermo del Toro talking about how this is one of his favorite films of all time .There 's a poster and still gallery , theatrical trailers , TV spots and radio commercials .The second disc is packed with interviews with the stars , the screenwriter , the co - producer , the cinematographer and make - up effects people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
