{"text": "The 55 plus make up 32 % of the light cinema goers .These figures do n't cover the international market , although there 's evidence many of these markets operate in the same way , apart from France which is a special issue .You can see this is a young and upmarket audience , surprisingly enough .Within the film industry there is a degree of snobbishness towards the so-\u00ad\u2010called multiplex audiences - I sincerely hope you 're not part of that snobbishness - and therefore there is a feeling that the multiplex audiences are comparatively down-\u00ad\u2010market , which is n't the case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "These clusters are n't giving you enough information .When I was at Film4 , when we were facing the issues around ' what kind of films should we make ' and ' why are films working and not working ' , we set out to look at two things : How do audiences really behave and why ?Are there any possible tools to help filmmakers and distributors in assessing the viability of the project ?This research was done in 2001 but has since been backed up by an equally large piece of research at the Film Council .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We did qualitative research - talking to people .We spoke to some film buffs and very mainstream types , but mainly to general film-\u00ad\u2010goers , people who enjoy a wide variety of films but do n't tend to seek out arthouse or European films .We asked : What activities are more important to you than film ?Men : Music , Drinking , Sport , Socialising , TV .Women : Music , Socialising , Shopping , TV .Younger people : Music , TV , Socialising , Computer Games , Shopping There 's one big note here and that 's music .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We have a very strong music culture in this country , and yet the film and music industry do not align themselves very easily .Actually most famous films usually tend to have a soundtrack attached to them that you can remember - that 's not a PR thing , it 's because they 're working in symbiosis together .I urge you to think about music much more centrally , the music is important .Next : What is it that film represents for people ?For the vast majority of people , except for film buffs , it is satisfying peoples ' unfulfilled desires .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is what it is .It is entertainment .It is all the things that people do not get from work .If we understand that people go to the cinema to fulfil unfulfilled desires , and to be entertained , we need to look at how people choose what they 're going to see .UKFC did a huge piece of research on behalf of the whole industry on this and the biggest thing that came out is that cinema is an event .And since people tend to go to the cinema with at least one other person ( unless you 're a film buff ) , choosing what you 're going to see means you have to negotiate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Often , the choice of film is a compromise .However , people still want to feel the film they will see will give them a peak experience i.e. they will leave the cinema on a high .No one wants to be blamed for choosing a ' bad ' film .Apart from the emotional reasons attached to seeing a ' bad ' film , it can also feel like a waste of money .In a group of friends those films that polarise , are unlikely to be seen -\u00ad\u2010 even if a large minority like them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You do n't want to choose the ' bad film ' , and we all know it 's quite uncomfortable sitting beside somebody who is not enjoying the film as much as you are , unlike a DVD which you can just switch off .There 's a desire to have a shared experience .See the above list - obviously one of the first things is genre , i.e. what kind of film is it ?Here we go back to the clustering principle , which is that clustering is so useful to quickly define what kind of film this is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Oh , I do n't like this kind of film \" or \" I do like this kind of film \" .Then there are some other clues as well : maybe who 's in it , it might be who 's directing , it might be that it 's from a book of some sort of incident or known source .Then there 's word of mouth -\u00ad\u2010 who 's talking about it , what the critics thought or whatever it is , etc .There are quite a lot of pieces of information , not all of which people will have .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "/cont'd ......... 4 .GENRE It 's probably best to note here that we did n't do ' Family ' during our research , we only did ' 18 Up ' .Obviously you can see on the left hand side women are more geared towards romance and the males , obviously , geared towards Sci-\u00ad\u2010Fi .The unifying factor between the male / female divide is comedy .So , a Rom-\u00ad\u2010Com will get a bloke in whereas with a romantic film on its own , you have very little chance of doing that .In order to have maximum appeal films need to appeal to men and women - even if they 're paying attention to different aspects .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'll tell you : DRAMA .Here we stumble across one of the first problems of British Film Industry .Statistically , 60 % of all films made are actually drama .But no-\u00ad\u2010one ever says , \" Let 's go and see this great drama \" -\u00ad\u2010 it 's not said .We say ' Crime ' or ' Gangster ' or ' Horror ' or ' Thriller ' or ' Sci-\u00ad\u2010fi ' , because we get that .That 's why genre is important - not because film people think it is , but because it helps people to describe what they do and do n't like .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Specifically American films are positively associated with : Epic ; Excellent , Exciting , Exhilirating ; Glamour and Style ; Escapism and Fantasy ; Heroic ; Romantic .Most recognise that American films have more resources to deliver what the audience want from a film .Also , American films have helped define expections of what a ' good ' film is , ie high in emotion , visual and entertaining ( contrasting with UK films which are felt to be from a more literary , cerebral , issues-\u00ad\u2010led tradition ) .However , there are perceived negatives , and I have a funny feeling the divide may be widening slightly between America and the rest of the world 's films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We do n't like these kinds of things too much in Europe .My favourite example is the very , very last scene in ' Saving Private Ryan ' where the guy gets hold of an American flag .That 's exactly where the divide lies .What are the positives of British Films ?Characters and Situations I can identify with Either fresh new acting talent or really great actors eg Judi Dench ' British humour is something no-\u00ad\u2010one else can do ' .Authentic and believable : not the ' typical Hollywood treatment ' Intelligent , fresh and original - likely to have twists and turns and be multi-\u00ad\u2010layered Unsentimental , amoral , clever Opportunity to see people who really break the rules .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "At their best , British films are highly believable and easy for the audience to relate to when executed in a way that is funny , clever and sometimes knowing but not schmaltzy and sentimental .Interestingly , British soundtracks contribute a great deal to this .But there are negatives as well : No known faces / same old faces Depressing or grim locations and stories , or period romps Not cinematic , could watch on TV .Lacking heightened emotions and themes , big names , high production values .No real peak moments so do not engender real emotions Moralising and worthy Limited and predictable ( ' either working class or middle class and seem very samey ' ) Cont'd// .................. 6 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So here we have a matrix , where we have the four areas .American positive ones are , let 's summarise , as ' uplifting ' and ' glamorous ' or ' life affirming ' .But their negative is ' schmaltzy \" , ' moralising ' , ' sentimental ' , and ' patriotic ' .You really want to be in the coloured area , not to close to schmaltzy and moralistic .And you probably want to avoid being down in the unglamorous and gritty quadrant which audiences say they 're not that interested in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , Fish Tank took around six hundred thousand pounds , which is , for that kind of film , quite big but in real terms is still very small .Precious was huge in America ( $ 45-\u00ad\u201050 million ) but only made half a million here .But there are also some films , like Trainspotting and Billy Elliott , which on synopsis alone would seem to be down in the unglamorous and gritty area , but which in practice have done something creatively interesting and been successful with UK and international audiences .Perhaps it 's because they 're life affirming , have characters audiences can identify with , but these films became HUGE hits .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And there are plenty of other examples : Full Monty , second biggest British film of all time ( pipped by Mamma Mia ) , and starring the normally unglamorous and gritty Robert Carlyle .East is East - there 's another one .You look at the plotline of that film and you think , ' Christ Almighty ! '-\u00ad\u2010 but it 's the way it 's done .There are other factors which will affect whether people go and see it .For example , if it 's subtitled , you 're going to have a problem with UK audiences because there is a perceived barrier there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of course , that may be fine with you .But your distributor and financiers will know that financially , the potential of the film is extremely restricted .There are some slightly depressing statistics on British film that show how much the industry struggles with these issues : Out of all the 388 British films released in 2000-\u00ad\u20102004 , total box office was \u00a3 572million .The average was \u00a3 1.4 million , with only 21 % taking over \u00a3 1 million , 33 % took \u00a3 100 K -\u00ad\u2010 \u00a3 1 million , and 46 % took under \u00a3 100K. Similarly , of 808 films certified between 1998 - 2004 , only 45 % were released .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Similarly of the 535 films certified between 2003 - 2006 , only 44 % were released - in 2004 the figure was 60 % .THE FESTIVAL TRAP So , this map shows something else , a trap that I think is laid out for filmmakers .And that is , that just because you win at festivals , does n't mean people will go and see your film .So what happens is films like Vera Drake win awards , but this does n't equate to success at the box office .I think film companies gets seduced by this and you , if you 're not careful , start to make films that actually no one wants - ie down the unglamorous and gritty end of things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The problem is that audiences do n't .There really is a disconnect here .Then you 're left and then you 're stuffed and then you do n't understand why nobody 's knocking on your door to make that next film .So be careful of the siren call of awards .Finally , this is something for you to play with .Put your own film , or any film in here and you have 0-\u00ad\u20105 ticks .The more ticks you have in each box , the more fundable and attractive your film is to audiences .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
