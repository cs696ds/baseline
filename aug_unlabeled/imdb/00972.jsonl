{"text": "\u0421omments .Edith Wharton 's novel The Age of Innocence is adapted by , of all directors , Martin Scorsese ... the violent poet of modern - day angst who has wowed audiences with Mean Streets , Taxi Driver , Raging Bull and Goodfellas .The story involves the unspoken emotional repression of a group of 19th - century New York socialites , and the forbidden lusts that threaten to dissolve the rules of society .The material would seem more suited to a stuffy \" prestige - movie \" director like James Ivory , and indeed there are times when Scorsese seems to be in over his head .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps that is why The Age of Innocence has the same tedious , morose tone of most of Ivory 's costume dramas , and fails to be particularly engrossing to the audience .However , there is also material in this story that plays to Scorsese 's strengths .As a director , Scorsese has always been more concerned with creating a world or visually expressing the emotions of his characters than with plot mechanics .With The Age of Innocence , Scorsese has created a visual feast of a movie ... almost literally , since there are many near - fetishistic close - ups of the luxurious food and drink that the socialities enjoy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There comes a point in this film when the theme of emotional repression becomes tedious and downright boring .Daniel Day - Lewis , normally a magnetic actor , can not convey the seething lust or buried curiosity that fuels his character ... he seems like an affable fop who happens to develop a boyish crush on a mysterious countess ( Michelle Pfeiffer ) .Scorsese is usually a director who can effortlessly convey passion and intensity .Here , though , he seems to be so in awe of his ability to re - create a period that he forgets to tell a compelling story ( a similar fate befalls Steven Spielberg in Amistad ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But the one critical flaw of the film is that it has forgotten that a film attempting to convey buried passion should itself be passionately alive .Hearts of Darkness - An interesting , but overlong documentary on the making of Apocalypse Now .There is some great behind - the - scenes footage of the struggles that the cast a crew faced while making the classic war film .Ministry of Fear - A very good noir film from Fritz Lang .Ray Milland is excellent , as always .Chinatown - Roman Polanski 's classic noir lives up to its expectations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Martin Scorsese calls The Age of Innocence his \" most violent film \" and after watching it I can definetly see why .It 's not like Taxi Driver or The Departed , the violence is all emotional pain that occurs between the two main characters when they can not be together because of the social and moral code of the world they lived in .The movie is beautifully shot and the score is great as well .All three of the leads ( Daniel Day - Lewis , Michelle Pfeiffer , and Winona Ryder ) gave excellent and touching performances .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
