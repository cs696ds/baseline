{"text": "Some of my favorite parts of the movie were when Riddick was trying to survive after being left for dead on the planet and when Riddick toyed with the mercenaries that came to collect his bounty .After this the movie became to much like Pitch Black and almost seemed to be copying it .Vin Diesels performance as Riddick is amazing and a good enough reason alone to go see this movie , while some of his co - stars were lacking Matt Nable , Jordi Moll\u00e0 and surprisingly Dave Bautista bring the same quality of acting as Vin Diesel does .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
