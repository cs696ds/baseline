{"text": "Many of these vary by species , and most are used in communication and/or defense .Many ants have a stinger , which they use to puncture the skin or exoskeleton of their enemies and pump poison into them ( after all , ants are closely related to bees and wasps ) .The most painful experience you could have with an ant is getting stung by one .Some can do a little bit of damage by biting ( especially very large ants like Camponotus gigas ) but most ants combine biting with stinging or some other chemical defense when they are hunting or defending themselves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of the most common and obvious of these chemicals is called formic acid .Formic acid is sprayed out of a specialized nozzle at the back end of ants in the subfamily Formicinae .This group of ants contains the most abundant and largest ants in much of Europe ( as well as North America and northern Asia ) .It was the probably the conspicuous , acrid smell of the formic acid from these ants that inspired the Middle English word \" pissemyre .\" The second part , \" -myr , \" ultimately comes from Greek for \" ant \" ( someone who studies ants is called a \" myrmecologist \" ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I still think formic acid smells more like vinegar , but perhaps the Middle English wanted their name to be funnier .As to whether or not formic acid , or any of the other defensive secretions other ants might use would make your skin itchy : I suspect not .I know it does n't make my skin itchy , although it does make me cough if I accidentally inhale it .In fact , a German colleague mentioned that many people in his native Bavaria think that formic acid is good for the skin , and go to somewhat ridiculous lengths to encourage ants to spray them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also , I suppose it is theoretically possible that someone might be allergic to something that ants secrete .However , in practice , I suspect that the majority of people who feel itchy after an ant walks over them are just the victims of their own imagination .I have these ants in my kitchen in West Texas ( Alpine ) .They appear in the evening , have the run of the pantry , garbage , and countertops and seem to disappear during the day .There used to be just a few but now they are everywhere .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Thank you for sharing your observations with us .Ants are really fascinating with elaborate behaviors and what you are observing is hygienic behavior .The ants want to carry away the dead nestmates and dump them somewhere far away from the colony .The reason is simple : If the ant had died from an infection , the risk is reduced that more nestmates will get that infection when the body is removed .In this video you also see a short passage of an infected worker being carried away .Leaf cutter ants and other ant species have special areas where they deposit dead bodies , these areas are basically graveyards .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Interesting observation !I have never seen anything exactly like that .Army ants can stream across a porch for hours , but usually in one or multiple directions .Another possibility is a colony of some other ant that has been flushed from its nest by army ants or somehow disturbed , resulting in an evacuation of the nest .I have seen this , with a large number of workers carrying brood waiting in a group on a big leaf or on a wall ( could be a patio ) .There may be workers on the periphery of the group that are more active , patrolling the border .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "If this would work what recommendations would you make about keeping this setting moist ?Also what would be the best species of ant for a situation like this ?I would want a species that could burrow fairly deep .Thank you for your time .Eric .Dear Eric , Thanks so much for your question !The potentially cool thing about building such a large formicarium is that it is a closer approximation of the amount of vertical space in which some ant species build their nests .In many places the soil in which ants build their nests is not evenly moist , but has different temperatures and levels of moisture at different depths .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Once the colony has matured and the nest has reached a large size , the ants can migrate vertically to find the \" sweet spot \" with the right conditions for storing their food , for example , or raising their young .Ants that live in large nests often have to adjust their positions within the nest depending on when the last rain was , and the time of day .For example , they might move their larvae close to the surface of the ground in the early morning , but then if it becomes too hot , they will move their larvae down lower .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One researcher in particular , Dr. Walter Tschinkel , has studied ant nest architecture extensively .By building a large formicarium , perhaps you 'll be able to make your own observations about how the ants use their space !The one tricky thing is that you 'll probably start out with a very small nest , or even a single queen , so you will need to maintain the correct conditions for the particular place within your large formicarium where the nest begins .This might be easier if you section off a small portion of the formicarium with a substance that can later be removed , or just chewed through by the ants .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A different approach would be to use the cool - looking blue gel sold in the pre - fabricated AntWorks formicaria .This substrate has gained some popularity in large formicaria meant for display , like those shown here .However , there are some anecdotal reports that the substrate does not allow ants to successfully raise their young , in part because , as we mentioned above , ants that build large nests are used to having options .The ants most likely to thrive in this gel might be ants found in environments that are very wet all the time , like tropical rain forests .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
