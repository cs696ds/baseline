{"text": "Then I remember seeing the trailer for this new remake , and hating it .I moved on , putting it out of my mind .It got the 2012 treatment and looked like how you would expect it to look when they rape our memories for a quick buck .Then I was invited to a top secret viewing of the flick .Free .I do n't pass up free stuff .So I went .Figured I would have fun ranting about this movie later .So , let me get this out of the way first .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And that is where I sat with it for a while after I saw it , trying to figure out if I liked it because I had low expectations , or because I truly find it to be actually funny .I have confidently decided on the latter .I was pleasantly surprised by the humor .Yes its essentially a fart joke movie , but .it is a well made fart joke movie , which is n't easy to make .This is n't Norbit .Like the originals , there are well placed jokes , nice set ups and the story mostly moves along at a nice clip .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There is some depth to Moe that we get to see that could have failed miserably as groan inducing but really works here .I was impressed to see some nuanced range .It was just the right touch .What really makes this movie genuinely funny though are all the peripheral characters .Everyone buys in to who they are in this universe and plenty of characters will surprise you .Every single character the Stooges interacted with in even the smallest ways brought something worthwhile to the movie ... just like in the originals .The only real issue I had was I thought they played the Jersey Shore gag too much .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With that said , they used the cast well ( I hate the show ) and even had a hilarious , out of left field Kardashian sisters joke .So the topical stuff was funny , but I feel definitely was n't needed .The greatest respect I can give this movie is it honestly made me feel 10 years old again .I was laughing like a kid .I let go of all the criticisms I thought I would want to give it and just sat back and ENJOYED IT .Ca nt remember the last time I did that with this kind of movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "A faithful homage to a loved comedy group !Hilarious !To go into this movie expecting the original stooges is ridiculous .The Stooges are long gone .Go into this movie expecting a loving tribute to the comedic powerhouse that was \" The Three Stooges \" and you will come out totally satisfied .All three actors are faithful and accurate in their imitation of the beloved characters .( I emphasize \" IMITATION \" because no - one can ever truly replace or replicate the originals . )The actors do a great job bringing the antics of the stooges into the modern day and civilization , while still sticking to the classic roots that made the stooges , \" The Stooges \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There 's some very interesting character development for the character of Moe , something I did n't expect to find in this film .There 's also an emotional depth and a light - hearted silliness that are present throughout the film , something which made the originals so great .There 's a few questionable scenes here or there that do n't quite feel like they fit in the film , but somehow we get the impression that if the Stooges could have gotten away with it back then they would have done the exact same thing .The eye pokes , slaps and head bonks are all the same as you remember .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Farrelly 's obviously put a lot of work and research into the film , and if their goal was to make a film that the original Stooges would be proud of and that would inspire a new generation of Stooge lovers , then they have succeeded .Do n't go into this film expecting it to top the originals .No one will ever come close to them , and the makers of this film understand that .Moe Howard was a man who always believed that the show must go on .When Curly was replaced by Shemp , naturally the shorts would n't be as good as the Curly ones , but they were still great on their own levels .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Moe knew that the golden age of the Stooges was the Moe , Larry and Curly era .That did n't stop him though , he always continued the act , because he knew people needed the Stooges .Do n't think of this film as an attempt to top the originals , that 's just never gon na happen .Look at it was a faithful love letter to the boys , and sit back relax and get ready to laugh like a kid again .Knuck , knuck , knuck , knuck !I 'm a victim of circumstance !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
