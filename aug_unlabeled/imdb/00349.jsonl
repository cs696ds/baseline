{"text": "It stands alone as its own series and truly earns the title of \" essential anime . \"Influenced by , but not based on , the 1982 movie Blade Runner , the series has a very \" future now \" feeling , with futuristic elements and modern - day elements working together to create a believable but fantastic environment for the story to be set in .Facts of the Case .After a devastating earthquake in Tokyo , the Genom corporation steps in and offers the assistance of Boomers , their force of super - strong robots , to handle the repair and rebuilding of the city .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , the Boomers are n't perfect -- far from it .More than a few of the units have gone rogue , mutating physically and mentally until they are holy terrors that leave a bloody trail of destruction behind them .Priss , a popular rock idol by day , is their leader .Priss is athletic , fierce , and usually the blunt instrument that brings down the target Boomer .Nene , a police dispatcher by day , is her backup .Nene is a genius with technology , but she is n't very good in the suit , so she offers cover fire for Priss and hacker technology for the team .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Silia runs a boutique as her cover operation , and is passionately dedicated to wiping out the Boomer threat .Linna is recruited to the team a little later on , mostly because she recognizes Priss as one of the Knight Sabers and follows her , asking to be let in .Linna is strong and gets the hang of the battle armor quickly , but her lack of experience and training holds her back at first .Meanwhile , A.D. cop Leon and his partner Daley are investigating the Boomer menace , and they also notice the steady rise in rogue units .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Leon notices Priss during this conflict ( she is not in battle gear ) and becomes immediately interested in her .He tracks her down at her nightclub and tries to get to know her , but Priss does n't reciprocate his interest .She identifies only with the gruff and distant Nigel , the hardsuit mechanic who appears only when Silia summons him , and who may or may not have something going on with Silia in addition to their professional relationship .Finally , a little brother for Silia is introduced about halfway through this nine - episode set .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He takes to working on the hardsuits right away , and shows quite an aptitude for it .Nigel , who normally works alone , takes the boy under his wing .Silia is having a hard time getting used to Mackie being there with her , and Mackie finds refuge in working with the machinery .He even helps to bring out the implacable Nigel a little in the process .Together , they build a special vehicle for Priss to use , and it is debuted on the fly when she has to hunt down a particularly huge and seemingly indestructable Boomer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I confess that I originally became interested in Bubblegum Crisis because the lead character is called Priss .Until I heard this , I gave BGC a wide berth -- the whole idea of punk riot grrls kicking ass ( in high - heeled battle suits , no less ! ) sounded like animated torture to me .But because I am a die - hard Blade Runner fan my curiosity overwhelmed me , and I had to have a look .To my delight , I enjoyed myself immensely .Bubblegum Crisis was a serious show yet did not take itself seriously .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Much of this attitude is translated to Bubblegum Crisis 2040 .At double the length of the original series , the story unfolds more slowly , taking its time introducing characters and building backstory .The original series was entertaining , and I liked the characters , but I connected with characters more powerfully in BGC 2040 .More important , I understand them better , which makes me care about their fight all the more .In BGC 2040 , Priss is a more grim character who is prone to brooding , and this ends up being the sexiest , most appropriate change of the whole series .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She craves and rejects attention in equal measure , and we understand that this is not because she 's trying to act cool ... she just does n't know any other way to be .Nene , on the other hand , is a confident whiz kid with a bubbly , head - in - the - clouds personality that clashes with Priss in hilarious ways .You would think her clumsiness and lack of athletic ability would get her kicked off the team , but she has an underlying fierceness that explains why she 's still around .At one point , Priss bumps her as she drives by on her bike , and Linna -- outraged by this casual slight -- chases Priss down on foot through a parking garage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The remastered English soundtrack is very pleasing , with nice channel separation and background noise filtering .The 2.0 Japanese and the additional 2.0 Spanish soundtracks also sound good , with good use of stereo sound .Video transfer looks great , with clear and vibrant colors that pop off the screen .Whenever a series has a lot of night scenes , the concern is that the black levels wo n't be deep enough or will readily show age - related wear , but that is not a concern here ; The image looks terrific .There are four voice actor commentaries , as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is not a bad thing , but anyone viewing this series for the first time and wanting to be surprised may want to consider holding off until they have seen the whole run .The good news is that these are very thorough and entertaining commentaries , with much discussion and analysis about the series itself , the history of the BGC franchise , and the character arcs .They also point out some of the in - jokes that animators included in 2040 , such as characters who drink Duff beer ( an homage to The Simpsons ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Very slick .The Rebuttal Witnesses .Fans of the original OAV series may be turned off by the focus on characters and story in BGC 2040 .The original series had a spare , tightly paced story that was heavy on action and conflict but offered very little in the way of character development or motivation .While 2040 also has beautifully choreographed action scenes , they tend to unroll a little more loosely and involve character conflict and interaction more than in the original series .As a result , die - hard fans of the original format may feel that this newer version is a bit slow .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Closing Statement .For anyone who wanted to know just what was going on in Priss 's head , or what Silia 's backstory was , this is the series to watch .With a brand - new transfer and packaging , not to mention a remastered soundtrack and voice actor commentaries , this is an easy choice for your next library addition .The Verdict .The court will turn a blind eye to vigilante activity in this case .Priss and the rest of the Knight Sabers are declared not guilty and are free to continue their work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
