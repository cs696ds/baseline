{"text": "He reasoned out himself by saying that after all Vasihsta is our Guru and he would be more happy in seeing his diciple honoring his word or command rather than him .With this he went ahead with the Yagna in the absence of Guru Vashisht .He only performed required rituals but did not take anything from the YagnaVedi as prasad .Guru Vashisht arrived later some time and was furious about Nimi performing Yagna in his absence .In that spur of the moment he curse him \" Hey Nimi , since you insulted me , you should be dead with immediate effect \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He expected some sort of appriciation for honoring the Time of the Yagna .As he found no fault with him and un - nesscesary curse from Guru Vashisht , he as well gave the same curse to his Guru .The sitiuation was that both of them falling dead were lying on the floor .The kingdom was left without any Raja and Guru which was not possible according to the social and political system of that time .Hence Rishis and Munis of nearby area gathered to make these dead bodies alive .They made Guru Vashisht to wake up thinking that Guru Vashisht in turn will make Raja Nimi alive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Mith is what we refer as Mithya that is illusory .Mith means illusory or that does not exists in reality .Ila means Atman .So Mithila menas a illusion of Atman when there is no real Atman .This qualifies as Physical frame of the Raja Janak that has a Atman of some one else but not its own Jivatmas .hence illusion of Atman .This means that Mithila means Ved Vyas wanted to tell Physical Frame of the Raja Janak .The Guru - Shishya killing each other is nothing but the practice of the YogSadhana regularly done by the Sadhak under the guindence of the Guru .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
