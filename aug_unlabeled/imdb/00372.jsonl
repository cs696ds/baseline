{"text": "Now that Kathryn Bigelow 's verit\u00e9 - style war film , The Hurt Locker , has achieved front - runner status for Best Picture at this year 's Oscars , the publicity for the film has directed renewed attention to the politics of representing war .In thinking about this debate , I 'm less interested in coming to a conclusion about the film 's politics than I am in interrogating the grounds by which we try to determine them .Although it 's tempting to accept the comments from director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal as definitive , it 's also important to place the film against some of the other paratexts - including the DVD itself - that help to define how it will be received .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But I think this reading - based primarily on the artists ' intentions - misses quite a bit .A number of observers , including Jarhead author Anthony Swofford , have argued that no combat film is ever fully anti - war .In fact , although the film details James ' expertise in defusing bombs , he is also seen as making dangerous and often risky choices that endanger himself and his fellow soldiers .And , yes , we fail to see the Iraqi civilians clearly , but that 's partially because the soldiers themselves can not see the Iraqis clearly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And asking every war film to deal with \" the larger context of the American presence in Iraq \" seems to be calling for a political lecture , precisely the kind of film that most audiences have rejected , usually because they are too reductive .In fact , Rieckhoff suggests the film lacks \" respect \" for US soldiers and cites another that calls the film \" insulting \" to the soldiers whose job it is to defuse IEDs .Rieckhoff 's complaints about the lack of realism are certainly hard to dispute , and even without any combat experience , I was well aware that many of James ' actions would have gotten him in trouble with his superiors or , worse , led to him getting shot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This tension regarding cinematic realism was recently addressed by Chris Cagle , who argues that The Hurt Locker 's documentary aesthetic makes us feel as if we are \" watching a slice of historical reality .\" But even with this deconstructionist approach , I 'd argue that the film should instead be read as politically ambivalent , as sustaining both pro- and anti - war readings , and in some sense , that ambivalence depends almost entirely on the \" war is a drug \" theme .In fact , the recognition that war is addictive works because of the adrenaline rush we get vicariously through James , the excitement at saving lives and the thrill of facing life - and - death decisions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film 's realism effect is also complicated by its engagement with the politics of representation , making it an incredibly difficult film to pin down .Update : By the way , Patrick Goldstein addresses the debate over the military response to the film 's accuracy in an interesting post on his Big Picture blog .I found the film very myopic in its depiction of American soldiers and absolute lack of depiction of the Iraqi people whose lives and homes have been occupied by a foreign force ( I use ' occupation ' rather than ' war ' just as Jonathan Rosenbaum does ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although the likes of War Tapes humanises its soldiers and ultimately blames ' the system ' , it still shows the absolute lack of humanity that they oftentimes exhibit also .It 's not that its apolitical ( I do n't truly believe any film could be ) but The Hurt Locker would have been a lot braver if it had have shown another dimension to the occupation in Iraq .I suspect it will be a long time before anyone makes a film about these horrific events that will have anything even close to a balanced view , and certainly not whilst the events persist .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You 're right to suggest that the screenwriter and director 's intentions often get obscured or lost , whether due to paratexts that frame interpretation , audience expectations , or some combination of both .That 's why I think the film is \" politically ambivalent , \" in the terms described by Frank Tomasulo in an essay on Apocalypse Now .Like that film , The Hurt Locker invites both pro- and anti - war readings .The myopia / identification issues are complicated for me , in that I think the film is trying to suggest that the soldiers are unable to truly see the Iraqi civilians .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In that sense , I do n't know if I would characterize what is happening as \" manipulation , \" so much as a blind spot in terms of how war films are constructed , even one that is attempting to deconstruct traditional narrative structures .In terms of your larger question , I wonder if we truly want a \" definitive \" Iraq War film .I actually like that we have so many perspectives , including a few films and documentaries made by or with the assistance of Iraqi civilians , that have been seen pretty widely ( My Country , My Country is the most accessible example ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Chuck Said , .This might only reinforce your point , but I have found the discussion of the military reaction to The Hurt Locker interesting .The latest example of this is in the LA Times .The contrarian in me wants to ask if anyone has thought to ask some Iraqi civilians if they think the depiction of the occupation is \" accurate . \" amanda ann klein Said , .Nice piece .I just watched this film this weekend - after hearing all of the hype - and found it disappointing ( which always happens with hyped up films ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
