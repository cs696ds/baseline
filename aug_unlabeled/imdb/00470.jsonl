{"text": "Product Description .Amazon.ca .The casting of cute , petite Bernadette Peters as the formidable Mama Rose in the 2003 revival of Gypsy led to a few raised eyebrows : Was this egregious miscasting ?After all , previous Roses have included Ethel Merman , Angela Lansbury , Tyne Daly , and ( on TV ) Bette Midler , all of them strong women who can belt with the best of them .Peters took a slightly different approach to the role , emphasizing the dramatic reading of her songs instead of blasting her way through sheer power -- she acts the material as much as she sings it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Peters 's acting skills are further emphasized by the generous helpings of dialog that frame the musical numbers .The rest of the cast is superlative , and Marvin Laird 's conducts a spirited orchestra .Discussions as to which recording of Gypsy is the definitive one will never end , but this album certainly deserves to be included among the finalists .--Elisabeth Vincentelli .Top Customer Reviews .This recording is excellent .The sound is bright and forward and the orchestra overture has never sounded more exciting .The strong cast does the score justice , and the added bits of dialogue into some songs keep the story moving .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A totally different take on Madam Rose than we have ever witnessed .From the first moment you hear her , you know that she has stamped the part as her own and is sticking to her own ideas about how to play it .If you are a theater enthusiast , and not someone prone to living in the past , this is an exciting new way to play and sing this part .Sappy sounding balads benefit from her personal touch , because she is telling you what she is feeling as she sings - the acting is coming through the music .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Here we have a strong voice coupled with a real intensity .And to me , it is Peters vulnerability at moments that makes her portrayal even more powerful when she does pull out all the stops and let her voice soar .She sounds great - and her spoken lines leading into a couple of the numbers are spine tingling .It 's a pleasure to hear a living Broadway legend tackle this role .I highly recommend it .I am hoping to see \" Gypsy \" in June while vacationing in New York , so no , I have not seen it yet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I had to pick up this soundtrack tonight .It 's absoulutely amazing .I 've loved the movie \" Gypsy \" ( both versions with Natalie Wood , then Bette Midler ) since I was a kid .My mom raised me on all the classic musicals .and they were always the movie versions since we lived no where near New York , London , LA , Toronto , or wherever ( and still do n't .Pffft . )Anyway , I grew up with \" Gypsy \" and thought about seeing the revival show .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She 's not one you 'd expect to play Rose , but listening to this recording , it somehow fits .Why doubt her , I do n't know .I believe she can do anything .Anything .And I ca n't wait to see her light up the stage in June .What an experience .Shockingly , all my favorite tracks are Rose 's songs .\" Rose 's Turn \" is breathtaking .You can feel the intensity and emotion Bernadette pours into this role .I almost ca n't even recognize her voice .Fun numbers \" Together , Wherever We Go \" and \" You Got ta Get A Gimmick \" , etc .. are charming .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anything to tide me over till June ...Do n't miss this one .I never thought that there could possibly be a bad version of \" Gypsy .\" I mean , the material is surefire and even survived the gratuitous rewriting by Arthur Laurents for the Angela Lansbury revival .But it took that tiny \" powerhouse \" Bernadette Peters to bring it down .Apologies to lovelorn diva fan , Ben Brantley .Yes , Peters is cute .Yes , she is adorable .But has anyone bothered to notice that she is a truly lousy actress ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Just listen to her line readings cuing each song on the new CD .Absolutely painful .She sounds more like Baby June than Madam Rose .( And , please , folks .Get it right .The character is never called Mama Rose in the play .She 's called Madam Rose .Even Laurents has pointed this out repeatedly and without much success . )And , come to think of it , Peters ' tiny singing voice makes her more suited to Baby June .I 've had the good future to see just about every Madam Rose - several times each .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You name them and I 've seem them - Ethel Merman , Rosalind Russell , Giselle McKenzie , Mary McCarty , Angela Lansbury , Joanne Worley , Tyne Daly , Bette Midler , Betty Buckley and Peters - and Peters is the hands - down worst .I realize that Broadway diehards do n't want to hear this , but the only one to truly realize the dimensions of this great role has been Rosalind Russell .For one thing , she 's the only world - class actress to play the role .( Yes , maybe Merman \" owns \" it but she was no actress ! )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She nailed the role , bringing some wonderful patrician pretensions to it , and with Kirk backing her up , offered the definitive rendering of the classic songs .Read more ' .Everyone has their favourite Rose .For me , the part belongs to Ethel Merman .Her recording still generates goosebumps .There are certain touches that Bernadette Peters brings to the role that I enjoy and because of the vivid theatricality of this disc it would be my second choice .Angela Lansbury comes in a close third , her recording undone by some curious choices including re - arranging the running order .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Tyne Daly 's recording did not capture here at her best so it 's a wrte off .The TV movie with Bette Midler is enjoyable to watch yet she never gets inside the character , and her recording suffers for it .As for the film with Rosalind Russell 's \" voice \" ( Lisa Kirk , mostly)it 's less objectionable to watch but tough to listen to .Even when watching the movie it 's like seeing a good road tour cast instead of the freshly minted original .BUT ...If you 've never seen GYPSY and have the chance to catch the Broadway revival , GO !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
