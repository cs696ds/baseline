{"text": "Lynda Carter played perhaps the most iconic of female superheroes , Wonder Woman .Probably the all - time best female superhero who can still turn our heads today is Wonder Woman as deliciously protrayed by actress Lynda Carter in the popular TV series that ran from 1975 to 1979 .Who can forget the image of her in that iconic red , white and blue skimpy costume , complete with the famous 1970s - style all - nylon sheer - to - waist suntan pantyhose on those legs that seemingly went for miles ?Case in point : There have been many Superman and Batman blockbuster movies made in every decade since the 1990s , but have you seen a new Wonder Woman since 1979 ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Proposed Wonder Woman costume for 2011 TV project upset WW fans everywhere .That might be in part because veteran costume designer Robert Blackman , a multiple Emmy nominee , and three - time winner , messed with Wonder Woman 's costume , changing those iconic briefs to ( gasp ) pants .\" I was vilified and vindicated ( by Wonder Woman fans ) on an hourly basis , \" Blackman told Entertainment Weekly .\" There was outrage over everything from the fact that she was wearing pants to the boot color . \" Yes , and rightfully so .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Why do people want to change something that 's worked beautifully for decades ?Eventually , in some promotional photos I saw ahead of the would - be show 's release , the costume did include an updated version of the classic briefs or short - shorts , but the star who was to play Wonder Woman was modeling them in \" bear \" legs .Uh ,yeah ... that was never gon na work , folks .You do n't mess with an icon .What makes a superhero character iconic ?Webster 's Dictionary offers a couple of definitions of the word , icon : \" Any person or thing that is revered ; someone or something regarded as embodying the essential characteristics of an era , group , etc . \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Period .If we did n't have a thing for pantyhose already , those of us who grew up watching Wonder Woman during the 70s might have become forever hooked because of the beautiful and charming character Lynda Carter portrayed .Just for kicks .In my mind , after Wonder Woman , the next great superheroine who very well could have influenced our early pantyhose fetish has to be the awesome video game character , Chun - Li .Introduced in the original Street Fighter II video game in 1991 , Chun - Li is an undercover Interpol agent seeking to avenge the death of her father at the hands of Bison and his criminal organization .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Chun - Li , the first well - known female playable character in a fighting game , was designed with muscular legs because of her strong martial arts kicking skills , necessary to hold her own in combat against the standard roster of powerful male characters .Most artwork depicts the Ada Wong character in the Resident Evil video games as wearing sheer pantyhose .I 'm not certain whether another superheroine who captured our hearts first in video games should be counted here or not because in almost half the pictures I can find of her she appears to be \" bear\"-legged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sadly , when Ada Wong finally made it to the silver screen last year in \" Resident Evil : Retribution , \" she did n't appear to be wearing pantyhose through most of the movie .I say did n't appear to be , as it is very hard to tell because gorgeous Chinese actress Li Bingbing has such perfect porcelean skin .I would swear that Miss Li is wearing very sheer pantyhose in some of the scenes and in some of the promotional photos for the movie , but as thoroughly as I 've investigated , the truth is I just ca n't tell .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'd like to think that means those models consider pantyhose integral to the Ada Wong costume , but I could be just as happy thinking that they at least have the brains and class to wear pantyhose just to look good in the costume .Hopefully , the models who do n't think it 's necessary to wear pantyhose with their Ada Wong costumes regret their decisions when they see the pics of themselves later on .Either way , Ada Wong in pantyhose totally rocks her beautiful red qipao dress better ( in my opinion ) than Chun - Li because Ada wears black pumps , whereas Chun - Li 's clunky white army boots are so less feminine looking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of course there are many other female superheroes in comic books , video games , TV series and movies , but I ca n't point to any who are always depicted wearing pantyhose .But there are some very significant supporting characters whose beautiful pantyhose - adorned legs might equally have helped to nuture our pantyhose fetish in the early stages .Teri Hatcher gave Lois Lane some sexy pantyhose - adorned legs in the 1990s Superman TV series .One of the most iconic is Lois Lane , originally portrayed by Noel Neill in the 1950s TV series , \" The Adventures of Superman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
