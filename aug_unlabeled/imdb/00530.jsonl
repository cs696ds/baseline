{"text": "Word Ridden .Dirkie .Thursday , June 19th , 2003 .I recently solved a mystery that has nagged at me for over 20 years .The answer to the riddle that has preoccupied me on and off for two - thirds of my life is Dirkie .And the riddle itself came about like this : .Back in the late seventies ( I do n't remember the exact year ) , my family was living in Germany .My parents had gone away on a trip of some sort , and the night that they were due back , I stayed up with my grandmother and watched the single television station available to us back then .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It began with a man , a boy and a dog in a plane over the desert .The plane crashes , something happens to the man , and the boy winds up wandering through the desert alone with his dog .Along the way , he gets stung by a scorpion and becomes delirious .He 's rescued by some tribesmen , but when he wakes up out of his delirium , he thinks that his rescuers have cooked his dog , and he becomes so angry that his rescuers abandon him .I think hyenas enter the picture somewhere along the way , and there may be a snake as well - I 'm not sure anymore .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If I remember correctly , the final shot in the film is of the man and the boy at the top of an empty sand dune , waiting , alone .That feeling of disquiet has never really gone away ( nor has my terror of scorpions , for that matter ) .Images from the movie - the scorpion , the roasting meat ( which is n't actually the dog , by the way ) , the final , lonely shot - have haunted me to this day .My feeling of unease has been compounded over the years by the fact that I had absolutely no idea what this movie was called , when it was made or where it was from .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Until just two days ago .Directed in South Africa in 1969 by Jamie Uys , the man who also directed The Gods Must Be Crazy .When I followed the link on the IMDB site through to the viewer comments and realized that this was , in fact , it , the film that has stuck in my memory for so many years , I uttered a stunned , \" Oh .My .God .\" I 'd almost come to believe that I had simply imagined the movie , or maybe even dreamed it , so when I saw the hard proof of its existence there on my computer screen , it was something of a shock to the system .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I could n't believe that other people had apparently had the same experience I had with this film .And I really could n't believe that my search was over .I 'm absolutely thrilled to have solved this little puzzle .It 's not some major revelation , and the mystery has n't exactly consumed me over the years , but it did always niggle away in a corner of my mind whenever I found myself pondering the things from my childhood that left a truly lasting impression on me .It was always there in my memory as a curiosity , an unexplained phenomenon , a big question mark .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I am Australian and as an 8 year old I failed to distinguish the difference in the accents , or in the faces of the San ( the bushmen )Vs Australian Aboriginals .The desert was also in keeping with the sandy deserts we have in Australia .I was surprised recently to find it was a South African movie .With very little dialogue and vast wide open empty landscapes , those images we all remember etch themselves even more sharply on the mind .I have never read so many reviews that are wirtten by people who have not seen this movie since they were children yet retain the story and its images so clearly in their minds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In hindsight I thought it may be an Australian film , but not because of the accents ; I thought the wild dog could 've been a dingo .I was only six at the time , & my recollection of the plot was : .After the boy and his Yorkie ( ? ) dog have been missing for a while , his father who works in a city arranges for paper fliers to be dropped out of helicopters along the assumed route .A wild dog in the desert sniffs at one of the fliers .( Now I 'm told it was a hyena ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
