{"text": "I 'm a huge fan of certain Chevy Chase movies like Vacation , Fletch , Spies Like Us , Three Amigos , even Caddyshack .While he 's pretty much the same Chevy in Funny Farm and very funny in deed at times , the whole movie just did n't work out for me .Funny Farm is somewhat more restrained , wry and maybe even boring compared to other Chevy Chase movies .There 's nothing really wrong with the movie ( unless maybe the last act is a bit of an u - turn ) , everything works as should , direction is quite tight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I really see this primarily as a Chevy Chase movie .While the leading lady did a pretty good job acting the part , I never thought she really fit the role .She just did n't have the Beverly D'Angelo kind of warmth I expected .I did n't feel the connection between Chevy and her wife .Also the lack of children made the movie seem a bit serious , even tho it had all the elements of a family comedy .George Roy Hill did a great job portraying the dry humour in Slap Shot , one of my all time favourite movies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And do n't get me wrong , the scenery and set deco are really nice to look at .Good pastime , but I do n't see myself returning to this title for some time .This Chevy Chase film had potential to be a really funny movie .Unfortunately , poor choices for moving the story along doom this one to being an unmemorable mediocre comedy .Still , there are some laughs to be had in this film about a couple who move to the country with rather disastrous results .Most of the more funny scenes though occur at the beginning of the film , as the film progresses though it becomes more and more bland .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This initially interesting and led to a funny scene involving a singing bird .However , this is also what ends up shooting the film down in flames as this leads to a dispute between Chevy 's character and his wife .A very unfunny set of scenes that set the movie into even less funny scenes as they decide to sell their newly acquired home .Chevy Chase is normally associated with the Caddyshack , Fletch and Vacation series meaning that his one - shot movies mostly fall by the wayside .Films like Spies Like Us , Nothing But Trouble and Funny Farm have went largely unseen since the advent of DVD in 1997 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was beginning to wonder what Warner had against giving them definitive releases until I discovered an HD master of Funny Farm on the PlayStation Network .I saw it only once , when I was about 9 , and remembered very little .If you 're a fan of Clark Griswold then Andy Farmer is n't too far removed .Andy is a sports journalist who retires from the big city to the Redbud , Vermont hoping to enjoy and idyllic , peaceful life and finally write the great , American novel ( The Big Heist ) .When he gets there he and his wife discover that almost everyone and everything is weirder than the last .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And top of all this Andy has severe writer 's block while his wife manages to churn out a successful children 's novel without really trying .With careful , measured direction from George Roy Hill ( Butch Cassidy , The Sting ) Funny Farm , based on a novel by Jay Cronley , manages to be a little classier than Chase 's usual fare .This makes the lack of a home video version even more puzzling .It has never been released on DVD in the UK , and the 1989 VHS is long gone .If you have access to the PlayStation Network then go for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
