{"text": "\" What drew you to \" The Lincoln Lawyer \" and what was your approach to the score ?I guess I was drawn to the job because it was a good film .I went to a preview screening and it was just a terrific movie .I know they were desperately afraid of it sounding like a television courtroom drama , so I was trying to avoid it sounding like anything typical .Although I do n't watch much television anyhow , so I do n't know what I was trying to avoid .I think I was hired because of the ambient style I 'm known for .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So that was the main inspiration to do something kind of stark .The score has a very striking mixture of electronics and orchestral stuff .Was there ever any hesitation on the filmmakers to go down that road ?Where did those sounds come from ?Well , it 's funny , a lot of the people I do these scores for have a real strong aversion to synthesizers , because they sound buzzy and overtly synthetic and electronic .And that was the case here .That 's the one thing ambient scores are known for - using a lot of electronics and synthesizers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In a way I was asked to do something that sounds electronic but not synthesizer electronic .Most of the things are stretched out organic sounds , rather than using something that sounds overtly plastic or synthetic .A lot of them are recordings of orchestral sounds that have been stretched out .They 've been pitched and stretched beyond recognition , but they do come from something organic originally .A lot of the sounds on \" Lincoln Lawyer \" are orchestral recordings are re - pitched and no longer recognizable , rather than creating them completely from scratch from the synthesizer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A lot of the stretched out textures in that were metallophones [ percussion instruments that strike metal tubes ] and stretched out they become percussive sounds and long , sustaining textural sounds .A lot of people thought \" Solaris \" was a synthetic score but 80 % of \" Solaris \" was the sound of an orchestra .Most people do n't think or recognize that .One of the great quotes I got was \" a terrific ambient synthesizer score .\" But it was in fact a 90-piece orchestra !But that was my first giant orchestral recording - it was a 90-piece orchestra that did most of what you hear .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Because you do n't have a lot of big , Danny Elfman - ish themes but there are certain motifs you weave through the work .It seems like everybody I know has a strong aversion to themes in the sense of strong , melodic hooks that you associate with a situation or a character .The thinking of a lot of filmmakers is that melodies and themes take a lot of your attention , perhaps away from the screen .I like using melodies .I do it whenever I can .But often I 'll settle for a motif based on a certain sound or something a lot simpler than a listenable , hummable melody .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So I try to do something that 's a recognizable motif that 's heard and evolves throughout the movie but is n't exactly melodies or traditional film themes .How does your work in the rock'n'roll arena inform your compositions ?[ Martinez was a drummer who played with Captain Beefheart , The Dickies and most notably , The Red Hot Chili Peppers ] I 've often thought that my background in rock'n'roll has gone to waste in film work .My background was that I was a rock'n'roll drummer and I do n't think I used drums in my first ten years of film scoring .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You 're basically there in a support role and you 're there to make everybody else look good .But for the most part , no , those skills have n't done me much good at all .Occasionally I 'll score something using a percussion controller , like \" Kafka , \" which was done with a MIDI drum controller , so occasionally I 'll get to use my drum skills on a film that 's rhythmic .But no .The whole sensibility is different .Writing songs and playing drums have n't gotten me much mileage in the film world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is n't anything that 's informed your film work ?Well , the one thing I do well is work with rhythm , so if I get to use it , being a drummer / percussionist does help .But , I 'm thinking of my first few films - \" sex , lies , and videotape , \" complete absence of anything rhythmic ...I guess there 's a little bit of rhythm in certain things .But the ambient thing deliberately avoids doing anything rhythmic .When I get to do it in something like \" Lincoln Lawyer , \" though , it does help .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a physical chap that you lose pretty quickly if you do n't keep up with it .I 'm horrified at how poorly I play now .Have there been any recent scores that you 've really loved ?Well , some big ones - I was really pulling for \" The King 's Speech .\" I think everybody kind of thinks a score is great if the film is great and if the film is n't great the music is n't so great either .But that score really got my attention .That guy [ Alexandre Desplat ] really knows what he 's doing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But that was a recent one that caught my attention .I thought \" Social Network \" was innovative and distinctive as well .It seems to be an interesting time with people moving from the electronic music realm over to film scoring , like Trent Reznor and more recently Daft Punk and Chemical Brothers .Well , I think people ca n't make money selling records anymore .I think a lot of these people who were in bands , making records , it 's just hard to make a living at it .You make money in live performances but it 's very difficult making money selling records .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "So I think that 's why everybody wants to get into licensing materials , film composing , television composing - because the pop music thing was always a reckless career choice but is now even more so .What 's interesting too is that they 're not really pressing film scores anymore , most things are going directly to iTunes .I 'm not sure why anybody makes a physical CD anymore when the costs are so much lower to just throw it up on iTunes .And it does n't seem that making a hard copy of something prevents pirating any less .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They pressed \" Lincoln Lawyer .\" They put that out there .And I kept thinking \" Why are they doing that ?Why incur the costs ?Do they sell more initially ?\" I 'm not sure what the economics of it is , if it 's a quaint relic of a bygone era or do they sell more of them initially because people want the artwork and the linear notes and the whole package .Or does anybody hear the difference between compressed files and CD ?I do n't know the economics of why CDs get pressed at all , quite frankly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I remember when I first saw it I thought it was pretty out there and pretty weird .And I guess what happened was that it was going to be a $ 60 million Universal picture with Hugh Jackman .So that 's where it came from .And Nicolas kind of turned it into a part of his personal style .But it is really good , a really , really exciting film .I would say it 's unique more than weird .My roommate keeps telling me , \" This guy you 're working for - he must be insane !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It must give you a lot of freedom to do some percussive stuff because it seems so action - packed .Some of that , yeah .It 's not quite as rhythmic as \" Lincoln Lawyer .\"Initially , Nicolas had the preference initially , the temp be all drones - all textures and atmospheres .And then he came to me , \" I 'm a little worried - when you go with this ambient style , the danger is that it will take energy away from the film . \"So a lot of the stuff has rhythm in it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's evolved into something more rhythmic , it 's an electronic ambient score with a fair amount of rhythm in it .But like a lot of guys , he does n't score the action stuff that much .When the action starts , it 's when the music disappears .It 's often the psychological moments that lead up to it or after the action moments , that are the important , key music moments .But it 's got a fair amount of the basic food groups of romance and violence and action sequences .And with Nicolas ' unique style , who was a director I was not familiar with .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
