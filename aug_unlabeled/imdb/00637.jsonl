{"text": "I asked Clark Gable if he felt it dangerous to work so long in a single film such as \" Gone with the Wind . \"Fans forget easily .Will the role of Rhett Butler , no matter how colorful , be strong enough to hold Clark at the top , to overcome the long months of getting him on celluloid ?Gable writes thus : . \"Rather than being too dangerous to work too long in one picture , I can say from experience that it is of definite value to an actor and makes for a superior film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
