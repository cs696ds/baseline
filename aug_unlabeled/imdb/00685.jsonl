{"text": "Death Wish II ( 1982 ) - A Quintessential Piece of Exploitative Revenge .Michael Winner 's ' Death Wish ' ( 1974 ) is a gritty realistic thought provoking crime thriller that is very much a product of its time capturing perfectly the American public 's concerns with the alarming rise of street crime in the 1970s .However , many critics vilified it by damning its depiction of vigilantism as supporting it .The consequences of which change Kersey 's perception of what is wrong and what is right .It is far more a damming commentary on violence than a glorification of it highlighted by the film 's Western themes with Paul Kersey 's descent into a crazy cowboy fantasy for justice induced by a business trip to Arizona after the attack on his family .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Colt Police Positive revolver .This is the protagonist 's turning point as he begins to prowl the streets for the same criminal element that has caused his grief attracting muggers by using himself as bait after the police 's inability to capture the perpetrators that ruined his life .Kersey is now living in a psychotic fantasy world and is enjoying his vigilantism work with little morality in his notion of justice and we question his true intentions .This is further established when Det .Frank Ochoa ( the late Vincent Gardenia ) the police officer who has been pursuing the vigilante asks him to leave town and Paul Kersey replies \" By sundown ? \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the final scene , Kersey arrives at Chicago Union Station and notices a gang of thugs harassing a young woman .Looking on happily he then goes over to help her with the parcels she has dropped .One writer who agreed with the critics was the author of the original 1972 novel of the same name that the movie was adapted from , Brian Garfield .He hated Winner 's film version so much that it compelled him to write a follow - up to his own book entitled ' Death Sentence ' published in 1975 and due to his intense dislike of the previous movie he would not sell the rights for an adaptation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Personally , I think Michael Winner 's movie did this anyway .The same can not be said about ' Death Wish II ' though as it is a complete reinvention of Bronson 's character - a reboot of the ' Death Wish ' concept if you will before the term was even coined .Cannon executive Menahem Golan was originally attached to direct but Winner was brought back on Bronson 's insistence .Completely redefined the emotionally subtle layered complexity of Paul Kersey and his abstract motives are replaced with a merciless angel of death in a balls out exploitation revenge thriller .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To see Kersey have direct revenge by dispatching with callous coldness the scumbags who have wronged him by raping and murdering his comatose daughter and kind housemaid is an emotionally rewarding experience .One thing that really did bug me about the original was that Paul Kersey never set out after Jeff Goldblum and his gang of freaks who attacked his family and never even once crossed paths with them .David Engelbach 's screenplay only serves the purpose to string together horrific events for Kersey 's plight that seek the reactions of shock , anger and revolt from us leading to his brutal retribution on the low - life scum who have wronged him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although this belated sequel was released eight years later , the story takes place six years after the original .It does not follow through with the set - up of the first film 's end ; Kersey does not carry on with his vigilantism ways and he is not even residing in Chicago but is now living in Los Angeles .He met an old friend in the Windy City who owns a radio station in L.A. so he transferred his architect business to The City of Angels and is working on a big project for a new building for his client friend 's station KABC .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She has been left largely mute but according to her doctors , she has been uttering sentences for the past five weeks .Engelbach ignored this original 's end set - up so he could have Paul Kersey pick up the pieces after his tragic misfortune and start a fresh with a happy new life just for the writer 's sole purpose to have it shattered into pieces again .This gives our protagonist a device to drive the narrative forward with his motivation for revenge and to draw our empathies for his mission .The opening title sequence is made up of establishing long shots and aerial shots of Los Angeles accompanied by Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page 's for the most part terrible cheese ridden non - diegetic soundtrack with this opening main theme music a mix of synthesizers and long guitar wanking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It turns out that it was Geri 's news report on KABC in a pre - recorded broadcast .While they are all having a day out together , Paul Kersey has his wallet stolen by a gang of five punks while waiting alone in a line for ice cream .Failing to get it back after cornering one of them in an ally Kersey goes back to Geri and Carol making the excuse that he left it at home .Getting his address from his I.D , the punks drive to his house in a van while the three of them are all still out and Rosario is still inside .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Gallardo is convincingly brilliant here in a brave performance and we really feel her suffering seeing her horrified facial expressions and hearing her crying and screaming of anguished pain .Four of the scumbags take turns on her and one of them Cutter ( a young Lawrence Fishburne ) whips her with his belt .The leader of the gang Nirvana ( Thomas F. Duffy ) forces her to give him oral sex .It is an immensely unpleasant experience made even more disturbing in how the director shoots it .Michael Winner walked the line in how he depicted the sexual violence in the first movie with the emphasis on realism just showing enough of what was necessary to display the foulness of the crime while ever so slightly treading the waters of exploitation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While Geri has gone off to do an interview Kersey and Carol return to the house .Paul Kersey is beaten and knocked unconscious .Rosario reaches for the phone for help but is killed when Nirvana hits her in the head with a crowbar .The gang takes Carol , this leads us to the second rape of the movie , and it is a strange and dare I say sensual one that juxtaposes the brutality of the previous sequence .He slowly unbuttons her blouse undoes her bra and gently fondles her breasts .Taking down her panties , he lays her down and penetrates her with long slow strokes while caressing her breasts and sucking on her nipples .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is as if Winner is trying to make an erotic rape scene to take the viewer out of the fact that what they are watching is sexual molestation .He tricks the audience into thinking momentarily that they are seeing a raunchy soft - core piece of pornography that they might find enjoyably arousing in the moment but the aftermath of which questions their own morality for looking at a rape in this voyeuristic perspective .This weird sensualized rape is followed by the graphic demise of Carol .When Punkcut is done and gets off her she buttons back up her blouse and just as Jiver with his back turned to her ( Stuart K. Robinson ) is about to have a go she suddenly gets up and runs away .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Back at Kersey 's house Geri turns up and unable to let herself in with her key she rings the doorbell bringing Paul Kersey back around to consciousness and when he unbolts the door and lets her in they discover Rosario dead on the floor .The writer purposely retconned this to give Paul Kersey the motivation he needs in that he has the strong feeling the police will fuck it up again and he just can not let that happen .That is the set - up and now it is time for Kersey to dispense his bloody justice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

's daytime now he is on their turf at night seeking them out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The sequences of Paul Kersey serving his own brand of justice are more elaborate action set - pieces here compared to the rooted in realism of his shootings of the muggers in the original .This makes for satisfying entertainment as we see Bronson doing what he does best by blowing away the bad guys who have done him wrong .There is a laugh out loud moment during a shoot - out when the stupid Cutter ( Fishburne ) tries to protect his face from gunfire with his ghetto blaster only for Kersey to blow it apart - .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do not think that David Engelbach did much research into street crime for preparation for the writing of his script though .When do you ever see multi - racial gangs ?Their actions are questionable with all of them hanging around on street corners waiting to mug someone for their wallet but later in the movie they quickly move up to drug deals and weapons buying .They take a public bus on their way to the meeting point of that last business transaction .All this is way unrealistic but the actors all do such a solid job in overacting hamming it up to make for some very entertaining villains and we long for them to get their comeuppance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This just makes her out to be an unlikable character and ruins any emotional lending to the relationship that we are supposed to feel .These scenes are the most boring , and to make it worse Page 's hit and miss soundtrack really gets stinky here with the corny and dated romance cues .His musical score overall is extremely lacklustre compared to Herbie Hancock 's excellent jazz score of the first movie .One character I am very happy to see here is the return of is the sneezing world - weary Det .Frank Ochoa ( Gardenia ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He is sent by his heads in New York to stop again Kersey 's vigilante ways to prevent him from being arrested as so to avoid him spilling the beans about letting him go the first time around .Ochoa is a great memorable character who is neither a bad cop nor a crusading one but he always does what he is told and is determined to get his job done bringing some much - needed comic relief with Vincent Gardenia 's whimsically humorous performance .Other comical elements can be seen with the ludicrous Lt .Mankewicz ( Frank ) the detective leading up the investigation here who is hilariously partial in putting off medical assistance to injured witnesses to Paul Kersey 's vigilantism be they his criminal victims or innocent citizens he had helped .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As a faithful companion piece to the themes presented in ' Death Wish ' , this sequel is a disappointment but although far from perfect as a deep down and dirty trashy exploitation urban revenge thriller that oozes atmosphere it is one helluva of a success .Much like how the first movie was a product of its time this film is very much a product of its own time .It encapsulates everything that is loved by genre fans when it comes to extremely violent action flicks of the early 80s and does not shy away in painting a grimy picture in graphic detail of how society 's ills had escalated in that period .
