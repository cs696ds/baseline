{"text": "Looper : the trailer excites , but i worried that would be all . nothing but a grand concept and two hours of Willis blowing stuff up .It was more .Mouth agape , I watched in amazement as a powerful drama unfolded , worked through bleak scifi underpinnings .A movie that shows little gore , but transfixes and horrifies with visceral violence .A time - travel concept I 'm still puzzling over , taking me back to when Termintor blew my teenage mind .And an unexpectedly mature story that speaks to forward looking youth , backward knowing age ... and something even more .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "From a story filled with terrible people .Terrible motivations .Grace emerges .Tragic grace .I saw this today .Lots to like and to think about but some of the premise does n't really make any sense .And trying to resolve the paradoxes is giving me a headache .But otherwise I think it 's first - rate .I think the actor who played the kid ( Cid ) deserves a supporting actor Oscar nom .I see the point of the story of being Joe 's character growth .Young Joe is a wretched person .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Old Joe is ' saved ' by his wife , but he is still wholly self - centered in willing to kill even children to try and save his life .Typical time travel story is a single , infinite loop : Sgt Reese is sent back by John Conner to save Sarah Conner , thus becoming the father of John Conner ...This has two , going on three .It indicates a fatalistic loop , and then breaks it .Ultimately , in this story , it 's not crucial if the time - travel is self - consistent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Maybe because he and his mom now had a bunch of silver bricks ?Other questions : Why require the loopers to kill their own old selves in the first place ?Seems too risky , have a different looper do it .Or why not kill them in the future , and just send a corpse back to be disposed of ?If they have to send a live person for some silly reason , sedate them first .It also seems pretty risky to let former loopers go free anyway , they have 30 years to ponder their pending demise and figure out how to prevent it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It just does n't seem like a well thought out process .And how did Sarah know so much about Loopers ?Color me intrigued .I 've watched the trailer and am interested , though these sorts of films often miss more than they hit .I doubt I 'll be able to catch this in theaters ( and I appreciate the use of spoiler tags ) but based on your comments , I think I will definitely Redbox this when it 's released .Are you new to the Home Theater Forum ?Stop by the New Member Introductions area and introduce yourself !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Rian Johnson first shows that time travel is n't a fixed loop by showing you two versions of Joe killing himself .The first is Joe not being able to kill himself , then Joe killing himself , flashing forward 30 years , losing his wife , then coming back and avoiding having his looped closed .So very early on it 's established that the future could be changed .So right off the bat Dave is right in that it 's not important to this movie if time travel is self - consistent , Johnson shows you from the beginning that it 's not .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Spoiler : Warning : Spoiler !I think even though in Future 1 , where Joe does close his loop , the Rainmaker does go bad even without Joe 's intervention .He had inadvertently killed his \" mom / aunt \" and probably ends up doing the same to his real mom .It 's established early on he has abandonment issues , calls her Sara , wo n't kiss her , etc .He was going down that road .Then when Young Joe self - sacrifices , it changes the Rainmaker for the good as he accepts his mother for what she is , and is shown giving her affection in ways he never did before .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Saw a free screening at Sony last night , was n't sure what to expect , came away very impressed .Dave 's first post hits it on the head .Interesting that a film with largely unlikeable characters can pull off such a compelling story .Do n't go into it trying to \" analyze the time travel mechanisms \" because it will , just like every other time travel film , fail .Just go in and accept the premise of time travel for what it is , and enjoy two hours of an intense emotional ride .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Spoiler : Warning : Spoiler !But to close his own loop in the way he did does give the film 's ending the gravitas it needed .Loved it .Great performance from the leads and extra special mention for the young boy - fantastic performance - if a bit creepy .This was a solid character study movie and the story kept me off balance as I unsuccessfully tried to ascertain where it was going next .As you explain , future is not fixed , but the Rainmaker exists in all past versions for unknown reasons .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For that reason , I did n't think the kid would be the Rainmaker , initially , since there was no proximate cause for him to become the Rainmaker until Joe entered his life .But , I can accept that the Rainmaker had other paths to his future , before Joe become involved .The second option is that time is actually looped , but it works in back on itself over multiple cycles .There is a Rainmaker , because Joe intervened , because Joe closed his loop .But rather than being a fatalistic cycle , it gets broken .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Tighten that bit up , and I 'd be a bit happier with the film .It easily worth a matinee showing if you like sci - fi time - travel films .I was also a little put off by Gordon - Levitt 's make - up ( trying to look like a younger Bruce Willis ) .It was just a weird choice .I understand the eye color issue , but the eyebrows , and a bit of nose prostetics was made him look weird to me .But even if that 's all I 'm really complaining about , it was a solid film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Really enjoyed the movie !I already know there will be a lot of extras in blu ray to at least give us some more insight to the director 's thinking .I stumbled on this link while I was trying to add to my sony rewards .Click on the 6 locked icons ( It will be ulocked while the video is running ) to get your silver blocks and more insight to the movie .I found this movie interesting for the time travel aspects , but like the director 's first feature \" Brick , \" it doesn''t connect on an emotional level , even though there are some significant human interest aspects to the plot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The flashbacks ( or flashforwards ) do n't add much to Willis 's words in the diner , just giving us a face to reference .We do n't know why she finally accepted him and helped him , why he was willing to change for her ; we are just told \" it was love .\" The young boy did a great job with the role of a mass murderer in the making , but his creepiness , and the moral - philosophical conundrum of the final act , is a double - edged sword that keeps us from connecting with the character .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Compare that to a movie like \" 12 Monkeys , \" which has similar themes , but hits me in both the head and the heart .I saw this movie a couple weekends ago I thought it was very well done and a very interesting twist on time travel .Just when you think the movie is going to end on a happy note ...Well another twist occurs .I agree one of the best syfy movies in a while .Equipment : Panasonic TC - P65VT25 , Panasonic DMP - BDT100 , Pioneer Elite SC-37 , TiVo Premiere XL , Limited Edition MW3 XBOX 360s with Kinect , Apple TV Speakers : Definitive Technology Mythos XTR60 ( 3 ) , Definitive Technology Mythos XTR20BP", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 've watched this one twice now and it still leaves me flat .A cool premise , a decent first act .Once we arrive at the farm though it goes for a wander into Hollywoodland with the forced / dumb romance angle and never recovers .I 'll stick with 12 Monkeys as my Bruce Willis time travel film of choice .The movie was enjoyable enough , but did n't have that mind altering punch that I was expecting .In many ways , this was a terrific Twilight Zone episode stretched too thin .I agree with Patrick about Gordon - Levitt 's attempt at mimicking Willis as being distracting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I actually love time travel plots , so the ideas of paradoxes and such do n't bother me .But there were two parts that made no sense : 1 )The first Looper who came back and took off started heading to Wire Street .In the process , he loses fingers , then nose , and then limbs , all as a result of past torture / dismemberment .Now , I can accept that thing done in the past to change the timeline may , like memories , appear contemporaneously in the older self .But they do n't happen in real time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a cool looking scene , but makes no sense in the context of time travel .2 )It 's apparently so difficult to kill people in the future that they have to resort to time travel to dispose of the bodies .And yet when they go to snatch Old Joe , they threaten him with guns .Does n't he realize they ca n't really shoot him or cause problems with the authorities or whatnot ?But wait , no -- they casually shoot his wife dead in the same scene .Huh ?If they can just kill people like that , why in the world is there a vast time travel network to cleanly kill people ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
