{"text": "How Spielberg and Lucas Caught The Surfing Bug ( ...And Waved Goodbye To Points On ' Close Encounters ' & ' Star Wars ' ) .When freak waves recently soaked the beach at Cannes , nobody was as happy among the incoming festival crowd as Sam George , who with Greg MacGillivray directed the Hollywood Do n't Surf documentary that premieres May 15 at the Palais .\" I thought it was no coincidence that it happened on a Wednesday , as in Big Wednesday , and my only regret is that the waves came a week early .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film repped by ICM covers Hollywood 's long infatuation with surf culture , and it 's largely a study in futility .In the 50 years that Hollywood has been making surf films , audiences have never been as enthused as wave - crazed executives and filmmakers thought they would .Nobody learned that lesson harder than Steven Spielberg and George Lucas .Normally shrewd businessmen , they read John Milius 's script for Big Wednesday and got so swept up that they traded points on their own projects .\" They gave John points in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Star Wars for a piece of Big Wednesday , \" said George , who got Spielberg to reminisce about the debacle . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Everyone assumed Big Wednesday was going to be a big summer blockbuster , and when Steven and George read the script , they thought this was a beach - bound American Graffiti , with Jaws mixed in .Big Wednesday was a disaster , and Close Encounters and Star Wars each grossed around $ 600 million .\" How much did Milius make from his stakes in Close Encounters and Star Wars ? \"John would only go as far as to say that it helped pay for his divorce , \" George said .Milius still carries a heavy heart over the film 's failure . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fairness to Milius , Big Wednesday went on to become a cult classic when it was released on VHS ( Hollywood Do n't Surf co - director McGillivray filmed all the surfing action sequences for Milius ) .But we 're still waiting for the first true surf - driven film blockbuster .George - who co - wrote with director Stacy Peralta the seminal surf doc Riding Giants - said that surf movies did something important by redefining the way the world viewed Southern California - starting with Gidget in 1959 and continuing with 1960s AIP films like Beach Blanket Bingo .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It was about friendship , honor , heroes , and youth at a time of America 's transition from world exploration to world exploitation .Okay , and also about riding the Big One .That it has become a cult favorite despite what was done to it shows that there are still pockets of hope out there .Denny Aaberg shot a lot of 8 mm behind the scenes stuff when they were making BW and cut it into a really cool little twelve minute silent piece .Love it , it absolutely captures the feel of a long gone time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Big Wednesday got laughs of derision at the Director 's Guild premiere .The only authentic moment was the draft induction sequence in downtown L.A.

{"text": "It is a surf movie , a good one really , but it is the story wrapped around surfing that fails to deliver thus the movie failed .Point Break is cartoonish in their depiction of surfing lifestyles with too much \" bro \" and \" brah \" and wildly animated arm waving descriptions of what surfing means .The movie , in total , features very few surf scenes , so it is hard for me to believe anyone really thinks this as a representative \" surf movie \" .This is a straight up action flick , and not a bad one either .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "@Utah , your comment reflects a very limited view of surf movies , I could name you 10 movies that delve into the \" spiritual side \" of surfing and do it more sincerely than Point Break .The movie Litmus comes to mind immediately in this regard . \" surf 's up \" is only the latest example of this .it was a good movie , but failed to ignite any great interest at the box office .it could be that surfing , like its newer counter - culture offsprings , snow boarding and x - treme sports , are only interesting to a small portion of the movie going public and only up until it becomes too mainstream for the counter - culture to embrace it . once a counter - culture activity makes it to the big screen it is , by definition , too mainstream for that group to support . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That 's why they fail .When something like Point Break comes along , which is an action movie about surfers , everything works out much better .Jack Gilardi ( ICM ) deserves our thanks and credit for shepherding the iconic \" beach pictures \" from American International Pictures with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello .These pictures represent a successful Hollywood voyage into the world of surfing , albeit heavily stylized .I worked on Point Break , we never did Leo Carillo , but i feel your pain .We 'd be shooting the RANCH , getting decent waves all alone , then have to fit it together with crappy San Clemente ... didnt work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
