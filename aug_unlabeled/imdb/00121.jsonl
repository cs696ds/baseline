{"text": "So it seems that the EU Clone Wars comic book series brought back a dead Jedi , too .But does anyone care if they did it ... .I 'm a HUGE stickler for continuity , and i REALLY wish they would n't make such extreme changes like Ryloth or Mandalore , but I really do n't see a Jedi killed in a reference book being in the show as a big deal .Now , if they were killed in an actual STORY where it was confrmed they died , like Yareal Poof , then I 'd have a problem with them coming back .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
