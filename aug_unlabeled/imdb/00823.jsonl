{"text": "Errol Flynn , man in tights .To be sure , in his prime Flynn looked pretty good all over .Before satellite communications and the Internet , global celebrity was much more elusive but it lasted longer .Flynn 's background made him an unlikely candidate for fame 's innermost circle .Repackaged by the film studio publicity department , Flynn became an Irishman , a descendent of Fletcher Christian and a member of the Australian Olympic boxing team .Advertisement .An actual descendent on his mother 's side of another Bounty mutineer , Midshipman Edmund Young , Flynn had played Christian in the Australian film In the Wake of the Bounty ( 1933 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The studio fixed his hair and teeth , but did n't change his name , unlike John Wayne , Gary Cooper , Clark Gable , Cary Grant , Marilyn Monroe and the many other Hollywood stars for whom names were invented .To borrow a line from the Coen Brothers ' Barton Fink , Errol Flynn was a man in tights physically and mentally , especially physically .No man has worn tights ( or any other close - fitting period costume ) on the big screen with greater confidence and easy charm than Flynn playing Robin Hood in one of the very few films that seem destined never to date .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Flynn 's on - screen appeal was due to what James sardonically calls \" the physical perfection common to Australian males \" .James is wrong about Flynn being seen but not really heard .In Flynn 's mouth , heroic speeches have a rousing effect difficult to resist even now .Who else could have convincingly delivered this famous line from Captain Blood ( 1935 ) , when Flynn and the men under his command have just liberated themselves from slavery on a 17th century plantation in Jamaica and commandeered a ship : .Up that rigging , you monkeys !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are no chains to hold you now .Break out those sails and watch them fill with the wind that 's carrying us all to freedom !Certainly no other figure in popular culture has ever made piracy appear such a noble , ethical undertaking .Advertisement .Handsome , clean - limbed and charismatic as Flynn was in his 20s and 30s , he drank and drugged himself to death .After an immense run of success in a series of films from Captain Blood to Gentleman Jim ( 1942 ) , Flynn began the long and ever accelerating physical and psychological decline that resulted in financial ruin , abjection and mediocrity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "All the major organs were found to be diseased and the pathology report noted the near absence of liver and kidneys .The only medical question arising from his death was how Flynn , a sufferer in adult life from malaria , tuberculosis , hepatitis and gonorrhea in addition to gargantuan chemical addictions , could possibly have maintained a pulse for as long as he did .Even in his physical prime , there were recurring health problems .The malaria was picked up during Flynn 's youthful adventuring in New Guinea .In Gentlemen Jim , Flynn displays a fine physique and genuine boxing prowess , yet while filming a climactic fight scene he collapsed from a mild heart attack .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like John Wayne , another notable Hollywood non - combatant , Flynn won World War II in his movies , again never looking less than capable than when in uniform .In the propaganda war film Desperate Journey ( 1942 ) , Flynn plays an Australian airman whose bomber is shot down deep in enemy territory .Flynn 's last line in Desperate Journey , having made an impossible escape from the heart of the Reich , is \" Now for Australia and a crack at the Japs \" .In Objective , Burma !( 1945 ) , the Flynn character does get to fight the Japanese , albeit in the guise of an American paratrooper dropped into the Burmese jungle behind enemy lines .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Throughout the war , the studio continued to maintain the fiction of the rude health and virility of their major star .Suspicious of the real reason for Flynn 's absence from the military , FBI boss J.Edgar Hoover commissioned a secret report which revealed that he had an enlarged heart .Ultimately the camera does not lie .Indeed rarely , if ever , have the movies tracked with such precision the dissipation of a star so natural , so uninhibited , so artless , and , as it turned out , so vulnerable to the moral and physical diseases associated with celebrity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Flynn was in his Hollywood heyday one of the most lusted - after and admired people on earth , but within he soon developed a self - loathing that knew no bounds .Though Flynn would have never have been permitted to play an outright villain , the studio was happy to exploit his well - deserved notoriety as a rou\u00e9 .In Gentleman Jim , there is one such exploitative scene .After being kissed by Corbett , his girlfriend teases : \" Fine way for a gentleman to behave . \"He replies : \" Oh , darling , that gentleman stuff never fooled you , did it ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" In that case , \" she responds saucily , \" I 'm no lady \" .When it came time for Flynn to play Don Juan in 1949 , the script became an ironic commentary on Flynn himself .In one scene , a crowd of women gathers just to admire his physique , thus disrupting a serious fencing lesson being given by the master swordsman .Don 's international reputation as a rake precedes him wherever he goes , leading one fellow Spaniard to comment : \" Columbus extended the world but for you it grows smaller \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the scene where Don parts from the Queen of Spain , who like Elisabeth can not resist his manly charms , Flynn reveals that he is tired of the whole business of being a fantasy figure .\" You 've become a hero of the people , \" the Queen assures him . \"Have I ?Well then it must be easy to become a hero .\" When he says he must leave her , she asks him where he will go .\" Who knows ? \" he shrugs .\" Into oblivion I suppose , where most legends go \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But the dark side of heroism , that readiness on the part of the hero to collude in his own destruction , was part of the Flynn persona even in the early , relatively sober days .Flynn once wrote : \" I have a zest for living , yet twice an urge to die \" .So do several of his characters .Even the all - action Captain Blood , in a rare moment of reflection , wonders why he took all those risks in becoming a pirate : \" I never quite knew .Some urge that drove me on \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Prematurely middle - aged in these films , Flynn 's frame and face have thickened , his eyes have become dull and suspicious and his movements are weary .The rousing speeches are gone .In The Master of Ballantrae , Flynn takes charge of a pirate vessel without ceremony , and certainly no rhetoric about patriotism or the brotherhood of buccaneers : \" Alright men , get aloft and shake the wrinkles out of those sails .Get 'em up , come on .I said get aloft ! \"The crew is unmoved by the order and only starts obeying after Flynn strikes one of them with the flat of his sword .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In his last big budget Hollywood film , The Sun Also Rises ( 1957 ) , Flynn gained a measure of critical respect - he had long since ceased to be good box office - simply for being what he was by then , a sad drunk .At one point Flynn 's character Mike Campbell , a bankrupt Scottish aristocrat and faded war hero , wonders aloud why the drink waiters ignore him .\" The service around this town is getting worse and worse every night .Perhaps it 's me .As a matter of fact , I 'm afraid it is me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" I have been suggesting that Flynn did n't need to act like a hero , lover or indeed drunk in order to be convincing on the big screen .Flynn 's singularity as a screen presence is marked by the fact that his accent hardly wavered .Flynn left Australia in 1932 and never returned , taking American citizenship in 1942 .And despite the stubborn accent , Flynn is the only non - American actor to become a major success appearing in Westerns . \" Would n't you like to be protected , just a little ? \" importunes Flynn as roguish cattleman Clay Hardin , when commencing to woo saloon singer Alexis Smith in San Antonio ( 1945 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The response is suitably matter - of - fact . \" Yes ma'am .That 's how the West was settled .\" Perhaps Flynn was n't identified as an Australian , despite the accent , simply because the vast majority among the audience for his films really did n't know what an Australian sounded like .Flynn 's persona still exerts an influence over the cultural perception of Australian masculinity as physical rather than intellectual , rebellious and devil - may - care .It is an image that in Flynn moreover is highly sexualised .When Hugh Jackman , playing the larrikin drover , strips to the waist and soaps himself by an outback fireside in the up - market chick flick Australia , it is an entirely Flynn - like gesture .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
