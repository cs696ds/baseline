{"text": "I think they 're watching it right now , as a matter of fact .Being a huge Garfield fan the orignal cartoon series offers jokes that I still find funny 20 + years later .Also , the series provides typical \" life lessons \" through song and story for kids about sharing , forgiveness , and other nice things .This collection takes me back to Saturday mornings when I was a kid .Now I get to share the original Garfield ( before CG ) with my own children !I love that I have the opportunity to show it to them in such great quality too ! my almost 2 yr old loves Garfield we do n't let him watch t.v much but when he does its Garfield all the way . its a great classic and one I do n't get sick of watching its not terrible and annoying like some these days .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
