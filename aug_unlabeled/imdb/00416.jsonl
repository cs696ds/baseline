{"text": "Quicklinks .A Masterpiece .Amazing .Radio Days has got to be one of my absolute favorite films of all time .To me , it 's a film that balances story , characters and atmosphere better than just about any other .It 's truly a great work of art , and a very , very underrated one .The best thing about it is how Allen 's love for his subject , the romantic nostalgia he feels , translates so eloquently to the screen .You 've also got to hand it to the cast .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Allen had Santo Loquasto , his art director , do a bang - up job on creating the world of early-1940s Rockaway , New York , and Jeffrey Kurland 's costumes help immensely .Particularly note - worthy is Carlo Di Palma 's stunning cinematography .The colours , the smoky nightclubs and soundstages , the dimly - lit nighteries and the dazzling rooftop set come to life like few sets do in films .And then there 's the music .That dazzling array of classic music , from one of the best periods for it in American history .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And there 's always the Radio Show Themes piece by Dick Hyman ( I 'm always by that name ) that accompanies many of the scenes .That piece of music alone is worth seeing the film .As you can probably tell , I love this film simply for the fact that it 's such a charming , enchanting , beautiful film .It 's one I 'd show my children , even the nude dancing scene , had I any children to show it to .Woody Allen 's turn in the films he 's made lately ( as of 2003 ) are , to me , pretty depressing and perverse , with none of the charm , life and humor that works like Radio Days symbolize , Sweet and Lowdown notwithstanding .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Woody Allen 's own \" Amarcord \" .What a beautiful , kind , gentle , ironic , warm , sentimental ( in a very good way and yes , I am talking about Woody Allen 's movie , that 's right ) yet perfectly balanced delight .It is a series of sketches about young Joe ( young Allen , of course , played by Seth Green - that was a surprise ) , an adolescent in Brooklyn , NY during 1930s-1940s who was passionately in love with radio which was a king .but loving relatives and a very funny comedy ( the way only Allen 's comedy can be ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Where gorgeous Diane Keaton sings and Diane Wiest , his beloved Aunt Bea never gives up hope of one true love .He never told us if she found it ... .\" I never forgot that New Year 's Eve when Aunt Bea awakened me to watch 1944 come in .I 've never forgotten any of those people or any of the voices we would hear on the radio .Though the truth is , with the passing of each New Year 's Eve , those voices do seem to grow dimmer and dimmer .\" The Radio days are gone but thanks to Allen , the voices of the times passed are still clear and sound and they always will be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This movie shouts one word : WARMTH .The colors , the plot , the characters , they are all wonderfully warm .I 've watched this movie with senior citizens who were around in the forties .I once watched it with a Jewish guy who grew up on Long Island ( albeit in the early 30 's , not the 40 's ) .All comments were the same : THIS was life in New York during wartime .Vietnam was my war , so this era was a mystery to me .However , any time a genius like Woody Allen can create a film that not only makes me and my rowdy friends laugh , but gets guffaws from my dear old Mom as well , it deserves a little fanfare .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you are looking for the normal amount of big laughs from a Woody Allen film , then you will be disappointed here .It 's not that kind of film .I was anything but disappointed , but I knew what the film was all about before I saw it .Actually , what drew me to it was that I had read where this was a wonderful visual film , filled with rich colors and great set designs .It did not let me down .This is a great visual tribute to the 1940s , to be exact from 1938 to 1944 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The story centers around a Jewish family in Queens and the importance that radio shows had in that day - and - age .Also profiled in here are some of those radio performers .It does have laughs but not as many as the normal Allen movie because the idea of this is simply to be a nostalgic piece , mainly Allen 's tribute to his own family days of growing up , what it was like around his house .It was interesting to see Seth Green playing Woody as a youngster with flaming red hair .The most interesting person , however , was Diane Wiest who played a man - chasing sister - in - law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Overall , it 's simply a nice film .... and gorgeous to look at .Sometimes I think some of Allen 's work is overrated but , boy , here is one that is definitely underrated .Everybody 's Family .This is a wonderful wonderful movie that exemplifies the phrase , \" misty watercolored memories .\" It is a joy to watch and listen to .The era before and during WWII , however , was anything but wonderful .Radio Days presents a time when America was dealing with the Great Depression and its after effects and the horrible event that was World War II .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" No movies , except this one , that I recall , are able to deal with this critical age in American history without conveying the tragic time that it was .I would like to think this family was really Woody Allen 's , but it is probably a work of fiction , like his other pieces .But how tremendous that he can create ( or remember ) these people .As I watched it , one thought that kept recurring was that these were not \" beautiful \" manufactured people like we see in the media today ; they had big hips and were fat and poor and ... and none of that mattered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They were believable .You ca n't watch this movie without wondering what happened to them , did Aunt Bee find a husband ?You cared about this family and personally , I wished they were mine .The vignettes were sad and sweet .My favorite was poor departed Kirby Kyle ; at least he had heart !And Leonard ; and \" donations for the promotion of a state in Palestine . \"So many memories that make us a part of a family most people never had .The viewer belongs to this warm and loving group .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Radio Days reminds us that having someone to experience life with is a treasure and a blessing , despite whacks on the head , martians , and fish , \" That man always brings home fish ! \"Recollecting Can Be Meaningful .I thought I was being original when I made the connection between Woody Allen 's \" Radio Days \" and Federico Fellini 's \" Amarcord , \" but I was being naive .The parallels are so transparent it is of no surprise that most of the IMDB reviewers ( and I imagine those others as well ) caught the similarity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It also cements my conclusion that Woody Allen is the only director who \" spoofs \" great art films and artistic styles , confirmed by his tributes to Ingmar Bergman and German Expressionists .All that aside , \" Radio Days \" is , second of all , a look at Allen 's childhood memories weaved together by radio .It 's the story of his family ( his large and extended family and neighborhood personages ) , their likes , dislikes , relationships and favorite radio shows .They are inextricably connected as genetic members of a family , but also more intangibly linked by radio broadcasts , to which they listen to individually as well as collectively .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They also share great love for one another , though they quibble like all human beings do .In fact , that tender quibbling , love and loss and understanding is what makes Allen 's characters come to life so successfully - no wonder he speaks of them with warmth .What \" Radio Days \" is about first of all and foremost , is nostalgia .The film would only be a heartwarming family tale and nothing more if it were not \" recollected \" by Woody Allen , the narrator .His role in the film ( in which he never physically appears ) is that of a story - teller .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And it is he , not the characters in the film as much , who experiences the nostalgia , the central theme of \" Radio Days . \"In narrating his memories , Allen is able to distance himself from them temporally .He is telling a tale that borders on fantasy , such as that on whose form nostalgic memories take place .There is a bittersweet yearning for the past and a realization that memories must inevitably fade , change , yield to time 's destructiveness .Re - telling them not only reveals how one thinks life once was ( usually painted over with warmth and pleasantness ) , but also oneself and the knowledge that these times are no longer physically accessible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In \" Radio Days \" that past is warm and Allen 's yearning for that warmth and childish innocence is what pervades the film so well giving it its nostalgic quality .And nostalgia , the film seems to suggest , is a feeling worth experiencing .If one can glance back at his life and feel a longing towards the past , a warmth emanating from his memories , then he remembers life as having been kind to him .Even if the details flee from the mind ( as they inevitably do ) and only the feelings inspired by hazy memories remain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , waddaya know , Woody does have a heart after all . . . .In preface , let me say that I was born at the tail - end of the \" golden age of radio , \" but just in time to experience a touch of its magic and the hold it had on households night after night in that pre - TV era .It all adds up to my absolutely having to go see \" Radio Days \" when it first came out , despite the fact that I 'd never been the world 's foremost Woody Allen fan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\"Well , I was wrong about Woody .This film shows it . \"Remotes , \" or on - the - spot broadcasts transported them to the scene of unfolding tragedies or triumphs in a way that newspapers never could ( and which TV , for all its advantages , rarely matches ) .Standouts ?The whole cast is perfect , but for me , in addition to those previously mentioned , I have to cit Mia Farrow 's portrayal of the dim - bulbed Sally White , who transforms herself with the aid of speech lessons into a radio personality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Criticisms ?One : At the end of a poignant scene in which young Joe has finally discovered what his dad does for a living , Allen insists on falling into some standby \" schtick \" in his voiceover .( I guess he could n't resist ; thankfully , it does n't ruin the moment . )Ultimately , of course , it is the era itself that this film celebrates .Faithfully , and lovingly , it is recreated with a skill that points up its absurdities at the same time it makes one hopefully nostalgic .And , if you 're not very careful , you wind up falling hopelessly in love with this funny , obscure Brooklyn family .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "well photographed trip in time .Woody 's best \" memory \" piece has great set designs , a sad and funny script and the usual great , well chosen cast , including a very young Seth Green playing Allen as a boy .Diane Wiest and Julie Kavner excel strongly in the female leads , Allen 's voice narrates the whole picture , and Mia Farrow squeaks deliciously as a bimbo cigarette girl who gets a culture make - over .This is the only Allen movie that both Farrow and Diane Keaton appear in ( she has a very brief cameo singing a song in a night club . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The story becomes even more poignant as you age .Watch it repeatedly over different stages of your life ... .A wonderfully nostalgic , funny and historically interesting film .In my opinion , Radio Days is right up there with Annie Hall though it 's different in that it 's following several people 's lives .Woody does n't act in this , but his narration is excellent .He takes the wonderful old songs and commercials from that time and weaves them into the story .I was completely captivated .It 's not a \" laugh a minute \" type film , but it also gets you thinking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Check out the Jewish fasting holiday scene .I 've watched it at least 6 times and I still laugh .Also the scene with Mia Farrow 's character was superb .One of my favorite lines is when she tells a top radio producer in her high - pitched nasal voice , \" Jeez .We ca n't keep meeting like this .In the backs of cars , movie theaters and stalled elevators .You 're gon na lose your respect for me !\" I love this film .Wistful , Sweet , and Excellent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Set against long - forgotten radio programs , hit songs , and the coming of World War II , we get two narrative threads .The Rockaway family dealing with everyday issues in a series of vignettes , and the fictional life of Sally White ( Mia Farrow ) as she rises from cigarette girl to glittering radio star .The cast is excellent .Farrow has a solid role as the Brooklyn girl with the Judy Holliday voice who battles her way toward upward mobility .Julie Kavner and Michael Tucker are terrific as the parents .Dianne Wiest is sweet as Aunt Bea , always on the lookout for true love .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Diane Keaton and Kitty Carlisle show up as singers .Josh Mostel and Renee Lippin are hilarious as the aunt and uncle .Wallace Shawn has a funny bit as the \" Masked Avenger . \"Highlights include Bea 's date on the night of Orson Welles ' famous radio program about a Martian invasion , and the poignant episode about the live radio coverage of a girl who 's fallen down a well .The film also takes nostalgic looks at radio serials , quiz programs , and comedy shows .The film perfectly captures the middle class neighborhood of Allen 's youth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
