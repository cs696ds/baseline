{"text": "Top Customer Reviews .Twenty - nine years ago this movie had a strange effect on me , I left the cinema with a profound feeling of joy According to what I have read , the movie is unscripted and the acting improvised , this comes across very clearly .The sound quality is sometimes poor .We are shown a series of ' tableaux ' , in which some very perturbed , gruesome characters play out their daily life centred on drugs , sex and misery .Joe , an impotent heroine addict , is constantly looking for his next hit and constantly coming across women who want to make love with him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These two characters and the fauna who surround them get into the most absurd and unlikely situations .The movie is sprinkled throughout with humour and grim reality , a dichotomy which works disturbs and delights .One finds oneself passing from disgust to a belly laugh in a matter of seconds and this is where the strength of the movie lies .To be brief , here is a little gem which is well worth seeing , an absurd drug - sex comedy with much artistic talent .For adults only . 1 Comment 13 of 14 people found this helpful .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yes No Sending feedback ... .When I saw this movie back in the l970s , I was knocked out of my BVD 's with Joe the Magnificent .I had never seen a creature like him before : gorgeous , tough , sweet , funny and sex personified .I 've read where this movie was NOT improvised , that Paul Morrisey adhered to a professional script and was a strict , but creative director .Then , I 've heard it was just the opposite .I really do n't think Joe was faking his drug induced stupor , expressions , mumblings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Gross is too mild a word .That drooling wet mouth and buck teeth , her bloated figure , yuck !I wish that sad little lost child , Andrea Feldman , had a bigger part .Thankfully , she was showcased in Andy Warhol 's HEAT , another favorite .Once I was in the Village during that time and my boyfriend told me Joe Dellasandro was walking just ahead .I fled -- not wanting to see a real embodiment of a movie icon .The same thing happened when Liz Taylor left the theater each night during her starring role in \" The Little Foxes \" during the 80s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But when I 'd see the stage door open and she began to make her exit , I fled .Reality 's a nice place to visit but I would n't want to live there .Got ta run and watch Joe , my Joe , my wonderful Joe in \" Trash . \"A real underground classic .1 Comment 15 of 19 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .Paul Morrissey 's film \" Trash \" , a fascinating glimpse into film history , is probably the first extremely popular underground film ( following on the heels of \" The Chelsea Girls \" and \" Flesh \" ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Filmed with a handheld camera and including long takes of actors spouting bizarre dialogue .Warhol Superstars Joe Dallesandro and Holly Woodlawn are baptized by fire in this oddity , a must for anyone interested in cinema verite and the New York underground movement .Comment 7 of 8 people found this helpful .Was this review helpful to you ?Yes No Sending feedback ... .A military brat who ran wild , Joe Dallesandro did a number of nude modeling jobs for \" physique \" magazines before he stumbled into Warhol in 1967 .Warhol might have been problematic as an artist , but he did have a talent for surrounding himself with the extreme personalities from which he fed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But there is really only one reason to watch any of them , and that is hope that Dallesandro will get naked .And very often he does .The simple truth is that Morrissey , who typically wrote , edited , and directed these films , is extremely bad at all three .There 's not much in the way of plot or script , and it seems Morrissey worked by creating a written outline of the scene and then letting his actors riff on it in bad improvisation for the actual filming .As for acting , you can pretty much forget about it , for none of the performers are actors in any real sense : they are who they are , which to say they are entirely without talent but they are vaguely interesting because they themselves are so extreme .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
