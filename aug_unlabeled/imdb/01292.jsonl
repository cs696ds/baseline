{"text": "Nine films about babies : ' Raising Arizona , ' ' Knocked Up ' .by Bill Goodykoontz - May.In \" What to Expect When You 're Expecting , \" Kirk Jones brings the Heidi Murkoff instructional books about pregnancy and childbirth -- if you 've had a kid , you 've doubtless read one -- to fictional life .That 's probably for the best ; two hours of explaining the proper way to prop a baby on your shoulder while burping her would get old fast .They say animals and kids are tough to work with in films .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But we 've dug up nine that will pass the time nicely while you 're waiting for colic to subside . \" Raising Arizona \" ( 1987 ) : Maybe the Coen brothers ' wackiest film , in which Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter , unable to have a child of their own , decide to steal one of another family 's quintuplets .Unhinged from the start , but really funny .\" She 's Having a Baby \" ( 1988 ) : John Hughes grows up .Stepping away from his Brat Pack films , Hughes wrote and directed this film about a young couple ( Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern ) going through the ups and downs of a new marriage and pregnancy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Knocked Up \" ( 2007 ) : Judd Apatow 's comedy about a mismatched couple ( Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl ) whose one - night stand leads to her pregnancy is crude , hilarious and heartfelt ( as Apatow 's best films tend to be ) .What 's even more impressive is how Apatow makes Heigl 's Type - A TV producer a likable character , something other directors have had a little less luck with . \" Rosemary 's Baby \" ( 1968 ) : Rosemary ( Mia Farrow ) has a terrible dream in which she is assaulted by a demon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Roman Polanski 's horror film is a classic , particularly in its depiction of the casual Satanists next door .Ruth Gordon won an Oscar as one of those neighbors .A great movie . \"Juno \" ( 2007 ) : Some of the hipper - than - thou dialogue Diablo Cody won an Oscar for writing has already started to age a bit .But Ellen Page is so charming spouting those words , as a precocious teenager who gets pregnant with her nice - guy boyfriend ( Michael Cera ) , that Jason Reitman 's film holds up nicely . \" Baby Mama \" ( 2008 ) : Tina Fey ca n't have a baby so she hires Amy Poehler as a surrogate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Has the Judd Apatow vibe and helped pave the way for \" Bridesmaids .\" Maybe . \"The Hand That Rocks the Cradle \" ( 1992 ) : Cheesy horror film , but Rebecca De Mornay is good as a psychotic woman , set off by the suicide of her husband , poses as a nanny to worm her way into the perfect family .Ultimately kind of silly , but De Mornay has her moments in which she 's pretty scary . \" Baby Boom \" ( 1987 ) : Diane Keaton plays a hard - charging New York businesswoman who inherits a baby girl .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
