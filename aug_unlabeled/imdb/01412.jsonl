'", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Had Charles Bronson starred , it would be hard to distinguish the plot of the ' The Brave One ' from that of any of the ' Death Wish ' pictures .Foster plays Erica Bain , the host of a successful New York radio talk show .When she and her fiancee David ( Naveen Andrews of \" Lost \" ) are brutally attacked by a gang of thugs in Central Park , resulting in David 's death , Erica retreats into a spiral of unrelenting fear .Then , only weeks later ( in the first of many coincidences ) , Erica witnesses a brutal murder at a convenience store and totally snaps .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As the press reports on the actions of New York 's apparent new savior , idealistic Detective Mercer ( Terrence Howard ) takes notice of the reign of terror .Digging deeper into the crimes , and realizing that the killer may be a woman , Mercer quickly suspects that Erica may be the likely culprit .As the plot grows more and more improbable , a final , shocking \" twist \" brings the pair together , leaving Mercer to act as Erica 's judge , jury , and possible executioner .The early scenes of ' The Brave One ' did n't gel for me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He paints the Erica - David romance in completely one - note , gooey - romantic terms , but frankly , Foster and Andrews have zero chemistry .With Foster never able to create a believable , three - dimensional character , all of the film 's subsequent efforts to make resonant cultural statements ring hollow .The Brave One ' also wallows in the stuff it is supposedly rallying against .To his credit , Jordan does n't linger on the gore , but he subtly stokes the audience 's hunger for brutality by staging Erica 's vigilante activities as crowd - pleasing moments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wo n't ruin the film 's surprise by discussing it 's plot twist resolution , but I will say that it really pissed me off .It 's a total cheat .The decision Mercer makes in the final minute runs so completely contrary to how his character has been set up that it violates the basics of cohesive storytelling .In hindsight , the filmmakers obviously shoehorned most of the plot developments into the script to serve its \" ambiguous \" ending , rather than letting the concluding events naturally unfold from what came before .What a crock !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As compelling cinema , ' The Brave One ' is hardly brave at all .The Video : Sizing Up the Picture .Warner presents ' The Brave One ' in 1080p / VC-1 video , framed at 2.40:1 .It 's not as a gritty a transfer as you might think , but a very polished and good - looking presentation that is sure to please .Funny enough , the photography of ' The Brave One ' may actually be too slick for its own good .There is a slight bit of graininess to the picture , but otherwise it 's so glossy that I longed for more of the exploitation - flick feel of a ' Death Wish .

{"text": "Fleshtones are as good as possible considering the overt stylization .Given the film 's big budget , even nighttime scenes are quite well - lit , so shadow delineation is thus superior and detail is generally strong .Only occasionally did image depth seem a tad less dimensional than the absolute best high - def I 've seen , but that 's a small complaint .This is a very , very nice transfer from Warner .The Audio : Rating the Sound .

{"text": "C'mon , Warner -- you can do better than this .Deleted Scenes ( SD , 12 minutes ) - This montage of scene extensions and a few extra character bits is decent , but far from revelatory .The presentation has a thrifty , slap - it - on - a - disc - quickly feel , with no optional commentary , no text introduction , and not even chapter stops for each scene -- it 's just one long , big lump of a montage .On top of that , none of the video extras on the disc are in HD -- only mediocre 480p / MPEG-2 video .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
