{"text": "Both of those important horror films are now readily available on disc .Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz 's Messiah of Evil may be the title that completes the set of early 70 's rare horror offerings .The Code Red Company 's new DVD loads this long - missing horror opus with tantalizing extras .We UCLA film students of the early 1970s were constantly reminded of the successes of the graduates that preceded us by only a few years .Francis Coppola was the most noted but plenty of other prize - winning student filmmakers were just beginning to make a dent in Hollywood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "1 This was the pack that already had accomplished , progressive films under their belts when producers went looking for hot talent to direct features for the post- Easy Rider generation .UCLA 's Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz gained considerable prestige with their student work ( examples of which are contained on the disc ) and were soon engaged helping writing the script for George Lucas ' American Graffiti .Seeing a few months of downtime while that project languished , the filmmaking couple were offered an assignment to make a low - budget horror film , and decided to do something different .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The movie rejects contemporary trends in search of weird moods and half - explained relationships .Art figures heavily in the film 's design and adds strongly to its impact .Most of the movie plays out in a beach house with an interior designed around mural art ; Huyck and Katz are fond of compositions that maroon living human figures against stylized mural backgrounds . 3Among other locations , the film is a record of the exterior of The Fox Venice Theater , a serious UCLA movie destination of our college years , and a main venue for The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Arletty Long ( Mariana Hill of Black Zoo , Red Line 7000 , The Traveling Executioner and Medium Cool ) travels to the remote California beach art colony town of Point Dune to check in with her artist father Joseph ( Royal Dano ) .Joseph has warned Arletty not to come near , and on the outskirts of Point Dune she has a strange encounter with a spaced - out albino ( Bennie Robinson ) .The lavish but spooky Long house is empty .Arletty observes figures burning bonfires on the beach .Local wino Charlie ( Elisha Cook Jr. ) warns Arletty that she 'll be forced to kill her own father .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The creepy Thom continues to hit on Arletty as the atmosphere becomes even more oppressive .The jealous Laura and the bored Toni leave on their own , to meet terrible fates on the streets of Point Dune .The centennial of the Blood Moon is visited upon the townspeople , all of whom bleed from the eyes and become cannibalistic ghouls -- as they await the second coming of The Stranger .Messiah of Evil makes a blessing of its limited resources -- the mannered direction relies on master shots and formal , old - school compositions .What might seem a lot of nothing in somebody else 's picture gains shape and menace in terrific set piece sequences : even the emptiness is creepy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thom is trapped after midnight in a seemingly endless small town center of closed stores sporting brilliant neon signs , an Edward Hopper nightmare .In a brightly lit supermarket , Laura wanders down the empty aisles as if touring a museum of consumerism ... until she comes upon a crowd of ghouls having a feast in the meat section .Although the film only suggests its cannibalistic details , the basic zombies - go - shopping concept of the later Dawn of the Dead is here and intact .Odd flashbacks to pioneer days prepare us for a bloody apocalypse under the Blood Moon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Her father 's portraits begin bleeding from the eyes , just as do the cursed townspeople .But she takes no overt action , which allows the beautifully constructed menace of the first hour to stall somewhat .A couple of startling encounters , cannibal attacks on Main Street and a final assault on the house re - energize the screen for the conclusion .Huyck and Katz wrap things up with an effective Caligari story - within - a - story motif , that almost compensates for the lack of a socko finish .With its odd approach Messiah of Evil collects a gallery of creepy moments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Mariana Hill is excellent as usual ; her quiet reactions to all the weird activity make it seem all the more believable .Fans will enjoy seeing Anitra Ford ( Invasion of the Bee Girls ) in a more rounded performance than is usual .Cult actress Joy Bang is at the end of her short film career , at age 25 .Michael Greer sends mixed signals as both a sincere researcher and a rather reprehensible hedonist ; we are n't sure why Arletty trusts him , even for a moment .Code Red 's DVD of Messiah of Evil is an excellent transfer of a good - quality film print .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some wide night shots are a bit soft .The audio is carefully designed but has some technical flaws , in that sound effects and voices sometimes seem out of sync by a few frames .Code Red 's Lee Christian moderates a commentary with the filmmakers , who acknowledge the show 's rarity ; it has n't been seen in ' Scope since it came out .They identify the anxious victim in the first scene as future writer - director Walter Hill .Bill L. Norton , another director of note , plays a zombie extra .Christian 's very entertaining docu Remembering Messiah of Evil brings in more of the film 's creative participants , giving a full picture of what it was like for a group of cinematic aspirants trying to lend the film some class .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
