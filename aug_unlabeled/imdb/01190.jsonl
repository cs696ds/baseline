{"text": "Recent reviews .Not great at all .The odd joke that 's okay , but it 's a lame spoof .The film has a big name cast , that 's it .So it could easily make people think it 's gon na be good , well you 'd be disappointed .The story follows a bunch of people that go hunting for this money .There 's about 5 different stories going on about how they are trying to get to the money .This film has the odd joke or to that 's okay , but I 'm sure the rest , if not the whole thing would only entertain kids with no taste in comedy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Seth Green 's story was really boring , and very predictable .I did n't need a crystal ball to tell what was going to happen to them .Cuba Godding Jr. 's story was just as boring .The typical stuff .It 's very unoriginal altogether .Whoopie Goldberg 's story is average , just like the vast majority of this film .However , Rowan Atkinson 's story had it 's moments , but you could n't help but think A scene of Mr. Bean accidentally got put into Rat Race , so it 's too late for Atkinson ; he 's already a type - cast ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This film would n't be in my \" worst films list \" .Although Lovit 's High School High is straight in there ............. .I think this film is really average .It 's one of those film you would only watch if you were bored , I was at the time , so I 'm only going on my experience .Otherwise - Avoid .I have to agree with the top most voted review on this film , so let me say that again : The TOP voted .This film is way overrated .Almost everything says this film is powerful , intense , shocking ... well , I do n't think so or believe so .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And it also really does n't help that Deniro / Scorsese fans keep calling this a \" masterpiece \" Okay , I can understand why some may like it , but I would never call this a masterpiece .And yeah , it may be a classic , but just because it is , it does n't mean it 's good , that 's just a phrase for \" well - know \" .This is proof that not all the classics are good .I even found this quite pretentious honestly .Also , people say all the time that Travis Bickel is cool and is a great film character , well to me he was just an ordinary guy who was misguided .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Again , it seems I 'm in the minority .Jodie Foster was great , as always .I think De Niro is okay , but it 's certainly not his best performance , he never was a favourite of mine .Scorsese films are really boring , and they 're all the same thing , just a different film title .I 'm not a fan .This film has got be one of the most overrated and boring films ever .Just like most of his films ... .So , yeah , overrated , boring and now thanks to the creepy obsessive Taxi Driver fans , it 's now pretentious .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you saw something in this film that I did n't , you 're either delusional , an idiot or a liar .I really did n't like this film that much .Swearing and fighting appeals to the lowest common denominator of humanity .Maybe it was funny that Eligh Wood got beaten up a bit , but I still did n't like it .This type of stuff makes Great Britain look like a place of dirty crap , and I say this in the nicest way possible .Football hooligans and stuff like that I do n't like .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I would avoid this totally .But , if you want to hear such appalling use of the English language , then by all means , watch this crap .Well , to be honest , this is not really my kind of film anyway but I looked past that and attempted to look into the whole awareness and what message this film was supposed to send out .And it sort of worked .And , in parts , just damn right boooring !But , I believe that there are people out there who will enjoy this film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As a final say on this film , it 's not something I would like to see again .How is this film ' weird ' ?Obviously the people calling this film that and such , have yet to see a truly weird film , or are just in need of a dictionary .This has to be one of the most overrated and dated films ever made .I just do n't get it .Oh , wait , maybe because there truly is nothing to actually ' get ' .Is it that hard to figure out ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Kubrick got it all wrong , way wrong .He 's like a totally different person , in fact , so is the whole damn thing .I think the director was having a bit of a laugh .Has Kubrick no dignity ?He should have read the book beforehand and then have made the film , jeez , I think that 's the least I could have expected from him .Plus , this film was really boring .It 's like futuristic Britain ? rofl , how 's that then ?It just looks like it 's 1970 's Britain , Stanley was n't even trying , and you people all fell for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
