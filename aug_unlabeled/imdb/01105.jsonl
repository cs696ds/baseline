{"text": "Well , yeah , that and The Postman and Revenge and The Bodyguard and Tin Cup and Message in a Bottle and 3000 Miles to Graceland and Dragonfly and that ridiculous accent in the otherwise entertaining Robin Hood Prince of Thieves .I do n't hate him but he just seems to be playing himself most of the time e.g. the \" Julia Roberts syndrome \" .But I love Dances with wolves and Field of dreams but could n't get into The Postman ( if I remember correctly , did Tom Petty portray himself ? ) or Sizzle Beach USA .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I would n't say many of his hated movies are awful , even the Postman was ok in many respects .But when your best is mediocre and your worst is ...3000 miles to graceland , well , blah .And I will add that Costner ai n't much of an actor .While he 's not terrible , his range is lacking and his voice sometimes just sounds like he 's reading lines .Granted I think that 's just how it is ... but it 's not the most compelling thing in the world .But where is the old quality ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "he just fell from those heights what can I say .I think he 's generally given a free pass these days with people hating Ben Affleck , Halle Berry , and so forth .But I suspect the simple answer is that he got so popular a decade or so ago and when he had the ability to do almost anything he wanted , and people did n't really like what he did .People in general did n't like Waterworld or The Postman and so he got attacked for it .If he was n't so popular before hand or the projects were n't so big , then it probably would n't be the same .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The flops like Waterworld and the impression that he is a bit egomaniacal did n't help .The fact that he is a somewhat two - dimensional actor does n't help either .I think it boils down , largely , to over - exposure for about 2 years there .Take Edward Burns for example .He constantly directs himself in films and is also a pretty two - dimensional actor , but no one starts \" I hate Edward Burns \" threads because he is n't in every moviegoers face all the time .Heck , you have to go to a coffeehouse theater or a film festival just to see one of his films usually .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think that he does better when he has a good cast around him ( Robid Hood , No Way Out , Silverado . . .the last being his best performance , as far as I concerned ) .That does n't mean that I think those movies are bad . . .I just think that he is n't able to brong them to their full potential with his skills alone ._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Hooray for sarcasm : \" I laughed so hard , I vomited a little .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I love many of Costner 's films , I would consider JFK , Bull Durham , Field of Dreams , and A Perfect World masterpieces .No Way Out , Waterworld , Tin Cup , The Untouchables , and Silverado are very good films IMHO .Nine good movies can be considered a decent career , it just his bad movies are so bad , i.e. The Bodyguard , Postman , 3000 miles , and Wyatt Earp that it is easy to focus on that part of his career .But Kevin Costner as Robin Hood was not , unfortunately .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
