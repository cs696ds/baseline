{"text": "But why a film ?Seriously , Bereft is an unmistakeably visual book ; multiple scenes evoke a drifting widescreen camera , like a vulture hovering over a fresh carcass .It 's partly the sensory element , the mentions of arid heat , sweat and grime , but also the loneliness and isolation .There are flashbacks , but beyond the exposition putting Quint 's return in context they 're generally concerned with memories he ca n't or wo n't talk to other people about - death and how people deal with it , or fail to .There 's a readily identifiable streak of deliberate , stylised artistry , too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Is this a literary thing ?No , the touchy subjects are much more than just an exercise in wordy cleverness : they 're a source of real dramatic tension as well .Quint and Sophie are as much the hunted as the hunters , and the need to find out whether he finds closure is an immediate thrill as much as a cerebral one , coffee at four in the morning as well as the Sistine Chapel .The stakes are set fairly high from the outset - while Womersley does n't pretend Quint is that different from any of the millions of other servicemen in the conflict , Bereft deals with savage physical wounds as well as bone - deep , lasting psychological damage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For all her childlike bravado , Sophie clearly realises she 's desperately vulnerable even with Quint around , and Womersley tightens the noose to fantastic effect during the confrontation that closes the novel .Who could pull this off ?In a perfect world ?Malick could take on Bereft , maybe ; there 'd be plenty of opportunities for meticulously composed landscape shots , or hallucinogenic philosophising .Womersley 's prose has the bite of genre fiction , though , a rougher , less disciplined approach .Still , the emotional language and choice of symbolism - angry , wounded men in an angry , wounded landscape - might suit someone like John Hilcoat if he could ease the throttle back a notch , or perhaps Glendining if he could open it up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Either way , Bereft would be a tremendous movie in the right hands .You 'd have to play up the fantastical aspects to avoid it falling into niche territory .It 'd take more money , but Bereft 's story is plainly more than something flavour of the month or rich white people putting their angst up on a pedestal , and treating it with respect could pay dividends .Too strange and forbidding to pass for awards bait - who 's going to cheer for The Proposition meets Lawn Dogs ? - Bereft is still sufficiently gripping , transporting and deeply compassionate so that any film adaptation done right would net a sizeable audience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
