{"text": "That said , the film certainly has its followers and if you are one of them this new blu ray will delight you .If you are not - well - however good the transfer , this rather dated tale of \" sexy \" \" vampires \" on the loose in London wo n't appeal !So what I 'm reviewing is the quality of the blu ray on offer , here is my take on the technical spec . of the new disc .Arrow offers a fine AVC encoded 1080p transfer in an expansive 2.35:1 . format in which Hooper oversaw both the restoration and transfer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is no evidence of digital messing around either so that clear , but unobtrusive , grain remains .Any softness - and there is some - I 'm sure comes from the source material .There is a lossless DTS - HD Master Audio 5.1 and a 2.0 track .The 5.1 track provides some stunning immersive effects and does full justice to both the dialogue and Henry Mancini 's ( very untypical ) score .Undoubtedly both spectacular and sexually explicit , this horror romp - vaguely reminiscent of Nigel Kneal meets Paul Raymond - wo n't please everyone , but few can disagree over the excellent quality of these two new transfers and the extensive and impressive extras on offer too !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Sure there are lots of cliches like that and plenty of macho behaviour here but on the whole it works for me .I especially love the creature 's transformation at the end .This movie has had more than its fair share of bad reviews but there are many people who appreciate it .Thanks for the re - issue as my VHS version was showing its age .Presented in widescreen so you miss none of the action , the only negative point in my view is the lack of any extras .Possibly the only place you will hear the words \" Mission Control Great Britain \" uttered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Please try again later .Lifeforce ' is terrible .Almost .Actually , it 's quite good fun .And terrible .Work that one out for yourself .It 's one of those films that tries to be really great , as if it has aspirations that it 's going to be the next ' Godfather ' film , only to end up being more akin to ' Flash Gordon .

{"text": "Like I say , Lifeforce thinks it 's dark and mysterious and going to be the next ' Alien ' movie , yet it never quite manages it .The dialogue is cheesy , the special effects not that special and its main selling point is the fact that the lead actress spends her time in a state of full undress .But it tries .And , in some way , that kind of makes up for its failings .You ca n't help but feel kindly towards the film because it really does its best to live up to what it wants to be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Once they board it , they unleash a trio of hungry alien vampires upon England .Now it 's up to the only surviving American space pilot from the mission and an SAS colonel to hunt her down and stop her sleeping her way through the nation 's men .It 's the kind of film where you have to ( a ) know what you 're getting and ( b ) be in the mood for .If you 're expecting an epic sci - fi drama which is truly terrifying and/or you 're hoping for action aplenty , then you 're probably better off watch one or other of Alien or Species .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
