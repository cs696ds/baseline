{"text": "Neatorama presents a guest post from actor , comedian , and voiceover artist Eddie Deezen .Visit Eddie at his website .Most of us who grew up watching and loving the Marx Brothers will agree on one thing -these guys were very , very funny , very talented , very creative , maybe the most surreal of all characters in the history of motion pictures .Okay , ever heard of a seldom - seen or talked - about 1957 film called The Story of Mankind ?Well , The Story of Mankind , it is universally agreed on , is a pretty rotten movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is also their only full - length color film .The Story of Mankind was sort of a mixed blessing ( like many movies , come to think of it ) : yes , we get to see the Marx Brothers , and any Marx Brothers is better than no Marx Brothers .But Chico , the oldest brother , was a full 70 years old , and brothers Groucho and Harpo were in their late 60s .The boys were a bit long in the tooth by this time .It was a bit like the classic Beatles reunion so many hoped for , but with the Fab Four in their 50s or 60s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The film was one of the first examples of a true \" all - star cast . \" Hollywood has since learned , several times , that the greatest , most colorful casts in the world do not an entertaining or popular film make .The casting is intriguing , to say the least .Groucho Marx is cast as Peter Minuet , the guy who bought Manhattan Island from the Indians for $ 24 .Brother Harpo is cast as Sir Isaac Newton ( ? ? ? ) , and brother Chico , in a possibly a sly , sarcastic swipe at his well - known career as a ladies man , is cast as a monk .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Vincent Price is the Devil .Dennis Hopper chews up the scenery as Napoleon , Agnes Moorehead is Queen Elizabeth I , Peter Lorre hams it up as Nero , And Ronald Coleman , in his surely regrettable final film , is cast as \" the spirit of man . \"John Carradine plays \" Khufu \" ( ? ? ? )Oh yes , and Virginia Mayo is Cleopatra .Each of the above actors and actresses are indisputably talented and have each given us wonderful performances .It is a tribute to this film 's excruciatingly bad script , not their individual talents , that these poor guys end up looking so ridiculously bad .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Now get ready to say \" Who ? \" But let 's look at the great Marx Brothers .Groucho is actually quite good , and funny , in his role as Peter Minuet .His beautiful wife , Eden Hartford , plays a very sexy Indian girl he meets and leers at , so Groucho plays the character we all know and love him for -the sly , conniving deal - maker with an eye for the ladies .Groucho is so incredibly talented , he almost could n't help but be funny .He buys Manhattan from the naive Indians : \" Be glad it 's not 300 years later .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He manages to lure the chief 's pretty daughter \" Running Water \" away with an anachronistic rendering of \" Swanee River . \"( As a sidebar , Groucho 's pretty daughter Melinda has a brief role in the film , too .She is billed as \" Christian Girl .\" The fact that of an obviously Jewish girl making her film debut as a Christian girl is pure Marx Brother surreality , too .Harpo 's portrayal of Sir Isaac Newton is obviously unbelievable .But the wonderfully talented silent Marx brother puts in a very funny and memorable performance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Harpo briefly plays his trademark harp -who knew Newton was a harp player ?Both Harpo and Groucho come off quite well , in contrast to the third Marx Brother , poor Chico .In a ( probably ) wry comment on Chico 's legendary prowess as a skirt chaser , a very old , weathered - looking Chico plays a monk .Chico is , to be precise , a monk who warns Christopher Columbus how dangerous his voyage to the New World could be .With Groucho and Harpo , we are delighted -they each bring a bit of genuine humor into this dreadful film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "He plays the role of a monk ( no funny lines are given to him ) with deadpan seriousness .Chico is completely wasted in this dull role .The great Chico would be dead four years later ( the film came out in 1957 ; Chico passed away in 1961 ) .The Story of Mankind was a natural for inclusion in the Medved Brothers ' book The Fifty Worst Movies of All - Time , and The Golden Turkey Awards .Singled out for the Worst Miscasting Award is the bizarre Harpo Marx as Sir Isaac Newton .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Director Irwin Allen had the notion of getting them together \" for one last movie , \" but the boys are only seen in three separate scenes .Oh well .Watching talents like the Marx Brothers in a truly lousy film like The Story of Mankind is rather like Shakespeare writing an article for Mad magazine .It is like watching Michael Jordan play for the WNBA .It is watching Rembrandt paint with finger paints and draw with crayons .It is ... well , you get the idea .Thank God the Marx Brothers can still easily be viewed and appreciated on TCM or AMC or by buying or renting a copy of A Day at the Races or Duck Soup or Monkey Business .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Skip The Story of Mankin d. Once - in - a - lifetime comedic geniuses like Groucho , Chico , and Harpo definitely deserve better .I 've never seen the film myself but my dad told me about seeing it before I was born .He said it was n't as good as what he expected but it was good to see the Marx Brothers again .They will always be one of my favorite comedy teams along with The 3 Stooges and Martin & Lewis .I 've often wondered if Groucho is at the Pearly Gates and not allowing people in unless they say the secret word .... LOL !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I remember Hendrick van Loon !The author of one of the books on my mom 's shelf when I was a kid .Looking at his bibliography in Wikipedia , I think Van Loon 's Geography : The Story of the World We Live In is most likely to have been it .I remember seeing this piece of cinematic crapulence when I was a kid .It was truly awful .I was a huge fan of the Marx brothers ( this was in the 1970 's ) - even at my young age back then ( I must have been no older than 9 or 10 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This one is bad .... and yes , Chico is HORRIBLE .BUT - you want an even WORSE acting job by a Marx brother ?Try Skiddoo - Groucho 's last film ( and yes - there is GOOD REASON why he gave up ' acting ' after this ) .This steaming pile of poo is a GEM compared to the awfulness that is Skiddoo .It was directed by Otto Preminger and by the looks that Jackie Gleason gives , you can tell just how pissed off he was that he was suckered into being in the film .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That one had Caroline Munroe .Both of those are really good .Click to expand ... .Harryhausen / Schneer should have followed Golden Voyage almost immediately , before Harryhausen 's skills / time began to suffer as seen in Eye of the Tiger .Imagine if EOTT had GV 's level of refined efx .That would have been an off - the - charts experience .I was n't overly impressed with the parts I saw , though I did n't realize ' til the credits rolled that Patrick Troughton played Melanthius ...The guy playing Sinbad did n't really leave an impression and it was odd seeing him in an arctic setting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Story of Mankind was indeed a campy mess , redeemed and made sort of watchable by Vincent Price [ Mr. Scratch , the prosecutor ] , Ronald Coleman [ the Spirit of Man , counsel for the defense ] , and Cedric Hardwicke [ the Judge].Man has discovered the \" super H - bomb \" sixty years before we were meant to , and do n't realize that it will in fact cause our extinction .The trial is called to decide if humanity is worth intervening on behalf of or should be left to destroy itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The end is very much like the original Day The Earth Stood Still ... .^I watched the first 45 minutes and then decided to let the DVR handle the rest .Price is always fun , and after having heard various impressions of Ronald Colman over the years it 's interesting to see the genuine article .But it 's pretty awful overall .And the villains , figures like Cleopatra and Nero , are so one - dimensionally evil .Nukes really absorbed popular culture there for a while , did n't they ?Unfortunately , I have to agree that The Story of Mankind was n't too great and only stomached a bit of it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It had a neat take on the story and tackled it smartly .I thought the editing was almost modern with a lot of closeups , tracking shots , zooms , cuts and so on .It seemed a bit different than other films of the thirties .Gloria Holden really looked the part and Marguerite Churchill was quite the looker in this one as well .Anyone check out Solaris ?I thought it was slow , plodding and hard to sit through , and the subtitles did n't help , but it had a good story and excellent production values .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A lot fo the scenes on the station were pretty much the same .This one also had a strong focus on the love story , something that was a complaint when the 2002 version came out .The Story Of Mankind was indeed a religious tract .Not really worth watching , except as a Historical curiosity .There 's a nice essay on the TCM website about Dracula 's Daughter about how it 's always been considered second - rate , but in fact was quite innovative and foresaw many contemporary vampire tropes .At least I assume it must be on the website ; it 's on my app .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sounds like it was an innovative movie for its day .I watched the rest of The Story of Mankind last night after all .Good grief , what a terrible ending .It contradicted the hell out of itself .Colman had finished his closing statement and Price was making his , but then Colman was allowed to interrupt Price 's statement after a few sentences , refute him , and get the last word with Price not even protesting ?Talk about a kangaroo court .And the \" verdict \" too .Spoiler : Story of Mankind .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With the clock already ticking down to imminent doomsday , is n't that the same thing as deciding to let us be destroyed ?They did n't think this through very well , did they ?I have to say , though , I was impressed that the movie acknowledged the crimes and atrocities that Europeans inflicted upon the Native Americans , even though it embraced conventional stereotypes and myths of colonization in other respects .So there was a bit of progressive sentiment there , more than I expected .Still , the only thing that made this piece of dreck worthwhile was getting to listen to Vincent Price at his malevolent best for two hours .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And Groucho Marx managed to be funny even with the lame material he was given .Most of the rest of the celebrity guests did quite badly , though .It seems Allen was directing them to be as broad and campy as possible -- or else that they just showed up for a day or two to earn a quick buck and did n't put any effort into it .There 's a nice essay on the TCM website about Dracula 's Daughter about how it 's always been considered second - rate , but in fact was quite innovative and foresaw many contemporary vampire tropes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , I was very young , so the lesbian rape scene made the movie far scarier than anything in Dracula .Or most other movies .Click to expand ... .What I find intriguing about that scene is the way the fig leaf of \" vampirism \" allowed Universal to get away with a \" lesbian rape \" scene in a way they never could have if they had stripped away the supernatural hugger - mugger .Without the Dracula gimmick , you have a predatory older woman luring a vulnerable young woman up to her garrett to \" pose \" for her , getting her to disrobe , and then ( vaguely ) having her way with her .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's also amusing that generations of us kids grew up watching the show on the late show because , without a peep from our parents , because , on the surface , it 's about a vampire , not a lesbian .( Never mind that the whole plot is about a woman struggling with \" unnatural \" urges she ca n't control , to the extent that she consults a psychiatrist about it ! )I read somewhere that the censors insisted on a scene immediately afteward the garrett scene where a coroner explicitly states that poor Lily had her blood drained out -- just so the audience would n't think that something else might have happened after the fade - out . . . .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
