{"text": "Pages .A Single Bullet .In the summer of 1978 , my seven - year old brother Christopher was shot in the head by a deranged neighbor .He was a first grader , a skinny little tow - headed boy missing his front teeth .I held him , bleeding in my arms , as my mother drove maniacally to the ER .His eyes fluttered , rolling back in his head as he lost consciousness .His little body twitched violently from the brain damage .I begged him to hold on .My arms were covered in blood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
