{"text": "Hubs picked up a couple of movies over the weekend ... one was animated , for us to watch , not our son ( we find most of the newer animated movies more appropriate for adults , not for kids ) .The other he watched , because I was caring for our son !The last movie I watched was Hoodwinked that my friend let me borrow .First off my daughter decided she did n't want to sleep that night .Then I realized that movie was awful so that was the end of my \" movie night \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
