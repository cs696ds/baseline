{"text": "Product Description .Six months after The Game came their Flash Gordon soundtrack , featuring some of the trippiest Queen tracks ever plus the hit title song .Bonuses : Flash ( single version ) ; The Hero ( revisited October 1980 ) ; The Kiss ( early version ) ; Football Fight ( early version with no synths ) , and 1981 live - in - Montreal recordings of Flash and The Hero !Top Customer Reviews .So you 've made a film that 's over the top , bombastic , slightly camp & does n't take it 's self too seriously , who do you choose to record the soundtrack ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Soundtrack albums feature primarily incidental music are a little bit of an acquired taste , & if you are just a Queen greatest hits fan , you are probably not going to like this record .But if you 're Queen obsessive who must own every release you will love it .The album , I feel would have been improved if all the films dialogue had been removed , letting the record become a piece of work in its own right , instead of being constantly reminded that it 's a sound track to a film .It would also have been nice is some of the early tracks like \" Space Capsule \" & \" The Kiss \" have been extended , the album does rush a little to the finale ( which admittedly is pretty exciting ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Flash ( single version )The version of the song with all the dialogue ( you are so used to this version , that the album one , minus the quotes just does n't sound right ) .The Hero ( Oct 1980 Revisited )Same as the album track , but with Mercury vocal 's double - track , sound pretty similar .The Kiss ( Early Demo )Highlight of the bonus disc , same as the album version , but with piano replacing the synths , & giving the track a nice haunted quality , all be it a bit to short .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I am a huge Queen fan .And this was the last album I needed to complete my collection .To say that this album is complete garbage is an understatement .It is essentially 2 heavily edited songs book - ending 16 instrumental backed movie clips .Of all the albums I have ever listened to , this is by far the single worst one I have ever experienced .Luckily I used gift cards to pay for this so it did n't cost me full price .Trust me .Avoid this mess at all costs .The remastering still does n't rescue the drums from at times still sounding like they are muffled in cloth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It would have been great to hear the whole album without the sound effects and dialogue from the movie .This should have been easy to do with access to the original master tapes .As far as the included bonus tracks , the Flash single version is available on the Greatest Hits CD and the two Montreal live tracks are right from the Queen Rock Montreal release so these do n't even count .The early versions of \" The Kiss \" and \" Football Fight \" are awesome to hear - why could n't we get a whole disc of demos like this ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Queen 's tenth album was the soundtrack to the film Flash Gordon which was released in December of 1980 in the UK and January of 1981 here in the US .The band were approached by producer Dino De Laurentis before going off to tour the US to provide the score to his film adaptation of the old King Features Syndicate comic character Flash Gordon .The album was produced by guitarist Brian May and Mack and recorded in England sporadically through 1980 .Was this album good or bad , read ahead ( as I found out in 1992 ) !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The only other track with vocals is the closing rocker \" The Hero \" which rocks and was too composed by Brian .Brian also wrote \" Marriage of Dale and Ming \" with drummer Roger Taylor .Speaking of Roger , he contributed the instrumentals which are the love theme \" In the Space Capsule \" , its reprise called \" In the Death Cell \" and the tympani - synthesizer induced \" Escape from the Swamp \" .Bass player John Deacon contributed the instrumentals \" Execution of Flash \" ( with Deaky on guitar ) and \" Arboria \" ( which John composed on synthesizer ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Notwithstanding sales , this soundtrack is a great film score for Queen and their best soundtrack ever ( their score to Highlander was great but hard to top Flash Gordon ) !The bonus CD for the Flash Gordon Soundtrack contains the single mix of \" Flash \" .Then you get an alternate version of \" The Hero \" in an early state before it was re - recorded for the album .Next are embryonic versions of \" The Kiss \" and \" Football Fight \" which are slightly different to their finished counterparts .We conclude with the Queen Rock Montreal versions of \" Flash \" and \" The Hero \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some will say why buy again but I say go for it because of the remastering !Recommended !Recommended !Mention the movie \" Flash Gordon \" to anyone who has fond memories of it and they will most likely respond by singing , \" Flash ! !Ah - aahhhh !He 's a miracle ! \" Queen 's music was so intertwined with this movie that the two can not be separated .Watching the movie with the sound off makes for a horrible spectacle , just as listening to this music if you 'd never seen the movie would probably be horrible ( even if you were a queen fan ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I think I might have even had this album on vinyl way back when .Hearing it in stereophonic , digital perfection is almost as fun as watching the movie .That overwhelming beat , the screaming guitars , the weird synthesizers ...I love this soundtrack !This edition also comes with some extra songs that -- all of the above considered -- are fantastic .One of them is the \" radio release \" of the main song , which is pretty good , one is a concert performance of the theme song that 's OK but not great .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So you 've made a film that 's over the top , bombastic , slightly camp & does n't take it 's self too seriously , who do you choose to record the soundtrack ?It literary could n't be anybody else but Queen ( talk about a match made in heaven ! )Soundtrack albums feature primarily incidental music are a little bit of an acquired taste , & if you are just a Queen greatest hits fan , you are probably not going to like this record .But if you 're Queen obsessive who must own every release you will love it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It would also have been nice if some of the early tracks like \" Space Capsule \" & \" The Kiss \" have been extended , the album does rush a little to the finale ( which admittedly is pretty exciting ) .As for the second disc : .Flash ( single version )The version of the song with all the dialogue ( you are so used to this version , that the album one , minus the quotes just does n't sound right ) .The Hero ( Oct 1980 Revisited )Same as the album track , but with Mercury vocal 's double - track , sound pretty similar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Highlight of the bonus disc , same as the album version , but with piano replacing the synths , & giving the track a nice haunted quality , all be it a bit to short .The Football Fight ( Early Version ) Again replacing the synths with piano , but this time giving the song a crime - drama theme song feel to it .Flash / The Hero ( Live in Montreal , Nov 1981 )Taken from the Queen live album \" Queen Rock Montreal \" , good versions , but always sounds a bit odd when you have n't got the rest of the concert .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
