{"text": "The present situation is analogous to how several centuries ago society knew nothing of physical pathogens and the bacterial and viral origins of disease .They fell ill and knew neither the cause nor medical remedy .Likewise , today people get attachments and know neither the cause nor remedy .Etheric Parasites .Etheric parasites are negative thoughtforms , which are temporary beings generated in the etheric plane .The etheric plane is a nonphysical substructure underlying our material reality .Etheric energies and constructs are invisible \" metadata \" that can influence physical events at the quantum level .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Etheric parasites are generated by human thoughts infused with emotion and intent .This creates an energetic construct in the ether akin to an eddy in a river but imbued with artificial intelligence and purpose .Its most common purpose is to continue its own survival by feeding off the same kinds of energy that gave rise to it .If it was generated through hate , it will induce hateful thoughts in its host to suckle more emotional energy of that type .These thoughtforms float around in the ether , which interpenetrates and underlies physical space , and can influence the thoughts and emotions of people onto whom they latch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Occultists know how to create these intentionally , or to produce other effects in the ether , in order to consciously influence the mind of another person .But most thoughtforms are created unwittingly by our everyday sparks of emotion , fantasies , and moments of ill intent .To people with clairvoyant vision , they can see these parasitic energies budding off the person generating them and turning into grotesque forms .The color of the energy is always black , red , orange , olive green , muddy brown , and other dull colors .When these turn into thoughtforms , they appear symbolically to the clairvoyant mind as amoebas , insects , crabs , spiders , black globules , etc .. Again , the fact that clairvoyants can see these indicates they are objective constructs in the ether and not just internal psychological processes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Discarnate humans are those who have died in the recent past , but have not fully faded out from the physical , etheric , and astral planes .Sometimes it is just their etheric and/or astral bodies that turn into nonphysical parasites once their conscious spiritual core has left them behind .According to Rudolf Steiner , it is also possible for demonic entities to pick up the discarded etheric shells of deceased persons and put them on , thereby more easily masquerading as dead relatives to mediums , ouija board users , and societies that perform ancestor worship .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some of this was portrayed in the movie Ghost .Without a physical body , satisfying remnant physical addictions is impossible , and so discarnate humans can gratify their addictions by splicing themselves into the neural and etheric circuitry of the living in order to get a taste of physical sensations once again .Supposedly they can also possess the bodies of animals even more easily than humans .Attachment to humans is easiest when parasite and host share some emotional point of resonance , say someone who committed suicide latching onto someone who already has suicidal tendencies .Human entity attachments creates a personality overlay upon the living host , creating cravings and biases that are out of character for the person .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A discarnate female with sexual cravings can induce homosexual tendencies in straight males .A young woman who was always friendly may pick up the attachment of an old angry war veteran , and thus acquire a more masculine , gruff and angry demeanor .Discarnate human entity attachments tend to be acquired by being etherically vulnerable while in proximity to such entities .Examples include graveyards , bars , war zones , and sites of fatal accidents .Alien Entity Attachments .Some attachments are worse than others .Alien entity attachments are worse than human ones because they are placed into a person intentionally for purposes of monitoring , energy feeding , and manipulation , whereas human entity attachments merely create human personality overlays and common vices .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Demonic Attachments .The worst attachment of all are demonic ones .I am not sure of the true origins of demons .Maybe they are thoughtforms created by the collective negativity of humanity throughout the ages .Maybe they were effluvia left over from the creation of the universe .Maybe they were physical beings who advanced so far along the negative path that they transcended their physical bodies and took up residence in the darkest recesses of the lower astral planes .Whatever the case , fully possessed humans become sharp instruments of demonic manipulation and can carry a composed exterior and high social status , but underneath be dark , manipulative , cunning predators endowed with paranormal powers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Extreme sadism and perversion are also possible , as in the case of serial killers and murderers who typically admit a voice told them to do it , or that they could n't help themselves , that something evil compelled them .Clairvoyants , young children , animals , and anyone with an iota of intuition can sense the presence of demonically possessed individuals and will feel threatened , repulsed , and creeped out by them .Demonic attachments can be picked up in several ways .One is through willful invitation , say through practice of black magick , left - hand - path occult systems , or undergoing initiations into questionable secret societies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But just as people get themselves into a hole through credit cards , some do likewise spiritually through the \" credit card \" of black magick .Another path toward demonic possession is starting with a minor attachment and being too weak or willing to resist its pull toward ever greater forms of depravity .It tends to start with a severe weakness in a person , such as being extremely traumatized as a child , being a heavy alcoholic or drug abuser , and/or nurturing feelings of morbidity , suicide , depression into a total lifestyle .Generally , demonic possessions require a greater degree of permission than other types of attachments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Permission can be given consciously through rituals or inadvertently through cultivation of anti - human , anti - life , anti - spiritual attitudes and feelings .Getting Rid of Attachments .Entity attachments can be removed by starving them out and/or dislodging them directly .Starving them out means identifying what thoughts , emotions , and behaviors they persistently aim to induce , and cutting these off , transmuting or replacing them with their positive opposites .Sooner or later the entity learns that an attempt to induce this action creates the opposite effect and they have no choice but to cease and hopefully leave .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Dislodging them directly is more difficult .Traditionally this involves getting an exorcism , visiting someone practiced in shamanic journeying and de - possession techniques , or getting a Spirit Releasement Therapy hypnosis session .If you have access to these and can afford the service , look into a reputable practitioner .Beware of remote healers or those with icky vibes ; some are charlatans and others are disease vectors for even worse entity attachments .It can be done yourself provided you can enter a lucid state of consciousness other than waking , particularly that twilight state in between waking and sleeping .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In this state , which Robert Monroe calls \" mind awake , body asleep \" you are etherically empowered compared to your waking state .Not only can you see / feel an entity attachment , but you can take various actions to get it off you .This state is characterized by complete sleep paralysis , the sensation of disembodiment , hovering , vibration , and so on .It 's when your etheric body is naturally decoupled from the physical , which science would call the hypnagogic or hypnopompic state .See my article on Active Dreaming for more information .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You can employ Robert Bruce 's New Energy Ways technique to shuttle energy back and forth in that area , which can uproot the entity and make it drop off .Bruce also recommends taking an hour - long bath in water that has a cup of epsom salts dissolved in it , though a swim in the ocean works too .Saltwater has the effect of discharging such attachments .But keep in mind that physical tricks like these only address the most rudimentary of attachments .For astral and more powerful etheric attachments , you have to resort to internal / psychic methods .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In occultism there is the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram which can be traced with one 's etheric arms .Catholics have their pectoral crossing gesture .Robert Bruce talks about removing Core Images ( traumatic memories ) by visualizing them as photographs being pulled away from your inner field of vision , held at arms length , flipped over , and then visualizing the critters attached to the back of the photo being burned .These techniques serve as a graphical user interface that tells your subconscious or higher self / higher mind to address the problem .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Robert Bruce 's technique and other simple positive rituals may be effective while awake ( but focused ) , although for extra punch I believe one does have to be in an etherically empowered state ( mind awake , body asleep ) .That 's because the gap between the conscious and subconscious minds is smaller in the hypnagogic , hypnopompic , and dreaming states .Note , however , that a talented psychic or shaman will not require such states if they etheric / astral bodies have well - developed nonphysical organs that create a 24/7 two - directional uplink with the higher mind .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's my instinctual response and has been used with success several times .I have called upon the power of Christ and whatever else fills me with righteous power .All this is done in that \" mind awake , body asleep \" state where it 's most effective and the results more noticeable .This works best on demonic or negative entities who carry an anti - divine signature .It 's important to feel neither fear , weakness , or malice while doing this .In fact , the more positive and empowered you make yourself feel , the better and more effective the process .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
