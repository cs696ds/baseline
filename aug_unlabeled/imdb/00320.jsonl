{"text": "Even to non - opera buffs , the idea behind Aria must sound fascinating : The movie rounds up 10 distinctive directors , and lets each make a short film to accompany the operatic aria of his choice .British producer Don Boyd gave the directors no constraints when it came to approach or subject matter .Which means that Aria is essentially an omnibus of high - brow music videos , and a chance for some top - flight filmmakers to flex their muscles .Predictably , what results is a very mixed bag .There 's a framing story , about an opera singer ( John Hurt ) entering a theater and preparing for a role .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is directed by Nicolas Roeg ( Do n't Look Now ) , who tells the true story of an assassination attempt on Albania 's King Zog in 1931 .Zog , who survived the attack , may be the only assassination target who ever saved himself by shooting back .Adding a ripple of perversity is Roeg 's casting , which puts his wife , Theresa Russell , in drag in the role of Zog .This is a promising start , but the next piece , with music from Verdi 's La Forza del Destino , directed by Charles Sturridge , is uninspired and obtuse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a typically Godardian workout , full of repetition , ambient noise , and a large knife .It 's Verdi again-Rigoletto -for the film 's centerpiece , a 15-minute farce directed by Julian Temple .Temple mounts a comedy of adultery , as two marrieds ( Buck Henry and Anita Morris ) enjoy other partners at a motel with \" theme \" rooms ( the Neanderthal Room , Heidi 's Hideaway ) .The music is from Rameau 's Les Boreades .Next , Franc Roddam ( The Bride ) does a haunting update on Wagner 's Tristan und Isolde , in which a young couple ( James Mathers and Bridget Fonda - Peter 's daughter ) go to Las Vegas , make passionate love , and commit suicide .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "You expect Ken Russell to bring the house down with this sort of thing , and Russell 's fantasia on Turandot by Puccini is one of the film 's weirdest turns .It 's a surreal glimpse of what appear to be the near - death thoughts of a woman who has just been in a car accident .She is played by England 's most famous stripper , Linzi Drew .The film is rounded out by Derek Jarman 's impressionistic take on Charpentier 's Louise , and by the end of the framing story , which closes with Il Pagliacci , directed by Bill Bryden .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even though it 's something of a disappointment overall , Aria is still an intriguing concept .Now , can we do the same thing with rock ' n ' roll ?First published in the Herald , July 1988 .Tilda Swinton was in the Jarman segment , one of her first screen roles .Some of this movie was pretty dull , as I recall , and not because of the opera , but because the filmmakers fell down .You are currently browsing the WHAT A FEELING ! blog archives for the day Tuesday , January 24th , 2012 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is a \" diary \" in movie reviews : the decade of the 1980s , written by a working critic who slogged through the weird , the cruddy , and even , occasionally , the some kind of wonderful .Some present - day annotation will provide hindsight , but otherwise these are the movies as they appeared : first impressions of Gymkata , the Police Academy pictures , the Stallone - Schwarzenegger - Norris oeuvre at its peak .I 'll start small but will keep a steady flow of reviews coming from my stash of yellowing clippings , even when the results embarrass me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
