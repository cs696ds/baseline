{"text": "I now have two HD video cameras that I will be using on this next upcoming 2 week trip(Kodak playsport & Gopro Hero )The reason I am using two camera now is to get different vantage points / views .The biggest mistake IMO that people make when shooting fishing videos ( or any video for that matter ) is to just shoot it from one angle .Even a video of a great fish will quickly become boring to the viewer if it is continuously shoot from one angle .So try to use various angles when shooting your footage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Also try to use some footage while the camera is on a tripod and mix that in with the action shots of the camera mounted on you .It helps to mix in some nice steady footage where the camera is not bouncing around such as it will be while mounted on your person .When it comes to the Zoom I usually try to avoid using it .When zoom is used handheld it makes for a very very jumpy film and really takes away from what you are trying to shoot .It 's better to get closer to something rather than trying to zoom in on it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Far as what mode / resolution I personally like to shoot in 720P 60FPS .I find the quality is just as good in playback as 1080 and the FPS makes for a nice smooth video of quick moving objects like fish jumping .One of the better bang for the buck editing programs out there is Cyberlink Power director .I use the power director 9 which I paid about $ 55 for last year , but now that # 10 is out I believe you can get # 9 for about $ 35 now on Amazon .Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doin , than a long life spent in a miserable way - Alan Watts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
