{"text": "NO REVIEWS AVAILABLE .Epic .This movie contains great sweeping scenes and exuberant portrayals by Cesar Romero , Jean Peters and Lee J.Cobb among others who give it rich color and texture .Though the screenplay occasionally flags , Tyrone Power , with his flashing eyes and athletic energy is the charismatic center of the story and makes a dashing , thrilling Spanish nobleman in Cortez 's army .An engrossing eye and earfull with grand scenes and a legendary score , it 's a classic epic adventure .That Wonderful Score .Alfred Newman created a musical masterpiece for this movie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I assume that domination of native populations by European powers was not apparently a very sensitive issue when this film was produced .Movies from this time do seem to wholeheartedly glorify England ( especially ) , France and Spain 's conquest of the new world and for that matter , the white man 's right to dominate Native Americans right through thr 19th century .Subjugation of indeginous populations aside -- if indeed it can be overlooked -- Captain from Castile , featuring movie legend , Tyrone Power and Jean Peters , is intended as grand adventure .Power and Peters are great together and very sexy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Money was spent making \" Castile \" and it shows .This is lavish , sprawling moviemaking .Cortez was actually blond with blue eyes .A GREAT MOVIE AND A GORGEOUS JEAN PETERS .This epic adventure was filmed on location in Mexico in fabulous technicolor and is a genuine gem .A period piece with a most interesting topic : The conquest of the New World in the midst of the Spanish inquisition .It 's Jean Peters ' first film , and once you see it you might agree with me that she is one of the most gorgeous creatures to hit the Hollywood screen -plus she does a great acting job for someone who 'd never acted before .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
