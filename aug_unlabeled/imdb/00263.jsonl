{"text": "Aman 's Blog .Saturday , February 28 , 2009 .Customer Care , Expect Anything But Care .... .As I travel quite often so its a little dangerous for me to carry a lots of cash .Generally I do n't carry much but that only which is suitable at the places where plastic money is not used , for example , bus ticket .Now , its not possible that your account has loads of cash all the time , at least its not possible for a poor guy like me , so at times , I do use my credit cards too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As I am at home so I thought why not use this opportunity to make one from it as well .And the story starts from here , a painful story if you may want to say so !The first point of contact is to check that do you have contact number of some marketing guy who can help you in this process .I checked that whether in some deep dark corners of my cupboards , I have one or not ?Luckily(for some time )I had one .So I called him only to find some lady over the other end .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So how come I have it noted with me ?Never mind .So now what ?Next point of contact , as like an obvious choice , bank 's customer care , people who actually get paid to help customers or would be customers .So I did call on the customer and a sugar quoted voice welcomed me with a mile long welcome note .I asked that I want to apply for a new credit card so it would be just great if she can help me in the process .She just stopped me saying that this number is not the right number to enquire about all this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She gave me another number and asked to call there .Upon asking that can she transfer my call to the other number , she said in a very innocent voice , this facility is not with them .No probs mamasita !Let 's call the other number , I said to myself .When I called on the 2nd number , once again , there was a huge welcome for me with a mile long welcome note once again .I heard that already so I just came straight to business which was how to apply for a new card ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Okay so now I am pist off !And I blasted on that lady like anything .But it seems , they are trained or habitual to hear all this on a daily basis so she just kept on saying a polite sorry and her inability to help me further .She asked me to call on the same number where I called just now before her as that is the right number to check about cards .Yeah thanks for telling !I called and you can very well imagine how would I had sounded ?The lady ( there was another one this time ) mentioned apologies for so many times and said some fresher must have said it by mistake that this is not the right number .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Ahan and why so , its company policy so she did n't have any idea .So how do I go for one now ?She asked me to check the co - branded card which HSBC offers with couple of shopping outlets .And how do I do that , for this they had no idea , not even had the contact details for any outlet in my city .Great , thanks for the big help .So now I was searching for the outlet numbers in my city which do offer this co - branded card thingy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I called them up and asked that how do I go for the card application for which I was told this does n't happen here and bank people do it .Give me a break now !I had to explain him the entire story which I heard since morning to clear the picture .And how does one become a member of the mall , upon the shopping of worth 2000INR .He came with an \" exciting \" offer also that I can become member by doing a shopping of 1000Rs at the moment but I have to make shopping of another 1000Rs in the same month .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sorry its a too costly bargain for me , not interested .When I said this , the guy asked me that do I want membership just for the card , if yes than I can avail a paid membership for just 150Rs .Wow !Now that 's what I call a loophole .Just compare 2000 bucks with 150 bucks , that 's a real smart deal eh ?Well he told me that I can come to the mall , pay 150 bucks and than I shall be eligible to apply for the card .Good , I said this and put the phone down .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , the answer is no , I am not , at least not at the moment .Its a little too much hassle for me as the mall is much far away from my place and just for a card , I wo n't be going that far .Besides this , I do have another cards so I am not that eager to get the card as well .The only thing which stood out from this is that customer care is the only place where you can expect anything , sweet talks , huge apologies , a VIP welcome but just not what you are actually there for , care , solutions for your issues !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Back .... .I got back today morning after a grueling program .I just hope that it went well .I am not sure though about it .The guys were smiling and were very happy so that 's a good sign if you ask me but still , I am much concerned about rating too this time .There was not anything special that happened over my travel back .I am not sure why but I am just feeling drop dead tired .Now , I ca n't say that its for no reason because I know , I am pushing my self for couple of things a little too much and this certainly can be a reason for this over tiredness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My cab was going to be late so I just decided to stay back in the office rather than going all the way back to guest house and when I was sitting there , my eyes were not getting open at all !The irony is that when I am so much tired like this and want to take a nap , some thing or the other happens because of which I never able to get one .The same happened yesterday too .I thought that I shall take a short nap while coming to the airport .But just when I was about to close my eyes , I got a call from one colleague of mine and she kept on talking about one thing or the other , leaving me once again , sleepless .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I was already not able to open my eyes but when I got at check - in counter , I got to hear a news which made my sleep go completely vanished .I have a frequent flier card .Though I do n't use it much but still , I did use it couple of times .So when I gave the same yesterday and asked the lady over the counter to tell me about the miles that I have in it , she surprised me by the reply that I had no miles under this card .Hmm now I may not use the card very often but I did use it couple of times so zero miles is certainly possible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Good , so what would I do now ?Nothing , I just asked for another card which I could use from this year onwards .The lady did enter that card 's number and said , its active now .Hope this time , I would have some miles with me over this card and I promise , I shall use my card for sure now in a more regular fashion .Regulars over here must be aware about this that I take a cab from airport to bus stand .I did the same yesterday too .There are a lot of changes happening over the New Delhi airport .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hope these all changes would actually make the airport of nation capital a much better place to start / end travel .Anyways , so I just went to the bus stand , got my bus and started off for home .Driver just made the bus \" fly \" .I got the bus at 1 am and I was at my place at 6 am .Now that 's FAST !So what 's next ?To be honest , I do n't know .I have got a blank mind at the moment .I just want to spend some time with me and myself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Besides this , I have got some projects to finish so I shall try to focus over them too .I have some thoughts in mind about which I shall try to write as well .All this and much more is in draft , let 's see how much will see the sunshine ?At the moment , its time to sleep .So see you all later !Tuesday , February 24 , 2009 .( Tired ) Travel Update .... .At times , you do feel really so much tired and that 's the same is the case with me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , whatever it may be , the end result is that I am dead tired at the moment and that 's the main reason that I did n't write anything since I got here .I did want to sit on Sunday and wanted to write about the bits of my travel but I just could n't gather myself to do so .About the travel , there was n't anything unusual at the time of the start .I did catch my bus and as like of the times , this was a Punjab Roadways .My dad came to drop me there and I am not sure , but I was feeling so sad while leaving .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But still , I did get sad this time and I just wanted to get off from the bus and wanted to go back home with my dad .But this was not going to happen so I just had to sit there .The bus was from Punjab Roadways but this was a Patiala depot bus , another division of Punjab Roadways you can say !Normally the PR buses are slow and take a long time to reach anywhere .But this was bus was an exception .The driver drove the bus like a rocket !No its really true .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It takes normally about 7 hours to get to Delhi from my place and guess how much time it took me to get there this time , just 5 hours !Believe me , at times , he did scare all of us with the way he was driving .It appeared to me that he was not even scared of speed tickets which one gets immediately in Delhi for going over speed .He was driving on the same speed in the city also with which he drove on the highway too .Though I was bit uneasy about this much high speed but still I landed up in Delhi much earlier than I thought , leaving with me plenty of time to get to the airport so I was a relieved .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Why oh why I just make up pre - plans !I have been traveling from a long time now and when you are doing some thing from a long time , its inevitable that your not known or seen by some people who hang out on the same place where you are moving around .I take an auto from the bus stand to the airport and the same is true since a long time .The condition is this now that some auto drivers do recognize my face now .Okay that ca n't be called a fan following but still , its good that you are known to some locals as it always helps .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So he without even me mentioning anything took me to the airport and on the same price which I normally pay .When I got to the airport , I came to know that the flight of which I had the booking in my hands , this got over - booked ! WTH !How the heck a flight can be over booked , a flight !Well , the lady asked me that would I like to travel by another partner carrier of them who is flying one hour early too !I thought and said yes to it because this would had made me reach on a very reasonable timings to my guest house which I normally do n't get .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I do have a frequent flier card , though I do n't use it much but still I have one .I gave my card to the gal to add it and she was like , you never used it .Okay now may be I do n't use it very oftenly but that does n't mean that I NEVER used it .So I asked her to check again and she said , as your name on the card is Aman Sharma and on the ticket is Sharma Aman , computer is not accepting your card .What , give me a break , that 's the most stupid logic I have ever heard .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Who coded that stupid piece of software I do n't know but I did ask my card back and just asked the lady to give me a seat .There was n't anything more unusual which did happen in the flight and I got at my guest house at about 8.30pm , just about the time of dinner , perfect timing which I never actually got before !The program for which I am here , also did have issues in the starting .The first and the most important one was that there was a huge miscommunication that happened between my team and the client and this resulted into completely no setup with us , even on Monday morning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I hope this would n't effect much to the program .The guys are nice .I got a chance to have lunch with two of them and it went off really nice .Thanks a bunch guys for the nice lunch .We got the session over today due to some urgent meeting which audience had to attend .That 's what gave me a little \" extra \" time to make myself relaxed .As I said in the starting only , I am just feeling so much tired .May be a cup of coffee would help , let 's see !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Its Travel Time .... .Yes I am leaving tomorrow .I am not sure that what 's the outcome of the tour .If you are following than you must be aware about what happened in the last trip of mine .Thinking of that , I must say , I am a bit scared , both for my health and about the program .I am not sure what 's going to happen this time .Those who know me for real , they must be aware about this fact that I am not a sort of person who would let things go just like that and wo n't give my best .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I just hope things would go fine and there wo n't be any \" shocks \" for me after the program .Do pray for me guys , really need your wishes !Before I leave , I just want to mention that I am happy today over something .Want to know what ?Well , if you have read about my thoughts about Roadies and in that , a guy from the current season , Devrishi over here , you must be knowing that I did n't like that guy at all .Besides that there are just too many reasons for me to not to like him at all , one is that he is just a loud mouth , over confident chap who think that he is the best thing happened to this mankind after mankind !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Anyways , he is not that important that I would waste my web space talking about him that much .I am happy because in today 's episode , he got \" thrown out \" of the show .Yes , you did hear me right , he was n't voted out but was thrown out like a dead fly out of the milk is thrown !And again , in all this , none else but he himself was responsible .His own stupidity or over - intelligence , whatever you may say , got him killed today .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After what he did to Nauman , the way he reacts , he was going to end up like this only what he faced today .It was just a matter of time and that time came today .Its never going to end up just in thin air when you are going to hurt some one !Sadly , people like Devrishi do n't realize this and even more sad is that they never would too !A Looong Day .... .Indeed it was !I am just feeling so much tired at the moment when writing this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When I came back , I thought I would sleep for just some time but I was asleep for complete 3 hours !I had some plans with me for today so I just had a quick breakfast and got ready .It was going to be a long day and I knew its going to be fun !My first stop for the day was at the place where I go for my hair cut and a non - often face clean(or facial if my hair dresser and sis would insist ) .It was a long time since I had undergone a face clean so I thought , I shall get one today .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And when I mention it , its the most happiest day for him I believe because I always hear , wow today 's date must be noted :-) .Anyhow , its always fun to relax for a while and I do n't mind getting couple of unknown creams / packs / whatever over me and have a feeling that something good is happening .Unknown because when all that is getting applied , my eyes are closed so I do n't have a slightest clue even what gets applied and what not !And the answer for just having a good feeling , despite of my best efforts ( and of my stylist too to show me ) , I never am able to find that \" killer glow \" over my face which except me , everyone else detects and acclaims .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Normally , it takes about an hour for all this to get complete excluding my hair cut time , which normally is about 20 minutes .If you know me and have seen my current hair cut , you would say that its a little too much but its true , my stylist does take that much time .So like all the other days , today also , I got into one of those massage rooms and was lying down with eyes closed , hoping that this would just finish in no time .The toughest part for me is that moment when after applying some mystic cream , my stylist start plucking my skin out of my nose , or in other words , start getting the \" black heads \" out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So I was thinking about all this and was lying listening to some music .The process started as usual like the other days .I did n't feel any difference for some time .Only when I started to count that I did finish about 5 big Qawallis , each of almost 30 minutes duration , I was like , \" something is changed today \" .In between of all this , my stylist came and I asked him , how long it has been and he started laughing .He told me that today he wanted me to undergo the complete process and he did n't just do face clean today but also some facial .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Well , nothing wrong about that guy , he is a good friend of mine and a very good technician in his work .He always does that thing which is good for me so its okay .Despite that I was so much restless , I just listened to him and let him do whatever he had chosen for me .Finally after some 3 hours , everything got finished and I was allowed to get up .Again , as like always , I failed to see any \" killer glow \" over my face but all said , its just there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I just said bye to all of them there and left for my next stop , shopping for a new toy , a new box !I have a desktop which I bought almost 7 years back .The configuration of it is some thing on which any new user of current timings would just laugh so I wo n't mention it but at that time , that was the best configuration that one could get .But as like everything , change is essential , at least in some things and one of those things is the hardware of a computer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I did manage to do it for so long , up til today if have to be precise but there are certain things for which I feel handicapped when I do n't have my own box to play with .Despite of the fact that I wanted to get a new one from rather a much longer time , I was always like , \" next time \" when it was actually the time to buy it .Do n't ask me the reason for it .But today , my mom said that I must go and get one as its not a thing of fun for me , I need it and I know that I need it so its no point to put it on hold .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I know a friend who deals in all this so I just went to him .Again , as like all who are with me , his first statement was when he saw me , today 's date must be noted .He knew if I am there it means I am not going back without getting one !Well , it did n't take him much time to get things which I wanted and the install process was started .By this time , when I was sitting there , there was a mother with her son too who came to buy a machine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My friend said ask him(me ) about it .So I told the guy to check Oracle 's technology site and download from there .His mom asked me what I do ?To answer that I said , I teach people how to use oracle .In the meanwhile , that guy asked me , so as you must not be knowing database , do you know PL / SQL ( a basic learning topic about oracle ) ?I just stopped my smile somehow and just could manage to say , yes I think so .He was like , learn Java , it will be good .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There was one another guy sitting there , I do n't know who he was , he asked about Window 7 to my friend .I told him that its of no use to go for it as its still in its Beta only .I said that its better to go for Linux , both for learning and for daily use .To that , both guys said , you know Linux , do you know UNIX as well ?Oh my gosh , I just said , yes a little bit .That lady took my number and said , she would call me for her son .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By this time , my machine was ready so I left to get the cash for the payment .Now , when I am writing this , my new box is loaded with 2 window platforms , XP Professional and Media Center .At the moment , Oracle 's , Oracle Enterprise Linux 's installation is going on .Some how , OEL is not picking up my mouse and I do n't know why !I yet have to install oracle db over both the platforms .I am not sure that I shall be doing it now or tomorrow as I am just so much tired .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I guess , I did n't make a wrong decision to get one .Time now for some serious , oracle , Linux action !Thursday , February 19 , 2009 .Back , Filled With Disappointment .... .I just got back from a grueling tour .I am not sure that I can remember a tour which I felt so long and where I had such a huge urge to get back to home ?I guess and hope , this was the only one and the number should n't increase .There were series of jolts which did come all the time in this tour .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But this time , I just could n't hold myself to stay up .As I had mentioned in my last post , I did n't get good rating in the first program of mine .Though the comments were good but the rating was n't and the irony is that the module is that one which I have taken almost 100 times .I was told that it does n't matter for me what is the rating but I guess , it does and it will as long as I shall be in this profession .Though the 2nd program did go well ( so was the last one too ) and the rating did get improve along with lots of good comments but still , it was n't very good according to my opinion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I gave my best shot and I guess this time , especially in the 2nd program , I did add a lots of stuff which I have learned with the passage of time .So I am not sure what I lacked and where ?I am not feeling well and that thought is hitting me in the back of my mind so that can be one of the reason but again , I do n't think its good to justify your mistakes / failures .A failure is a failure and there is n't any justification for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We do check some thing called , feasibility of the program for the audience and the score was very high for that .This does mean that the audience did find the program helpful in their day to day work which in my opinion is the end result of any program .If that does n't happen that audience does n't find the program beneficial for what they do , the whole meaning / effort is wasted .So in that way , I am satisfied that I was able to speak something which they found useful for them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I had an idea(which was again wrong ) that there is an outlet over the airport too from where I can get the money as I did remember getting the money once from that counter .Everything is correct about this idea except that I forgot that I did see and used that counter in an another city 's airport , not on this one !Wow , talk about a shock and I had one !So , here I was , with some pennies in my wallet and searching for an ATM to get the money because I would need it when I would get down to my place to catch a cab and bus !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
