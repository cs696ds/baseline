{"text": "Content : .Summary : .Bill Murray stars as a neurotic goofball named Bob Wiley so obsessed that he follows his shrink on vacation .With excellent characterizations , the film would be recommended for all ages if it were n't for some brief outbursts of obscenity that Bob utters to prove he 's not faking a profanity complex .Review : .Bill Murray pulls out all the stops in WHAT ABOUT BOB ? to create a new kind of neurotic goofball character so obsessed that he follows his shrink on vacation .Bob Wiley is a genuine New York nut case and a multi - phobic personality with a long list of peculiar aberrations , including a fear of elevators and of touching things as well as an irrational fixation on his new psychiatrist , Dr. Leo Marvin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , just as blundering Bob begins to see a glimmer of hope from Marvin 's \" Baby Steps \" therapy , the diffident doctor goes on vacation with his family .Panic - stricken and exhibiting an excessive / compulsive obsession to follow Dr. Marvin , Bob ferrets out the doctor 's serene New Hampshire vacation paradise , arriving there with the goldfish that he keeps in a jar tied around his neck .Dr. Marvin , of course , is less than thrilled , especially since the egotistical psychiatrist is awaiting the arrival of a \" Good Morning America \" television crew that is planning to interview him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Basically , Bob does stuff to make Dr. Marvin 's family and everyone else think that he ( Bob ) is wonderful and Dr. Marvin is a schmuck .Until , finally , Dr. Marvin resorts to \" death therapy \" ( he plans to blow up Bob ) , and the question arises as to who is really crazy and who is n't .If WHAT ABOUT BOB ? is meant to be an attack on psychiatry , or more specifically , on all the self - help books currently flooding the market , then in an uproariously funny manner it succeeds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm walking proof of that .\" At wits end , Dr. Marvin ( played convincingly by Richard Dreyfuss ) convulses hysterically .Bill Murray is cast even better as Bob Wiley .Not so much a cross between his Todd character ( from the Todd and Lisa Lupner sketches on \" Saturday Night Live \" ) and some other caricature , Bob is more of a new character altogether .With sunken facial expressions and a certain droop to his slumping presence , his patient neuroses are played to perfection with hilarious accuracy .The only problem with WHAT ABOUT BOB ? are some early outbursts of obscenity which Bob utters to prove that he 's not faking a profanity complex .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
