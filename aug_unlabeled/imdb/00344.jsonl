{"text": "At the height of his popularity in the Thirties and Forties , he tended to be regarded as a ' personality ' actor , who always played the same role in different settings .Later , his performances were reassessed .Because he appeared so ' natural ' , the public and even the critics believed he was simply playing himself .But , as countless stars have said , playing yourself is the most difficult art in the cinema .He was born in 1901 , the son of British immigrants .His father was a judge who owned a ranch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They lived in Helena , Montana , which Cooper remembered when it was a goldmining town - called Last Chance Gulch .During the making of his penultimate film , The Wreck of the Mary Deare ( 1959 ) , he reminisced about the old days : .

{"text": "During his time at college - where he also developed his skill as a cartoonist - he thought he 'd like to join the staff of a newspaper .By then his parents were living in Los Angeles , and Cooper was strolling down Hollywood Boulevard when he met a couple of chums who were playing extra roles in cheap Westerns for $ 10 a day .He decided to join them .From 1925 Cooper appeared briefly in countless films .Then in 1927 , Clara Bow - who had been having a much - publicized romance with Cooper - managed to secure him a minor role in Wings , directed by William Wellman , where he played an easy - going but doomed young flyer in World War I.

{"text": "In the meantime Warners starred Cooper in action films such as Task Force ( 1949 ) , a routine naval drama , because they felt that the public would not accept Cooper in his usual spotless - hero guise until the adverse publicity died down .It was just a good story of the policeman who had to do a job and the townsfolk who were prepared to let him do it alone .But it was a good script and we had a fine director .Fred Zinnemann .I really did n't see it as a psychological Western .
