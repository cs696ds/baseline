{"text": "In the ' 80s and ' 90s , some of us would rush home from school and pop in our favorite tape until it was totally worn down , of course here that tape was probably one of the Star Wars films .Granted , times have changed , home video formats have largely changed , and even Star Wars has changed , so this new poll asks how often fans watch the Star Wars films , and applies to any or all of the Star Wars films , prequel or OT .No schedule ...I put down once a year but I 'm sure that it 's not even that frequently .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The specialness of a thing disappates if it gets used too much I think .Funny thing , I was just thinking about this the other day .I 'd say I 'm once or twice year watcher .The main factors are what I 'm in the mood to watch and what I have time for .I may have time for a movie , but feel like a comedy .Or I may want to watch SW , but only have a half hour .I watched SW last week and was going to watch ESB today but just did n't feel it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
