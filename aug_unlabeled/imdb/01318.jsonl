{"text": "Perhaps more than any other modern monarch , Nicholas II attached his fate and the future of his dynasty to the notion of the ruler as a saintly and infallible father to his people .This idealized vision of the Romanov monarchy blinded him to the actual state of his country .With a firm belief that his power to rule was granted by Divine Right , Nicholas assumed that the Russian people were devoted to him with unquestioning loyalty .This ironclad belief rendered Nicholas unwilling to allow the progressive reforms that might have alleviated the suffering of the Russian people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite constant oppression , the desire of the people for democratic participation in government was strong .Since the Age of Enlightenment , Russian intellectuals had promoted Enlightenment ideals such as the dignity of the individual and of the rectitude of democratic representation .These ideals were championed most vociferously by Russia 's liberals , although populists , Marxists , and anarchists also claimed to support democratic reforms .Workers responded to the massacre with a crippling general strike , forcing Nicholas to put forth the October Manifesto which established a democratically elected parliament ( the State Duma ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Unfulfilled hopes of democracy fueled revolutionary ideas and violent outbursts targeted at the monarchy .One of the Tsar 's principal rationales for risking war in 1914 was his desire to restore the prestige that Russia had lost amid the debacles of the Russo - Japanese war .Nicholas also sought to foster a greater sense of national unity with a war against a common and ancient enemy .The Russian Empire was an agglomeration of diverse ethnicities that had shown significant signs of disunity in the years before the First World War .Nicholas believed in part that the shared peril and tribulation of a foreign war would mitigate the social unrest over the persistent issues of poverty , inequality , and inhuman working conditions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
