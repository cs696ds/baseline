{"text": "Make no mistake , this is still Pink Floyd in all their song - writing glory , but there is no denying the restraint they exercised when recording this album .The creeping swell of emotion that is the style of Floyd can be recognized on the opening number and self - titled song,\"Obscured by Clouds \" .Not a bad beat to groove to , and luckily for us , they did not open with their best track .I can not say which songs you will like more than others , but my favorites and the ones I show my friends include the tracks \" When You 're In \" , \" Childhood 's End \" , and \" Stay \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This would be an album that I would recommend listening to on a long car ride , maybe in the background .I would not sit down and listen to it as seriously as Floyd 's other more highly rated albums , but I would n't rule out of my collection among Pink Floyd 's discography .It 's much more accepting when you find out it 's the score for a movie .MEMBERS LOGIN ZONE .As a registered member ( register here if not ) , you can post rating / reviews ( & edit later ) , comments reviews and submit new albums .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Out of all the Pink Floyd album out there , 1972 's Obscured by Clouds has to be my favorite .Although I doubt that many other people share this opinion , I suppose in my little world of me , my thoughts are all that counts .So just to make clear , I am not here to be a preachy hipster and tell you to fall in love with this album .That would just be inane , and I know nobody wants that .Yet , I have an urge to share my thoughts on it with the progressive community .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The band was known to perform on other soundtracks , such as Zabriskie Point , The Comittee , and other , more obscure and less known filmscores .But the major , well know releases by the band were More ( 1969 ) , and this album .The music was made for the 1972 film \" La Vall\u00e9e \" , written and directed by Barbet Schroeder .Schroeder , a well known Iranian director who 's career was based in French cinema during the 60 's , was the same man who directed the 1969 film More , which Pink Floyd also recorded a soundtrack for .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Due to this , the album was largely forgotten by the general public .After people had reveled in the majesty of the trifecta of Pink Floyd hit albums , Obscured By Clouds started to be slowly noticed .Critics were inclined to shrug it off as well , and the album again faded back into Obscure - ity ( I 'm sorry , I had to ) .As for me , my friend actually found this album at a music store nearby to where I lived .Knowing that I sought the entire Pink Floyd chronology , he so kindly bought it for about five dollars and brought it over .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Mind you , this was one first new listens to the band I had in over a year , and I was incredibly excited to give it a listen .At first listen , the album did n't appeal to me as much as I thought it would .I had always been a lover of the under appreciated , and that was probably why A Momentary Lapse of Reason ( 1987 ) was my favorite album by the band for a long time .But this sadly did not strike a chord with me like I expected it to .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It sat there for an ungodly amount of time , perhaps two months or so , until I pulled it back out to give it another listen .Then , something that rarely happens with me happened with this album .On my second listen , I loved the album .In the period of time that the album was sitting in my shelf , I was researching more and more on the band in order to grasp everything I needed to know about them .I had already gained Dark Side well before this , and thoroughly enjoyed it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This was actually surprising to me , and I had come to know that usually albums that preceded masterpieces were highly influential to the band 's sound .Knowing this , I came at the album with a totally different mentality , and I liked the album much more than I did at first listen .Unlike the 1970 's hit of Meddle , OBC 's sound is extremely different .True , the former did propel Pink Floyd into a whole new era , but it was OBC 's job to reinforce that sound .It did it very successfully .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Everything about this album is right ; there is a healthy amount of tracks , a simple yet cool album cover ( an unfocused picture of a man sitting in a tree , who would have guessed ? ) , and not to mention some really fine songs .Out of the tracks , there are probably only a few that I enjoy a ton more over the others .Not to say that any of them are bad , but most of them do get sort of the same feeling out of me .The two rockiest of the tracks , ' When You 're In ' and ' The Gold It 's In The ... ' , are both simple , fantastic little ditties by Gilmour .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Very Zeppelin like , especially taking into account the time of this album 's release . 'Mudmen ' is a nice instrumental , something that you could take a snooze to .Listening through the album may not give it the same effect , because it comes right after ' Wots ...Uh the Deal ' , another really slow acoustic track . 'Childhood 's End ' is probably my second highest pick for this album .There is so much Dark side influence on it that if you 'd put this next to ' Time ' , and I did n't know the two albums , I would swear they were from the same release .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
