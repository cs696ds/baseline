{"text": "Interview : Horror Icon Barbara Crampton .I really do n't think I need to introduce the subject of this interview .Any horror fan worth their salt knows Barbara Crampton and the important contribution she 's giving to the genre .Beginning her career in 1983 on DAYS OF OUR LIVES , her talent and drop - dead gorgeous looks landed her in her first feature length film , FRATERNITY VACATION ( a popular teen - sex - romp that was so popular in the 80 's ) .But that same year , 1985 , Barbara Crampton would be thrust into the horror archives for her role as \" Megan Halsey \" in Stuart Gordon 's RE - ANIMATOR , a genre - defining film that blew away horror fans around the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Rides , games , and cotton candy at my fingertips daily .We travelled in the Summer when we were off from school .There were many types of people who are drawn to that way of life .Transients and drifters being very common .I 'm not certain it drew me to the world of horror , but it certainly exposed me to the type of individuals who are on the fringe of society and afforded me a kind of acceptance for ALL creatures horrible and not !Who are some of the directors , actors , and actresses who 've influenced your horror performances ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What are some of your all time favorite horror films ?My favorite actors growing up were Bette Davis , Miriam Hopkins and Danny Kaye .I used to love to watch old black and white movies after school on the daily ' Million Dollar Movie .

{"text": "Yet the longevity of this and FROM BEYOND really come from the single minded and laser focus of Stuart .He has a passion and a strong force of will to bend others to his thinking !His movies are full and cohesive , and he knows what he wants .He gets the performances he wants out of everyone .The behind the scenes people and the actors in front .He will tirelessly push you in a very calm yet energetic way .He is the movie .You 've starred in some of my favorite genre films : RE - ANIMATOR , FROM BEYOND , CASTLE FREAK , CHOPPING MALL , and PUPPETMASTER .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What 's your personal favorite role out of all the various films and TV shows you 've been in ?I loved playing Katherine in FROM BEYOND .There was so much range in that character .Repressed intellectual , sassy seductress , and heroine all in the space of 86 minutes .We filmed the movie in Italy , my first time there , on the old De Laurentiis lot .It was a lovely shoot .I also had a very juicy part in THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS for many years . \"Leanna Love \" was her name .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "More dreams with scarier SFX .I would also explore the devil a bit more .Who is he ?Perhaps with the angle that you create the devil out of your own sins .Could Your Evilness coupled with the energy of others ( Roman and Minnie ) create the thing that is most feared in life .What if the devil is n't real , unless you create pain and misery in others .Perhaps you ( Guy ) are the devil and your bad energy is unleashed on a world because of the choices you make .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "I thought The Blair Witch Project was extremely effective in portraying helplessness in the face of an unknown , borderline omnipotent power .And those wooden witch figures hanging from the trees provided a great example of having the crap scared out of you in broad daylight .Daytime scary is worse than nighttime scary .And do n't let 's forget the musical scores .When they 're done right , they add so much to creating tension - my favorites are from The Shining , Alien , and The Thing ( 1982 ) , if those can properly be called scores .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
