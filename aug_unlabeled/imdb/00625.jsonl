{"text": "I do n't think I would quibble with the notion of describing each of those films a \" Western classic .\" Scott , however , had of course been a major Western star long before his association with Budd Boetticher and Burt Kennedy .We talk regularly here about those earlier pictures directed by Andre De Toth for just one example .Most of Scott 's films after 1950 were made or released by either Warners or Columbia ( alternating sometimes ) .But his earliest western successes were probably those produced by Nat Holt and often released by RKO , directed by Ray Enright and others .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One that fails to warrant mention very often , it seems , is Trail Street from 1947 .The story is a range war drama with the matter of law and order interwoven as farmers and ranchers are at loggerheads .The farmers can not get their wheat to grow due partly to climate but mainly due to the free roaming of the ranchers ' cattle .This is exacerbated by the lack of local law and order .Into this situation rides Bat Masterson ( Scott ) who is enlisted as town marshal to bring a degree of order .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Gabby \" is always a plus in anything for me .Scott also deputizes Robert Ryan whose character discovers a form of wheat that will withstand the drought conditions , so making a brighter prospect for the farmers and therefore the community .There is of course plenty of slam - bang shoot-'em - up action as one would expect and the different strands of the storyline are woven together well .As if the presence of Scott and Hayes was n't enough , we have the beauty of Anne Jeffries in support and the strong role played by the always - excellent Ryan too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Against the backdrop of the first Olympics in Germany since World War II , the Munich Massacre , as it has come to be known , is one of the most ruthless and appalling acts of terror the world has witnessed .Today , 40 years later , the victims ' families and the Israeli people still struggle to understand how such an atrocity could occur , how such a heinous act was carried out at an event dedicated to sportsmanship and cultural celebration .And all that we ask for is just one minute .Every four years since the ' 72 Games , widows of those murdered athletes have petitioned the International Olympic Committee to hold one minute of silence at the opening ceremonies to honor their memory .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "According to a recent explanation from its president , Jacques Rogge , \" the opening ceremony is an atmosphere that is not fit to remember such a tragic incident .\" This explanation is not only unsatisfactory , but it is also insulting .The Olympics are indeed a celebration , but there is a responsibility to recall past participants murdered during the Games , on Olympic soil .If the atmosphere of the opening ceremony is not fit for recalling tragedy , then the IOC must create an atmosphere that is , just as it appropriately did at the 2002 Games by opening them with a minute of silence to honor the victims of 9/11 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It reminds us to appreciate .At an international gathering such as the Olympics , silence is the most universal language of all , understood by everyone without forcing any interpretations or beliefs .An entire Olympic stadium filled with athletes from every country and religion observing one minute of silence sends a strong message that all peoples stand together in rejecting terrorism and hatred .We are asking for sixty seconds of silence because we want the opportunity to pause , reflect , mourn , and , above all , unite .According to the Olympic Charter , the IOC 's role is \" to encourage and support the promotion of ethics in sport ... to take action in order to strengthen the unity ... to act against any form of discrimination affecting the Olympic Movement .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Yet , the IOC cites its commitment to keeping the games apolitical as a paramount interest and contends that a minute of silence for the Israeli victims will compromise that priority .The IOC 's refusal to hold the minute of silence for this reason frames the decision within a political context and demonstrates that it is tone deaf to the cause : a memorial to eleven Olympic athletes .Indeed , if agreeing to host a moment of silence is a political statement , refusing to host a moment of silence is also a political statement .And a much more powerful one at that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
