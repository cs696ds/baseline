{"text": "For the most part the thing I liked about it was it had a fresh look to it , Don 's directing and camera movements are ambitious and exciting , it introduced Joe Ripple and I loved Stover and Ruxton 's performances .Apart from that I have to say it is probably the least satisfactory Dohler film for me .He is getting back on the saddle and there 's still interesting things going on but he 's not hit his stride yet .It 's still enjoyable and if you were in a house where this was the only Don Dohler film available then I would suggest watching this in a heart beat but really I do n't think it will be a film I 'll revisit as often as the others .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nick : I just re - watched it this week and I have to say that I enjoyed it even more the second time .The first thing that stands out to me is how great the movie looks .The camera work is fantastic and Dohler really tries out a lot of new techniques .There are also a ton of great special effects ... the energy - field - time - warp - wall - thing is very effective and I love all the scenes involving the spaceship interior and exterior .There are some great performances too ... the cameos from Ruxton and Frith are amazing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What you see is what you get . \"Jamie Kalman , Jonas Grey , and Donna Sherman are all great in their first Dohler films and Steven King effectively plays possibly the worst cop in small - town alien invasion history .It 's also great to see Joe Ripple for the first time , although why he decides to run face - first into a shimmering pulsing energy field is beyond me .( His burned carcass is a nice effect , though . )I think Joe is a legitimately good actor and this is a great start for him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Musically , I 'm assuming it 's all library music but it 's used very effectively ... the main title theme is especially good .On the whole , I think it 's a great return to filmmaking for Don .It 's tough to rate it when comparing it to the original run of 5 films but if I were looking at it on its own as if from a new director I 'd think it was a fantastic start .I 'll give it a solid 4 but only because it does n't quite have the plot development of the early films and also does n't have the original synth soundtrack .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is the first partnership pairing between Dohler and Joe Ripple .The story is similar to that of BLOOD MASSACRE .A gang of thugs led by a Marine vet ( Donna Sherman ) knock over a convenience store .One of the gang gets shot and the getaway car conks out .This forces them to carjack and kidnap a young woman - making her take them to her family 's house .This mild mannered family is held at gunpoint until two Federal Marshals show up , looking for the criminals .From this point on it is a cat - and - mouse chase , and not everything is as it initially seems to be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are veteran cast members present , but also newer additions including Leanna Chamish , Donna Sherman and Steven King .There are a lot of visual effects on display ; some work , some are surreal , and some do not work .There is a strip club , a blood bath , vicious kills , stalking in the woods , Federal agents , eerie basements and a synth soundtrack .Can you separate this as its own movie ( knowing its roots are in BLOOD MASSACRE ) and will you both please give us your thoughts on everything discussed here ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Spectacularly creepy .I think with Blood Massacre you connect with George and therefore his ' last stand ' seems more heroic and brilliant .It 's also a more pleasingly frantic and crazy finale than Harvesters which is definitely more mainstream , which is not necessarily a bad thing .The production values , camerawork and acting are definitely an interesting improvement .Also the step towards a more exploitation / horror style of film making ( the blood bath , the pitch fork , the cleaver etc . ) shows Don and Joe to be as inventive in this genre as Don had previously been in the alien / monster movie pictures .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is a lot of creativity displayed in the camera work and in the violence and gore .Many of the deaths are completely original and the blood bath scene is a great way to add nudity in a creepy mood - setting way .I love having the original synth soundtrack back ... some of the little quiet motifs in the slower suspenseful scenes are especially good .And the \" Harvesters \" song by Voodoo Highway joins \" Danger \" and \" Maybe Someday , \" on the ultimate Dohler playlist .Another film , another fantastic role for George Stover as he gets to tap into his demented unsettling side again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The versatility of Stover knows no bounds .Everyone returning from ALIEN RAMPAGE is also great ... the standouts for me are Donna Sherman and Steven King .Joe Ripple has another great part as the marshal and , of course , Leanna Chamish is a tremendous addition to the ensemble cast as the disturbing house - wife , Betty .Of all the movies I 've seen her in so far this is my favorite role .The climactic chase through the woods ( as is required in all Dohler films ) is terrific and the twist at the very end really works for me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "We ca n't wait to hear what you have to say about VAMPIRE SISTERS , DEAD HUNT and CRAWLER - not to mention the works of other fine independent filmmakers .Do you have any closing words before we wrap this up ?Jon : I would like to add that , as the internet continues to expose people to a variety of film making , with both low and high budgets , that there is a worrying trend of sneering , laughing or downright smuggly and superiorly attacking films like this .Don acknowledges some of this in Blood , Boobs and Beast , which is why , on re - watch , it bothers me that there were ' fans ' included who do , quite simply , that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Keep up the good work , sir , and I ca n't wait to check out CRAWLER !George Lucas ' comedy American Graffiti is by far his best - written and most enjoyable picture , and perhaps the only one with a consistent sense of humor .There really is no other movie by anybody that captures the particular ' in between ' years after the death of Buddy Holly ( an event unknown to me , at age 8) and the arrival of The Beatles , an Earth - shattering event for a kid of 12 .In August of 1960 I moved to San Bernardino , California , a car town where the big activity was to find some way , any way , to sneak behind the wheel of a car .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "San Berdoo was also a big , big AM radio market , with two competing Rock ' n ' Roll stations .The airwaves in 1963 overflowed with pop music , almost all of which seemed to be one - of - a - kind novelty songs , each with a different \" sound \" .Although we could n't receive Wolfman Jack , his legend was present , and the stations we listened to ( my favorite was KMEN 129 ) were highly interactive .When American Graffiti arrived , I can say that most people my age experienced their first blast of genuine nostalgia .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As far as I was concerned , the fun and craziness of Graffiti was my personal experience , which is nonsense .But all that music ran in our blood stream ... .I had heard of Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck , who 7 or 8 years before were star film students .George Lucas turned to them to help sketch the great characters of American Graffiti , something we wish he 'd done for more of his later movies , as he ca n't write dialogue to save his soul .Katz and Huyck were making their own \" cheapo horror movie \" , an overachieving , artsy thriller known as Messiah of Evil .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The wonderful , insightful comic characters of American Graffiti are perhaps so perfect because the film 's long gestation period gave the writers time to really think everything out .The script was finalized so close to its production date that the studio had no time to screw it up , and Lucas had no opportunity for second - guessing .The serendipity at work of course extends much farther than the script .Lucas 's choice of Techniscope is rescued by Haskell Wexler 's pinch - hitting to optimize images filmed in that wild format -- those poor cameramen used all their skill just to keep the actors in focus .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Perhaps adopting the directing style of his partner- partial mentor Francis Coppola , Lucas kept the shooting loose , allowing the actors as much freedom as possible given the short schedule .The result still looks entirely fresh .We 're almost surprised to see rehearsal footage of the actors reciting their lines , as so many of the performances have a \" first time through \" quality .I 've heard complaints that the movie looks too \" fifties \" to be 1962 , which is nonsense -- before the homogenization of media , the youth culture of every American town was at a different evolutionary stage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A big surprise of American Graffiti was that somebody got those kids to cut their hair and learn to dance the way they might in ' 62 .That was when it was n't criminally uncool to go to a dance to actually dance , and having fun was the point even if the best you could do was a spastic twist imitation .Girls did dance in their socks , and girls too secure to be intimidated danced with girls -- often the only good dancer available was another girl .We were hugely grateful for ANY band that could play hit songs and make lots of noise -- no arbiters of taste griped at the playlist or told us that the musicians were incompetent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This was all part of the innocence .Some of the claims made on the very good Laurent Bouzereau docu for American Graffiti are a bit wacko ( was Graffiti really the first movie to use parallel , unrelated plots ? )The brilliance of the screenplay is its structural decision to pair up opposite characters .Clean - cut college material & budding intellectual Curt ( Richard Dreyfuss ) is hijacked by a trio of low - riding hoodlums from the Pharaohs car club , led by the laid - back Joe ( Bo Hopkins ) .The Homecoming Queen and the BMOC jock Laurie and Steve ( Cindy Williams & Ron Howard ) work out familiar teen romance issues , culminating in a potential tragedy when Laurie steps into the hot rod driven by the reckless street racing menace Bob Falfa ( Harrison Ford ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By that time we had a better idea who Kathleen Quinlan , Kay Lenz , Joe Spano and Suzanne Somers were .Harrison Ford probably fell into this category too , considering that he had zoomed from unknown to superstar in the interim .Another common comment about American Graffiti is that its wall - to - wall selection of pop music cues \" constitutes another character \" .I would n't go that far , but the use of a lot of songs that even by 1973 had been banished to retro oldies stations created a shock of recognition .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Beyond the tunes themselves , we 'd never heard creative sound design like this before .The songs echo and distort in perspective when heard from down the block .The music reverb - echoes between plate glass windows and goes in and out of phase when a particular car radio delays the signal .A single lyric line or music riff will suddenly jump through the audio haze to be heard in the foreground .Lucas , his editors and his ace sound designer - mixer Walter Murch wrap the songs around the action .The visuals are cut to fit the meter of the music , which of course , is both a reflection of and catalyst for the action on screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Of course , plenty of lyric lines are positioned to comment on the screen action , such as The Big Bopper 's \" Helllloooo , bayy - bee ! \"as Terry is confronted by a pair of oversized car thieves .These tend to be as funny ( or touching ) on the tenth viewing as they were on the first .The ending titles explaining the fates of the four male leads have been hit with a lot of criticism , some of which is legit -- the girls are n't afforded the same courtesy .I can vouch that there were gasps in the audience , as the one - line text bios broke the spell of the movie that went before .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "My age group was n't affected until the end of the ' 60s and a few years beyond , but George Lucas probably saw a lot of his classmates get derailed by the war , if not swallowed up by it .The kid behaviors are less exaggerated than they are ' compressed ' , with a lot of extremes crammed into the one night .American Graffiti is n't a coming of age movie , it 's a anthropological thesis on mating rituals ( the funny kind ) .Curt 's exclamation , \" that girl in the car !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "They 're babies and clueless dolts just like you were , maybe blessed with better looks but more likely possessed of a slightly stronger illusion of self - esteem .American Graffiti is a collection of teen legends , yet it very strongly captures the desperation of those high school years .The cumulative feeling imparted is that all this fun and immature romance will soon evaporate in the hard world of adult realities and cruel politics .Universal 's Blu - ray of American Graffiti is bright , colorful , clean and sharp ; I like it much better than the image on the older DVD .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I swear , with the darker , more marginal scenes such as the pre - dawn drive to Paradise Road , the swimming patterns of grain almost overpowered the image .By going ( I assume ) back to the original half - frame Techniscope original , Universal 's assets managers have extracted a far superior image than could be obtained through the crummy 1973 optics that blew Techniscope up to anamorphic widescreen .Just as so many web reviews of this modern classic have no clue whatsoever about what elevates it above and beyond teen comedies from any decade , I ca n't say that I bother to read through technically oriented reviews crying foul over the improved transfer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Some of the reviews do n't seem aware that the show was filmed in glorified 16 mm , on film stock rated for two or three times the lighting that Lucas and Haskell Wexler used .It still looks plenty rough in darker shots , but now we see decent colors .American Graffiti had a ragged docu look , but I 'd rather watch disc this than the old degraded image .And I 'm fairly sure Lucas has n't altered anything .He does n't own this movie outright and has little to gain by \" improving \" it every ten years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Walter Murch ( I believe it was him ) really went to town , crafting a track that does everything right and might be ruined by further ' spreading out ' or the addition of intrusive directional effects .Those rock ' n ' roll hits sound beefier and more authentic than the 45rpm originals .The disc carries all of the excellent extras from earlier DVD editions .The long form making - of docu uses interviews with many of the original actors .Richard Dreyfuss manages to compliment himself even when saying what a klutz he was , while Harrison Ford states flat out that he 'd all but given up on acting after six or seven years of near - total frustration .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
