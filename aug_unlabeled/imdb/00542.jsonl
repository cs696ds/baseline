{"text": "Joanna M. Smith , 54 ; this is the edition of the 1831 text that Marshall uses and that I shall continue to cite ) .At the same time , \" The dissecting room and the slaughter - house furnished many of my materials ... \" ( Frankenstein 56 ) .And he \" became acquainted with the science of anatomy \" ( Frankenstein 53 ) .A \" Chronology of Events , \" which precedes Marshall 's exposition proper , begins with the Murder Act of 1752 which made the medical dissection of all executed murderers compulsory .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is pointed out in the chronology that \" More than a thousand corpses a year disappear from burial grounds in England and Scotland in the first decade of the nineteenth century \" ( xiii ) .But still the demand exceeded the supply .The utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Benthan believed that people should be encouraged to volunteer their bodies for dissection after their deaths , and set an example by volunteering his own .In accordance with his will , his body was publicly dissected after his death in 1832 .It was a short step from digging up corpses for the surgeons to actually creating corpses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The corpses they sold to the Edinburgh anatomist Dr. Robert Knox were the result of murders they themselves committed .After Hare turned King 's evidence , Burke was hanged and dissected in Edinburgh in 1829 .Back in 1819 , the surgeon John Abernethy ( whose lectures Percy Shelley attended in 1811 ) proposed in print for the first time that pauper bodies be used for dissection .In 1824 , Thomas Southwood Smith published an article recommending \" that all unclaimed bodies from hospitals and workhouses should automatically be handed over for dissection \" ( xiii ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Invariably , after the Anatomy Act , the corpses made available to surgeons were those of the poor .It was their corpses which were most likely to be unclaimed by relatives .Instead of being a murderer in order to be a candidate for dissection , it was now only necessary to be poor .Marshall 's chronology reveals that the Anatomy Act became law on 1 August 1832 , shortly after the First Reform Act which became law on 7 June 1832 .Both acts targeted the poor -- the first Reform Act denied them voting rights and the Anatomy Act equated them with the murderers of the 1752 Murder Act .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are no direct allusions to the events described above in the three editions of Frankenstein ( of course at the time of the original 1818 edition most of them had yet to come to pass ) .Nor are there any in Mary Shelley 's letters and journals .I know because I have checked Betty T. Bennett 's edition of the letters and Paul R. Feldman and Diana Scott - Kilvert 's edition of the journals .An example occurs in this quotation from Smith 's introduction which is of particular importance to Marshall 's argument : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The \" politics of the day\" ... are the increasingly violent public debates over a Reform Bill whose early version would have enfranchised a portion of the working as well as the middle class .( Smith 14 ; quoted , minus the paragraph indentation , Marshall 24 ) .Marshall claims that both the Anatomy Bill , which failed in 1829 , and the Reform Bill were responsible for the unrest to which Mary Shelley refers in her letter .Murdering to Dissect requires a very suspicious reading .It is necessary to distinguish between reasonable theoretical , biographical speculations and wire - drawn -- often theory - driven -- analogies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is certainly relevant to note that grave - robbing was rife in the Scotland that Mary Shelley knew as a girl and that \" Frankenstein 's grave - robbing exploits anchor the story in the medical realities of the day . . . \"( 5 ) .Frankenstein may reasonably be described as \" a comparative anatomist \" ( 71 ) and the monster as \" the artificial product of the dissecting room \" ( 69 ) .But there are many other statements which , if not exactly untrue , variously stretch the truth .It may well be , as Marshall claims , that \" Mary Shelley 's story is haunted by the spectre of death in poverty \" ( 147)--an understandable enough human fear -- but is it so in Frankenstein because dissection would be the inevitable consequence ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "With a parting gesture ... figures as the angry gallows crowd of the early eighteenth century .Appearing to Frankenstein 's sight , he ' jeers ' and , in a claiming gesture , points to the corpse as one of his own .The \" figure \" in this quote of the monster as the proletarian crowd of potential pauper dissectees is crucial to the development of Marshall 's thesis .The monster , it is repeatedly stated ( 55 , 125 , 158 , 169 , 226 ) is , in effect , more than one person ; he is an assemblage of corpses ; he is therefore the crowd .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The ground rules of interpretation have changed considerably over the past twenty years .At issue is what constitutes evidence .The kind of analogical argument that abounds in Murdering to Dissect is today pretty much the norm and no doubt many readers , given the appropriate post - structuralist assumptions , will be more favourably disposed towards its endlessly generative analogies than I am .What used to be strained is now liberating .A good example is Marshall 's treatment of the \" hulks , \" as the moored , rotting ships used as overcrowded prisons were called : \" In 1815 there existed five hulks holding around 2,500 convicts ; by 1828 ten hulks held around 4,500 \" ( 185 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Because of the overcrowded conditions , the mortality rate on these hulks was very high and thus they provided \" a convenient source of [ young ] corpses for the [ dissection ] slab \" ( 187 ) .Call me old - fashioned but I find this far - fetched .The prisoners aboard the hulks died of diseases caused by overcrowding and insanitary conditions .It was not yet understood when Frankenstein was written that diseases were caused by germs often related to vermin .The term \" vermin , \" of course , can be related to human beings as well as rodents .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Translating all the analogies , the working class and the poor ( both represented by the monster ) , are to be equated with \" rampantly procreating bacilli . \"\" The developments in Frankenstein which are the work of the Creature 's hand can be cast into a ' germ - ism ' scenario of the invisible enemy \" ( 243 ) .According to Marshall 's summation , .The historical monster in Frankenstein is the 1832 Anatomy Act , the lineaments of which were assembled after the story appeared in 1818 .The resurrectionist culture Mary Shelley grew up in . . .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But history recasts Frankenstein after Burke and Hare ....In this book I have tried to read the script which history put into the tale of Frankenstein .But there is no evidence -- as Marshall himself admits -- that that interpretation had anything much to do with Mary Shelley 's intentions , insofar as they can be persuasively reconstructed .But the work itself is always amenable to new readings .If one wishes , a reader may understand \" The hare mockingly offered to Frankenstein \" as \" a metonymy of the reversal crowd [ a term drawn from Canetti 's theory ] \" ( 291 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But one wonders why Marshall did not go the additional distance and allow history to rewrite this hare so that it is understood as a mocking figure for William Hare !Finally , there is something misshapen and distorted about Murdering to Dissect .It is not really a book about Frankenstein .It is really a very interesting and engagingly written work of cultural history dealing with the anatomy legislation , its context , and related literary works , including Frankenstein .For much of this material Marshall is indebted , as he acknowledges , to Ruth Richardson 's Death , Dissection & the Destitute ( Harmondsworth : Penguin , 1989 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Marshall has useful things to say about various dissection - related publications such as De Quincey 's On Murder Considered as One of the Fine Arts ( 1827 , 1839 ) , Dickens ' Barnaby Rudge ( 184O ) , and Mrs. Gaskell 's Mary Barton ( 1848 ) .A better book would have resulted had Marshall simply treated Frankenstein as one further such example and not over - inflated that case by making it the primary subject of his book .Marshall has taken what should have been an article on Frankenstein and , with too much repetition , combined it with what should have been a general sociological / cultural / literary study in a way that seriously skews the relative weights of the two components .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
