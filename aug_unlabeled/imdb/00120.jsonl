{"text": "6 Reasons ' The Office ' Was At Its Best In Season 8 .Let 's face it : television fans are a fickle bunch .While watching a particular series may be \" must see TV \" during the course of one season , that same series can be easily relegated down to a Netflix \" wait \" or an on - sale DVD release .When The Office lost Steve Carell toward the end of season 7 , fans were appropriately concerned with what might happen to television 's longtime comedy staple .Completely admitting that The Office has generally been hit - or - miss since its most famed seasons , one - time fans of the series should know that they 're missing out on some absolutely wonderful television .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Robert California wore out his welcome halfway through the season .He was great when his presence brought back the awkward humor that made The Office funny in the first place , but when he spirals out of control and just becomes weak and uninterested in involving himself in the company at all , is presence is wasted .I have to agree that this season has been a really great one for the show .The first episode of the season was my favorite mainly because of how they revealed Andy being the new boss .One thing I ca n't stand about this season is Nellie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Completely agree , Nellie was great for the first episode .Then , the rest of the entire Florida thing was forced .Anyone who Honestly thinks this is better then any season then maybe Season 4 ( Writer strike season ) ...Needs to go back and rewatch the show .I ve rewatched all 8 seasons a minimal of 4 times each , yes I have no life , and season 8 is by far the most forced and weakest written season so far .It was great for the first 13 episodes , they dragges Andy not knowing if he can run the branch out WAY TOO LONG , Only 2 of the florida episodes were really good .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There is a reason why the producers decided to bring back David Wallace .Catherine Tate , Nellie , is the worst thing to happen to a television series in a long time .I loathed every moment she was on - screen .And Andy 's \" mercy \" on her in the finale put the nail in the coffin for me .I got tired of Robert California after his house party , but I despised Nellie the second she leaned in Ryan 's ear and uttered her first line .They should 've killed her off after last season 's interview .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Andy as the boss was a sloppy choice .In fact the office was incredibly sloppy with its cast and storylines this year .Whatever happened to the girl that was hired by Will Farrell 's character ?Whatever happened to the other girl who took over for Pam who was hitting on Jim ?What s been the point of the Angela / Senator storyline that 's been strung out .For me Tate was the only character who made the show worth watching - it was just a shame it took over half the season before she came in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Season 9 needs to be the end . and Andy better be out of that bosses chair .He 's not Michael Scott and they need to stop making him out to be Michael .Andy was only funny as a supporting character .Here 's to hoping season 9 will step up .TATE WAS THE ONLY CHARACTER WHO MADE THE SHOW WORTH WATCHING ? ? ?TATE ? ? ? ?Tate is the single worst thing to ever happen to The Office .Beyond the fact that the actor comes across forced and absolutely skin crawlingly annoying 100 % of the time , the character herself is worthless , mean , vindictive , and has ZERO qualifications for ANYTHING does !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I wish she had died .Then maybe the series would 've lived .The word \" great \" and \" Whitney \" have never been used in the same sentence .I was n't even able to get through the ads for that show , let alone an episode .How that got greenlit , I 'll never know .The Office had some great moments this year ( the Florida storyline was ripe with them ) , but the show is not the same without Michael Scott .As much as I still enjoy the show , I think it 's time to put it to bed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I actually hated Michael Scott after season 3 and was overjoyed when I heard he was leaving .I did n't find him funny in the least .Offensively ignorant .Hated him .I loved the first couple episodes with Andy as the boss were my favorites of all time .He balanced being a goof with being a real boss .But then they changed him ; tried to turn him into Michael Scott 2.0 and the season plummeted .I ca n't believe I just went through this slideshow .This season has been absolutely horrible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's gotten so unrealistic as far as office dynamics go , that it takes away from the whole point of the show .Spader 's character was OK for a minute , but throughout the whole season , was just annoying .Obviously , writer of this was on some kind of illegal substance if they genuinely found this season funny .This season has turned out better than I had hoped , I was hesitant to see how this would all work out , but they did a pretty good job .I did n't care much for the whole Andy chasing Erin story , just seems forced and I think they could 've come up with a better way to give Erin more screen time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This last season was awful .Robert California is such a annoying and one - dimensional character .The Andy getting fired and starting his own paper company story line is just recycled from the Michael Scott Paper Company story line .And what happened to the girl that was trying to seduce Jim ?Just lazy writing .This show needs to end .Andy Bernard just is n't funny to me .And to compare him ( even slightly ) to Michael Scott .... no way !The Jim & Pam thing did hurt the series but it was n't a series \" killer \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'll concede that one .Other than that I 'll say that I do agree that the rest of the cast has sort of picked up the slack and have really shined .And although I do miss Michael 's crazy antics , this has been an overall very enjoyable season .I 'd say the second half of season 8 was excellent .I was n't sold for the first few episodes of season 8 and believed that when the season 7 finale had Michael Scott removing the microphone would have been the best series finale .But , the cast shined more and more throughout the year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I 'm actually excited to see where the show goes from here .And my campaign against Whitney failed ... stupid NBC renewing that crapfest .Anthony - How much did NBC pay you to write that article ?Could not disagree more and have yet to actually talk to anyone face to face who still likes the show .What used to be MUST SEE is now CAN'T WATCH .Everyone has a right to their opinion but you 're just plain stupid if you consider this season any good .Maybe compared to other lame sitcoms on TV but compared to season 1 - 7 this was the worst season .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I grimace whenever I see her .Also this season lost a lot without Michael .He mad the how what it is and if you did n't like Michael then why did you bother watching the show ?I liked the awkward sense that Robert brings , but he is a little over utilized .I do n't see another season happening because Robert , kellie , and Dwight are all not going to return .I really did enjoy quite a few of the episodes this season in part because of Robert California .In the early episodes I liked the awkwardness he brought to the show , and at the end of the season I was laughing at his weirdness brought on by his going off the deep end following the collapse of his marriage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They both were terrific this year .The one thing I hated was when Nellie appeared .I just really do not like her in the least and can find nothing about her being there that is a plus .With Robert leaving and her staying I 'm concerned about season 9 ...I'm hoping she leaves and whatever the new dynamic is that drives the show is a winner .I agree on parts of this but being a longtime fan I have to say this season has bean the WEAKEST .I agree on the Jim and Dwight chemistry being stronger than ever , the Halpert family is still awesome , and the locations are good .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I HATED Robert California he is a total ASS and not funny a majority of the time in my opinion , GLAD he is leaving .I really wanted Andy as boss but I feel the writers tried to make him too much like Michael and not let him be himself enough , but overall he is all right .With many having not renewed their contracts , Rainn leaving midseason , and Kaling probably leaving my question is who will be left do the show ? ? ? ?I wish it had ended with season seven because the show has become pathetically stale and might not even get a decent final season with all this mess of contract renewals and characters departures .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I respectfully completey disagree .As a huge fan of the series and a loser with no life who has viewed every episode of The Office at least 4 times ...I feel like this entire season was forced and thinly written .I believe the use of Tate and several locations were there attempt to provide new and different takes to the show , which it does , but this is one time where i felt like it could ve been better left undone .The first 13 episodes are fantastic .I will agree that even in the weaker episodes Jim and Dwight 's rivalry / friendship still continue to shine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Robert California was great .They forced Andy to hold onto \" uncomfortable \" Andy too long .Confident Andy needs to come back from seasons 2 - 6 ...Then we will have another Michael as the boss .I like the direction the show is going .And I did enjoy this season still .I just felt other then maybe Season 4 which has 3 of my favorite episodes ( Dunder Mifflin Infinity , Launch Party , and Dinner Party ) ...It is the second weakest season of a consistently great show .That 's like trying to insult a compliment ... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I defended House these last two season and have loyally stuck by Supernatural through the last two years that people have bashed it .That all said I think this is easily the worst season of The Office .There have been a few great moments here and there but over all it 's been terrible .Robert California was over used and really had no place being around half as long as he was .His character was neither funny nor interesting .Daryl has lost a lot of his humor which is odd for one of the funniest actors around .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Jim seems less intelligent half the time and while it 's nice to see him back at doing the pranks they have probably been the worst he 's ever done .I 'm a big Ed Helms fan and a long time Andy defender , but this season was bad for him .I 've actually enjoyed the Andy Erin relationship the past few years as well that 's how much I usually like the guy .This season though I have not been laughing at the Andy scenes because they 've made me uncomfortable .None of them are funny it 's just been watching a poor pathetic man meltdown all year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nelie .She 's terrible in every way .She 's unlikable and worse yet unfunny .He managed to get almost everything wrong about this terrible season .Andy was a bore , Jim and Pam were non - existent , Robert California and Nellie were uninteresting and the ensemble was ignored for endless Andy as manager stories that went no where .Only Jim and Dwight were bright spots in what was easily the worst season of the series .A fact matched by its plumenting ratings .As a huge office fan I could n't disagree more with this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
