{"text": "But Christ , that 's what they 've done .Yea , and in the doing , they 've inspired me to consider committing a few venal sins - mostly killing and feeling wrath and such .For Christ 's Sake ultimately irritates through tedium and an inability to make us connect with any of the characters .While it may be hard to accurately place pins on the spots where things go wrong , a leisurely pace , lack of effective shock humor , and roundly lackluster performances are good places to look .Rue and Sasso fare best , but are due only faint praise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "She 's too relaxed , and brings little emotional depth to her part , meaning she does n't convince as either a porn performer or someone who might care for Robert .It 'd be more convincing if she just wanted to tease and befuddle the man , but the specter of humanist love has to come up .Meanwhile Sasso 's crass , lackadaisical Alan also lacks fire .He 's amusing and disingenuous , but little else , turning in a performance that would n't have generated many laughs even on Mad TV .Rees ( who must also suffer the ignominy of having his name misspelled on the DVD cover ) lacks even the leading - man good looks that would make Candy 's attraction believable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( Only Alex Borstein in a tiny role is allowed to go there , though her incestuously perverted mother character is disturbingly gross and needy , rather than funny . )A few amusing scenes of porn production between Candy and her leading man cough up some dirty language laughs , but that 's about it .So , Lord , I 'm not sure what I should do .I 'd like to cast the first stone , and pound those irritating characters a bit .I 'd like to smite director Douglas , and actor Rees .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So I guess I 'm going to hell , where I 'll probably have to watch For Christ 's Sake again .Save your soul and Skip It .( I 'm sure you can find those pictures of Rue online somewhere , if you , you know , need them . )The DVD .Video : A fairly heavenly 16 X 9 anamorphic widescreen transfer belies this indie comedy 's budget , with rich , lush colors and nice black levels .The image is pretty crisp and sharp , with good detail levels .Compression problems are kept to a bare minimum , mostly appearing in the form of some minor aliasing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A little bit of what sounds like poor room sound means some of the dialog contains a bit of echo , but that 's about it .Dialog and music are mixed well and otherwise there are n't real problems like drop outs or distortion to trouble you .However if you do n't like quirky indie comedy music that tells you who you should find goofy , with the introduction of those irritating pizzicato strings and such , your need to be dissatisfied will be met .Extras : A big old auto - navigation Stills Gallery delivers plenty of BTS shots , while the film 's Trailer and other Previews are all you get for extras .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
