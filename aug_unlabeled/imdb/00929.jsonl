{"text": "Bigger budget films should take note !It got better from there , not showing too much of the croc and building suspense with good pacing and realistic reactions from the cast .The cinematography and editing on the river journey were great .After seeing this I almost want to go to the Northern Territories .Almost , but not after the Croc finally shows its face .This is one primal beast .The film does a good job of keeping it under wraps for the early portion of the film but when it finally shows its face its a great moment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the second act the filmmakers do a great job at ratcheting up suspense , using a great set up involving the river .I wo nt spoil it here but its so simple but very effective .I am a jaded monster film fan and this one had me wanting to see it for a second time straight away .Crocs and Alligators seem to be the whipping boys of the film industry with so many comedy or low budget appearances .To finally to see one with real teeth and to give it a go with a good story and great fx is fantastic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
