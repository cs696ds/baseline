{"text": "Issues Views Reviews .Bollywood moving away from plagiarism ?We all love to bash Bollywood because the industry is in the habit of plagiarizing .In fact the very name ' Bollywood ' is so insulting that I wonder why those who work in Bollywood do n't feel ashamed that they are working in an industry with a name that implies that it is a Hollywood clone .Could it be that they do n't feel ashamed because there is hope that they might win awards ?Recently the music from the film Munnabhai Lage Raho won a national award even though one of the tunes was plagiarized .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If you trace the history of the industry we have had great films - some of them classics .I am naming just a few here .Mehboob Khan 's Andaz ( 1945 ) , K. Asif 's Mughal - e - Azam ( 1960 ) and Satyajit Ray 's Pather Panchali ( 1955 ) .In the seventies there were popular films like Sholay ( Ramesh Sippy , 1975 ) and films like Anand and Kati Patang .There was no such thing as \" Bollywood \" then , not as far as I remember .It all changed in the eighties .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "By the nineties stealing had become rampant but even now I like to believe that less than half of the films and music are plagiarized , but that 's just a guess .How long is this going to go on ?I mean , why is n't Hollywood complaining ?Why are n't they suing ?Well , even though Hollywood is n't suing , I think the copycats producers and directors are getting flak ... from bloggers .Today if a film or song is stolen , bloggers write about it and the directors and producers are shamed , well to some extent at least .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But this kind of copying can not last .It 's not going to last .I feel the Hindi film industry has reached a kind of peak ( of copying ) and with bloggers increasingly exposing these charlatans , movie producers are thinking of ways to avoid criticism and scandals .I think a change is in the offing .Recently , director Rajkumar Gupta \" struggled \" to get the rights of American pop singer Peggy Lee 's song for his film Aamir .They finally paid Rs.800,000 , a sum they could barely afford as it was a low - budget film ( with a budget of Rs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Imtiaz Ali of Jab We Met fame also tried to get the rights for \" rock band Katrina & The Waves Walking on Sunshine . \" In fact he had gone ahead and used the song for the promos but when the permission did not come through , he dropped the song .It 's not just their name that producers are worried about .Recently Rakesh Roshan had to pay Rs 2 crore to the music composer Ram Sampath who had filed a case against him for copying a tune in his film Krazzy 4 .If Hollywood ever sues and succeeds , the copycats could become bankrupt !", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's about time this happened because we have so many talented directors and a good number of original films coming out of the Hindi industry today that it would be a shame if a few copycats spoilt their good name .Aamir Khan 's Taare Zameen Par ( 2007 ) is just an example .Two more examples are the charming romantic film Parineeta ( 2005 ) and Lagaan ( 2001 ) which was nominated in the foreign film category of the Oscars .There are also the \" new wave \" films like Traffic Signal or Life in a Metro , Mr. and Mrs. Iyer and Khosla Ka Ghosla .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These small budget films are changing the face of the industry and Aamir is the latest one .The success of such films has given rise to hope that talent is getting recognized .Hopefully the Indian government will realise that originality and talent needs to be encouraged .They should stop giving any type of award to any film which has plagiarized any thing , be it the story , a scene or two or a song .It may seem a harsh punishment for a director or producer who may not be in the know if a music director has say copied a tune , but without such rules how will plagiarism ever stop ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "It 's even worse in the south indian movie industry .It is neither because of blogging nor shame of being exposed that producers are avoiding copying .After Shakti Kapoor 's casting couch scandal , shame sounds like the last thing anyone would be bothered about .One main reason for the change in producers attitude is that corporate companies are focusing on film productions .Corporate companies want to make money .When a movie owned by them in one language is already been made in another about a decade ago , it 's an opportunity lost to make money .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "When big money is involved , corporate companies tend to have an aggresive attitude .A possible reason why bollywood does n't get sued by hollywood is because of the time and expense involved .Also , not many might be aware of the legal procedures as they are different in different countries .Bollywood is a volume market .Mass production is what is happens , and a self congratulatory approach as awards are concerned .Krazzy 4 is \" adapted \" from a Malayalam movie which in fact inspired from a Hollywood flick .Almost all of Priyadarshan 's Bollywood offerings are Malayalam movies made by himself or some other directors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
