{"text": "Unlike his sources , Shakespeare gives Banquo no role in the King 's murder , making it a deed committed solely by Macbeth and his wife .Why Shakespeare 's Banquo is so different from the character described by Holinshed and Boece is not known , though critics have proposed several possible explanations .First among them is the risk associated with portraying the king 's ancestor as a murderer and conspirator in the plot to overthrow a rightful king , as well as the author 's desire to flatter a powerful patron .But Shakespeare may also simply have altered Banquo 's character because there was no dramatic need for another accomplice to the murder .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Banquo is in a third of the play 's scenes , as both a human and a ghost .As significant as he is to the plot , he has fewer lines than the relatively insignificant Ross , a Scottish nobleman who survives the play .[ 8 ] In the second scene of the play , King Duncan describes the brave manner in which Macbeth , Thane of Glamis , and Banquo bravely led his army against invaders , fighting side by side .In the next scene , Banquo and Macbeth , returning from the battle together , encounter the Three Witches , who predict that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor , and then king .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "These similar sentences contain interconnected ideas and therefore demonstrate the inseparability of Macbeth and the forces of darkness .Macbeth 's first words could be interpreted in a way such that things that seem fair such as becoming king are also foul because it could lead to his own downfall .Therefore , it seems as if Macbeth is responsible for his own downfall because Shakespeare depicts him to be associated with evil forces .The witches ' prophecies have a powerful effect on Macbeth .Banquo notices this and asks him \" why do you start and seem to fear/ Things that do sound so fair \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "What the witches say seems to strike a thought in Macbeth 's mind , especially the prediction that he will become king .Macbeth 's deep though - provoked mind is perhaps the first sign of his ambitious nature and actually the first indicator of the theme itself because it is unusual for someone to fear something that \" sounds so fair \" .Alternatively , perhaps Macbeth 's \" fear \" is of uncertainty rather than \" an emotional response to a perceived threat \" ( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear ) .From this interpretation , Macbeth is unsure about the choices he will have to make in order to fulfil his ambition and the prophecy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This interpretation is supported in the text because when the witches vanish , Macbeth wonders if they have disappeared \" into the air\"- what he thought was solid has melted away .This could be interpreted in way such that under the evil influence of the witches , things around Macbeth that he thinks are solid , like his loyalty to the King will also melt away .Macbeth chooses to accept the witches ' words and is clearly lost in thought unlike Banquo who is suspicious of them and seems unafraid .In his asides , Macbeth reveals that all he has to achieve is to become king after saying that the \" greatest is behind \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This issue of kingship and loyalty were of profound importance to James who early in life had survived the Gunpowder Plot assassination .Shakespeare has clearly related the play to the events of the Gunpowder Plot through the theme of bad versus good kingship where James represents Duncan , the rightful and well - respected king who maintains peace and order which collapses due to the arrogance of an ambitious Thane , Macbeth .Thus , Macbeth is seen as being responsible for his own downfall because he has associated the witches ' prophecy with murder .Lady Macbeth contributes towards Macbeth 's downfall as she is seen to be very persuasive , particularly in encouraging Macbeth to kill the King .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Lady Macbeth uses the metaphor of \" milk \" ( being a pure drink ) to show that Macbeth is too kind and respectful to \" catch the nearest way \" to becoming king .Therefore , although Macbeth is a great warrior , he lacks ruthlessness .Thus , Macbeth does not lack ambition but he is squeamish about the methods to be used to achieve his ambition of becoming king .When in Act 1 Scene 7 , Macbeth decides to cancel the plan of murdering king Duncan , Lady Macbeth uses several techniques to in order to convince him to carry out the plan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The significance of the statement is that Macbeth is planning to carry out the deed on his own , without the guidance and support from his wife .Macbeth 's tyranny is shown in this scene because he is confident that his wife will agree with the murders after they are accomplished and \" applaud the deed \" .Macbeth has detached himself from his reliance on his wife and now is carrying out murder on his own accord .Macbeth is calls for the murder of his trusted friends and allies in order to remain King .Although earlier in the play Macbeth is depicted as a \" butcher \" in battle , his ambitious nature goes to the extent that he becomes a \" bloody tyrant \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Thus , Macbeth is very much a ruthless dictator who is corrupt and knows no moral quandary .He is decisive although he relies upon the witches to gain confidence .Macbeth 's downfall is in some ways caused by his guilty conscience as throughout the play , he sees many visions and has hallucinations .These dramatic features present in the play are the main reason why scholars regard Macbeth as \" the first psychological exploration of effects of guilt \" .In Act 2 Scene 1 , Macbeth says : \" Is this a dagger I see before me \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This dramatic device indicates that Macbeth is full of guilt .His mind is full of dark thoughts and he is tormented by images of blood and fear of the unknown .Interestingly , Shakespeare 's perception of the supernatural in the play stays truthful to the general belief at the time .James the First believed in witchcraft , publishing a book on witchcraft called \" Daemononlogie \" in 1597 .To be associated with witches was considered a criminal offense and many women were put on trial as a result .Thus , although we may solely believe that the supernatural are only a psychological force influencing and antagonising Macbeth throughout the play , in fact many people during James 's reign took witchcraft and the supernatural quite literally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Furthermore , in Act 3 Scene 4 Macbeth hallucinates when he claims that the \" table 's full \" as he sees Banquo 's ghost sitting in a chair at the banquet .There is dramatic irony since only Macbeth can see Banquo 's ghost whereas Lady Macbeth and the nobles can not .Through stage directions , it is stated that Banquo 's ghost sits in \" Macbeth 's place \" and \" smiles \" .This is signifying that Banquo will take his revenge because although Macbeth might be King of Scotland now , it is Banquo 's decedents who will be kings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This theme of revenge is supported by Macbeth 's response to the ghost : \" Blood will have blood \" .Thus , Banquo 's ghost is a harsh reminder of Macbeth 's wickedness and is an externalised form of Macbeth 's fear of discovery and guilt .Shakespeare has portrayed Banquo as the ' angel - like ' figure only to please King James because in reality , the historic Banquo was actually an accomplice in the murder of Duncan .Banquo 's ghost pricks Macbeth 's conscience by reminding him that he murdered his former friend .Macbeth tries to suppress his guilt but this only leads to psychological illness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "After Duncan 's death , Macbeth starts to isolate himself from his wife and becomes suspicious of his allies , particularly Banquo .The bloody dagger and Banquo 's ghost , though playing a small part , attack Macbeth 's conscience , confusing him and leading him to near insanity .The witches , who Macbeth depends on throughout the play , deceive him and lead him to a false sense of security .However , Macbeth was already doomed for destruction when he announced himself as king because a true king is one that can maintain the balance of order and not give in to dark forces .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , it must not be forgotten that the play is a tragedy ; Macbeth , an individual whose ambition , the driving force of his life is his greatest weakness causing him to fall from a successful position to inevitably death .Perhaps , it is nor right or wrong to blame destruction on Macbeth himself because as in all tragedies , the main protagonist has the capability to succeed but also the limitations to fall .To put responsibility on a single individual is to some extent unfair because all human beings have flaws ; no matter how confident and bold they appear .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
