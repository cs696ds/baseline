{"text": "FP : Daniel Pipes , Bruce Teft and Robert Spencer , welcome to Frontpage Symposium .Bruce Teft , let me begin with you .What do you find significant about the FBI warning in the context of jihad attacks and dates ?Tefft : I believe that it is pretty clear that the FBI has no \" sources \" within the terrorist organizations per se -- they mostly draw these warnings ( and they come out every year like clockwork ) from increased \" chatter \" on jihadi websites .Of course , the terrorists are not going to be talking about real attacks on the websites .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I suspect that most of these chat sites are manned by Muslim teenagers doing their part in the war of Islam against the West .I do not believe that there is a connection between terrorist attacks and certain dates , with perhaps rare exceptions such as the connection between the OKC bombing and the Waco , Texas disaster .Any other apparent connections are probably nothing more than coincidence .Clandestine operations , whether military , intelligence or terrorist , are very difficult to fix for certain dates .They usually take place as soon as they are ready , certainly not before and rarely afterwards ( due to a legitimate fear of discovery ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Spencer : Bruce Tefft is of course correct : there is no direct correlation between jihad terror attacks and certain dates .Still , there are some curious resonances .However , even if this connection is absolutely true , no one could have predicted it in advance : it is not that well known as a historical landmark , and the date is not celebrated or memorialized by anyone .This indicates that it is essentially a worthless exercise to try to gauge terrorist strategy by scanning over notable dates in history .These attitudes , so often reemphasized among Salafist communities , inculcate a contempt and hatred for non - Muslims particularly on the occasions of their holidays that could become the justification for a holiday attack .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "I have written about the rejection of Valentine 's Day , but that is a special case , for the focus is erotic , something that bothers the pious of several faiths .Arguments against these holidays tend to fall into several categories : ( 1 )They have pagan origins .( 2 ) Muslims must not imitate kafir s. ( 3 ) Islam is complete and has no need for external celebrations .To sum these various points up : While Islamists might well enjoy the symbolism of striking during Western holidays , this motivation will not likely have much importance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact , I regard both as my mentors .Drawing on their discourse and writings , I 've only tried to apply those teachings to the operational matter of fighting Islam .Operationally , however , specific dates are difficult to adhere to and analytically , it is nearly impossible to determine which date might be preferred for an attack over another date .I eschew the term \" Islamist \" since I believe it is misleading , implying , as does the term \" Islamofascist \" that there is some major theological or ideological split in Islam over basic goals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Those Muslims attacking us are the militants , the muhajideen or holy warriors -- the armed wing of Islam , much like the various IRA factions were the armed wing of the Irish nationalists , while Sinn Fein was the political / moderate wing .Both the militants and the other Muslims who support them , or do not reject them as apostates , are after the same goal : conquest of the world by Islam .Their only difference might be tactical . \"Moderate \" Muslims may believe , as many Communists did during the Cold War , that infiltration and subversion are more effective than direct , frontal - assault armed attacks in conquering their enemy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "FP :Well moderate Muslims might not be able to deny that this is what the Qur'an dictates , but they can reject it .And in rejecting it this may make them un - Islamic in the eyes of Islam , but they can see themselves as Muslims if they want to and we can not stop them .In other words , the problem is Islam , not the many Muslims who want to democratize it .They face a large challenge , but because they face a large challenge does not make them the same as Muslim extremists .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Or does he deny that such teachings exist ?A real reformer will not deny the existence of such teachings , but will confront them and try to formulate ways to blunt their force for incitement to violence .So I agree that moderate Muslims can not deny these Qur'anic dictates , but I think it may be possible to formulate a non - literal ( and , indeed , anti - literal ) understanding of Islam that explicitly rejects its traditional supremacist elements .We should n't kid ourselves , however , into thinking this is a mass movement that is ready to sweep the Islamic world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They deserve our support .But they do not at this point have the numbers or influence to even be called a movement , much less to seize the intellectual initiative from the jihadists .Do I think in general that we should be on greater alert this holiday season ?Yes , because the possibility of a holiday strike is there , but we should maintain general vigilance at all times .And in a general sense , is the West not preparing itself in a way that it should be ?Indeed not .There are also many non - violent ways in which the Islamic supremacist agenda is advancing , and those are not even on the radar screen for law enforcement or government officials at this point .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And kindly add a word , if you can , about Robert Spencer 's point about the many non - violent ways in which the Islamist agenda is advancing .Pipes : Robert Spencer makes two points - that there are \" many non - violent ways in which the Islamic supremacist agenda is advancing \" and that these are \" not even on the radar screen for law enforcement or government officials at this point .\" I agree entirely .( 2 ) Government officials in general and law enforcement in particular are clueless about this problem ; indeed , they tend to make matters worse by effectively endorsing lawful Islamists .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Looking ahead , I see an emerging debate on lawful Islamists .That is , Westerners generally agree that truly moderate Muslims are our allies and violent Islamists are our enemies .Contention centers on the middle ground of lawful Islamists .As for the topic that began this discussion , that of \" holiday jihad , \" I think we three general agree that the December holiday season is about as dangerous as other times of the year .Tefft : I disagree with you Jamie that moderate Muslims can reject any part of the Qu'ran and remain Muslims .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As Robert noted , this is hardly a mass movement ready to sweep the Islamic world ... a few hundred Muslims rejecting the Koran out of 1.5 billion is not even statistically noticeable .As far as those Muslims who do not necessarily support al - Qaeda 's tactic of frontal assault against non - Muslims , I think Dr. Pipe 's points are essential .Muslims , who know they are obligated to make the world Islamic , are far more dangerous when they pretend to be pro - democratic , or loyal members of any man - made , non - Islamic state .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is much the same tactic the Communists resorted to following the Second World War when they realized that they could not beat the West on an open battlefield .Islam is at war with us .Muslims have so stated , from Mohammed to bin Laden to the Prime Minister of Turkey .Why do we persist in denying the danger ?Islam is at war with us , we are not ( yet ) at war with Islam .And we are in grave danger because of this .FP : There is a difference between Islam and Muslims .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are Muslims who do not and will not follow out on many of the teachings .Are these Muslims considered good Muslims within Islam ?No .Does this mean they do not exist ?No .Islam poses a threat and a problem for us today .Muslims such as Khalim Massoud and Hasan Mahmud do not .They represent part of our hope and we would be very unwise to paint them with the same brush that we do Islamic extremists .Having said that , Mr. Tefft , I am not in disagreement with your main points about Islam itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That is not to say that a new understanding of Islam could not be developed and ultimately become a large movement , but that consummation , however devoutly to be wished , is not at this point on the horizon .The jihadist movement is precisely a reassertion of that traditional theology and Qur'anic literalism among Muslim populations where some aspects of that literalism have been set aside in practice for quite some time .Most analysts assume that Muslims who in practice reject that literalism will stand up and be counted on the side of the West , pluralism , and peaceful coexistence when challenged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And it seems unlikely to happen , since the jihadists can and do portray themselves as the exponents of \" pure \" and \" true \" Islam in order to gain recruits and justify their actions .In light of that , genuine reformers would have to reject Qur'anic literalism and traditional Sharia provisions explicitly , and brave the charge from Islamic supremacists that they have by doing so ceased to be Muslim .Those who do so , however small their numbers may be , deserve our support , although we should be wary of placing too high hopes on their prospects for initiating a large - scale reform movement within the Islamic world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are Muslims who do not and will not follow out on many of the teachings .\" I believe there are many ways this can be done that have n't even begun to be explored , because official policy has been hamstrung by fictions about Islam and Muslims that have been invested with the status of unquestionable dogma .Pipes : Islam is in many ways similar to Judaism , as they are both based on a sacred law , Shari'a and Halakha .It is therefore instructive to look at the encounter of Judaism with modernity .To shorten a long and complex story , played out over several centuries , the grip of sacred law was loosened and Jews today remain Jews while eating pork and not keeping the Sabbath .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Muslims are , from our point of view , not a problem , not a threat and indeed , quite probably good , decent people .That said , from a military - intelligence point of view , or even an operational and security viewpoint , we must drop political correctness and look at reality .As with the Nazis or Communists of a by - gone era , basic ( fundamental ) Islam is a murderous , even genocidal , supremacist , exclusionary and evil religion ( ideology ) .I do not think we can gainsay individuals who claim to be Muslims and say that they really do not support the Koran ( an obligation in being Muslim ) or the ideology of Islam , or are ignorant of what they are claiming to be .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As a simple man , I will take people at their word and if a person claims to be a Muslim , like someone claiming to be a Nazi , they are also laying claim to the belief system that ideology professes .Islam is not a race , ethnicity , or skin color .Adherence to Islam is not accidental or involuntary .You have to choose to believe in Islam and choose that ideology if you are a Muslim .If it is not yet clear , the religion of Islam is 180 degrees antithetical to the American way of life and the US Constitution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is the basic reason for Islam singling out the US as the Great Satan above all other nations .We are thumbing our collective noses at Mohammed teachings .True Muslims are not and can not be our friends and allies .If someone states that he is a Muslim , I will take him at his word that he is my sworn enemy .FP : Ok , well , this debate is starting to go in circles .Needless to say , this position that \" If someone states that he is a Muslim , I will take him at his word that he is my sworn enemy , \" well , as I have already stated , I reject this position .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "But in any case , I have already made my position clear on this throughout the symposium .There is a difference between Muslims and Islam .And millions of Muslims throughout the world have been and are the victims of political Islam .But , as a said , this argument is starting to go in circles .Robert Spencer , last comment please .Spencer : Mr. Tefft is correct that \" Islam is not a race , ethnicity , or skin color .\" At the same time , in the Middle East in particular , as well as in other areas of the Islamic world , one 's deen - religion - does approach the level of ethnicity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A few years back a Palestinian Muslim named Eyad Sarraj expressed this assumption when he said : \" I would honestly say that if I could choose a religion , I would choose Christianity and its ideal of universal acceptance , love , and forgiveness .\" It never occurred to him that he could actually choose a religion ; such an idea , so taken for granted in America , is almost unheard - of in some sections of the Dar al - Islam .Consequently , I think it might be fruitful for analysts to study how to bring Muslims to an explicit rejection of concepts that many reject implicitly already - Islamic supremacism , the subjugation of unbelievers , and the like .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite those obstacles , however , I do n't think it would be wise to cede the field entirely to the jihadists in their efforts to win cultural Muslims to their point of view .Our appeals to those cultural Muslims have thus far been based on ignorance both of Islam and of human nature , but there is no reason why that must always be the case .Pipes : We seem long to have left the \" holiday jihad \" topic behind .A few responses to comments by my fellow panelists : .This is as fallacious as would be taking a certain form of Christianity - say , that of fifteenth - century Spain - and extending it to all times and places .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
