{"text": "The programme was not about paedophilia .It was about the way in which the media covers such topics .Everything should be questioned !That is why we need programmes like this .Gavin Wilson , UK .How is it possible to make light of something as serious as paedophilia ?I thought the program was insensitive and did not deserve a slot on national television .There are claims that the program was produced to challenge the way in which the media sensationalises paedophilia .What is next ?Racism ?Cannibalism ?Drug abuse ?Their motivation is twisted and I do n't believe that people so out of touch with reality should be working for a television company .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
