{"text": "Award - Winning Musical Based On 80s Cult Film Re - Animates .Some things just wo n't stay dead .Thankfully , \" Re - Animator The Musical \" ( opening May 3 at the Hayworth Theater in LA ) is one of them .It is reopening tonight for a 10-week run at the Hayworth Theater in LA before heading to New York and then heading to Scotland for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe .Both showcases could lead to further re - animation !I have been following \" Re - Animator The Musical \" since I saw an online ad for it more than a year ago announcing that if you arrived early you could sit in the \" splash zone \" and get soaked in blood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Stuart Gordon turned his 1985 cult classic film \" Re - Animator \" into a musical horror comedy with the help of producer Dean Schramm and witty composer / lyricist Mark Nutter .Based on an H.P Lovecraft tale , the film and play both involve a gifted but mad student who has found a way to bring the dead back to life .Only problem is that when they re - animate , they are pretty pissed off and braindead .Just recently the play took home an armload of awards ( six L.A. Weekly Theater Awards , an Ovation Award and L.A. Drama Critics Circle Awards for everything from Best Musical to Best Blood Effects ) and deservedly so .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It keeps just enough of the film elements to keep those fans happy and brings enough new inventiveness to please a whole new theater audience .I ca n't emphasize enough how important cleverness is to the success of the play .It opened last year as the Broadway \" Spider - Man \" musical was in the throes of technical difficulties .The two productions reveal provide an interesting comparison .\" Spider - Man \" tried to bring big budget Hollywood effects to the stage , forcing the techniques and specialties of one medium onto another . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It embraced its limitations and turned them into strengths .I reviewed the play when it first opened and my opinion has not changed . \"Re - Animator : The Musical \" boasts wickedly funny songs , a lively cast , maintains healthy respect for the film mixed with a willingness to develop a personality of its own , and is a genuinely delightful time at the theater .I confess that I was favorably inclined toward the play because of my affection for the film , but the stage production exceeded all my expectations .Above : Graham Skipper as Herbert West , and Chris L. McKenna as Dan and Rachel Avery as Megan in \" Re - Animator : The Musical .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The biggest change and definite improvement is that the play is now performed without intermission .This makes it more streamlined , and without any interruptions in the rapidly developing and increasingly audacious plot .There are some new song additions , all good , and a few trims ( but nothing painful ) .There are also some nice new additions , which I do not want to reveal but oh man what fun !One of the things that pleased me most about the production was that they went back to the imaginative effects team that worked on the low budget 1985 film to create the effects for the play .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Having just done an NPR feature on the practical effects championed at Monsterpalooza , I have even more respect and affection for the work done by \" Re - Animator 's \" effects team .It all happens right before your eyes and you know you 're being tricked yet it 's still magical and wicked fun .Like the decapitation .Herbert West ( Graham Skipper ) cuts off the head of Dr. Hill ( Jesse Merlin ) and then the doctor , played Merlin , has to spend the rest of the play carrying his own head around .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There 's a long smock but you can see wheels underneath it so there 's clearly some kind of seat .A lot of people ca n't figure out how we do it .You ca n't help but cheer on the performers as they deftly pull off these sleights of hand , which is why I am about to go see the play for the 8th time .In fact there are diehard fans who have seen it more than 2 dozen times and many dress up in costumes as well .The play inspires a devoted following and it inspires us to show our appreciation in clever ways .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Above : Some of the diehard fans ( in Miskatonic University Cheer Squad t - shirts ) of \" Re - Animator The Musical \" after a preview performance .Actor Chris McKenna ( the one not in an orange shirt ) plays Dan in the play .I know LA may seem a long drive to see a play but my friends and I have made that long drive repeatedly and it is well worth the effort .Make it a fun road trip with friends and take a group to the play .If you are a fan of the film , a horror fan , or just a fan of bold , inspired theater , \" Re - Animator The Musical \" is simply a must - see .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It also engages the audience in such a playful manner that it proves impossible to resist .So what are you waiting for ?Go , get soaked in the splash zone .You wo n't regret it .I 'm even trying to figure out a way to get to Scotland to see it in Edinburgh , I mean the home of bloody Macbeth would be the perfect setting for \" Re - Animator The Musical 's \" steeping in blood .Related Content .Please stay on topic and be as concise as possible .Leaving a comment means you agree to our Community Discussion Rules .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
