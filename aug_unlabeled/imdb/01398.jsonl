{"text": "A Perfect Si - Fi Film And a GREAT ACTION MOVIE .After reading so many negative reviews I was actually considering not going to watch it .... .I was expecting the worst I even took my android phone in case it was really bad and I could of played a couple of games .This film does n't follow the Hollywood method it does n't have a normal ending , characters are not printed on politically correct paper .I found the reactions of the people involved to be realistic , normal people with small minds and grasping to small problems in a situation they have no control over .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We watch so many films that follow a formula that show man out to be this amazing being who always survives always wins we are so use to being saved and its not really true is it ?We do n't have a ace pilot or elitist hacker we do n't have a superhero to fix it all , we be in trouble if something more advanced than us comes to play .To me this makes it an awesome film and strangely I found the rest of the people in the cinema of the same mind as soon as the film finished people I did n't know started discussing it as a bit of fresh air .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One Of The Greatest Movies Of All Time .23 April 2012 - 1 out of 2 users found this review helpful .Frank Darabont returns to the directors chair with another adaptation of Stephen Kings novel .The events take place at a death row , the guards call the green mile .The story is a layered , rather character - driven fantasy tale of the events that transpire at \" the mile \" after the arrival of a giant man , John Coffey ( Michael Duncan ) , convicted of the murder of two small girls .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A character - driven movie requires a lot from the cast , and fortunately when it comes to cast , The Green Mile delivers .As the poster of the movie tells , this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb , senior prison guard of the mile , and as always he performs very well indeed .Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular , perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown .With a face you know , one inevitably remembers previous performances , and the new role is colored by this .Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore , a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive , yet his character could have been given more depth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is hard to find a flaw in this movie .The camera - work is superb , cast wonderful and direction flawless .The movie 's considerable length , a bit over three hours , is something that had me worried .Yet the marvelous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination .Many will find this movie to be too long , but I for one was delighted of the style , combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "10 out of 10 .Coll movie but not real .31 January 2011 - 0 out of 1 users found this review helpful .This is a remake of The Poseidon Adventure ( 1972 ) .Before you jump on the bandwagon and start bashing it on this basis alone , keep it mind that the original film was not exactly a masterpiece .It was a film that sacrificed scientific reality to propel an inane plot , filled with one - dimensional characters and compensated for it with action - overload .Poseidon is exactly the same -- ridiculous plot , intrepid characters and big slice of adventure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This is a perfect time to remake a film like this ( much better than in 1972 ) -- just go overboard with special effects and no one will notice the flawed writing ( which is basically a sketchbook mess ) .This is the reason Poseidon does not fail in entertaining the audience .I 'll admit that I was skeptical when Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas appeared in all her plastic surgery glory and Josh Lucas spouted out some cheese ball line ( \" Where is the disco ? \" \" Why , you feel like dancing now ? \" ) , but I set its cringe worthy dialog aside early on and focused my energy on not wanting to kill Fergie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Another thing , besides special effects , that is by far better in this version is that the characters are actually interested in surviving and do not stop every few minutes for a petty argument as in The Poseidon Adventure ( 1972 ) .Overall , Poseidon is bathed in a militantly hectic mood and is as fast - paced as any action film you 'll see .It features mind - numbing special effects , overdoses of excitement and just typical Wolfgang Peterson overkill .It definitely wo n't disappoint you if you 're looking for cheap but solid adrenaline kicks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The Green Hornet is Ausome .27 January 2011 - 1 out of 3 users found this review helpful .I went into this movie having read reviews talking about how the movie \" could n't decide \" what it wanted to be .And they were Absolutely correct , but i could n't care less .The Green Hornet is so horribly acted and over the top that it easily fits into the category of \" SO BAD ITS GOOD \" , For fans of slap - stick classics such as \" Flash Gordon \" or anything by Mel Brooks , this movie is a MUST SEE .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They utterly and gloriously fail .Seth Rogan could n't decide if he wanted to do Iron Man or Pineapple Express , so he just said \" To hell with it \" and did both .It succeeds because of how HORRIBLY it fails .Toss in easily the funniest fight scene ever captured on film and best usage of Coolio 's \" Gangsters Paradise \" in cinema and you 've got comedic GOLD .Please go into this movie with absolutely NO expectations and i promise that you will leave satisfied . not as good as the originals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It should be wise for people to at least watch the first six films in order before watching this one , if they have n't read the books already .With this film , we are slowly but surely bidding farewell to one of cinema 's most successful and imaginative franchises .The franchise , like Harry Potter himself , has grown and matured as the years ( and films ) progress .Part I of the \" Deathly Hallows \" is ultimately a strong build- up to what will be a triumphant , bittersweet finale for everybody .I wo n't waste time trying to talk about the performances , because they are all great and powerful in their own way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "They 've grown into fine young people .Screenwriter Steve Kloves does n't forget to add the mood and gloom to the story as it slowly unfolds , but then again he adds some light humor to the film when it needs it .Bonus points for making this not only a visual spectacle , but also a character - driven ensemble ; there 's some complex characterization here .Also there 's some action which are n't seen on screen , but mentioned by the characters .It 's OK , because it 's necessary for the brisk pacing , and it 's not really that important anyways .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are many themes in this film .Sacrifice , determination , ( obviously ) friendship , and above all - acceptance .As the films progressed the films started to gain an increasingly dark momentum - signaling that all hope may be lost .But in the end , will good triumph over evil ?Like the film , real life is n't so sure .Also , the fact that the actors and crew are moving on after a decade of making these films - it 's also another way of acceptance - the films have ended , they 're moving on for the better of their lives / careers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Hallows : Part I \" is many parts thrilling , as there are quite a number of intense action sequences .Many of them , of course , are done with well - rendered visual effects , and in this one they just blend in at a natural level without being too jarring .However , the action sequences are perfectly blended in with the gripping , dramatic moments .They do n't feel heavy handed and it 's beautiful to look at .The animated sequence about the origins of the Deathly Hallows is an absolute masterclass and jaw - droopingly beautiful to both watch and listen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The crew also get their due here .David Yates has gotten a firm grip on the film 's direction since directing the fifth and sixth films years ago .The cinematography is stunning and exquisite , and it gives off a certain moody hue to the film .The editing is also crisp , it 's not choppy when it does n't need to be .Alexandre Desplat 's score really makes a difference , it literally puts you into the world with its beautiful , harmonious , and emotional tones .In short , I would have to say that this film is the best \" Harry Potter : film yet in all honesty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But rest assured , the finale will be grand .One more thing .This interpretation of the novel is the best one yet .The novel is done justice , something not seen since the first three films .It 's something for both the fans and novel - readers alike , as there are some pieces only book readers can discover while watching the film .It 's definitely a huge improvement over \" Half - Blood Prince \" 's adaptation , which for me is the worst Potter film .Harry Potter is a phenomenon .But , like all things , it most come to an end eventually .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "it 's good for girls to have a good night out .8 October 2010 .Sure , the dumb blond jokes in The House Bunny are old and played out , but Anna Faris gives you continuing reason to laugh in a film that is far funnier than it really deserves to be .The House Bunny plays on the sexy - but - dumb stereotype to the fullest extent and Faris has proved in the past , as a regular in the otherwise awful Scary Movie films , she can pull this off .On top of looking amazing , Faris gives this film every reason to exist .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "- stars Emma Stone , Kat Dennings and the increasingly emaciated Rumer Willis offer up a couple of additional laughs , but it is Faris that leads the charge .She plays right up to the edge of the dumb blond stereotype and only occasionally tosses in one too many clich\u00e9d jokes .Nevertheless , you forgive her thanks to a consistent number of chuckles throughout the film .This is n't to say this is a classic comedy by any means , but anyone that goes to see House Bunny should walk away with a smile .This is n't a film to hate , it offers up exactly what the trailers promise and it delivers a little extra with an unexpected f - bomb dropped in the mix and a peek at Faris 's little bum to keep the men paying attention .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After a decent sized role in Peter Jackson 's King Kong , Hanks has only managed to worm his way into mediocre films at best .Then again , he has n't shown anyone any reason to give him anything with more meat on it so I guess I should n't be too surprised .Katherine McPhee of \" American Idol \" fame plays a small role in the feature as does Beverly D'Angelo , but both are relatively inconsequential .The ladies in the audience are more likely to get a kick out of The House Bunny and the fellas dragged to the theater with them should be able to enjoy themselves as well despite the estrogen oozing of the screen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Another complaint has been Mileys ( and maybe others ) acting in this movie .I can agree that on the show Hannah Montana they lack great acting ( Except maybe Mitchel Musso and Mosies Arias ) .But in this movie the acting was nothing half bad .In fact I find the acting good .There is n't much to blame .I mean Miley Cyrus plays Miley Stewart , a character based on her and Billy Ray plays Robbie Ray who is also based on him .They play as themselves and no one is too much or to short on acting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It 's a feel good film with good messenges about the ups and downs of things , and as the whole show it deals with \" To follow your heart \" and \" Do the right thing \" .Might not be original , but messenges like it is needed , because although over exposed very few people follow the advice .I know watching Hannah Montana as a whole has changed me in many ways even though I always \" hated \" it all before I actually took time to watch it .I recommend the move to all ages and sexes but keep an open mind and think hard about what is said and you might come out wiser than before .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
