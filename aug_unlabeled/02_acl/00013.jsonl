{"text": "This finding suggests that , on average , SD does not bias subjects toward either faster or more accurate responding , although this claim can not be made of any individual cognitive test .Moderator Analysis Of the three moderator variables studied , only hours awake ( homeostatic sleep drive or sleep pressure ) was a significant mod- erator of the effect of SD , and only for accuracy , not reaction time variables .Because of the nature of the coding in this study , we expected homeostatic sleep pressure to be a stronger predictor than circadian time or circadian offset , as there is considerable variabil- ity in endogenous circadian phase across individuals ( Horne & Ostberg , 1976 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A likely explanation for this negative result is that much of the observed heterogeneity is due to the variety of cognitive tests in each sample .If this assertion is correct , it implies that the amount of impairment on tests that putatively assess the same cognitive domain may still differ considerably following SD .In other words , the validity of these tests in assessing the cognitive process may not be as high after SD .For example , total SD is known to exacerbate the time - on - task effect ( Doran et al . , 2001 ) , suggesting that test length may be a confounding variable across tests of many cognitive processes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although it would have been interesting to test the moderating effect of self - paced and work - paced paradigms in this analysis , these variables were highly confounded with cognitive domain ( i.e. , within each category , most or all tests tended to be either self - paced or work paced ) .From the data obtained in the main effects , however , we can infer that the differential effects of self - paced versus work paced on accuracy and reaction time mea- sures are unlikely to be significant as suggested in previous meta- analyses .Instead , it is possible that these effects are present only under certain conditions ( e.g. , extremely long periods of SD or for particular subsets of tests ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although total SD does produce statistically significant differences in most cognitive domains , the largest effects are seen in tests of simple , sustained attention .This form of attention is critical in many industries involving sustained operations , during which a worker 's primary task may involve long , monotonous periods of low - level monitoring and situational awareness .Moreover , rela- tively brief failures of vigilance may potentially lead to disastrous consequences .We argue , therefore , that this cognitive module is of the greatest practical concern in combating SD - related problems in real - world situations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although our analysis was restricted to subjects who had gone a single night without sleep , effect sizes were still large for both speed and accuracy measures on simple attention tasks .These findings support the data showing that deficits in sustained attention often presage the other observable cognitive effects of SD and may have considerable utility as an early warning system for imminent cognitive failure .This cogni- tive component should therefore be one of the primary targets of assessment for work fitness and a basis for decisions on whether subsequent countermeasures should be applied .On the next rung of the hierarchy , we note that tests of working memory and other tests of executive attention are also robustly affected by one night of SD .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Indeed , studies of partial SD have demonstrated little or no effect on cognitive throughput tasks ( Casement , Broussard , Mullington , & Press , 2006 ; Dinges et al . , 1997 ) .The implication of this finding is that changes in processing speed may be theoreti- cally interesting but not of great practical significance in explain- ing and predicting real - world cognitive failures ( Monk , 2007 ) .Limitations This analysis contains a small number of limitations that may have affected the validity of the conclusions drawn .As we were able to obtain only a small amount of unpublished data , it is possible that there was a bias in the analysis toward effect sizes that reached statistical significance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We are , therefore , relatively confident that the study was not greatly affected by publication bias .Although every effort was made in this analysis to classify studies into appropriate and meaningful categories , it is clear that 386 LIM AND DINGES .Page 13 .with the possible exception of simple attention , pure assays of most of the cognitive domains we have identified do not exist .Moreover , there remained numerous dissimilarities among the forms and characteristics of the tests within each category ( e.g. , task length , task demands ) , particularly within the category of complex attention .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite these drawbacks , we propose that our taxonomy is a useful heuristic for several reasons .First , significant between- categories differences were found in the meta - analysis , suggesting that we have captured meaningful constructs with the classification we employed .Second , we have stayed faithful to categories that are well defined in the neuropsychological literature .In many cases , focal deficits on these tests have been observed in patients with specific pathologies or injuries ( e.g. , working memory in attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder patients ; Barkley , 1997 ) .Finally , several of the domains studied here have relatively high external validity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Task duration is likely to be one of these factors , with longer tasks associated with greater effect sizes due to the presence of the time - on - task effect .We were unable to code this moderator chiefly because many articles did not report task length and because of the variability in time to completion for all tasks that were self - paced .As we have already mentioned , the difference between self - paced and work - paced tests was highly confounded with cognitive do- main , making it unfeasible to test this as a moderator .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Finally , a substantial number of studies entered into this meta- analysis reported only accuracy or reaction time as a dependent variable in their final published work .As a result , we could not conduct paired comparisons of these measures to assess their reliability .We encourage authors publishing in this field in the future to consider reporting both accuracy and reaction time mea- sures where appropriate so that their relationship after SD can be better explored .We also suggest that , wherever possible , data from individual test bouts and not just omnibus F values for a series of bouts be reported , so as to enable the inclusion of more studies in future quantitative syntheses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Overall , there was a significant difference among cognitive domains , but not between speed and accuracy , suggesting that SD has differential effects on different cognitive processes but does not bias subjects toward either faster or more accurate responding in any of these domains .Finally , our results indicate that simple attention is the cognitive domain most strongly affected by short - term SD .Although dec- rements in other cognitive modules such as decision - making and memory processes no doubt contribute to real - world errors and accidents , the results of this analysis argue that deficits in sustained attention may represent the most parsimonious explanation for these occurrences .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Background : Modulation of sexual desires is , in some cases , necessary to avoid inappropriate or illegal sexual behavior ( downregulation of sexual desire ) or to engage with a romantic partner ( upregulation of sexual desire ) .Some have suggested that those who have difficulty downregulating their sexual desires be diagnosed as having a sexual \" addiction \" .This diagnosis is thought to be associated with sexual urges that feel out of control , high - frequency sexual behavior , consequences due to those behaviors , and poor ability to reduce those behaviors .However , such symptoms also may be better understood as a non - pathological variation of high sexual desire .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thus , the direction of neural responsivity to sexual stimuli expected was unclear .If these individuals exhibit habituation , their P300 amplitude to sexual stimuli should be diminished ; if they merely have high sexual desire , their P300 amplitude to sexual stimuli should be increased .Neural responsivity to sexual stimuli in a sample of hypersexuals could differentiate these two competing explanations of symptoms .Methods : Fifty - two ( 13 female ) individuals who self - identified as having problems regulating their viewing of visual sexual stimuli viewed emotional ( pleasant sexual , pleasant - non - sexual , neutral , and unpleasant ) photographs while electroencephalography was collected .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Under the influence of alcohol , it is the sexual arousal , rather than the amount of alcohol consumed , that best predicts intentions to engage in risky sexual behaviors ( George et al ., 2009 ; Prause , Staley , & Finn , 2011 ) .To date , success in developing treatments to help regulate sexual desires have been sparse , ineffective , or drastic .For example , hypoactive sexual desire disorder lacks any strong treatment for upregulation ( Heiman , 2002 ) .Sexual ' addiction ' may represent a unique case of regulation failure , where the problem is not that sexual desire is directed toward a problematic target , but the level of the sexual desire itself is thought to be central to the problem .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Once called ' excessive sexual desire disorder ' ( Marshall & Marshall , 2001 ) , these problem behaviors have been spun into many labels thought to describe a constellation of disease symptoms ( e.g. ' hypersexuality ' ) .It is unclear , however , whether the additional features of the proposed disease ( Kafka , 2010 ) add any explanatory power .For comparison , consider excessive television viewing in children .More hours viewing television is associated with many health problems ( Boulos , Vikre , Oppenheimer , Chang , & Kranarek , 2012 ) , which feeds back to increase television viewing ( Fuller - Tyszkiewicz , Skouteris , Hardy , & Halse , 2012 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Treatments focus on reducing the number of hours viewing television behaviorally without a disease overlay such as ' television addiction ' and are effective .This suggests a similar approach might be appropriate for high sexual desire if the proposed disease model does not add explanatory power beyond merely high sexual desire .In this study , brain responses were monitored using electroencephalography to visual emotional , including sexual , stimuli in a group who reported problems regulating their viewing of visual sexual stimuli ( VSS ) .Event - related potentials ( ERPs ) were used to assess whether differences in responses to the sexual stimuli were related to sexual desire levels , hypersexual levels , both separately , or neither .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This makes clear predictions difficult .Work in this area is rarely experimental ( Mundry et al . , 2011 ) .In fact , the current authors are not aware of any other research using ERPs to investigate hypersexuality to date .Hypersexuals do not appear to have any gross executive control abnormalities measured with neuropsychological tests ( Reid , Garos , & Carpenter , 2011 ) , but may have more subtle attention deficits or specific attentional deficits to sexual stimuli .A small sample of hypersexual men did make more errors of both commission and omission on a Go / No - Go task ( Miner , Raymond , Mueller , Lloyd , & Lim , 2009 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In fact , it is suggested as a core feature of the disorder ( Kafka , 2010 ) and an important component of treatment ( Adams & Robinson , 2001 ) .Hypersexuals do not report more negative affect at baseline ( Prause , Staley , & Fong , 2013 ) , though , suggesting the affective dysregulation commonly described clinically in hypersexuality might occur at some other stage of processing sexual stimuli .Some suggest that hypersexuals engage in sexual behaviors when they are in a negative mood ( Bancroft , Carnes , & Janssen , 2005 ; Bancroft & Vukadinovic , 2004 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In addition to ' hypersexuality ' , some have described this symptom cluster as sexual ' addiction ' or sexual ' impulsivity ' .Although an exhaustive review of studies relating brain reactivity to impulsivity or addictions is beyond the scope of this study , studies of ERP components in impulsivity and addictions could guide predictions for hypersexuality .Impulsivity has been associated with P300 decrements to novel stimuli ( Justus , Finn , & Steinmetz , 2001 ; Russo , De Pascalis , Varriale , & Barratt , 2008 ) .The direction of the relationship between trait impulsivity and ERP components is not documented consistently ( Carrillo - de - la - Pe\u00f1a & Barratt , 1993 ) , and controlling for factors like general intelligence has eliminated the relationship ( Russo et al . , 2008 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Auditory - evoked P300 amplitudes during a sexual stimulus are different from P300 amplitudes evoked by the onset of the sexual stimulus itself .As compared to the auditory P300 collected during the sexual films , P300 stimulus - locked sexual images are higher in amplitude and similar to other high - arousal , negatively valenced stimuli ( Cuthbert , Schupp , Bradley , McManis , & Lang , 1998 ) .These findings are consistent , as both indicate greater attention allocated to processing sexual stimuli at the expense of processing competing ( e.g. auditory ) stimuli .Several interpretations of P300 modulation to sexual stimuli in relation to sexual desire levels are possible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Finally , women with lower sexual desire fixate more on contextual than sexual parts of erotic scenes than controls ( Lykins , Meana , & Minimi , 2011 ) .These attentional effects affected by sexual desire level also are malleable within - person to exogenous testosterone ( Van der Made et al . , 2009 ) .Given related research on attention and sexual desire , those with high sexual desire could exhibit greater P300 to sexual stimuli than neutral stimuli , due to greater affective salience .Alternatively , sexual stimuli could elicit lower P300 than neutral stimuli in those with high sexual desire , due to stronger attentional capture by the stimulus .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Those with higher sexual desire appear to allocate more attention to sexual stimuli than those with lower sexual desire ( Carvalho et al . , 2011 ; Macapagal et al . , 2011 ; Prause et al . , 2008 ; Vardi et al . , 2009 ) .Usually more salient , or emotional , stimuli elicit greater P300 amplitude ( Cuthbert et al ., 1998 ) .However , P300 amplitudes elicited by population - specific stimuli habituate more rapidly for that population ( e.g. those engaged in extreme sports presented with novel stimuli ) than controls ( Fjell et al . , 2007 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Alternatively , little or no P300 amplitude difference could be measured due to habituation to VSS .This study was designed to determine whether sexual desire level alone , or a cluster of symptoms unique to hypersexuality , predict neural reactivity to sexual stimuli .Specifically , questionnaire measures of sexual desire and hypersexuality were used to predict ERP amplitudes to a series of emotional , including sexual pictures .The ability of the hypersexual measures to predict variance in the mean amplitude of the P300 beyond the variance predicted by sexual desire alone was tested .Given that this is the first time ERPs were recorded in hypersexuals , and literature on addiction ( higher P300 ) and impulsivity ( lower P300 ) suggest opposite predictions , the direction of the hypersexual effect was specified mainly on theoretical grounds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Methods .Participants .All but one participant reported viewing visual erotica in the past month .Initial plans called for patients in treatment for sexual addiction to be recruited , but the local Institutional Review Board prohibited this recruitment on the grounds that exposing such volunteers to VSS could potentiate a relapse .Instead , participants were recruited from the Pocatello , Idaho community by online advertisements requesting people who were experiencing problems regulating their viewing of sexual images .This recruitment strategy appears to have successfully recruited participants with scores comparable to those labeled as ' patients ' with hypersexual problems ( see Table 2 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Equally important , acculturation to the dominant U.S. culture appears to be a much stronger predictor of neuropsychological performance than Latina / o acculturation , which may reflect cultural biases in tests , and therefore may be more salient for neuropsychological test interpretation ( Helms , 1992 ) .Our results further suggest that considering the impact of acculturation on neuropsychological test performance would likely improve interpretation of neuropsychological test results within this population .Even in our English - dominant , highly bicultural sample , acculturation scores accounted for a significant amount of the variance ( 11 - 14 % ) in global neuropsychological performance , verbal fluency , and processing speed , as well as trends in executive and motor function .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "These findings are suggestive of different use - dependent adaptation periods depending on cognitive domain .Furthermore , they imply that early age of musical acquisition , sustained and maintained during advanced age , may enhance cognitive functions and buffer age and education influences .Introduction .Cognitive aging variation is evident from studies documenting numerous individual characteristics associated with enhanced cognitive functioning in advanced age ( Kramer et al ., 2004 ) .Age - related cognitive declines have consistently been documented primarily in reduced processing capacity and fluid abilities with acceleration in the fifth and sixth decades ( Salthouse , 2004 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": ", 2004 ) .Thus , age - associated cognitive declines may not be inevitable , with increasing evidence that several factors and/or lifestyle activities may predict the course of cognitive development across the life span .In a recent study , we demonstrated that instrumental musicians with extended practice across the life span displayed better cognition in advanced age ( 60 - 83 years of age ) .Specifically , at least 10 years of musical participation across the life span had a strong predictive effect on preserved cognitive functioning across both verbal and visuospatial domains , and for executive processes ( Hanna - Pladdy and Mackay , 2011 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Therefore , based on recent findings , there is strong evidence supporting brain plasticity in lifelong musicians with potential transfer to non - musical cognitive functions .This is a plausible hypothesis given that general lifestyle activities have reliably predicted cognitive change in older adults ( Newson and Kemps , 2005 ) .Consequently , this warrants further investigation in particular related to whether musical training may buffer age - related cognitive declines in older individuals at the age of greatest risk for development of a neurodegenerative process ( i.e. , over the age of 60 ) .In the current study , we selected a sample of subjects comparable to our first study to further ascertain whether general activity level between musicians and non - musicians might account for differences in cognitive outcomes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Once again , general activity level did not reliably predict LNS performance .Discussion .When accounting for strength of handedness , the musicians also outperformed non - musicians on sensorimotor integration .From an early age , musicians engage in intensive practice involving repetitive visual translation of musical notation into spatiotemporal aspects of skilled movements that create the sound of music .Thus , the cognitive domains enhanced in the amateur musicians in our study match the demands of musical skill acquisition and training .Similarly , voxel - by - voxel morphometry has revealed gray matter volume enhancements in motor , auditory , and visuospatial brain regions for musicians ( Gaser and Schlaug , 2003 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The most striking difference between our two studies was the type of memory performance enhanced in musicians , and was partly related to inclusion of a more sensitive verbal memory test in the current study .This result corresponds to previously reported differences in young musicians on a Korean version of this verbal memory test ( Chan et al ., 1998 ; Ho et al . , 2003 ) .In addition to verbal memory enhancement for older musicians , we also found differences in verbal fluency and verbal working memory functions .The overlap between language and verbal functions with musical networks has been given careful consideration especially given the auditory demands of music processing ( Fujioka et al . , 2006 ; Patel and Iversen , 2007 ; Forgeard et al . , 2008 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The neural basis of these enhancements are supported by large activations in the left hemisphere evident for musicians in prefrontal areas , supramarginal gyrus , and temporal areas varying depending on the musical cognitive processing requirements ( Koelsch et al . , 2005 ) .These brain differences have been utilized as support for the presence of brain plasticity in longitudinal studies revealing differences in expected brain regions closely tied to musical skills , but also in brain regions unrelated to those skills responsible for multimodal integration ( Hyde et al . , 2009 ) .These regions might possibly underlie the cognitive advantages in visuospatial processing identified in our study .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Despite the obvious skilled movements associated with musical training , we did not find statistically significant differences between the groups for finger tapping speed which is in contrast to previously reported results ( Jancke et al . , 1997 ) .It is conceivable that other age - related factors such as arthritis may have obscured significance in the motor domain , or perhaps the findings were not robust because musicians were not required to be musically active at the time of the study .This hypothesis is partially supported by the results of the partition analyses for sensorimotor functions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Nonetheless , when controlling for strength of handedness , we did find differences in sensorimotor functions .This is consistent with evidence for expansion of cortical representations for musicians related to length of practice ( Elbert et al . , 1995 ) .Also , gray matter differences between musicians and non - musicans has been identified extending from the premotor region to the primary somatosensory cortex into the anterior parietal lobe attributed to skill acquisition and practice ( Gaser and Schlaug , 2003 ) .Conversely , there is clear evidence that reduction of cortical representational areas accompanies reduced skilled use , in support of our less than robust motor findings for older adults with less recent activity ( Liepert et al . , 1995 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These cognitive tasks span across both verbal and visuospatial domains , but both requiring fluid abilities .Similar to another recent study , we found verbal working memory but not spatial working memory differences and may be partially explained by differences in test sensitivity ( Parbery - Clark et al . , 2011 ) .The finding that age of musical acquisition before age 9 predicts enhanced performance in verbal working memory functions in advanced age , supports the model of sensitive periods for auditory and language circuits .The maintenance of cognitive enhancements many years later irrespective of continued participation in musical activity , suggests that neural circuits during this critical period may be altered permanently .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Consistent with our findings , this suggests that there is a maturation period within the first decade of life .However , since continued music participation predicted visuospatial functions , this raises the question of different sensitive periods for cognitive stimulation , or alternatively whether continued experience can alter connectivity patterns with the architectural constrains established during earlier sensitive periods ( Knudsen , 2004 ) .However , our results do not allow us to tease apart the reason for this association , and it is plausible that older individuals with enhanced cognitive sensory abilities in advanced age are more likely to persist with musical activity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These results imply that musical training may be considered an educational opportunity serving as additional cognitive stimulation outside of the traditional academic domain .Moreover , one longitudinal study with random assignment of young children into musical and non - musical groups , reported improvement in executive functions after only 20 days of musical training with additional neural evidence from corresponding ERP ( Moreno et al . , 2011a ) .It is conceivable that music training influences domain specific processes in verbal and auditory functions , but also domain - general processes such as attention and executive functioning ( Hannon and Trainor , 2007 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many activities that are associated with cognitive stimulation may also increase social interactions and physical activity , making it difficult to discern whether it is the cognitive , social or physical aspect of the activity that is yielding the beneficial effect .Our previous study accounted for the variance in cognitive aging variability related to physical exercise and demonstrated significant contributions to cognition from musical activity above that attributed to physical activity ( Hanna - Pladdy and Mackay , 2011 ) .Results of our partition analyses from the current study reveal that participation in general activities was not a reliable predictor of cognitive performance , and that musicians did not differ in general lifestyle activity engagement relative to non - musicians , making this hypothesis less plausible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "First and foremost , while the current study controlled for general lifestyle activities , future studies will be needed to compare musical training to other specific leisure activities .Furthermore , given our small sample size , multiple comparisons is a limitation of this exploratory study especially since musicians only revealed statistical significance on five of the neuropsychological measures .Therefore , all results should be verified with prospective large studies with specific hypotheses generated based on our findings .In summary , there is mounting evidence supporting training - induced brain changes from musical experience that can potentially transfer to non - musical cognitive abilities and influence cognitive functioning across the lifespan into advanced age ( for review see Jancke , 2009a , b ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
