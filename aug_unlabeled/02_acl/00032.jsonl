{"text": "BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION .Most semantic knowledge which is required in Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) or , e.g. , in Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) , has had to be built by hand , or hand - coded .Because the task of hand - coding semantic knowledge is time - consuming , these applications have necessarily been limited to a specific domain .In order to achieve true broad - coverage NLP , i.e. , NLP unrestricted in domain , detailed semantic knowledge is required for tens , and hundreds , of thousands of words , including those which are infrequent , technical , informal , slang , etc .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The problem is : how to acquire the semantic knowledge required for an unrestricted domain .There have been some attempts to hand - code highly structured semantic knowledge for unrestricted NLP : Dahlgren ( 1988 ) ; Lenat and Guha ( 1989 ) ; and Miller et al .( 1990 ) .These attempts all demonstrate that to construct a semantic knowledge base by hand is extremely difficult .While it may be relatively simple to make decisions about how to capture words representing concrete concepts , to adequately capture the meaning of more abstract words can be much more problematic , involving difficult and sometimes arbitrary decisions about what semantic properties of a concept might be relevant .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Currently , however , none of these techniques appears capable of providing the semantic detail required for processing unrestricted text .Our method is rooted in the tradition which attempts to construct a semantic knowledge base by identifying and extracting semantic information from a machine - readable version of a published dictionary ( henceforth \" on - line dictionary \" ) .One of the earliest efforts in this general approach , which we will call dictionary - based , or DB , is Amsler ( 1980 ) , which explored the possibility of constructing taxonomies ( one type of semantic information ) using computational methods .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Chodorow et al .( 1985 ) relied on string - matching to automatically extract genus terms for nouns and verbs from the on - line version of Webster 's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary ( Webster 7 ) .In addition , Calzolari ( 1984 , 1988 ) used string matching procedures in order to extract both genus and differenti\u00e6 information from the text of dictionary definitions .More recently , semantic information has been extracted from on - line dictionaries in a two - step procedure , first parsing the dictionary text ( the definition and/or example sentences ) ; and then applying patterns to this syntactic information in order to improve the accuracy of the identification of semantic information .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In contrast , work such as Alshawi ( 1989 ) and Slator ( in Wilks et al . , 1989 ) have relied on specially - constructed parsers which exploit the idiosyncratic syntactic properties of LDOCE entries .The advantage of relying on a broad coverage parser is that the parser need not be modified or rewritten in the course of extending the approach to other dictionaries .We see this as an important consideration , given that the huge semantic resources needed for broad - coverage NLP can only be acquired through the merging of multiple on - line dictionaries , as well as the analysis of encyclopedias and other sources .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are some researchers who claim that dictionaries are too impoverished a source of semantic information to ever serve as the lexical knowledge base for sophisticated semantic processing ( e.g. Atkins , Kegl , and Levin , 1986 ) .This pessimistic view seems to be supported by a casual examination of dictionary entries .Definitions frequently fail to express even basic facts about word meanings , facts which we would obviously want to include in a knowledge base which is to serve as the basis for understanding language .A typical case is the word \" flower \" in Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English ( henceforth , LDOCE ) whose primary sense is noteworthy more for the information it omits than for what it provides : . flower ( n,1 ) \" the part of a plant , often beautiful and coloured , that produces seeds or fruit \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Even the important fact that flowers prototypically have a pleasant scent goes unmentioned .In this case , however , such a strategy is not especially productive , yielding general information about plants but no specific details about flowers .The question then remains : how to acquire the semantic knowledge required for an unrestricted domain .To a great extent , the apparent inadequacy of on - line dictionaries for semantic processing can be attributed to the way in which they have been used - what we might term the forward - linking model of dictionary consultation .Given a dictionary in book form , the only way to find information about a given word involves looking it up , then exploring the semantic properties of any words mentioned in its definition , and so on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "That is , in looking up a word we might consult not just its own definition , but also the definition of any word which mentions it .It is important to note , however , that a concordance of such terms does not make explicit the semantic relation , if any , which holds between the headword and a concordance term .As such , the presence of concordance terms for a headword does not augment the semantic information for that headword , nor does it facilitate any NL processing task , such as resolving syntactic ambiguity .Specifically , Amsler only explored discerning taxonomic information ( hypernym , hyponym ) from the concordances , which are of only limited use in NL processing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Overview .Lexical knowledge is poorly characterized by even the best definition of a word .The foregoing example of the definition for \" flower \" amply proves the point .Humans , by virtue of their ability to understand a definition in the relational context of a well developed prior knowledge base , can intuitively compensate for many such definitional deficiencies .( They know , for example , that a flower has petals , even though the definition of \" flower \" does n't say so . )A feature of the present invention that seeks to redress this deficiency of each definition taken separately is the notion of \" backward linking . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" Petal , \" \" garden \" and \" rose \" are but some of the rich variety of terms that are identified in this fashion .The contexts in which these associated terms are found are then heuristically analyzed to discern semantic relationships between each of these terms and the original word \" flower . \"( It should be noted that not all definitions which mention \" flower \" will have a semantic relation with \" flower \" as the value . )This analysis reveals , for example , that \" petal \" is a part of a flower , \" garden \" is a location where flowers may be found , and \" rose \" is a type of flower .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" While the foregoing paragraph illustrates the concept of \" backward linking , \" it omits several of the other steps in our preferred embodiment .A more complete summary includes the following steps , illustrated in .FIG .1 : .This step may entail two discrete substeps : .a. A set of syntactic rules is applied to the text segment to produce a corresponding syntactic structure .This can be done using either a grammar designed specifically for the on - line dictionary being used , but more preferably involves the application of a broad - coverage grammar to the definition in order to facilitate processing multiple monolingual dictionaries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "b. A set of logical rules is applied to the syntactic structure to produce a corresponding logical form .A semantic relation structure is then extracted from the logical form .This is done by the application of a set of heuristic rules - these serving to correlate particular syntactic and lexical patterns with corresponding semantic relations .The result is one or more semantic relations per text segment ( e.g. a definition ) .These relations may have as their values either ( a ) word(s ) or embedded relation(s ) .A simple semantic relation is composed of a triple including : ( 1 ) a headword ( e.g. \" flower \" ) ; ( 2 ) a semantic relation ( e.g. \" part of \" ) ; and ( 3 ) a value ( e.g. \" plant \" ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "More typically , rich tree structures are formed , with each value itself often being used as a headword , and associated with further relations and values . )The semantic relation structure identified in this fashion is then stored in association with the headword \" flower \" as part of the lexical knowledge base .So far , it should be noted that no backward linking has occurred .Instead , the steps have only been concerned with the original dictionary definition for the word \" flower . \"Further , it should be noted that these steps , per se , are well known in the art , being found in many other NLP analysis systems ( albeit not in the context of extracting semantic relations from the logical form of definitions in on - line dictionaries ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The backward linking begins by inverting each of the semantic relation structures generated by the foregoing steps .For example , becomes ( the inverse of the semantic relation part of is part ) .Each inverted semantic relation structure is then used to augment the lexical knowledge base .For example , the inverted structure is used to augment the entry for \" plant , \" thus making explicit the semantic knowledge that one of the parts of a plant is a flower .This knowledge , which originally was explicit only in the definition of \" flower , \" is now explicit in the entry for \" plant \" as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The augmentation of the knowledge base by the inverted semantic structures produced in the first pass of the process improves the parser 's ability to produce unambiguous logical forms in subsequent passes .More meaningful semantic relations can thereby be found .( In the preferred methodology , the first pass seeks to extract one set of semantic relations [ e.g. hypernym / hyponym ] , and the second pass seeks to extract a different set of semantic relations [ e.g. location , location_of , part , part_of]. )The foregoing overview will become clearer from the following , more detailed , discussion of the component steps and their preferred implementation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The first step in extracting information from lexical entries in a dictionary involves parsing the definition and/or example sentences using a broad - coverage grammar of English .The resulting parse structures are then subjected to a set of heuristic rules whose goal is to identify syntactic and lexical patterns which are consistently associated with some specific semantic relation .Furthermore , we recommend applying the structural patterns for identifying semantic analysis to an analysis of the text segment at the level of logical form instead of the less detailed level of syntactic analysis .An example of this analysis technique proceeds with reference to two sample definitions from the LDOCE : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The patterns that make it possible to identify the underlying semantic similarity in these superficially different definitions can be roughly paraphrased as : .Applying these patterns to the parsed definitions of \" authority \" and \" storehouse \" yields , in part , the fact that each is the location of \" information .\" It is these patterns , together with the use of a NL parser ( e.g. as described in Jensen , 1986 ) , that enable the automatic extraction of vast numbers of semantic relations across the entire dictionary .( It should be noted that these structural patterns include the phrases : \" and its argument \" and \" along with any of its modifiers . \" In the presently preferred embodiment , the phrases \" and its argument \" and \" and any of its modifiers \" invokes a special pattern for verbs and for nouns , respectively .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These special patterns allow very deep levels of embedding of semantic relations to be identified for all levels of the logical form analysis , notably because they apply recursively .This results in correspondingly deep semantic relation structures . )Once extracted , these relations are explicitly added to the words from whose definitions they were obtained , thus creating a network of labeled links between words in the dictionary ( i.e. the identified semantic relations serve as the links ) .Shown below are the semantic relations added to this sense entry for \" authority . \"authority ( n,7 ) : a person , book , etc . , mentioned as the place where one found certain information .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A paraphrase of this semantic relation structure is \" an authority is a person , an authority is a book , and an authority is a location where someone finds an object , typically \" information .In our work , we have found it best to use a relatively small set of semantic relations .Of course in other embodiments , larger or smaller sets of relations can be used .Further , our preferred implementation does not extract each of these relations in both the forward linking and backward linking operations .Instead , the relations hypernym , user , domain , and manner are extracted only in the forward linking operation , and the relations hypernym_of , user_of , domain_of , and manner_of are extracted only in the backwards linking operation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A paraphrase of this set of semantic relations is \" a flower is part_of a plant , and a flower produces objects , typically seeds and/or fruit . \"As mentioned above , this definition is noteworthy more for the information that it omits than for what it provides .Missing from this definition is any detailed description of the physical structure of flowers , information about what kinds of plants have flowers , and so on .Backlinks .As noted , we have observed that most of the lexical information available in a dictionary for a given term is to be found in the entries for other words that mention that word , rather than in the entry for the term itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A simple search through LDOCE for noun entries which mention flower in their definitions , however , will allow us to arrive at a much more detailed picture of its meaning .It is further possible to compile an exhaustive list of flowers and flowering plants , a few of which are given in ( 8) ( LDOCE contains scores of such entries ) .A partial listing of other words that use \" flower \" in their definitions follows : .As noted , we believe that such links substantially improve the effectiveness of semantic processing in NLP .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( For some dictionaries , these backlinks are restricted to the words of the vocabulary used in the definitions and/or example sentences , such is the case for LDOCE .Other dictionaries have not limited the vocabulary used to express definitions and so there are no restrictions on the number of backlinks that are found processing these dictionaries . )On - line dictionaries thus represent formidable sources of \" common sense \" knowledge about the world , a long sought - after resource in AI .In order to exploit this information , however , we must tease out the network structure which is implicit in the text of dictionary definitions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In addition to adding the inverted semantic relation derived from \" corolla \" to the entry \" flower , \" one can add to \" flower \" other information pertaining to \" corolla , \" for example , the sense number of \" corolla . \"Adding sense numbers wherever they are available produces the following entry of \" flower \" : .The second semantic relation extracted for the word \" corolla \" is : corolla purpose attract .Finally , this semantic relation is also added to the entry for the words which are the value of the lower level relations , in this example : \" insect .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Certain semantic relations , most notably hypernym , can be extracted reliably in the first pass through an on - line dictionary .( A \" pass \" is here considered to mean the sequence of steps shown in solid lines in .FIG .1 . )Other semantic relations , however , are more difficult to identify without an established knowledge base .A simple example may help illustrate the point .Consider the following definition of necklace : . necklace : a chain of gold .In the first pass , the hypernym relation between necklace and chain can readily be identified .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Given the definition 's structure , it would appear that the semantic relation linking \" chain \" and \" gold \" is part_of ( i.e. chain part_of gold ) ; this , however , is not correct .The correct semantic relation between \" chain \" and \" gold \" is that of material .To address this problem , we have found it advantageous to process the on - line dictionary a second time , making use of the knowledge base assembled in the first pass as an aid to parsing .After the first pass , for example , the knowledge base has assembled a collection of hypernyms for \" gold . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The Vitamin Model .According to the job demand - control ( JD - C ) model , job demands and job control have an effect on employee well - being .The model suggests that the work environment can be characterised by a combination of high job demands and low job control ( Karasek , 1979 ; Karasek and Theorell , 1990 ) .A similar approach has been developed by Warr ( 1987a ) who in his vitamin model suggests that job characteristics affect mental health .Warr suggests nine ( later 10 ) broad categories of job characteristics , grouping together the principal variables .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although the JD - C model suggests an interaction effect , Warr ( 1987a , 1990 ) , however , suggests a non - linear relationship between the job characteristics and mental health .According to the vitamin model , the availability of vitamins is important for physical health up to , but not beyond , a certain level .At low levels of intake vitamin deficiency gives rise to physiological impairment and ill health , but after attainment of specified levels , there are no benefits from additional quantities .Principal features of the environment ( see table 1 ) are important to mental health in a similar manner , their absence leads to impairment in mental health , and their presence beyond a required level does not yield further benefits .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For example vitamins A and D in very large quantities can be toxic and therefore act as an additional decrement ( AD ) .While vitamins C and E have no additional impact but rather have a constant effect and therefore no ill - effects are observed in large doses .According to Warr ( 1987a ) low levels or extremely high levels of certain environmental features can have a harmful effect and give rise to an additional decrement in mental health , depending on the environmental feature ; some can have a constant effect ( CE ) .Within the vitamin model there are six AD features and three with CE ( see table 1 ) ( Warr , 1994 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Job demands remained as the major predictor of well - being when NA and PA were controlled ; however , autonomy was found to be non - significant when controlling NA and PA .The inconsistent results were due to the small , predominantly female and homogenous sample .In summary , the vitamin model is similar to the JD - C model as both suggest that job characteristics affect the mental well - being of employees .Although the vitamin model embraces broader job characteristics , there is limited evidence on all job categories in relation to mental health ( Warr , 1987a , 1990 , 1996 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
