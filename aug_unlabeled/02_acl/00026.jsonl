{"text": "In the last few years a number of task - specific kernel functions have been proposed and used in various text processing tasks , for example , string kernel , graph kernel , tree kernel and so on .So far very few efforts have been devoted to the development of NER task specific kernel .In the literature we found that the tree kernel has been used in NER task only for entity boundary detection or reannotation .The conventional tree kernel is unable to execute the complete NER task on its own .In this paper we have proposed a kernel function , motivated by the tree kernel , which is able to perform the complete NER task .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Our kernel executes the complete NER task and achieves reasonable accuracy .Introduction .Named entity recognition ( NER ) is a task of identifying the named entities ( NE ) from texts .In a text NEs are the pivotal elements to further contextualise the data .That is why NER has huge application in various text mining tasks .In the last decade substantial amount of work has been done for development of NER systems in various languages and domains .Various systems have been developed for identifying NEs in biomedical domain [ 1 - 5 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In these machine learning based approaches , the problem is viewed as a classification problem and a classifier is trained using annotated data and a set of features .The efficiency of these systems mostly depends on effectiveness of the assembled feature set .Support vector machines ( SVM ) is one of the most efficient and popular machine learning approaches which are being used in NER and other related tasks .It is basically a binary classifier which finds separating hyperplane with a large margin .That is why it is also known as a large margin classifier .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The similarity between two words is computed as the dot product between the corresponding vectors .The features used are mostly binary , which takes value one when that feature satisfies for the current word and zero otherwise .In the NER task most commonly used features are the current and surrounding words , suffix and prefix information of the words , and so on .A previous word feature can take any value from the lexicon ( all unique words in the corpus ) which designates the previous word .In this way only to the feature \" previous word \" , a range of binary features in feature space is included ( total number of unique words ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This way , the total number of features for the NER task becomes huge .So the computation of dot product between the vectors is a tedious task .Alternatively , the similarity between the words can be measured by using an appropriate kernel function .A kernel function helps in establishing an implicit relation between two words by mapping them into an alternative dimensional feature space .This saves time and effort of explicitly selecting features into the feature set for improving the overall efficiency .In the literature we found that various kernel functions have been proposed and used in various text processing tasks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In string kernel the distance between two words is computed by measuring the similarity in character sequences [ 6 ] .The tree kernel finds the distance between two trees by finding the similarity between their tree fragments [ 7 ] .Several variations of tree kernel are there , among which subtree kernel , subset tree kernel , and partial tree kernel are popular [ 8 ] .In the literature we observe that the use of task - specific kernel for NER task is limited .String kernel finds similarity between two words by computing character similarity and therefore not much effective in NER task .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But in NER task the distance between the individual words has to be computed .Therefore the conventional tree kernel is not directly applicable in this task .We observe that in a few NER systems the tree kernel has been applied for boundary detection or reannotation .There the task is viewed as a two - phase process ; the first phase identifies the class of the words and the second phase detects the boundary .In those tasks , for entity identification other machine learning classifiers like CRF are used and the tree kernel is used for named entity boundary detection [ 9 ] or reannotation [ 10 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This kernel will execute the complete NER task on its own .The design of the kernel is motivated by the tree kernel .Similar to the tree kernel , the proposed kernel also uses a tree representation to the sentences .But instead of considering the whole tree we focus on the subtrees where the target word and its surrounding words are present .Here the target word is represented by a tree fragment where only the target and its surrounding words are present .To these fragments we also include additional marker nodes as parents of the target words .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\"The proposed kernel is tested for biomedical named entity recognition task using the popular JNLPBA 2004 data [ 11 ] .Experimental results and related comparisons demonstrate the efficiency of the sliding tree kernel in the NER task .The background , details of the kernel , and experiment results are presented in the subsequent sections of the paper .Early Works on Biomedical NER .NER task is the primary task in biomedical domain .Many systems using various supervised learning classifiers , like hidden Markov model [ 1 , 12 ] , maximum entropy [ 3 , 13 ] , conditional random Field [ 14 ] , SVM [ 4 , 15 ] , and so forth , have been proposed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In biomedical domain a few annotated NER data are openly available , for example , JNLPBA 2004 data .Several systems participated in JNLPBA 2004 shared task .Among these , the highest accuracy was achieved by the system developed by Zhou and Su which produced an .Among all the classifiers it has been found in the literature that SVM is more efficient as a classifier .The ease and efficiency in implementation of kernel techniques into the classifier is the most attractive part of SVM [ 16 ] .NER task has much been explored for many decades .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Seeing the advantage of kernel techniques over extensive feature based model , lots of kernel techniques have been developed over the years .Unfortunately all the kernels proposed for various text processing tasks are not applicable in the NER task .Vanschoenwinkel [ 17 ] proposed a polynomial overlap kernel for language independent NER .This system showed an average .-score of 71.00 % .For NER , tree kernel has never been directly used for named entity word identification .Nguyen et al .[ 10 ] used tree kernel to reannotate the examples using kernel - based reranking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Collins and Duffy [ 9 ] used tree kernel for named entity boundary detection and left identification of NE to a separate stage of processing .Looking into the various literatures , tree kernel has never been used to do complete NER task .It has always been partially used for NER subtasks like named entity boundary detection or reannotation .Methods .Support Vector Machine .SVM is a supervised learning classifier .The cost estimation function in SVM gives special emphasis on avoiding overfitting by looking for global optima .This leads to an optimum hyperplane .That is why it is also known to be a large margin classifier .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But it can be utilized for multiclass classification by using one - vs - all method . is the label to each example in dataset .A classifier classifies based on the positive and negative examples experienced in the training data , so that given a set of new feature patterns it can predict the corresponding label . here depends on a cost minimization principle .A cost estimation function minimizes the cost error between experienced and predicted labels in the dot product space .But the key to SVM is its cost function finding an optimum hyperplane by also minimizing the parameter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This leads to the optimum hyperplane [ 20 ] .SVM learns by applying structural risk minimization principle [ 21 ] .As a classifier SVM shows low bias and high variance [ 16 ] .One of the highlights of SVM is its ability to apply kernel methods to implicitly map data into the required dot product space .Kernel Method .The data points fetched to the classifier are in the form of feature patterns .These feature patterns are used to generalize the data points .But defining an explicit feature set to the problem can be huge and tedious , whereas a kernel function helps in implicitly generalizing the data points with a new set of features , that is , in another dimension .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To a classifier given a new pattern .Tree Kernel .Tree kernels are intended kernel functions for semantic parse trees .It identifies trees in the form of tree fragments .This way it can identify trees without explicitly considering the entire feature space .Tree fragments are nothing but the different substructures of a tree , where each terminal of the grammar is associated with the tree leaves .In the tree kernel a syntactic parse structure is considered .The popular tree kernel methods used are subtrees ( STs ) , subSet trees ( SSTs ) , and partial trees ( PTs ) kernel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A subtree is considered as a constituent sub tree from a node in the original tree .It consists of all of its descendants from the current node in the original tree .Of a tree the total number of subtrees can be generated are much lesser than the substructures generated using SST and PT .Figure 1 ( a ) shows some of STs of sentence \" Presence of beta 2-M. \" Subset Tree .SSTs are more generalized than the ST structures .But it has been constrained that an SST should not break any grammatical rule .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Figure 1 ( b ) shows eight SSTs ( there are more ) of the example sentence .Partial Tree .A partial tree structure does not have the constraint of including all non - terminals like SST .It contains substructures which are partial structures of even SSTs .Figure 1 ( c ) shows eight partial trees of given sentence .The partial trees may or may not contain all the preterminals of constituent subtrees .Of any given sentence the possible PTs are much more than SSTs .The associated kernel function measures the similarity between two trees by counting the number of their common subparts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "using the mapping function .And the distance between trees are found by the classifier into the dot product space using the kernel function .By this a kernel function identifies wether tree subparts ( common to both trees ) belong to the feature space that we intend to generate [ 7 ] .In general SST kernel shows better accuracy than ST and PT kernels .The PT shows lower accuracy than the SST but shows a better accuracy on dependency structures [ 8 ] .The Proposed Sliding Tree Kernel .Most of the existing NER systems which are built using feature vectors use word syntactic and shallow parse information for classification .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Therefore the information of semantic correlations also plays a major role in classification of an entity .A semantic parse structure using parts - of - speech information is built on a complete sentence .Therefore a tree kernel is subjected to find the distance between two trees , that is , two sentences .But to perform NER task the distance between words has to be found rather than the sentences .When SST , ST , and PT are used in the kernel space for NER task , the kernel space fills with redundant fragments .This is because consecutive words belonging to the same sentence would share similar fragments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Moreover this leads to performance degradation and longer execution time in NER task .To overcome this problem with existing tree kernels a sliding tree kernel ( SL ) is proposed .This kernel considers a substructure of trees in the form of a sliding window of sliding value \" .\" is preferred which semantically centers the focused word .Here the sliding value is required to be chosen initially for a set of experiments .In addition , in the proposed kernel we introduce a word marker in the SL fragments .The marker is placed as the parent node of the current word .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So the subset trees which are collected are constrained to have all the preterminals along with the markers .In Figure 2 we have shown the sliding tree fragments for an example sentence : \" Presence of beta 2-M was analyzed by immunohistochemistry .\" The figure shows five SL trees ( out of total eight possible SL fragments : one for each word ) forming feature space taking .Now using the sliding window the constituent subset tree fragments are drawn .These constituent trees are restricted to semantic information of a word through slide window rather than of entire tree .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The SL decreases the structural redundancy of the constituent trees in the kernel space .Figure 3 shows the constituent trees of sliding windows with markers .The ( a ) and ( b ) in Figure 2 show the sliding windows for words \" Presence \" and \" of .\" The constituent subset trees generated at the same nodes of original example tree mentioned in Figure 2 show dissimilarity with respect to the words belonging to the same tree .Subtrees ( a-1 ) and ( b-1 ) ( in Figure 3 ) are different even though they start from the same node \" NP \" which is the left child of node \" S \" in source example tree ( shown in Figure 1 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "And ( b-1 ) has CW marker on the word \" of \" as preterminal , whereas ( a-1 ) has it on word \" Presence .\" This makes SL a task - specific kernel for tasks like NER .It easily identifies the word with generated constituent trees and generalizes for an optimum hyperplane to be found .The distances between the trees are calculated by counting the common substructure of SL trees .As in tree kernel the above kernel space is mapped in the vector spaces of .Then the distance between the words is calculated using the dot product similarity measure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Experimental Results and Discussion .Training and Test Data .To carry out the experimentations , data from JNLPBA 2004 shared task data is used .The training set contains 20,546 sentences from 2000 abstracts which have about 472,006 tokens , whereas the test set contains 4,260 sentences from 404 abstracts which have about 96,780 tokens .This data for the NER systems to be developed has been preannotated into 5 classes .DNA , RNA , protein , cell - line , and cell - type are the classes .This corpus is extracted from GENIA corpus Version 3.02 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Curiously , however , that evidence does not include DNA , which according to Collins provides \" compelling \" evidence for Darwin 's theory of evolution instead .In the course of defending Darwinian evolution as \" unquestionably correct , \" Collins argues that intelligent design not only \" fails in a fundamental way to qualify as a scientific theory \" but is also \" doing considerable damage to faith . \" SUMMARY Francis Collins criticizes intelligent design ( ID ) on the grounds that it fails to suggest approaches for experimental verification , but then he cites experiments that he says prove it wrong .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Collins feels that ID poses a serious problem to Christian belief because it rejects Darwinian evolution , which he feels is supported by overwhelming evidence .But the only evidence Collins cites for Darwin 's mechanism of variation and selection is microevolution - minor changes within existing species .And the principal evidence he cites for Darwin 's claim of common ancestry is DNA sequences that he says have no function - though genome researchers are discovering that many of them do have functions .Collins 's defense of Darwinian theory turns out to be largely an argument from ignorance that must retreat as we learn more about the genome - in effect , a Darwin of the gaps .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Part of Collins 's book is devoted to his own journey from childhood atheism to belief in God .In his \" most awkward moment \" as a physician , a patient asked him what he believed , and he realized that although he was a scientist he had \" never really seriously considered the evidence for and against belief .\" From that moment on he was \" determined to have a look at the facts , no matter what the outcome .\" One of the facts Collins looked at , and the one that impressed him most , was the \" Moral Law \" - the concept of right and wrong that \" appears to be universal among all members of the human species . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Collins continued to seek evidence for his belief .He found some in the Big Bang , which \" cries out for a divine explanation . \"He found more in the orderliness of natural laws and in the Anthropic Principle , \" the idea that our universe is uniquely tuned to give rise to humans .\" This is not the same as what has become known as \" intelligent design .\" In fact , Collins is worried that intelligent design ( ID ) is endangering faith by encouraging Christians to pin their faith on illusory evidence that evaporates in the light of new scientific discoveries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Like many other critics of ID , Collins thus begins by using a definition of ID that is different from that of its proponents .Contrary to Collins 's first proposition , ID does not claim that \" evolution promotes an atheistic worldview .\" Evolution can mean simply change over time , which carries no religious or anti - religious implications .Or it can mean minor changes within existing species , an uncontroversial phenomenon that is also religiously neutral .Problems arise with respect to Darwin 's theory , though , which excludes design in the details of living things .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So he was \" inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws , with the details , whether good or bad , left to the working out of what we may call chance . \" 2 Because Darwinism excludes design in the details , many people ( including many Darwinists ! ) have argued that it \" promotes an atheistic worldview .\" But the conflict between Darwinism and ID concerns only the question of whether certain features of living things are better explained by an intelligent cause or by undirected natural processes .Collins 's second and third propositions falsely imply that ID consists only of a negative argument - as though the absence of evidence for Darwinism automatically justifies an inference to design .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The fact that Darwinian theory can not explain something may be a necessary condition for inferring intelligent design , but it is not sufficient .Collins argues that ID ( as he defines it ) is not science : \" Intelligent design fails in a fundamental way to qualify as a scientific theory .All scientific theories represent a framework for making sense of a body of experimental observations .But the primary utility of a theory is not just to look back but to look forward .A viable scientific theory predicts other findings and suggests approaches for further experimental verification .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Collins then criticizes biochemist Michael Behe 's claim that some features of cells are irreducibly complex .\" By irreducibly complex , \" Behe wrote in 1996 , \" I mean a single system composed of several well - matched , interacting parts that contribute to the basic function , wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning .\" 3 Behe argued that whenever we encounter irreducible complexity in our daily lives we quite reasonably attribute it to an intelligent agent , since that is the only cause we know that can produce it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "One of these was the human blood - clotting cascade , a system of interacting proteins that ensures that clots will form only when and where they are needed .Behe wrote a response to this criticism in 2000 4 , which Collins ignores .More surprising is the fact that Collins is here citing experimental evidence against a theory he maintains is unscientific because it is not open to experimental testing .In claiming that evidence from gene duplication disproves ID , Collins is demonstrating that ID can be tested with scientific evidence .Either ID is unscientific , in which case evidence is irrelevant ; or evidence can be cited against it , in which case ID is scientific .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The most \" damaging crack in the foundation of intelligent design \" for Collins , however , is recent research that allegedly undercuts Behe 's argument for the irreducible complexity of the bacterial flagellum , a propulsion system driven by a microscopic high - speed motor .Collins first re - casts Behe 's view of irreducible complexity as a claim that \" the individual subunits of the flagellum could have had no prior useful function of some other sort , \" then he proceeds to argue against that claim .As evidence , Collins cites the type III secretory apparatus ( TTSS ) , \" an entirely different apparatus used by certain bacteria to inject toxins into other bacteria that they are attacking \" that is composed of proteins similar to some of those in the bacterial flagellum motor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But each such new puzzle piece provides a natural explanation for a step that ID had relegated to supernatural forces , and leaves its proponents with smaller and smaller territory to stand upon . \"As in the case of the blood - clotting cascade , Collins ignores Behe 's counterargument - in this case , that \" there 's no reason that parts or sub - assemblies of irreducibly complex systems ca n't have one or more other functions .\" 6 The fact that a fuel pump can be used for other purposes does n't mean that the automobile engine of which it is a part is undesigned .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If anything , the latter probably de -volved from the former !In any case , Collins is again citing evidence ( as he did above ) against a theory he says ca n't be tested against the evidence .Without noticing the contradiction , he concludes : \" Scientifically , ID fails to hold up , providing neither an opportunity for experimental validation nor a robust foundation for its primary claim of irreducible complexity . \"Collins then adds a new twist : \" More than that , however , ID also fails in a way that should be more of a concern to the believer than to the hard - nosed scientist .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Various cultures have traditionally tried to ascribe to God various natural phenomena that the science of the day had been unable to sort out - whether a solar eclipse or the beauty of a flower .But those theories have a dismal history .Advances in science ultimately fill in those gaps , to the dismay of those who had attached their faith to them .Ultimately a ' God of the gaps ' religion runs a huge risk of simply discrediting faith .We must not repeat this mistake in the current era .Intelligent design fits into this discouraging tradition , and faces the same ultimate demise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "As physicist David Snoke has written , \" Did anyone ever argue for the existence of God because we did not understand magnets or the orbits of the planets ?Perhaps some pagan shaman somewhere has argued that way , but I see no evidence for any serious Christian argument along these lines . \" 8 And Collins 's suggestion that scientific advances have eliminated intelligent design is exaggerated , to say the least .After all , for the blood - clotting cascade and the bacterial flagellum the only thing Collins offers is speculation about ancient gene duplications .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "First , ID is not inserting supernatural intervention , unless intelligence itself is defined as supernatural .ID makes only the minimal claim that it is possible to infer from the evidence of nature that some features or patterns in nature are explained better by an intelligent cause than by undirected processes .True , one can then ask about the nature of the intelligence , and a reasonable answer would be God .But ID does not take us that far ; it is not natural theology .Second , and more importantly , design inferences are not arguments from ignorance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" We infer design in our daily lives when X resembles things that we know are produced by intelligence and could not plausibly have been produced without it .Irreducible complexity is one hallmark of designed things ; the \" specified complexity \" of William Dembski is another .9 In either case , we infer design most reliably when we have more evidence , not less .Darwin and his contemporaries thought living cells were blobs of protoplasm ; it was easy for them to assume that such blobs were undesigned .But as modern biologists learn more and more about the irreducibly complex biochemical cascades and molecular machines needed for life , it becomes less and less plausible to dismiss cells as accidental by - products of unguided natural forces .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "His real target is not ID , but God of the gaps reasoning , which he considers a grave danger to religious faith because of what he believes to be overwhelming evidence for Darwinian evolution .Overwhelming evidence ?As director of the National Human Genome Research Institute ( NHGRI ) , Collins argues that data from DNA sequencing provide \" powerful support for Darwin 's theory of evolution , that is , descent from a common ancestor with natural selection operating on randomly occurring variations .\" Regarding the second part of the theory ( natural selection acting on random variations ) , Collins writes : \" Darwin could hardly have imagined a more compelling digital demonstration of his theory than what we find by studying the DNA of multiple organisms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We can now see that the variation he postulated is supported by naturally occurring mutations in DNA . \"Although most mutations are neutral or harmful , \" on rare occasions , a mutation will arise by chance that offers a slight degree of selective advantage .That new DNA ' spelling ' will have a slightly higher likelihood of being passed on to future offspring .Over the course of a very long period of time , such favorable rare events can become widespread in all members of the species , ultimately resulting in major changes in biological function .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\"But he writes that \" this distinction is increasingly seen to be artificial .\" To prove his point , Collins cites a Stanford University study of stickleback fish 10 .Marine sticklebacks typically have armor plates extending from head to tail , but many freshwater sticklebacks lack such plates , and biologists have found a correlation between this difference and variations in the gene for Ectodysplasin ( EDA ) , a molecule involved in the formation of the plates .Collins concludes : \" It is not hard to see how the difference between freshwater and saltwater sticklebacks could be extended to generate all kinds of fish .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" But marine and freshwater sticklebacks are merely varieties of the same species , Gasterosteus aculeatus .There is no evidence here that variations in their gene for EDA would ( or even could ) lead to the origin of a new species , much less to the new organs or major changes in body plans needed for macroevolution .The same can be said for the only other example cited by Collins , variations in disease - causing viruses , bacteria , and parasites .Like Dobzhansky , Collins merely assumes that microevolution can be extrapolated to macroevolution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Regarding the first part of Darwin 's theory ( descent from a common ancestor ) , Collins writes that \" the study of multiple genomes \" enables evolutionary biologists \" to do detailed comparisons of our own DNA sequence with that of other organisms . \"Since DNA mutations accumulate over time , organisms with a recent common ancestor would be expected to show fewer differences in their DNA than organisms that diverged much earlier .Collins concludes : \" This analysis does not utilize any information from the fossil record , or from anatomical observations of current life forms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "\" What Collins does n't mention is that the DNA data often lead to conflicting phylogenies .For example , his evolutionary tree in The Language of God shows flying lemurs related to tree shrews , and rabbits and monkeys on more distant branches .But a phylogeny published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA in 2002 shows flying lemurs related to monkeys and tree shrews related to rabbits .12 Conflicts among different DNA - based trees are a major headache for evolutionary biologists , some of whom spend their entire careers attempting to resolve them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Take whales , for example - fossils of which Collins asserts are \" consistent with the concept of a tree of life of related organisms .\" On morphological grounds , evolutionary biologist Leigh Van Valen proposed in the 1960s that modern whales are descended from an extinct group of hyena - like animals . 13 Then , in the 1990s , molecular comparisons suggested that whales are more closely related to hippopotamuses 14 .In 2001 , however , evolutionary biologist Kenneth D. Rose reported that \" substantial discrepancies remain \" between the morphological and molecular evidence 15 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
