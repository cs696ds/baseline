{"text": "Uppsala Persian Dependency Treebank : UPDT .Uppsala Persian Dependency Treebank ( UPDT ) ( Seraji , 2015 , Chapter 5 , pp .97 - 146 ) is a dependency - based syntactically annotated corpus .The treebank consists of 6000 sentences ( 151,671 tokens ) of written text in CoNLL - format and is developed through a bootstrapping procedure involving the open source data - driven dependency parser MaltParser ( Nivre et al . , 2006 ) , and manual validation of the annotation .The entire treebank was released in 2013 .However , the first release of the treebank , containing a seed data set of 225 sentences , was in Fall 2011 and the process of treebank development was published in the journal article Linguistic Issues in Language Technology , 7(18):1 - 10 , January 2012 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
