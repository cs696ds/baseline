{"text": "However , to what extent genes that regulate the development of the nervous system and its circuitry also influence homeostasis and longevity remains presently unclear .Interestingly , several data support the notion that early - life environmental influences might have \" carry - over \" effects into adulthood and might thus impact lifespan ( Gavrilov and Gavrilova , 2011 ; Saino et al ., 2012 ) .For example , putative biomarkers of aging that affect gene activity and chromosome structure at an early age have been shown to predict life expectancy ( Baeriswyl et al ., 2009 ; Pincus and Slack , 2010 ; Heidinger et al .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Similarly , newly emerging data from C. elegans show that age - related behaviors are associated with distinct transcriptomes and that the statistical analysis of these aggregate gene expression profiles can predict age and health states ( Golden et al . , 2008 ) .Thus , such data tempt one to speculate that genes involved in developmental canalization ( or \" robustness \" ) might also have long - term effects on physiological homeostasis and somatic maintenance later in life .This canalization has been predicted to be a generic feature of developmental gene networks ( Siegal and Bergman , 2002 ; Flatt , 2005 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Another obvious mechanism that might play a role in \" carry - over \" effects on lifespan and aging are epigenetic modifications .Experiments in rodents , for instance , have shown that experiences during sensitive periods of brain development influence DNA methylation patterns , which in turn could alter gene transcription throughout life and promote specific phenotypic outcomes ( Roth and Sweatt , 2011 ) .In a similar vein , the \" heterochromatin loss model of aging \" posits that heterochromatin domains that are set up early in embryogenesis are gradually lost with age , which results in aberrant and age - associated gene expression patterns ( Villeponteau , 1997 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": ", 2012 ) .These are intriguing preliminary observations and it will be interesting to learn more about the role of epigenetic changes in aging and lifespan in future work .A recent study directly comparing gene expression profiles during aging in mouse , rhesus macaque and human brains indicates that only a small subset of the age - dependent expression changes might be conserved ( Loerch et al . , 2008 ) .These few genes include the neuroprotective gene apolipoprotein D ( APOD ) , which is robustly upregulated with age in all three species and whose two Drosophila homologs are known to affect lifespan ( Ruiz et al . , 2011 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While these results indicate that the neuronal mechanisms of aging and longevity might not be highly conserved among different taxa , a study by Fonseca et al .( 2005 ) provides a remarkable counter - example .Across a range of terrestrial , freshwater , marine , tropical , and temperate arthropods , whose lifespans vary by three orders of magnitude , the neuronal deposition of lipofuscin , a lipid - protein aggregate , is highly correlated with lifespan .This suggests that age - dependent damage accumulation in the brain might be the primary driver of senescence ( Fonseca et al . , 2005 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although one can not rule out a certain level of ascertainment bias , these results suggest that FOXO not only plays a functional role in regulating lifespan in laboratory model organisms , but that naturally occurring alleles can also have measurable effects on lifespan .Similar associations between natural polymorphisms and human longevity have been identified for IGF-1R ( Suh et al . , 2008 ) .Likewise , evidence from Drosophila indicates that natural alleles in the InR locus do affect life history traits that are closely linked to longevity ( Paaby et al . , 2010 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The literature review presented in this research shows that although many researches have been conducted in this area of science , it has still great potential to be further extended .Another conclusion is that Goyal 's [ 7 ] model can be considered as the major infrastructure for the inventory models with delay in payment .A more precise look at the trend of the literature reveals that most of the studies discussed here are extensions of their preceding researches to which one or more factors mentioned throughout this paper are added .A more thorough summary of the findings of this literature review is as follows .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This consideration is practical in the real world as the parties of the supply chain ( supplier and buyer ) seek for their profit maximization simultaneously .Moreover , EPQ models are still suitable for future studies .Secondly , it is mostly assumed that the demand rate is constant .However , clearly , this assumption is only for the time that the product is in the maturity stage of its life cycle .Therefore , considering time , price , or credit - dependent demand rate would be of great importance and could be considered as one of the main directions toward conducting future researches .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Since this assumption is not considered widely , a more realistic and effective problem for the future research could be considering order - quantity - dependent trade credit .Fourthly , it is argued by some of the previously conducted studies that backorder occurs partially , not completely , and some of the customers may be lost due to the lack of the inventory .This could be assumed for future studies to extend the existing models .Conflict of Interests .The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper .Acknowledgments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "This approach has evolved along the last decades , improving our understanding on public transport operations .These studies are based on a strict hypothesis that all users are perfectly rational .In reality , however , most of the users may be boundedly rational in choosing the bus lines .There is a kind of users , called oblivious users , who make their bus lane choices without caring about the delay and in - carriage congestion experienced .Their decisions rely on simple criteria , for example , finding the most direct line from the transit map .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
