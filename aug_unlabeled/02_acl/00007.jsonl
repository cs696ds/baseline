{"text": "Colon .Approximately 1.4 million people in Europe are diagnosed - generally in late adolescence or early adulthood - with inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) which consists of two major forms , namely , ulcerative colitis ( UC ) and Crohn 's disease ( CD ) [ 71 ] .Both pathologic entities are characterized by autoimmune - mediated inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract .In CD , MK serum levels showed positive correlation with Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) which includes vital parameters , clinical findings , and medical history [ 12 , 72 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In an experimental colitis model , where bowel inflammation was induced by dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) and which represents a well - established model for UC , MK was abundantly expressed in fibroblasts of the mucosal and submucosal layers of the rat distal colon [ 36 ] .Here , TNF- \u03b1 and IL-1 \u03b2 , which show high local expression during active IBD in humans leading to infiltration of innate immune cells , were expressed in the distal rat colon [ 36 , 73 ] .In addition , both cytokines induced MK expression in the rat fibroblast cell line 3Y1 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thus , the inflammatory cytokines TNF- \u03b1 and IL-1 \u03b2 may facilitate wound repair by upregulating MK .However , the question whether MK is beneficial for mucosa repair or rather promotes inflammation requires further investigation .Central Nervous System .MK has also been investigated in a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the central nervous system , namely , multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .In Europe around 500,000 people suffer from MS [ 74 ] .MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that is characterized by demyelination of axons of the central nervous system caused by autoreactive T - cells and demyelinating antibodies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After induction of EAE in rats , increased MK mRNA expression in the spinal cord correlated with the severity of clinical symptoms such as limb and tail weakness .Recovery of clinical symptoms led to decreased MK expression in the spinal cord again [ 37 ] .EAE induction of WT mice caused severe clinical symptoms 18 days after onset of the experiment .MK - deficient mice also developed clinical signs of encephalomyelitis .However , clinical scores were significantly lower than in WT control animals .Administration of recombinant MK with a subcutaneously implanted microosmotic pump deteriorated clinical scores [ 13 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This indicates that MK was important for induction and development of EAE .CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations were similar in peripheral lymph nodes of WT and MK - deficient mice and , therefore , did not explain reduced clinical and histopathological severity in MK - deficient mice .Accordingly , administration of MK critically suppressed T reg expansion in a dose - dependent manner in vitro and in vivo .When T reg were targeted with a CD25 blocking antibody in MK - deficient mice , suppression of EAE was abolished [ 13 ] .These findings indicate that an increased number of T reg were recruited to peripheral lymph nodes when MK was absent after induction of EAE leading to attenuated clinical and histopathological symptoms in this model [ 13 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It could also be shown that targeting MK by RNA aptamers significantly increased T reg expansion and improved clinical signs after induction of EAE in WT mice [ 13 ] .Taken together , MK expression has been shown to be enhanced during induction and progression of EAE which correlated positively with clinical scores and histopathological signs of inflammation of the myelin sheath .MK suppressed expansion of T reg and enhanced autoreactive injury of the myelin sheath .Targeting MK led to increased T reg expansion and subsequently suppressed autoreactive T H 1 and T H 17 cell populations in this model which are critically involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Being diagnosed with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , or rheumatoid arthritis critically affects the patients ' quality of life [ 79 , 80 ] .Especially the early onset and gradual progression of disease over a long period of time makes therapy and treatment for clinicians and patients very challenging [ 81 ] .Immunosuppressive drugs , corticosteroids , cytostatics , and biological drugs specifically targeting proteins involved in the inflammatory response can effectively suppress autoimmune responses .However , severe side effects , for example , increased risk of infection , cancer , and other autoimmune diseases , make treatment options unsatisfying [ 81 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Different studies have shown that MK plays a role in inflammation by induction of leukocyte infiltration and chemokine expression as well as by suppression of T reg expansion .As MK shows highly restrictive expression patterns in healthy tissues of the adult organism , targeting MK may represent a promising new approach for treatment of chronic inflammation including autoimmune diseases .ACKNOWLEDGMENTS .The authors would like to thank Dr. Markus Sperandio for critical reading of this paper and helpful discussion .L.

{"text": "Introduction .Understanding tissue alterations at an early stage following traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) is critical for injury management and prevention of more severe secondary damage to the brain .Diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) is a powerful tool for studying neurological disease as it provides in vivo measurements of tissue microstructure change that could not otherwise be detected through conventional magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques .Diffusion of water protons in tissue is typically characterized by mean diffusivity ( MD ) , which measures the average distance a water molecule traverses within a given observation time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Studies using DTI have focused on white matter abnormality because of the highly directional diffusion of water found in the white matter tracts .Since the diffusion profile in the grey matter is considered to be largely isotropic [ Pierpaoli et al . , 1996 ] , the use of DTI to study changes in the gray matter in brain injury has unfortunately received very little interest .The diffusion of water in brain tissue , while complex , is largely simplified in a tensor model where the diffusion - weighted signal ' S ' is assumed to follow a mono - exponential decay .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Typically for routine clinical evaluation , the b - values ( a measure of the sensitivity to diffusion ) in DTI experiments are around 1000 s / mm 2 and can probe water diffusion changes over 50 - 100ms .Observation of diffusion changes over this time frame provides sensitivity to a minimum diffusion distances of about 5 - 10\u03bcm ( Assaf and Cohen , 2000 ) .While this model is routinely used in the clinic , the model breaks down when higher b - values are used and the diffusion gradients are sensitized to probe restricted diffusion over shorter molecular distances ( Assaf and Cohen , 1998 ; Niendorf et al .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To understand such complex micro - environments , several models have been developed to characterize diffusion behavior .The most comprehensive and rigorous method proposed is the q - space method , which measures the diffusion weighted signal with different gradient strengths and diffusion times , and estimates the distribution of diffusion displacement of water ( Cohen and Assaf , 2002 ) .The q - space method thus provides a direct measure of water diffusion restriction in the tissue , which is indicative of cell size or axon radius ( Cohen and Assaf , 2002 ; Farrell et al . , 2010 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The diffusion kurtosis model has been proposed as an alternative to the compartmental model , using a cumulant expansion of ln ( S ) in a power series of b to fit the diffusion - weighted signal .This model makes no presumption of compartmentalization and has shown to fit the diffusion - weighted signal well , up to moderately large b - values of around 2500 s / mm 2 .Diffusion kurtosis has also shown to have clinical value in detecting tissue microstructure abnormality such as in squamous cell carcinoma ( Jansen et al . , 2010 ) , cerebral gliomas ( Raab et al . , 2010 ) , and lung dysfunction ( Trampel et al . , 2006 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In a study of brain maturation , Falangola et al .( 2008 ) have shown that MK is sensitive to changes in grey matter , where MK increases with brain maturation while the DTI parameters , MD and FA remained relatively unchanged .They postulated that the increase in MK during maturation in the grey and white matter was likely due to consistent and continuing myelination and an overall increase of the microstructural complexity and increased cell - packing density especially in the grey matter .Post - mortem studies also confirm the increase in the number and volume of glial cells with age in response to neuronal pruning as part of the developmental process of the nervous system ( Finch , 2003 ; Terry et al . , 1987 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , this complex scenario of microstructural changes appears to be sensitive to MK .Previous studies of brain injury have observed reactive astrogliosis activity to peak at 4 - 7 days post injury ( Chen et al . , 2003 ; MacDonald et al . , 2007 ) .This observation agrees with our histopathological findings where we observe significant increase in reactive astrocytosis and microglial response at 7 days .Furthermore , this increased reactive astrogliosis corresponds directly to the increased MK seen in vivo at sub - acute stage when DTI parameters such as FA and MD have returned to baseline , indicating that MK is sensitive to changes in tissue microstructure in response to the injury .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although the primary injury from CCI was focal , the pattern of injury as observed through DKI , especially at the sub - acute stage , was diffuse and even extended to the contralateral hemisphere .This finding is consistent with a previous study that found progressive neurodegeneration following CCI , starting at the site of the injury and gradually progressing to a widespread callosal and thalamic neuro - degeneration in both hemispheres by 7 days ( Hall et al . , 2005 ) .The authors attributed this widespread change to degeneration of fibers in the corpus callosum and commissural pathway , causing progressive neuronal death and cellular destruction on the contralateral hemisphere .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "So such a process would also likely trigger mild reactive astrogliosis that might contribute to an increase in MK in the contralateral hemisphere .It is well known that reactive astrogliosis occurs in response to CNS injury and other disease process , the extent of which may vary based on the severity of the insult ( Laird et al . , 2008 ; Sofronview , 2009 ) .These changes are modulated by inter- and intra - cellular signaling mechanisms and have the potential to modify the degree of changes in a manner that can be either detrimental or beneficial for the surrounding cells .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "These processes together with demyelination may result in more free water diffusion in the radial direction and hence higher \u03bb r and lower K r .The increase in K a was also significant in the ipsilateral EC without a corresponding change in \u03bb a .The increase in K a and normalization of K r at sub - acute stage can be attributed to reactive fibrous astrogliosis activity in the white matter .DTI has been used extensively in characterizing white matter disease because diffusion properties along and perpendicular to the axon provide important information about axonal integrity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The fact that changes in the grey matter can be realized using MK provides an extra dimension to the repertoire of imaging techniques for the investigators .The directly impacted cortex shows an increased MD and reduced FA at the acute stage due to tissue edema , visible on T 2 -weighted images .In the grey matter regions of the hippocampus and the cortex , we observed a reduced MD and increased FA at the acute stage .By the sub - acute stage a return to the baseline for MD and FA was observed in all these regions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Reliance purely on DTI parameters may underestimate the underlying cellular processes that influence changes in the tissue microstructure .In our study , the acute MK increase was only significant in the ipsilateral cortex and was directly associated with highly restricted diffusion as observed by MD in the directly impacted area .However , a wide spread increase in MK was observed by the sub - acute stage in other regions , at a time when both MD and FA appear to return to baseline levels .The increase in MK suggests increased tissue heterogeneity which was confirmed as reactive astrogliosis from GFAP staining .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Once again , this reflects the sensitivity of MK that is not captured by either MD or FA which underestimate the processes underlying tissue microstructure changes , when clearly reactive protoplasmic astrocytes have not completely resolved .One limitation to the present study is that only GFAP staining was performed to obtain immunohistochemistry information on the animals .Although our study here clearly indicates an association of increased MK to increased reactive astrocyte activity from GFAP staining , one should not discount the possibility of other physiological processes that may also be in play that may have an effect on diffusion kurtosis .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "While future studies should focus on teasing the contribution of these physiological processes , it is clear that diffusion kurtosis may have value in the case of mild injury where no focal contusion or lesion is observed on conventional MRI or can be identified by standard DTI parameters .Because of its sensitivity to changes in reactive astrogliosis , diffusion kurtosis may be a suitable imaging marker to monitor inflammatory changes in the brain following TBI .The association of increased MK to increased astrocyte immunoreactivity in this study should also be viewed in the context of its limitations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Although we observed a strong association of changes in MK with GFAP immunoreactivity , it would be of great interest to see how MK correlates with histological findings , especially with the density of astrocytes within the injured tissue and the relationship with behavior and size of the contusion .It should be noted that reactive astrogliosis is believed to be a reliable and sensitive marker of diseased tissue ( Sofroniew , 2010 ) and can play an important role in determining long - term clinical outcome ( Cheng et al . , 2003 ; Sofroniew , 2009 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It would of interest to see if the MK tracks the normalization of the astrocytic activity over a longer period .We only used three b - values primarily because of concern for the effects of prolonged anesthesia for the animals , potential for the animal to move during these prolonged experiments , and time constraints posed for magnet use .The reliability in the estimation of DKI parameters increases with the use of multiple b - values as it helps in minimizing fitting errors ( Cheung et al . , 2008 ; Falangola et al . , 2008 ; Hui et al . , 2008 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
