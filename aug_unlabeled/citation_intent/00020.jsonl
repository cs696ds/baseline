{"text": "The mixed transformation method is a modification of a full transformation method developed previously for meshfree solution of boundary value problems , while the boundary singular kernel method introduces singularities into the kernel functions associated with the restrained nodes [ 18 ] .Another set of new boundary treatment techniques were developed by Ren and Liew , namely , node interpolation method ( NIM ) and direct imposition method ( DIM ) .In NIM , the shape functions associated with EBCs were constructed using node interpolation and then combined with meshfree shape functions , while DIM rearranges the discretized system equations , and directly provides the known values of the essential boundary conditions in the nodal variable vector [ 19 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In proposed method , shape functions of EFG method were modified and made continuous in domain with concave corners , by simply redefining a parameter governing decay of weight function [ 96 ] .In meshfree methods , for numerical integration of Galerkin weak form , Gauss integration method is most commonly used .Dolbow and Belytschko demonstrated and investigated integration aspects in meshfree methods .Authors emphasized on source of integration errors and suggested techniques to minimize them [ 20 ] .But a number of disadvantages have been reported in employing Gauss integration , like complexity , requirement of higher order quadrature rules , specialized integration zone patterns , and so forth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "To overcome it , a stabilized nodal integration technique , for EFG , was proposed by adding a residual of the equilibrium equation to the potential energy function .The proposed technique does not need background cell structure and results in completely meshless method [ 21 ] .A stabilized conforming nodal integration ( SCNI ) method for elastoplastic contact analysis of metal forming processes was proposed by Yoon et al .In this approach , strain smoothing stabilization was introduced to eliminate spatial instability in collocation meshfree methods and convergence was obtained by introducing an integration constraint ( IC ) as a necessary condition for a linear exactness in the mesh - free Galerkin approximation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
