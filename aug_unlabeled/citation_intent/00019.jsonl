{"text": "For example , here is how the Perl docs describe one of the forms that Perl 's use statement takes : . use Module VERSION LIST . and in Perl 's source code ( perly.y ) something similar drives the parser .The second level is lexical .For example , Perl 's perlpodspec page has a number of statements like this : .The lexical level is character by character .The structural level is less well - defined , but in practice it ignores most of the character - by - character issues , and it almost always avoids dealing with whitespace .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "( For historic reasons , L0 is sometimes also called G0 . )It is important to realize that the difference between L0 and G1 is one of level of description and NOT one of precision or exactness .A structural description of Perl 's use statement , much like the one I showed above , is in Perl 's source code ( perly.y ) , along with many other , similar , structural - level descriptions .These are used to generate the production parser for Perl so , clearly , structural level descriptions are every bit as much a precision instrument as regular expressions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In order to focus on very basic issues , I will use as an example , a very simple language with a very simple semantics .The language consists of decimal digits and ASCII spaces .The semantics will treat it as a series of integers to be added .Here are three strings in that language .According to our semantics , the three strings contain respectively , one , two and seven integers .The values of the three strings are , according to our semantics , the sum of these integers : respectively , 8675311 , 6178 , and 31 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "From the purely structural point of view this can be , in one sense , true .But from the lexical point of view it 's clearly quite false .Combining the two levels of description , it is very hard to justify an assertion that \" whitespace is ignored \" .The three strings in the display above differ only in whitespace .Clearly the placement of the whitespace makes a vast difference , and has a major effect on the structure of string , which in turn has a determining effect on its semantics .Why the structural level ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is possible to describe a language using a single level of description .So why have a structural ( G1 ) level of description ?Why not a \" unified \" instead of a \" split \" description .It turns out that , for most languages of practical size , particularly those that deploy whitespace in a natural and intuitive way , a \" unified \" description rapidly becomes unwriteable , and even more rapidly becomes unreadable .The reader should be able to convince himself by taking the BNF from his favorite language standard and recasting it so that every rule takes into account whitespace .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the first of the two lines above the whitespace is necessary .In the second of the two lines whitespace would be allowed , but is not necessary .You can not simply insist on whitespace between all symbols , because whitespace is and should be optional between some symbols and not between others .Where whitespace is optional , and where it should not be , depends on which characters are adjacent to each other .This kind of character - level information is not convenient to represent at the structural ( G1 ) level .It is certainly possible to write whitespace - aware BNF for the fragment of the C language above .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "But before you 've extended the BNF very much , you will notice it is becoming a lot harder to write .You will also notice that , as quickly as it is becoming hard to write , it is even more quickly becoming \" write - only \" -- impossible to read .In making your BNF whitespace - aware , you are more than doubling its size .And you are burying what intuition sees as the structure of the language under a deep pile of special cases .Long before you finish , I expect you will realize that the \" unified \" approach is simply not workable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This was clearly the only practical approach .Interweaving the two levels .The scanless interface interweaves the \" split \" and \" unified \" approaches and , I hope , preserves the best features of each .Here is full syntax of the example whitespace - and - digit language , described using Marpa::R2 's scanless interface : .A new operator .In this example , three of the scanless interface 's extensions to the Stuifzand interface are used .Character classes .Perl character classes are now allowed on the RHS of prioritized and quantified rules .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Lexemes .Tokens at the boundary between L0 and G1 have special significance .The top - level undiscarded symbols in L0 , which will be called \" L0 lexemes \" , go on to become the terminals in G1 .G1 's terminals are called \" G1 lexemes \" .To find the \" L0 lexemes \" , Marpa looks for symbols which are on the LHS of a L0 rule , but not on the RHS of any L0 rule .To find the \" G1 lexemes \" , Marpa looks for symbols on the RHS of at least one G1 rule , but not on the LHS of any G1 rule .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If they do not , the programmer receives a fatal message which describes the problem and the symbols involved .So in practice I will usually simply refer to \" lexemes \" .Longest tokens match .The L0 grammar looks for tokens on a longest tokens match basis .Tokens in discard rules are thrown away , and the rest are passed on to the G1 grammar .Note that match is longest TOKENS .There may be more than one longest match , in which case Marpa uses the full set of longest matches .Semantics .The value of a L0 rule is always the string it matches , and the value of a lexeme from the G1 point of view is the same as its value from the L0 point of view .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Historically , the sub ( ) and gsub ( ) functions treated the two character sequence ' \\ & ' specially ; this sequence was replaced in the generated text with a single ' & ' .Any other ' \\ ' within the replacement string that did not precede an ' & ' was passed through unchanged .This is illustrated in Table 9.1 .You type sub ( ) sees sub ( ) generates .Table 9.1 : Historical Escape Sequence Processing for sub ( ) and gsub ( ) .This table shows both the lexical - level processing , where an odd number of backslashes becomes an even number at the runtime level , as well as the runtime processing done by sub ( ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The problem with the historical approach is that there is no way to get a literal ' \\ ' followed by the matched text .The 1992 POSIX standard attempted to fix this problem .That standard says that sub ( ) and gsub ( ) look for either a ' \\ ' or an ' & ' after the ' \\ ' .If either one follows a ' \\ ' , that character is output literally .The interpretation of ' \\ ' and ' & ' then becomes as shown in Table 9.2 .You type sub ( ) sees sub ( ) generates .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This appears to solve the problem .Unfortunately , the phrasing of the standard is unusual .It says , in effect , that ' \\ ' turns off the special meaning of any following character , but for anything other than ' \\ ' and ' & ' , such special meaning is undefined .This wording leads to two problems : .Backslashes must now be doubled in the replacement string , breaking historical awk programs .To make sure that an awk program is portable , every character in the replacement string must be preceded with a backslash .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The proposed rules have special cases that make it possible to produce a ' \\ ' preceding the matched text .This is shown in Table 9.3 .You type sub ( ) sees sub ( ) generates .Table 9.3 : Proposed rules for sub and backslash .In a nutshell , at the runtime level , there are now three special sequences of characters ( ' \\\\\\ & ' , ' \\\\ & ' and ' \\ & ' ) whereas historically there was only one .However , as in the historical case , any ' \\ ' that is not part of one of these three sequences is not special and appears in the output literally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The POSIX standard took much longer to be revised than was expected in 1996 .The 2001 standard does not follow the above rules .Instead , the rules there are somewhat simpler .The results are similar except for one case .These rules are presented in Table 9.4 .You type sub ( ) sees sub ( ) generates .Table 9.4 : POSIX rules for sub ( ) and gsub ( ) .The only case where the difference is noticeable is the last one : ' \\\\\\\\ ' is seen as ' \\\\ ' and produces ' \\ ' instead of ' \\\\ ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Otherwise , it continued to follow the 1996 proposed rules , since that had been its behavior for many years .When version 4.0.0 , was released , the gawk maintainer made the POSIX rules the default , breaking well over a decade 's worth of backwards compatibility .( 46 ) Needless to say , this was a bad idea , and as of version 4.0.1 , gawk resumed its historical behavior , and only follows the POSIX rules when ' --posix ' is given .The rules for gensub ( ) are considerably simpler .At the runtime level , whenever gawk sees a ' \\ ' , if the following character is a digit , then the text that matched the corresponding parenthesized subexpression is placed in the generated output .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
