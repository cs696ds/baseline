{"text": "Different studies have been described in the literature about the sample preparation and chromatographic determination of pesticide residues in food and feedstuffs and these results are described in this chapter .Solid - liquid extraction .In the last decades , one of the most applied pesticide extraction technique from cereals was solid - liquid extraction ( SLE ) .Before the SLE , solid samples are transformed into fine and homogeneous particles by mechanical grinding , mixing , rolling , agitating , chopping , crushing , macerating , mincing , pressing , or pulverizing .The homogenized solid samples are repeatedly extracted with an immiscible organic solvent , and the extracts are then centrifuged , concentrated and/or purified before the final analysis [ 10 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "As explained before that fucoxanthin has been implicated as important dietary nutrients having antioxidant potential .It is one of the reasons why some researchers had evaluated the in vitro antioxidant activity of fucoxanthin extracted from algae .For example , Roh et al . suggested that fucoxanthin content should be considered as an important feature of brown seaweed , as some of its nutritive and pharmacological effects could be attributed to their presence in plant material [ 31 ] .Billakanti et al . also reported that the yield of fucoxanthin from U. pinnatifida could be improved by using an enzyme - assisted extraction process followed by DME extraction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In this work , by using ethanol solvent , 50 \u03bcg of fucoxanthin has been extracted from U. pinnatifida 6 g.

{"text": "At the same extraction temperature , the same trend was found at 10 , 20 , and 30 MPa .As previously mentioned , the effect of pressure can be attributed to the increase in solvent power and by the strengthening of intermolecular physical interactions .It is also evident that an increase in pressure had effect on the solubility of fucoxanthin in supercritical CO 2 .This result is in agreement with similar trends reported by other authors [ 29 , 37 ] .Machmudah et al . reported that the total extract and the astaxanthin extracted were not significantly affected by the increasing pressure at 30 - 50 MPa , and after which the dramatic increase was observed at the pressure of 55 MPa .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "In addition , due to the fast extraction rate of fucoxanthin from U. pinnatifida , this figure also showed that an increase in temperature likely had a stronger effect on the solubility than an increase in pressure .At 70 \u00b0 C , the yield of fucoxanthin is lower than at 60 \u00b0 C .In this case , degradation of fucoxanthin might also take place , considering that carotenoids in general are considered to be heat - sensitive [ 33 ] .Figure 2 .Figure 2 .In this work , the amounts of fucoxanthin extracted by supercritical CO 2 extraction with and without ethanol as entrainer were compared .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Due to the long extraction time at the boiling point of the ethanol solvent , the possible degradations of fucoxanthin due to local overheating effects might occur .This process was performed to disrupt the cell membrane in U. pinnatifida , thus extraction efficiency of fucoxanthin increases .Supercritical CO 2 as known is attractive extraction method for food industries because the solvent is safe , nontoxic and easily removable , the method is fast and extraction parameters can be changed in a wide range of pressure and temperature .However , CO 2 is non - polar fluid and it is the main disadvantage in its use for the isolation of antioxidants .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "However , respecting to separation process , it is not only expensive but also difficult .On the contrary , the cell disruption of U. pinnatifida is not required when the DME was employed as extractant due to the properties of DME ( see \" Introduction \" ) .That is why this technique of fucoxanthin extraction is very simple and versatile .Experimental Section .Materials .

{"text": "Errors due to syntactic parsing may also contribute to precision errors .Discussion of results on the gold corpus .Our evaluation results on the independently annotated Nagel gold corpus ( Table 5 ) show that although the exact subgraph matching approach achieved a high precision - similar to that on the silver corpus - it had a lower recall than on the silver corpus .The approximate matching approach achieved not only a higher recall but retained a very high precision .In the Nagel gold corpus , there were a significant number ( 18 % ) of protein - residue relations that span multiple sentences , placing an upper bound on the recall of any sentence - bound method and therefore contributing to the lower recall of our sentence - based approach .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Examination of these cases , found in 11 abstracts , indicates that often the relevant protein is introduced early on in the abstract and implicitly referenced in subsequent sentences .There are in some of these cases multiple intervening sentences between the protein mention and the residue mention .For instance , in PMID 7608980 , the protein abrin - a is introduced in the first sentence of the abstract , while its residue , Tyr74 , is discussed in the sixth sentence .This indicates that a simple window - based constraint on abstract co - occurrence would be inadequate to improve recall without also impacting precision .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Key words : artificial cardiac pacemaker , lead extraction , laser light .The extraction of venous leads of permanent pacemakers and defibrillators poses a great challenge to artificial cardiac stimulation , because of the high indices of failure and complications observed with the different techniques used .The clinical conditions requiring extraction of these catheters are luckily not frequent and include infection in the stimulation system , venous thrombosis , repetitive pulmonary embolisms , or other situations associated with the presence of a catheter and that constitute a risk to the patient 's life 1,2 .The routine practice of abandoning leads with no function has also become a problem with the use of multiple electrodes of the dual - chamber and multisite pacemakers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This management increases the risk of pulmonary thromboembolism , syndrome of the superior vena cava , and , frequently , hinders the access route for placement of new leads .Internal countertraction is a transvenous technique , and , consequently , less invasive than cardiotomy , therefore , being the preferred approach in most services .It requires , however , the introduction of a sheath that releases the lead to be extracted , and advances in the vein , encircling the lead until reaching the cardiac chamber , where the electrode is implanted , to act as support for the myocardium during lead extraction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Recent studies published in the literature have shown the superiority of the technique that uses the laser light , which has a higher rate of success in removing the fibrosis and a lower rate of complications .The objective of this study is to report the results obtained with the use of the excimer laser for extracting permanent transvenous leads from 36 patients operated upon at the of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo .Heart Institute ( Medical School ) .Methods .Twenty - two patients were males and 14 were females .The causes of the disorder in the cardiac conduction system were as follows : Chagas ' disease in 9 patients , degenerative diseases in 6 patients , ischemic disease in 5 , and other causes in 16 patients .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The CVX-300 excimer laser emits a beam of light of 308 nm , which is not visible to the human eye .It is a type of laser light that cuts using coldness : the temperature of the light emitted is approximately 50\u00baC. At the tissue depth of approximately 0.06 mm , 64 % of the energy is absorbed , and at the tissue depth of 0.18 mm , 95 % of this energy is dissipated .The body of this sheath contains 82 optical fibers that conduct the laser light as far as their distal portions , each one with a diameter of 100 mm .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Total release of the lead is obtained when the sheath reaches the endocardium , in the cardiac chamber where the electrode is implanted .Three different calibers of sheath exist : 12 , 14 , and 16 F , corresponding respectively to 2.8 mm , 3.4 mm , and 4.2 mm of internal diameter , and 4.1 mm , 4.8 mm , and 5.6 mm of external diameter .The proper choice of caliber of the sheath allows the extraction of any model of lead used in artificial venous cardiac stimulation .Patients are preferably operated upon while they are under general anesthesia with orotracheal intubation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Antisepsis of the skin is performed with povidone iodine , and sterile fields are placed to allow an easy access for sternal or lateral median thoracotomy .All material for thoracotomy should be easily accessible .After opening the pacemaker pocket , and with the electrode already released from the generator of pulses , the lead is carefully dissected from the scare tissue that envelopes it , and the suture sleeve is extracted .A smooth manual traction is then applied to check whether the extraction is feasible without using the set of extraction sheaths , and with no damage to the lead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The standard procedure for extracting the lead starts with extraction of the connector of the lead with a sterile wire cutter , and a long proximal portion of the lead is left to allow handling of the locking stylet and sheaths .As the distal part of the conductor may be deformed by the use of the wire cutter , a sharp conical dilator is used to expand the coil and allow the passage of the thickest possible locking stylet .The internal diameter of the lumen of the conductor is then measured with a set of locking stylet measurers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "After this maneuver , a new traction may be applied to the lead to check whether its release from the myocardium is feasible without using countertraction .If the electrode is not freed , the set of sheaths ( the internal , which emits the laser light , and the external , of polypropylene ) is applied to the lead , using it as a guide for their introduction .The applications of laser light are then started , each application lasting for 5 seconds , always accompanied by fluoroscopy .As the laser sheath progresses towards the heart , the external polypropylene sheath also advances , freeing the adherences of the lead to the venous and cardiac structures , until the most distal portion of the lead is reached by the laser sheath .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Then , the entire set ( external sheath , laser sheath , and lead ) is extracted , and hemostasis is performed at the site of introduction of the catheter by simple compression .Results .Fifty - four catheters were extracted , resulting in a 96.4 % rate of success .The extraction of 46 leads ( 82.1 % ) was complete .In 8 other leads , only the metallic tip remained attached to the myocardium ( 14.3 % ) , and only 2 leads could not be extracted at all ( 3.6 % ) .One patient had cardiac tamponade after extraction of the defibrillator lead , requiring open surgery on an emergency basis for correction of a laceration in the tip of the right ventricle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Discussion .In regard to extraction of leads , the state - of - the - art of artificial cardiac stimulation has revealed the advantages of the techniques that use internal countertraction when compared with other techniques .The high rate of success obtained with the countertraction techniques with mechanical dilators has been reported in the literature .Smith et al 3 have reported the following results obtained from 1988 to 1994 in the U.S. Lead Extraction Database : 86.8 % of complete extraction ; 7.5 % of incomplete extraction ; 5.7 % of failure ; 2.5 % of severe complications ; and 0.6 % of mortality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "According to these authors , active fixation atrial leads coated with silicone are completely extracted more frequently than passive fixation ventricular leads coated with polyurethane .Fibrosis can be very intense at 4 months after implantation of electrodes coated with silicone , and at 6 months for those coated with polyurethane 5 .The use of laser light ( replacing mechanical dilators ) to allow the introduction of the sheaths for countertraction has resulted in a reduction in the duration of the procedure and has increased safety .In 1999 , Wilkoff et al 6 carried out a study in which 301 patients were randomized , using 2 techniques for countertraction , as follows : in 1 group , mechanical dilators were used , and , in the other group , the excimer laser was used .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The 96.4 % rate of success and 2.8 % rate of severe complications are in accordance with the rates found in the literature , even though the incidence of incomplete extraction ( 14.3 % ) was higher in our study .All these factors suggest a higher risk of complications or of partial extraction .The other 2 criteria observed , number of leads per patient and proportion of female patients , have similar figures for the 3 populations analyzed .In conclusion , the use of the excimer laser has allowed extraction of catheters with a high success rate and a low level of complication .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
