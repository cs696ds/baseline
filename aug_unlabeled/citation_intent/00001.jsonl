{"text": "Also , most products require you to wait until new turf has been mowed three times before using them , though a few can be used somewhat sooner .Life cycle plays an important role in determining the ideal time to apply broadleaf herbicides .Perennials such as dandelion or clover are at their weakest in fall , when food reserves are low following summer .These weeds experience a growth resurgence in fall , and send new reserves to storage structures in preparation for winter .If you apply herbicides in fall , you can take advantage of this flow of reserves to the roots to help the herbicide reach these critical storage areas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "A survey of communication systems , particularly those with working frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 20 GHz , reveals that an urgent need exists for good quality , small , competitive and , more importantly , tunable resonant devices .Examples include UHF mobile radio systems ( toward the lower frequencies of this range ) and radar and satellite communications systems ( toward the higher frequencies ) .It is evident that the requirements of such a device depend on the type of application .For example , the important prerequisite for a cell site base station power combiner used in a radio mobile station is a high Q filter capable of handling power in the range of tens of watts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Except for tunability , most of these requirements are fulfilled by a resonant ceramic material known as a dielectric resonator ( DR ) .Although initially developed in 1939 , 1 these ceramics did not find applications in microwave circuits until the late 1960s 2,3 because of the uncontrolled temperature coefficient of the resonant frequency .The first application appeared in 1968 when the DR was used as a microwave filter element .Since then , utilization of DRs in both filters and oscillators has proliferated .Currently , DRs are considered one of the more important microwave devices .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The ceramics provide quality factors and temperature stability better than those of invar cavity resonators along with an integration capability approaching that of stripline resonators .DRs are also progressively replacing the large and costly metal cavity resonator in almost all applications .Commonly cylindrical in shape , DRs sustain the same electromagnetic field modes as those of a conventional metallic resonator cavity and behave in a similar way , except that the electromagnetic fields extend beyond the bulk of the device .4 For this reason , DRs are usually placed inside a metal shield to prevent external interactions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Most DRs implemented in microwave circuits ( such as filters and VCOs ) are tuned or adjusted mechanically .This tuning is achieved by perturbing the field distribution surrounding the DR through the movement of metallic or dielectric objects ( either manually or electrically ) by using , for example , a step motor .It is obvious that mechanical tuning involves mechanical parts in motion .Therefore , the process is slow and inaccurate and , hence , not highly reliable .Even if this approach is satisfactory in some cases , it is certainly not suitable for applications such as frequency hopping or frequency modulation where high tuning speed is needed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Consequently , the approach most commonly adopted relies on the electronic tuning afforded by coupling varactor diodes to the DR . .A DR can be tuned over an approximate 10 percent bandwidth by perturbing the resonator 's magnetic field .This tuning can be achieved by varying the air gap between the ceramic disc and metal enclosure with , for example , a movable metal plate or screw coaxial with the ceramic disc .The tuning mechanism involved here can be explained by the perturbational principle .6 Namely , when a metal wall of any resonant cavity is moved inward , the change in resonant frequency is proportional to the difference in stored magnetic and electric energies with the displaced volume .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In both cases , it is evident that the adjustment of the resonant frequency to a prescribed value is based on the perturbation of the fringing fields outside the resonator .For a particular mode , the tuning range is determined by the amount of this perturbation .For example , if the tuning mechanism increases the stored magnetic energy with respect to the electric energy , the resonant frequency will shift toward higher frequencies 4 with a deviation proportional to the energy difference .If the tuning mechanism decreases , the shift will be toward lower frequencies .Thus , a wide tuning bandwidth requires a strong perturbation , which may degrade the system quality drastically .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "DR frequency control may be accomplished either by solid - state devices such as varactors or PIN diodes , or low loss magnetic materials such as a single - crystal yttrium iron garnet sphere or disc ferrite .Disc ferrite materials are based on the control of the magnetic field and lead to a substantial tuning range of 250 MHz at 8 GHz while maintaining a high resonator unloaded Q ( greater than 1000 ) . 7However , like most of the mechanisms based on magnetic materials , methods utilizing ferrite materials usually require a large and cumbersome electromagnet for producing the controlling magnetic field .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The first method , shown in Figure 2 , involves placing the varactors on the mechanical tuning plate , which is located directly above the resonator .The principal advantage of this approach is that , in order to obtain an appreciable amount of electronic tuning , the varactors must be coupled tightly to the circuit by reducing the separation between the top of the resonator and the tuning plate .This configuration can seriously degrade the resonators ' unloaded Q factor .However , the technique has been used to produce 4 MHz of electronic tuning in a 14 GHz dielectric resonator oscillator ( DRO ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The varactor diode is placed inside the slot that has been cut out of the DR .The purpose of the metallized sides of the slot is to ensure that the perturbed field appears uniformly at the sides of the slot .This field then is displaced by the varactor or other conducting device across the slot .Variation of the slot capacitance perturbs the electromagnetic field associated with the DR and , hence , affects its resonant frequency .The configuration can provide a very large tuning bandwidth of approximately 150 MHz at 5 GHz with an insertion loss variation of only 2 dB.", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Optical tuning of microwave devices , in general , and DRs , in particular , is highly desirable mainly for its high tuning speed .Interest in such a tuning method was aroused by the advent of new electro - optic devices such as diode lasers and optic switches .A straightforward way to tune the DR optically is to sensitize it to light .This sensitization can be accomplished either by , for example , simply adding a photosensitive material on top of the DR or spattering a very thin layer of photoconductor materials .14 Hence , illumination of the photosensitive material produces a change in conductivity , which , in turn , perturbs the field around the DR and leads to a shift of the resonant frequency .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
