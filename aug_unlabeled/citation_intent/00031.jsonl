{"text": "Distributional Similarity for Chinese : Exploiting Characters and Radicals .Received 10 April 2012 ; Accepted 1 June 2012 .Academic Editor : Yuping Wang .Copyright \u00a9 2012 Peng Jin et al .This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original work is properly cited .Abstract .Distributional Similarity has attracted considerable attention in the field of natural language processing as an automatic means of countering the ubiquitous problem of sparse data .As a logographic language , Chinese words consist of characters and each of them is composed of one or more radicals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Likewise , radicals often make a predictable contribution to the meaning of a character : characters that have the same components tend to have similar or related meanings .In this paper , we utilize these properties of the Chinese language to improve Chinese word similarity computation .Given a content word , we first extract similar words based on a large corpus and a similarity score for ranking .This rank is then adjusted according to the characters and components shared between the similar word and the target word .Experiments on two gold standard datasets show that the adjusted rank is superior and closer to human judgments than the original rank .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Introduction .The computation of word similarity can make an important contribution to many language processing tasks and applications .Tasks include , for example , automatic creation of thesauruses [ 1 ] , smoothing of statistical language models [ 2 ] , and lexical expansion [ 3 ] .A recent more direct application has been for suggesting bid - terms for a commercial search engine [ 4 , 5 ] .There are two main ways to compute word similarity : corpus - based and WordNet - based [ 6 ] .The first way avoids the requirement of a manually constructed lexical resource .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The second method usually has better performance than the first one , but it requires a hand - crafted thesaurus and there will always be omissions in such a resource .Research is increasingly focusing on the former [ 7 ] or combining these two approaches [ 8 , 9 ] .There are few previous studies on Chinese word similarity .Liu and Li [ 10 ] report work based on a manually created ontology named HowNet [ 11 ] .Rather than listing a target word 's neighbors in order , they provide an interface to return the similarity score of any two terms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Chinese language has the feature that almost every individual Chinese character has some specific meaning .The meaning of a word is often highly related to the characters it is comprised of .Moreover , each Chinese character is composed of one or more components .Usually , one component ( the \" radical \" ) carries the meaning of a character to a certain degree and the other indicates the pronunciation .Characters sharing the same radicals have related or similar meanings .It is easy to decompose a word into characters and to decompose a character into components according to their forms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Many researchers have noted that Chinese characters carry information about word meaning .This information has been used for predicting the semantic class of unknown words .Lu [ 12 ] proposed three knowledge - based models , out of which combining a character - category association model and a rule - based model performed best .A corpus - based model did not improve performance .Tseng [ 13 ] used a morphological analyzer to tag the syntactic categories of characters in a target word .Hsieh [ 14 ] predicted the sense of unknown two - character words with the help of a character ontology that was created manually .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Veale and Chen [ 15 ] strived for valid decompositions of Chinese lexemes and divided them into three categories : metaphors , analogies , and blends .This information could be integrated into our method in further to improve the system 's performance .As far as radicals were concerned , Liu and Lin [ 16 ] used structural information to identify similar Chinese characters .Wang et al .[17 ] integrated radical features into an SVM - based tool for part of speech tagging .Their experiment results showed that the precision was improved from 84.32 % to 85.27 % for out - of - vocabulary words .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This paper is structured as follows .Section 2 describes a novel approach to rescoring the results from Lin 's [ 1 ] corpus - based measure of word similarity taking advantage of structural features of the Chinese language .Section 3 presents an experimental evaluation .Section 4 discusses the results .Section 5 concludes and proposes directions for future work .Methods .Word Similarity Computation .Lin [ 1 ] defined the similarity between two objects as \" the amount of information contained in the commonality between the objects divided by the amount of information in the descriptions of the objects .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the experiments , Lin used a broad - coverage parser to extract triples from 64-million word corpus consisting of the Wall Street Journal ( 24 million words ) , San Jose Mercury ( 21 million words ) , and AP Newswire ( 19 million words ) .Lin 's experimental results demonstrated that this method is better than other algorithms such as cosine and dice .It is widely used in the field of computational linguistics such as for word sense disambiguation [ 18 ] and semantic parsing [ 19 ] .Hierarchical Structure of a Chinese Word .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It should be noticed that all subwords are easily obtained by straightforward morphological analysis .The semantic radicals are usually used as the index for words in a Chinese dictionary , and the Chinese government has published a national standard [ 20 ] to associate each character to a specific radical .Most Chinese characters are composed of two radicals : one is the semantic radical , and the other is phonetic radical .Usually only the semantic radicals provide the important cue to measure the similarity for characters .Following Jin et al .[21 ] , and in contrast to Yencken and Baldwin [ 22 ] , in this paper we only use the semantic radical .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The rank induced by ( 2.1 ) is the baseline .We then adjust the similarity score according to characters and radicals shared between the two words , based on a decomposition as illustrated in Figure 1 , thus obtaining a reranking of the neighbors .In broad terms , our approach works as follows .Firstly , if a neighbor of the target word contains a character that is also in the target word , the neighbor 's score is increased .Secondly , for nonshared characters , if a radical of that character in a neighbor is the same as a radical of a character in the target , the neighbor 's score is increased .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are a number of ways in which the shared character and radical information can be used to adjust the distributional similarity score .The first approach we considered was to add constants that ensured shared characters were considered more important than shared radicals , which in turn were considered more strongly than the distributional similarity score .To do this we added a constant of10 for each shared character in the target word and putative neighbor .A constant of1 was applied for each shared radical because the original distributional similarity score is always below1 ( this constant was selected because no word is longer than 10 characters so it could never dominate the character - based weighting ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "In the alternative approach , we multiplicatively adjust the basic distributional similarity score according to the number of shared characters or radicals between the target word and neighbor whose similarity score we are adjusting .As ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) indicate , the original similarity score is multiplied by a parameter , to the power of the number of common characters : .We use held - out data from the CiLin evaluation described below to find optimal values for the parameters .In ( 2.3 ) , \u03b1 is set to 2.5 .To ( 2.4 ) , we first optimize \u03b7 and next optimize \u03bb , resulting in \u03b7 equals to 2.5 and \u03bb to 1.2 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "We develop a system to obtain the similar words from a large scale corpus based on the technique of Lin [ 1 ] .Then , given a target word , its neighbor words ( the 50 most similar ) are reranked by the method proposed in this paper .These ranks are evaluated on two gold standard datasets which are created by human .Corpus .The corpus we use in our experiments comes from the Chinese Gigaword Second Edition ( catalog number LDC2005T14 ) .In this , we only use the Xinhua newswire material because it is Mandarin Chinese News Text , while the rest is not .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This covers all news published by Xinhua News Agency ( the largest news agency in China ) from 1991 to 2004 .By analogy to Lin 's [ 1 ] work on English word similarity which starts with dependency parsing , we use the Chinese version of the Stanford Parser to extract dependency triples from the Xinhua newswire corpus .The Stanford Parser also assigns part - of - speech labels using the PoS inventory of Xia [ 23 ] , in which NN denotes noun , VV is verb , and VA is adjective .In total , there are nearly 850,000 word types in the corpus .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Weeds et al .[ 24 ] proposed that \" distributional similarity techniques have been shown to work well for words which occur more than 100 times in a given corpus . \" In fact , the threshold of 100 is adapted by many researchers [ 1 , 25 - 27 ] .So , we also set 100 in our experiments .Finally , there are 45,667 word types in our experiment .Among them , there are 30,778 nouns ; 13,164 verbs ; 1,725 adjectives .The Stanford Parser identifies 45 named grammatical relations ; a 46th relation dep ( dependent ) is the default when the parser fails to identify the relation type .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are in total 12,403,187 sentences after segmentation ; of these , 1.16 % sentences contain only one or two words and are removed before parsing .Since very long sentences can cause the parser to run out of memory or run slowly , we set the parameter \" maxLength \" to 300 bytes , so a further 6.3 % sentences are removed before parsing .Although we chose the \" factored parser \" ( xinhuaFactored.ser.gz ) , about 4.6 % of sentences still failed to be parsed .In the end , 10,899,022 sentences were parsed , accounting for 87.9 % of all 14 years of Xinhua newswire .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This list is a national standard published in 2009 [ 20 ] .Some radicals do not indicate the meaning of a character , so we filtered them out in our experiments .Evaluation on CiLin Extended Version .The original version of the CiLin thesaurus was published by Mei et al .[28 ] .In that version , there are four levels in the taxonomy structure .Levels 1 to 3 are taxonomic categories , while Level 4 contains sets of near - synonym terms .There are 53,859 head terms listed .The thesaurus was extended in 2005 by the Information Retrieval Lab of Harbin Institute of Technology [ 29 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The extended CiLin consists of 12 large classes , 97 medium classes , 1,400 small classes ( topics ) , and 17,817 small synonym sets which cover 77,343 head terms .In this extended version , there are five levels in the taxonomy structure .Levels 1 to 4 are taxonomic categories , and Level 5 consists of so - called atom nodes , which often contain a few words or only one word .To guarantee the quality of this thesaurus , all changes were done manually .In our experiments , we use the fourth level as the gold standard .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The INVR score is the sum of the inverse rank of each match .The ranking obtained using ( 2.1 ) serves as the baseline .We evaluate all nouns , verbs and adjectives whose frequency is greater than 100 .The results are shown in Table 1 . \"Lin \" denotes the system 's performance obtained by ( 2.1 ) ; \" Char \" is the score when character information is used ; \" Char / Rad \" is the performance integrating both character and radical information .-test at 95 % confidence ) .It is unsurprising that the integration of radicals and characters makes only modest improvements compared to the results with characters alone because radicals are only a component of characters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Evaluation on the Rank of Word Pairs .Aside from the thesaurus style gold standard , another type of gold standard also ranks word pairs according to their similarity score .Finkelstein et al .[ 31 ] provided two language resources for the English language , carrying out a psycholinguistic experiment to create this dataset .First , they selected 353 word pairs .All the 30 noun pairs from Miller and Charles [ 32 ] were included in this set .Then , they asked a number of native speakers to assign a numerical similarity score between 0 and 10 ( 0 indicates that these two words are totally unrelated , 10 is very closely related ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "During the assignment , an annotator could look in a dictionary when he did not know the meaning of a particular word .But , he was required not to consult other people .Each word pair 's similarity score was the mean of all annotators .Finally , the word pairs were ranked by their similarity scores .Following Finkelstein et al .[ 31 ] , we created a new dataset for the Chinese language ( This has been released as benchmark data by SemEval-2012 task 4 .We first translate all word pairs from Finkelstein et al .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "If their translations are the same , this word pair is retained otherwise it is removed .( There are in fact 169 pairs completely same in literal .In the end , only five word pairs were discarded due to having different translations , and one pair was also removed because there were two identical word pairs .The remaining 347 word pairs are annotated by 12 undergraduates .The annotators are all native speakers and their major is linguistics .Each annotator annotated the whole set .In the SemEval-2012 campaign , 50 word pairs were used as trial data .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The Kendall 's tau [ 33 ] is used as the evaluation metric .Given a rank , if its tau value is higher , it is closer to the gold standard rank .In this experiment , we used the human annotated rank as a gold standard .The rank according to ( 2.4 ) obtained 0.023 .While the tau values are not large and the difference is not significant , the reranking by our proposed method clearly moves the similarity calculations towards the human judgments which is encouraging .This result shows that the latter is closer to the gold standard than the original rank .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The rank is obtained according to the word pairs ' similarity score returned by the system which is developed by themselves with the default setting of parameters .The Kendall 's tau of this system is 0.075 , so it is better than our system .This could be expected because they used a thesaurus which was created manually by linguistic experts .These results highlight the need for more research to handle word similarity computation for low - frequency words and a better way of estimating similarity ( dissimilarity ) for distant words .Discussion .Subword - Related Errors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "There are in total 397 nouns , 208 , verbs , and 32 adjectives whose performance goes down .We have conducted an error analysis to investigate the causes .Firstly , some words ' meanings are not related to the characters that compose the word .Nearly all the transliteration words ' meaning have nothing to do with the characters they are composed of .The widespread usage of metaphor decreases the performance when using subword information .The metaphorical mapping based on empirical basis and reason will move some words ' meaning far from their original meaning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Secondly , performance could suffer from the ambiguity of characters and radicals .Similar issues apply to radicals .But in our study this difference is neglected ; making allowances for such differences should also lead to improved performance .Although these factors are not problematic on the whole , because unrelated words do not tend to have high distributional similarity scores , there are cases where these factors result in incorrect rerankings .The Performance on Different Word Frequencies .Weeds and Weir [ 26 ] demonstrated that word frequency can influence word similarity computation .We therefore selected out target terms according to their frequency , in increments of powers of 10 : 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , respectively ( illustrated by Figures 2 and 3 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Our method works well both on high - frequency and low - frequency words when using the fourth level of CiLin Extended as the gold standard .For these experiments , we focused on nouns and verbs as there were more of these compared to adjectives ( see Figures 2 and 3 ) .It should be noted that for verbs , the line climbs as frequency increases .However , the line for nouns climbs at the beginning but at \" 3 \" begins to drop .We intend to investigate this effect further in future work .We note that gains over the baseline for low frequency words are larger than for high - frequency words .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Conclusion .We have described a conceptually simple but effective way to improve the computation of Chinese word similarity .The method leverages the hierarchical nature of the Chinese language : the meaning of a word is partly related to the characters it contains .Furthermore , radicals provide clues to the meaning of characters .Evaluated on two gold standard datasets , our method outperforms the state - of - the - art algorithm .We demonstrate that the effectiveness of our method spans different parts of speech ( noun , verb , and adjective ) and word frequencies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Conversely , some distinct characters contribute similar meanings , so should be taken account of in the similarity scoring .The work of Yencken and Baldwin [ 34 ] could be extended to Chinese to capture similarities between pairs of characters .Our measure does not take the length of words into consideration .Shorter words will have fewer characters and therefore perhaps be ranked lower than they should .We need to investigate this in future work .Acknowledgment .This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( no .61003206 , 60703063 , and 61103089 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Word learning also provides clear examples of the multiple forms of knowledge that are critical for successful performance .Word representations are jointly perceptual ( in systems involved in recognizing words ) , procedural ( in motor systems for producing words ) and semantic ( in systems representing word meaning ) .Representations in each of these linked systems must be robust and able to generalize from individual experiences to novel input .For instance , we must recognize familiar words spoken by unfamiliar voices or establish the meaning of familiar words in unfamiliar contexts .These properties are ably demonstrated by neural network models ( e.g. Gaskell & Marslen - Wilson 1997 ) that are subject to computational limitations typical of systems trained with distributed learning algorithms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The Zhang approach , which depends only on the children of a given term , often fails to effectively differentiate a child from its parents , yielding an equal . value and IC for these terms .It also tends to produce a uniform semantic similarity between a parent and its children ( see Table 2 in Section 2 ) , which is overestimated to 1 when using Lin 's approach , whereas these GO terms are biologically and topologically different .This means that the approach ignores the fact that a child is more specific than the parent by assigning them the same semantic value and consequently the approach fails to distinguish proteins annotated by these terms , which leads to an overestimation of functional similarity between these proteins .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These observations suggest that a given similarity approach relying on the intrinsic topology of the hierarchical structure should consider both GO term parents and children in its conception .Performance Evaluation of the GO - Universal Metric .We first evaluated the performance of the new metric by assessing its ability to capture functional coherence in a human protein - protein interaction network in terms of how interacting proteins are functionally related to each other .These networks were integrated into a single network where we only considered interactions predicted by at least two different approaches to alleviate the issue of false positives , as a specific approach may incorrectly identify an interaction [ 47 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "For our performance evaluation , we only used proteins annotated with BP terms in the network produced .This is because two proteins that interact physically are more likely to be involved in similar biological processes [ 40 ] but there is no guarantee that they share molecular functions [ 48 ] .Among 25831 proteins found in the complete list of reviewed proteins in human , 10620 proteins are annotated with GO BP terms .This was used as a positive control set .Lack of complete knowledge about protein interaction sets makes the generation of a negative control set challenging , since the fact that two proteins are not known to interact may simply be because this interaction has not yet been detected [ 47 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Thus , negative datasets with equal numbers of protein pairs as in the positive interaction dataset were built by randomly choosing annotated human protein pairs in the proteome .In our context , this is relevant as the probability of randomly selecting a true protein - protein interaction is very low ( less than 0.052 % ) .The classification power of the new metric was tested by receiver operator characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis [ 51 ] which measures the true positive rate or sensitivity against the false positive rate or 1-specificity .The best match average version of the new metric is compared to the best match average under the Lin measure and that using the Resnik measure which has been shown to perform better than others [ 52 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The SimUI approach refers to the union - intersection protein similarity measure , which is also implemented in the GOstats package [ 24 ] .It is a particular case of simGIC or SimUIC which assumes that all GO terms occur at equal frequency , in which case , only the topology of the GO - DAG is needed .This implies that the SimUI approach assigns equal semantic value or information content to all terms in the GO - DAG .The area under the ROC curve ( AUC ) is used as a measure of discriminative power , the larger the upper AUC value , the more powerful the measure is , and a realistic classifier must have an AUC larger than 0.5 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "These results indicate that all the approaches perform well .When considering protein functional similarity approaches derived from GO term semantic similarity scores ( first three rows of Table 3 ) , the new approach outperforms the best annotation - based approach , namely , BMA under Resnik , particularly in precision , and accuracy .This also shows that the new metric is less sensitive to outliers compared to annotation - based approaches , on top of the fact that it only uses the intrinsic topology ( structure ) of the GO - DAG without requiring annotation data .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Note that the performance of Resnik and SimGIC approaches is related to the corpus under consideration because of its dependence on the frequencies of GO term occurrences in the corpus .This shallow annotation problem constitutes a serious drawback to these approaches , specifically for organisms with sparse GO annotations [ 55 ] and may negatively affect their performances [ 52 ] .The use of the whole set of annotations may solve this problem but could , in turn , increase the complexity of these annotation - based approaches as the number of protein annotations increases daily .This would potentially hamper the performance of these approaches in their running time , since reading the annotation file takes time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This means that these measures may produce biases which affect protein functional similarity scores .Furthermore , we investigate if the performance can be improved by leaving out GO annotations with IEA evidence codes .Interestingly , no significant improvement is achieved when leaving out GO annotations with IEA evidence code suggesting that these IEA annotations are in fact of high quality [ 33 , 56 ] .This also justifies observations made by Guzzi et al .[52 ] concerning the use of all types of GO evidence codes when assessing a given GO - based semantic similarity approach .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "The tasks in this area have many potential applications , such as information extraction , question answering , document summarization , machine translation , construction of thesauri and semantic networks , language modeling , paraphrasing , and recognizing textual entailment .In each of these potential applications , the contribution of the types of semantic analysis constitutes the most outstanding research issue .Tasks in Semantic Evaluation .The major tasks in semantic evaluation include : .Word sense disambiguation : WSD , lexical sample and all - words , the process of identifying which sense of a word ( i.e. meaning ) is used in a sentence , when the word has multiple meanings ( polysemy ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The former comprises disambiguating the occurrences of a small sample of target words which were previously selected , while in the latter all the words in a piece of running text need to be disambiguated .Tasks have been performed for many languages .Tasks have covered disambiguation of nouns , verbs , adjectives , and prepositions .A new task is evaluating phrasal semantics ( compositionality and semantic similarity of phrases ) .Multi - lingual or cross - lingual word - sense disambiguation : word senses are defined according to translation distinctions , e.g. , a polysemous word in Japanese is translated differently in a given context .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A related task is cross - language information retrieval , where participants disambiguate in one language ( e.g. , with WordNet synsets ) and retrieve documents in another language ; standard information retrieval metrics are use to assess the quality of the disambiguation .New tasks include cross - lingual content - based recommendation ( where user profiles are built to recommend items of interest in another language ) , examining semantic textual similarity with a view toward evaluating modular semantic components , and linking noun phrases across Wikipedia articles in different languages .Word - sense induction : comparison of sense - induction and discrimination systems .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "New tasks are to provide an evaluation framework for web search result clustering , induction for graded or non - graded senses , and tags used in folksonomies .Lexical substitution or simplification : find an alternative substitute word or phrase for a target word in context .The task involves both finding the synonyms and disambiguating the context .It allows the use of any kind of lexical resource or technique , including word sense disambiguation and word sense induction .A cross - lingual task was also defined .This topic also includes textual entailment and paraphrasing tasks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A lexical sample tagged with English WordNet senses was used for evaluation .Subcategorization acquistion : semantically similar verbs are similar in terms of subcategorization frames .The task is to use any available method for disambiguating verb senses , so that the results can then be fed into automatic methods used for acquiring subcategorization frames , with the hypothesis that the disambiguation will cluster the instances .Semantic role labeling : identifying and labeling constituents of sentences with their semantic roles .The basic task began with attempts to replicate FrameNet data , specifically frame elements .This task has expanded to inferring and developing new frames and frame elements , in individual sentences and in full running texts , with identification of intersentential links and coreference chains .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Semantic relation identification : examining relations between lexical items in a sentence .The task , given a sample of semantic relation types , is to identify and classify semantic relations between nominals ( i.e. , nouns and base noun phrases , excluding named entities ) ; a main purpose of this task is to assess different classification methods .Another task is , given a sentence and two tagged nominals , to predict the relation between those nominals and the direction of the relation .New tasks seek to measure the relational similarity between pairs of words , to extract drug - drug interactions from biomedical texts , and to develop methods in causal reasoning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "A second task is to identify when the arguments of a specified predicate does not satisfy selectional restrictions , and if not , to identify both the type mismatch and the type shift ( coercion ) .Temporal information processing : the temporal location and order of events in newspaper articles , narratives , and similar texts .The task is to identify the events described in a text and locate these in time , i.e. , identification of temporal referring expressions , events and temporal relations within a text .Coreference resolution : detection and resolution of coreferences .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Sentiment analysis : emotion annotation , polarity orientation labeling .The task is to classify the titles of newspaper articles with the appropriate emotion label and/or with a valence indication ( positive / negative ) , given a set of predefined six emotion labels ( i.e. , Anger , Disgust , Fear , Joy , Sadness , Surprise ) .A new task is to examine polarity in Twitter .This list is expected to grow as the field progresses .Some tasks are closely related to each other .For instance , word sense disambiguation ( monolingual , multi - lingual and cross - lingual ) , word sense induction task , lexical substitution , subcategorization acquisition and evaluation of lexical resources are all related to word senses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
