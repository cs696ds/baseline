{"text": "For example , the pairs aphasia / metabolism and hand / surgery are allowable , but hand / metabolism is not .The steady increase of publications to be indexed in MEDLINE ( about 2,500 per day ) has led to the development of automatic tools such as the Medical Text Indexer ( MTI ) [ 1 ] intended to assist NLM indexers with indexing recommendations .The complexity of the indexing task and the increasing amount of data to be processed make it necessary to improve existing tools .For automatic indexing in particular , the attachment of subheadings to the main heading recommendations produced automatically is a significant help to indexers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "Most ILP algorithms deal with rule inference within a hypothesis space ( ) as illustrated by Figure 1 ; the ILP tool that we used for our experiments , ALEPH [ 13 ] , is based on this very algorithm .The method of exploring the hypothesis space while constructing clauses is key for the inference phase ( see last sub - section of this section ) .Description of examples .In our context , ILP is used to infer rules describing the attachment of MeSH subheadings based on sample MEDLINE citations containing sets of MeSH indexing terms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It may be argued that this problem can be addressed by a less complex method than ILP , such as association rules discovery [ 14 ] .However , methods for association rules discovery such as APRIORI would require describing each example as a tuple comprising the relevant main heading ( that to which the subheading of interest may be attached ) and the other main headings occurring in the citation .Basically , this would result in a tuple of dimension 24,000 + \u00d7 24,000 + .Even less complex representations fail to account for the fact that a different number of main headings may be assigned to each citation and for the hierarchical structure of MeSH [ 8 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The expressiveness of Prolog allows for a simple description of relational problems .Let us consider the sample citation shown in Table 1 .Occurrences of main headings to which the focus subheading is attached constitute positive examples .For example , let us take pharmacology as our focus subheading ; according to the citation shown in Table 1 the following example E + will be constructed to indicate that pharmacology was attached to Acrylamide : qualif(mh16179550_1,\"pharmacology \" ) .Occurrences of main headings to which the focus subheading is not attached , although it is allowable for this main heading ( such as Astrocytes in our sample citation ) , constitute negative examples .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "However it should be no less problematic in theory to use MeSH terms than other indexing terms such as JCR subject categories which have previously been used successfully in bibliometric analysis [ 45 ] .MeSH terms are much more detailed than JCR subjects categories and possess inherent hierarchical relationships which may glean additional insight .From a MeSH perspective , medical informatics could be described as a set of largely mutually exclusive tools or concepts which are most frequently applied to address problems in specific applied domains and in non medical informatics contexts .Medical Informatics as a Mature Discipline .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "However , it is more likely the conventional or common consensus list of ' medical informatics journals ' is outdated .Medical engineering , physics , optics , and imaging journals consistently publish large numbers of articles which are indexed as MI - MeSH , yet these journals are not generally identified as ' medical informatics ' by the medical informatics field as JCR MI groupings .Limitations .We acknowledge the following limitations : Our search strategy only employed the \" Medical Informatics \" MeSH term and its descendents in the MeSH hierarchy .We did not attempt to answer which articles are ' truly ' medical informatics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There has been a steady growing presence of medical informatics articles and journals in the published literature discipline over time .Impact factors patterns may also reflect the increasing visibility , breath and attention to this rapidly evolving field .However , impact factors likely have limitations as well , such as the effect of biases and quality misconceptions .For example , not all articles in a high impact factor journal have equivalent quality and certain types .Results of our study note the specific journals of publication of medical informatics research and complementary disciplines , including core medical informatics journals and journals which may be lesser known .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}

{"text": "There have been previously reported higher yields using C - value and termhood scores [ 18 , 19 ] .The yield , however , is sensitive to the data and task involved in each study .Spasic et al used C - value to extract terms from full - text journal articles with a reported yield of 61 % .However , they targeted all valid terms instead of new terms ( ie , terms not yet included in a vocabulary ) , which are fewer and harder to find .In our own previous study to identify new CHV terms , both termhood score and C - value score were used .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The data set used in that study was the query log to MEDLINEPlus .Compared with query logs , PatientsLikeMe pages contain more \" noise \" ( ie , terms that are similar in structure to those we seek but are not health - related ) , which increases the number of candidate terms found .We chose not to use only either C - value or termhood scores alone on these data because the results produced were much lower than the 31 % we report here .Implications for the System .The results of this study point to the necessity of using both the termhood and C - value methods .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This could be problematic , as consumer terms may not occur in physicians ' notes .Evidence for their absence is the drop in valid terms after VA medical record term filtering from 651 to 215 .C - value balances termhood by not requiring prefiltering .However , for C - value to generate a concise list , too many valid terms are excluded , only 62 out of 651 .An implication of this study specific to this type of system is the choice of threshold .We found empirically that a threshold of 3.6 for the termhood score and a threshold of 15 for the C - value score produced a list that retained enough valid terms while excluding enough invalid terms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Looking at Figure 1 , it can be seen that a termhood threshold of 4 produces a candidate term list which is 95 % valid terms .Unfortunately , the total number of valid terms found would be only 42 out of a possible 651 .We consider identifying only 6 % of the available terms too inefficient .Increasing the C - value threshold produces a similar result .While the valid term yield increases to 78 % , only 44 valid terms are identified .It is possible that these thresholds could be increased and the number of valid terms missed could be mitigated by processing an extremely large number of webpages .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "This system could potentially be used for vocabulary maintenance beyond CHV and even beyond the health domain .Since an increasingly large proportion of contemporary writing is published on the Internet , it is possible to crawl open - access journals , blogs , and Web news channels to identify new candidate terms for inclusion in a variety of vocabularies .This system could also potentially be used to track the evolution of lay health language .Once the system is up - to - date , each new set of updates will be representative of the changes occurring in consumer terminology .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Limitations .A potential limitation of using the PatientsLikeMe website is the \" higher level \" language that occurs in the content produced by the site operators as opposed to the users .Higher level refers to language that is drawn directly from physicians ' vocabulary .In this case , it is likely that the term will be contained in the UMLS Metathesaurus and thus ignored in the collection of new terms .Additionally , this broader exposure to higher level language may cause increased migration of terms .The migration of such terms would be reflected in the frequency - of - use data that are used to recommend the name preferred for use in reference to the concept ( the consumer preferred CHV name ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The CAU system is limited by errors in the parsing and filtering stages .Although part of speech and noun phrase parsing are relatively mature NLP technologies [ 27 ] , the parsing of webpages poses extra challenges due to the prevalence of incomplete and ungrammatical sentences .The parser used in the HITEx system , OpenNLP , is trained to work with general text .HITEx was developed for the processing of clinical notes , which may be more grammatical or adhere to a different subgrammar .The continuing development of the HITEx NER system incorporated into the CAU will allow it to take advantage of any advances in the parser or mapper associated with HITEx .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "The database could be enlarged with proper institutional review board approval .The use of C - value with the unfiltered terms also decreases the effect of this limitation .The two ATR methods [ 18 , 19 ] are also imperfect .Their performance could be improved by preselecting the text to the extent it is practical in the social network setting .There may be a way to target specific locations in the website or on the webpages , perhaps by searching for key section headings or HTML tags .Another limitation of the CAU system is the continuing need for human review .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "Our current development is far from reaching the goal of zero human review but not from the goal of minimizing reviewer time .The results of this method on corpora other than PatientsLikeMe require further studies .We found 309 potential terms with 72 terms valid for inclusion in the CHV , that is , a 23 % valid term yield .However , as previously discussed , the thresholds we chose impacted the yield .Future Research .One direction of our future efforts will be to further analyze the terms found and either map them to existing concepts or create new ones .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
{"text": "It is therefore necessary to determine how to integrate them into the CHV .Since the majority of these new terms are synonyms of health concepts that already exist in the professional controlled vocabularies , it is a simple mapping to include them .However , some brand new concepts may be encountered , in which case we will utilize the characteristics of valid new consumer concepts described by Keselman et al [ 28 ] to help guide their inclusion .In the future , we also plan to explore public participation in the collaborative review phase .In addition to discovering new terms , we plan to use live corpora to estimate the familiarity of health terms and harvest explanations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}}
