Abstract . Manual lexicography has produced extraordinary results for Greek and Latin , but it can not in the immediate future provide for all texts the same level of coverage available for the most heavily studied materials . As we build a cyberinfrastructure for Classics in the future , we must explore the role that automatic methods can play within it . Great advances have been made in the sciences on which lexicography depends . Minute research in manuscript authorities has largely restored the texts of the classical writers , and even their orthography . Philology has traced the growth and history of thousands of words , and revealed meanings and shades of meaning which were long unknown . Syntax has been subjected to a profounder analysis . The history of ancient nations , the private life of the citizens , the thoughts and beliefs of their writers have been closely scrutinized in the light of accumulating information . Thus the student of to - day may justly demand of his Dictionary far more than the scholarship of thirty years ago could furnish . ( Advertisement for the Lewis & Short Latin Dictionary , March 1 , 1879 . ) The \\\" scholarship of thirty years ago \\\" that Lewis and Short here distance themselves from is Andrews ' 1850 Latin - English lexicon , itself largely a translation of Freund 's German W\\u00f6rterbuch published only a decade before . Founded on the same lexicographic principles that produced the juggernaut Oxford English Dictionary , the OLD is a testament to the extraordinary results that rigorous manual labor can provide . It has , along with the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae , provided extremely thorough coverage for the texts of the Golden and Silver Age in Latin literature and has driven modern scholarship for the past thirty years . Digital methods also let us deal well with scale . For instance , while the OLD focused on a canon of Classical authors that ends around the second century CE , Latin continued to be a productive language for the ensuing two millennia , with prolific writers in the Middle Ages , Renaissance and beyond . The Index Thomisticus [ Busa 1974 - 1980 ] alone contains 10.6 million words attributed to Thomas Aquinas and related authors , which is by itself larger than the entire corpus of extant classical Latin . In deciding how we want to design a cyberinfrastructure for Classics over the next ten years , there is an important question that lurks between \\\" where are we now ? \\\" and \\\" where do we want to be ? \\\" : where are our colleagues already ? Many of the tools we would want in the future are founded on technologies that already exist for English and other languages ; our task in designing a cyberinfrastructure may simply be to transfer and customize them for Classical Studies . Classics has arguably the most well - curated collection of texts in the world , and the uses its scholars demand from that collection are unique . In the following I will document the technologies available to us in creating a new kind of reference work for the future - one that complements the traditional lexicography exemplified by the OLD and the TLL and lets scholars interact with their texts in new and exciting ways . Where are we now ? In the past thirty years , computers have allowed this process to be significantly expedited , even in such simple ways as textual searching . This approach has been exploited most recently by the Greek Lexicon Project [ 2 ] at the University of Cambridge , which has been developing a New Greek Lexicon since 1998 using a large database of electronically compiled slips ( with a target completion date of 2010 ) . Here the act of lexicography is still very manual , as each dictionary sense is still heavily curated , but the tedious job of citation collection is not . We can contrast this computer - assisted lexicography with a new variety - which we might more properly call \\\" computational lexicography \\\" - that has emerged with the COBUILD project [ Sinclair 1987 ] of the late 1980s . This corpus evidence allows lexicographers to include frequency information as part of a word 's entry ( helping learners concentrate on common words ) and also to include sentences from the corpus that demonstrate a word 's common collocations - the words and phrases that it frequently appears with . By keeping the underlying corpus up to date , the editors are also able to add new headwords as they appear in the language , and common multi - word expressions and idioms ( such as bear fruit ) can also be uncovered as well . This corpus - based approach has since been augmented in two dimensions . [ 4 ] At the same time , researchers are also subjecting their corpora to more complex automatic processes to extract more knowledge from them . While word frequency and collocation analysis is fundamentally a task of simple counting , projects such as Kilgarriff 's Sketch Engine [ Kilgarriff et al . 2004 ] also enable lexicographers to induce information about a word 's grammatical behavior as well . In their ability to include statistical information about a word 's actual use , these contemporary projects are exploiting advances in computational linguistics that have been made over the past thirty years . Before turning , however , to how we can adapt these technologies in the creation of a new and complementary reference work , we must first address the use of such lexica . Like the OED , Classical lexica generally include a list of citations under each headword , providing testimony by real authors for each sense . Of necessity , these citations are usually only exemplary selections , though the TLL provides comprehensive listings by Classical authors for many of its lemmata . These citations essentially function as an index into the textual collection . If I am interested in the places in Classical literature where the verb libero means to acquit , I can consult the OLD and then turn to the source texts it cites : Cic . Ver . 1.72 , Plin . Nat . 6.90 , etc . For a more comprehensive ( but not exhaustive ) comparison , I can consult the TLL . This is what we might consider a manual form of \\\" lemmatized searching . \\\" The search results are thus significantly diluted by a large number of false positives . The advantage of the Perseus and TLG lemmatized search is that it gives scholars the opportunity to find all the instances of a given word form or lemma in the textual collections they each contain . The TLL , however , is impeccable in precision , while the Perseus and TLG results are dirty . What we need is a resource to combine the best of both . Where do we want to be ? The OLD and TLL are not likely to become obsolete anytime soon ; as the products of highly skilled editors and over a century of labor , the sense distinctions within them are highly precise and well substantiated . Heavily curated reference works provide great detail for a small set of texts ; our complement is to provide lesser detail for all texts . In order to accomplish this , we need to consider the role that automatic methods can play within our emerging cyberinfrastructure . [ 7 ] We need to provide traditional scholars with the apparatus necessary to facilitate their own textual research . This will be true of a cyberinfrastructure for any historical culture , and for any future structure that develops for modern scholarly corpora as well . We therefore must concentrate on two problems . First , how much can we automatically learn from a large textual collection using machine learning techniques that thrive on large corpora ? And second , how can the vast labor already invested in handcrafted lexica help those techniques to learn ? What we can learn from such a corpus is actually quite significant . With clustering techniques , we can establish the semantic similarity between two words based on their appearance in similar contexts . In creating a lexicon with these features , we are exploring two strengths of automated methods : they can analyze not only very large bodies of data but also provide customized analysis for particular texts or collections . We can thus not only identify patterns in one hundred and fifty million words of later Latin but also compare which senses of which words appear in the one hundred and fifty thousand words of Thucydides . Figure 1 presents a mock - up of what a dictionary entry could look like in such a dynamic reference work . The first section ( \\\" Translation equivalents \\\" ) presents items 1 and 2 from the list , and is reminiscent of traditional lexica for classical languages : a list of possible definitions is provided along with examples of use . The main difference between a dynamic lexicon and those print lexica , however , lies in the scope of the examples : while print lexica select one or several highly illustrative examples of usage from a source text , we are in a position to present far more . How do we get there ? We have already begun work on a dynamic lexicon like that shown in Figure 1 [ Bamman and Crane 2008 ] . Our approach is to use already established methods in natural language processing ; as such , our methodology involves the application of three core technologies : . identifying word senses from parallel texts ; . locating the correct sense for a word using contextual information ; and . Each of these technologies has a long history of development both within the Perseus Project and in the natural language processing community at large . In the following I will detail how we can leverage them all to uncover large - scale usage patterns in a text . Word Sense Induction . So , for example , the Greek word arch\\u00ea may be translated in one context as beginning and in another as empire , corresponding respectively to LSJ definitions I.1 and II.2 . Finding all of the translation equivalents for any given word then becomes a task of aligning the source text with its translations , at the level of individual words . The Perseus Digital Library contains at least one English translation for most of its Latin and Greek prose and poetry source texts . Many of these translations are encoded under the same canonical citation scheme as their source , but must further be aligned at the sentence and word level before individual word translation probabilities can be calculated . The workflow for this process is shown in Figure 2 . Since the XML files of both the source text and its translations are marked up with the same reference points , \\\" chapter 1 , section 1 \\\" of Tacitus ' Annales is automatically aligned with its English translation ( step 1 ) . This results ( for Latin at least ) in aligned chunks of text that are 217 words long . In step 3 , we then align these 1 - 1 sentences using GIZA++ [ Och and Ney 2003 ] . This word alignment is performed in both directions in order to discover multi - word expressions ( MWEs ) in the source language . Figure 3 shows the result of this word alignment ( here with English as the source language ) . The original , pre - lemmatized Latin is salvum tu me esse cupisti ( Cicero , Pro Plancio , chapter 33 ) . The original English is you wished me to be safe . As a result of the lemmatization process , many source words are mapped to multiple words in the target - most often to lemmas which share a common inflection . For instance , during lemmatization , the Latin word esse is replaced with the two lemmas from which it can be derived - sum1 ( to be ) and edo1 ( to eat ) . If the word alignment process maps the source word be to both of these lemmas in a given sentence ( as in Figure 3 ) , the translation probability is divided evenly between them . The weighted list of translation equivalents we identify using this technique can provide the foundation for our further lexical work . In the example above , we have induced from our collection of parallel texts that the headword oratio is primarily used with two senses : speech and prayer . Our approach , however , does have two clear advantages which complement those of traditional lexica : first , this method allows us to include statistics about actual word usage in the corpus we derive it from . And since we can run our word alignment at any time , we are always in a position to update the lexicon with the addition of new texts . Second , our word alignment also maps multi - word expressions , so we can include significant collocations in our lexicon as well . This allows us to provide translation equivalents for idioms and common phrases such as res publica ( republic ) or gratias ago ( to give thanks ) . Corpus methods ( especially supervised methods ) generally perform best in the SENSEVAL competitions - at SENSEVAL-3 , the best system achieved an accuracy of 72.9 % in the English lexical sample task and 65.1 % in the English all - words task . [ 8 ] Manually annotated corpora , however , are generally cost - prohibitive to create , and this is especially exacerbated with sense - tagged corpora , for which the human inter - annotator agreement is often low . Since the Perseus Digital Library contains two large monolingual corpora ( the canon of Greek and Latin classical texts ) and sizable parallel corpora as well , we have investigated using parallel texts for word sense disambiguation . This method uses the same techniques we used to create a sense inventory to disambiguate words in context . After we have a list of possible translation equivalents for a word , we can use the surrounding Latin or Greek context as an indicator for which sense is meant in texts where we have no corresponding translation . There are several techniques available for deciding which sense is most appropriate given the context , and several different measures for what definition of \\\" context \\\" is most appropriate itself . One technique that we have experimented with is a naive Bayesian classifier ( following Gale et al . 1992 ) , with context defined as a sentence - level bag of words ( all of the words in the sentence containing the word to be disambiguated contribute equally to its disambiguation ) . Bayesian classification is most commonly found in spam filtering . By counting each word and the class ( spam / not spam ) it appears in , we can assign it a probability that it falls into one class or the other . We can also use this principle to disambiguate word senses by building a classifier for every sense and training it on sentences where we do know the correct sense for a word . Just as a spam filter is trained by a user explicitly labeling a message as spam , this classifier can be trained simply by the presence of an aligned translation . For instance , the Latin word spiritus has several senses , including spirit and wind . In our texts , when spiritus is translated as wind , it is accompanied by words like mons ( mountain ) , ala ( wing ) or ventus ( wind ) . When it is translated as spirit , its context has ( more naturally ) a religious tone , including words such as sanctus ( holy ) and omnipotens ( all - powerful ) . If we are confronted with an instance of spiritus in a sentence for which we have no translation , we can disambiguate it as either spirit or wind by looking at its context in the original Latin . Word sense disambiguation will be most helpful for the construction of a lexicon when we are attempting to determine the sense for words in context for the large body of later Latin literature for which there exists no English translation . This will enable us to include these later texts in our statistics on a word 's usage , and link these passages to the definition as well . Parsing . Two of the features we would like to incorporate into a dynamic lexicon are based on a word 's role in syntax : subcategorization and selectional preference . A verb 's subcategorization frame is the set of possible combinations of surface syntactic arguments it can appear with . In a labeled dependency grammar , we can express a verb 's subcategorization as a combination of syntactic roles ( e.g. , OBJ OBJ ) . A predicate 's selectional preference specifies the type of argument it generally appears with . The verb to eat , for example , typically requires its object to be a thing that can be eaten and its subject to have animacy , unless used metaphorically . Selectional preference , however , can also be much more detailed , reflecting not only a word class ( such as animate or human ) , but also individual words themselves . [ 9 ] These are syntactic qualities since each of these arguments bears a direct syntactic relation to their head as much as they hold a semantic place within the underlying argument structure . In order to extract this kind of subcategorization and selectional information from unstructured text , we first need to impose syntactic order on it . A second , more practical option is to assign syntactic structure to a sentence using automatic methods . Automatic parsing generally requires the presence of a treebank - a large collection of manually annotated sentences - and a treebank 's size directly correlates with parsing accuracy : the larger the treebank , the better the automatic analysis . We are currently in the process of creating a treebank for Latin , and have just begun work on a one - million - word treebank of Ancient Greek . Now in version 1.5 , the Latin Dependency Treebank [ 10 ] is composed of excerpts from eight texts , including Caesar , Cicero , Jerome , Ovid , Petronius , Propertius , Sallust and Vergil . Based predominantly on the guidelines used for the Prague Dependency Treebank , our annotation style is also influenced by the Latin grammar of Pinkster ( 1990 ) , and is founded on the principles of dependency grammar [ Mel'\\u010duk 1988 ] . Dependency grammars differ from phrase - structure grammars in that they forego non - terminal phrasal categories and link words themselves to their immediate heads . This is an especially appropriate manner of representation for languages with a free word order ( such as Latin and Czech ) , where the linear order of constituents is broken up with elements of other constituents . A dependency grammar representation , for example , of ista meam norit gloria canitiem Propertius I.8.46 - \\\" that glory would know my old age \\\" - would look like the following : . While this treebank is still in its infancy , we can still use it to train a parser to parse the volumes of unstructured Latin in our collection . Our treebank is still too small to achieve state - of - the - art results in parsing but we can still induce valuable lexical information from its output by using a large corpus and simple hypothesis testing techniques to outweigh the noise of the occasional error [ Bamman and Crane 2008 ] . The key to improving this parsing accuracy is to increase the size of the annotated treebank : the better the parser , the more accurate the syntactic information we can extract from our corpus . Beyond the lexicon . These technologies , borrowed from computational linguistics , will give us the grounding to create a new kind of lexicon , one that presents information about a word 's actual usage . This lexicon resembles its more traditional print counterparts in that it is a work designed to be browsed : one looks up an individual headword and then reads its lexical entry . The technologies that will build this reference work , however , do so by processing a large Greek and Latin textual corpus . The results of this automatic processing go far beyond the construction of a single lexicon . I noted earlier that all scholarly dictionaries include a list of citations illustrating a word 's exemplary use . As Figure 1 shows , each entry in this new , dynamic lexicon ultimately ends with a list of canonical citations to fixed passages in the text . Searching by word sense . The ability to search a Latin or Greek text by an English translation equivalent is a close approximation to real cross - language information retrieval . By searching for word sense , however , a scholar can simply search for slave and automatically be presented with all of the passages for which this translation equivalent applies . Figure 7 presents a mock - up of what such a service could look like . Searching by word sense also allows us to investigate problems of changing orthography - both across authors and time : as Latin passes through the Middle Ages , for instance , the spelling of words changes dramatically even while meaning remains the same . So , for example , the diphthong ae is often reduced to e , and prevocalic ti is changed to ci . Even within a given time frame , spelling can vary , especially from poetry to prose . By allowing users to search for a sense rather than a specific word form , we can return all passages containing saeculum , saeclum , seculum and seclum - all valid forms for era . Additionally , we can automate this process to discover common words with multiple orthographic variations , and include these in our dynamic lexicon as well . Searching by selectional preference . The ability to search by a predicate 's selectional preference is also a step toward semantic searching - the ability to search a text based on what it \\\" means . \\\" In building the lexicon , we automatically assign an argument structure to all of the verbs . Once this structure is in place , it can stay attached to our texts and thereby be searchable in the future , allowing us to search a text for the subjects and direct objects of any verb . This is a powerful resource that can give us much more information about a text than simple search engines currently allow . Conclusion . In this a dynamic lexicon fills a gap left by traditional reference works . By creating a lexicon directly from a corpus of texts and then situating it within that corpus itself , we can let the two interact in ways that traditional lexica can not . Even driven by the scholarship of the past thirty years , however , a dynamic lexicon can not yet compete with the fine sense distinctions that traditional dictionaries make , and in this the two works are complementary . Classics , however , is only one field among many concerned with the technologies underlying lexicography , and by relying on the techniques of other disciplines like computational linguistics and computer science , we can count on the future progress of disciplines far outside our own .

Human Language Technologies ( HLT ) is a relatively new term that embraces a wide range of areas of research and development in the sphere of what used to be called Language Technologies or Language Engineering . The aim of this module is to familiarise the student with key areas of HLT , including a range of Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) applications . NLP is a general term used to describe the use of computers to process information expressed in natural ( i.e. human ) languages . The term NLP is used in a number of different contexts in this document and is one of the most important branches of HLT . There is a Special Interest Group in Language Processing , NLP SIG , within the EUROCALL professional association , and a Special Interest Group in Intelligent Computer Assisted Language Instruction ( ICALL ) within the CALICO professional association . Both have similar aims , namely to further research in a number of areas that are mentioned in this module , such as : . Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) . Computational Linguistics . Corpus - Driven and Corpus Linguistics . Formal Linguistics . Machine Aided Translation ( MAT ) . Machine Translation ( MT ) . Natural Language Interfaces . Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) . Theoretical Linguistics . All of the above are areas of research that have produced results which have proven , are proving and will prove very useful in the field of Computer Assisted Language Learning . Of course , this module can not teach you everything there is to know about HLT . This is neither necessary nor possible . The two main authors of this module are living proof of that ; they both started off as language teachers and then got interested in HLT . A multilingual CD - ROM titled A world of understanding was produced in 1998 on behalf of the Information Society and Media Directorate General of the European Commission under its former name , DGXIII . The aim of the CD - ROM was to demonstrate the importance of HLT in helping to realise the benefits of the Multilingual Information Society , in particular forming a review and record of the Language Engineering Sector of the Fourth Framework Programme of the European Union ( 1994 - 98 ) . 1.1 Introduction to HLT . [ ... ] there is no doubt that the development of tools ( technology ) depends on language - it is difficult to imagine how any tool - from a chisel to a CAT scanner - could be built without communication , without language . What is less obvious is that the development and the evolution of language - its effectiveness in communicating faster , with more people , and with greater clarity - depends more and more on sophisticated tools . ( European Commission : Language and technology 1996:1 ) . Language and technology lists the following examples of language technology ( using an admittedly broad understanding of the term ) : . photocopier ( p. 10 ) . laser printer ( p. 11 ) . fax machine ( p. 12 ) . desktop publishing ( p. 13 ) . scanner , modem ( p. 15 ) . electronic mail ( p. 16 ) . machine translation ( p. 17 ) . translator 's workbench ( p. 18 ) . tape recorder , database search engines ( p. 19 ) . telephone ( p. 25 ) . Many of these are already being used in language learning and teaching . The field of human language technology covers a broad range of activities with the eventual goal of enabling people to communicate with machines using natural communication skills . Research and development activities include the coding , recognition , interpretation , translation , and generation of language . [ ... ] Advances in human language technology offer the promise of nearly universal access to online information and services . Since almost everyone speaks and understands a language , the development of spoken language systems will allow the average person to interact with computers without special skills or training , using common devices such as the telephone . These systems will combine spoken language understanding and generation to allow people to interact with computers using speech to obtain information on virtually any topic , to conduct business and to communicate with each other more effectively . [ Source : Foreword to ( Cole 1997 ) ] . Facilitating and supporting all aspects of human communication through machines has interested researchers for a number of centuries . The use of mechanical devices to overcome language barriers was proposed first in the seventeenth century . Then , suggestions for numerical codes to be used to mediate between languages were made by Leibnitz , Descartes and others ( v. Hutchins 1986:21 ) . The beginnings of what we describe today as Human Language Technologies are , of course , closely connected to the advent of computers . ( i ) Various games , e.g. chess , noughts and crosses , bridge , poker ( ii ) The learning of languages ( iii ) Translation of languages ( iv ) Cryptography ( v ) Mathematics . Of these ( i ) , ( iv ) , and to a lesser extent ( iii ) and ( v ) are good in that they require little contact with the outside world . For instance in order that the machine should be able to play games its only organs need be ' eyes ' capable of distinguishing the various positions on a specially made board , and means for announcing its own moves . Mathematics should preferably be resticted to branches where diagrams are not much used . Of the above possible fields the learning of languages would be the most impressive , since it is the most human of these activities . This field sees however to depend too much on sense organs and locomotion to be feasible . ( Turing 1948:9 ) . Later on , Machine Translation enjoyed a period of popularity with researchers and funding bodies in the United States and the Soviet Union : . From 1956 onwards , the dollars ( and roubles ) really started to flow . Between 1956 and 1959 , no less than twelve research groups became established at various US universities and private corporations and research centres . Although linguists , language teachers and computer users today may find these predictions ridiculous , it was the enthusiasm and the work during this time that form the basis of many developments in HLT today . Research and development in HLT is nowadays more rapidly transferred into commercial systems than was the case up until the 1980s . Indeed HLT is becoming increasingly pervasive in our everyday lives . Here are some examples : . Machine Translation ( Section 3 ): There are many online translation systems that can be accessed free of charge , causing headaches for teachers whose students thought that they could save themselves time and who were blissfully unaware of the unreliability of their output ( Section 3.2 ) . Speech synthesis ( Section 4.1 ): Satellite navigation ( satnav ) devices for motor vehicles use systems that read out road numbers , street names and directions for the driver , and their output is surprisingly good . Speech recognition ( Section 4.2 ): If you make a telephone call to a customer support service you may hear a telephone recording that asks you to say a word or short phrase so that you can be connected to the appropriate department . Other previously unexpected areas of use are emerging . It is now , for instance , common for mobile phones to have what is known as predictive text input to aid the writing of short text messages . Instead of having to press one of the nine keys a number of times to produce the correct letter in a word , software in the phone compares users ' key presses to a linguistic database to determine the correct ( or most likely ) word . Most Internet search engines also now incorporate some kind of linguistic technology to enable users to enter a query in natural language , for example \\\" What is meant by log - likelihood ratio ? \\\" is as acceptable a query as simply \\\" log - likelihood ratio \\\" . What are the possible benefits for language teaching and learning of using HLT ? Here are some examples : . Teachers might want to preprocess a text to highlight certain grammatical phenomena or patterns . This can easily be done with a word - processor . Teachers might use part - of - speech taggers ( see Section 5 ) which could save them the trouble of having to manually annotate a text . Parsers available either on the Web or for local use on PCs can generate a graphical representation of sentence structure that may be useful for grammatical analysis for more advanced learners . Machine Translation ( MT ) has been the dream of computer scientists since the 1940s . The student 's attention is drawn in particular to the following publications , which provide a very useful introduction to MT : . Hutchins ( 1999 ) \\\" The development and use of machine translation systems and computer - based translation tools \\\" . Paper given at the International Symposium on Machine Translation and Computer Language Information Processing , 26 - 28 June 1999 , Beijing , China . 3.1 Machine Translation : a brief history . Initial work on Machine Translation ( MT ) systems was typified by what we would now consider to be a naive approach to the \\\" problem \\\" of natural language translation . Successful decoding of encrypted messages by machines during World War II led some scientists , most notably Warren Weaver , to view the translation process as essentially analogous with decoding . The concept of Machine Translation in the modern age can be traced back to the 1940s . Warren Weaver , Director of the Natural Sciences Division of the Rockefeller Foundation , wrote to his friend Norbert Wiener on 4 March 1947 - short ly after the first computers and computer programs had been produced : . Recognising fully , even though necessarily vaguely , the semantic difficulties because of multiple meanings , etc . , I have wondered if it were unthinkable to design a computer which would translate . Even if it would translate only scientific material ( where the semantic difficulties are very notably less ) , and even if it did produce an inelegant ( but intelligible ) result , it would seem to me worth while . When I look at an article in Russian , I say \\\" This is really written in English , but it has been coded in some strange symbols . I will now proceed to decode \\\" . Have you ever thought about this ? As a linguist and expert on computers , do you think it is worth thinking about ? Cited in Hutchins ( 1997 ) . Weaver was possibly chastened by Wiener 's pessimistic reply : . I frankly am afraid the boundaries of words in different languages are too vague and the emotional and international connotations are too extensive to make any quasi - mechanical translation scheme very hopeful . But Weaver remained undeterred and composed his famous 1949 Memorandum , titled simply \\\" Translation \\\" , which he sent to some 30 noteworthy minds of the time . It posited in more detail the need for and possibility of MT . Thus began the first era of MT research . A direct system would comprise a bilingual dictionary containing potential replacements or target language equivalents for each word in the source language . A restriction of such MT systems was therefore that they were unidirectional and could not accommodate many languages unlike the systems that followed . Rules for choosing correct replacements were incorporated but functioned on a basic level ; although there was some initial morphological analysis prior to dictionary lookup , subsequent local re - ordering and final generation of the target text , there was no scope for syntactic analysis let alone semantic analysis ! Inevitably this often led to poor quality output , which certainly contributed to the severe criticism of MT in the 1966 Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee ( ALPAC ) report which stated that it saw little use for MT in the foreseeable future . The damning judgment of the ALPAC report effectively halted research funding for machine translation in the USA throughout the 1960s and 1970s . We can say that both technical constraints and the lack of a linguistic basis hampered MT systems . The system developed at Georgetown University , Washington DC , and first demonstrated at IBM in New York in 1954 had no clear separation of translation knowledge and processing algorithms , making modification of the system difficult . In the period following the ALPAC report the need was increasingly felt for an approach to MT system design which would avoid many of the pitfalls of 1 G systems . By this time opinion had shifted towards the view that linguistic developments should influence system design and development . Indeed it can be said that the second generation ( 2 G ) of \\\" indirect \\\" systems owed much to linguistic theories of the time . 2 G systems can be divided essentially into \\\" interlingual \\\" and \\\" transfer \\\" systems . We will look first of all at interlingual systems , or rather those claiming to adopt an interlingual approach . Although Warren Weaver had put forward the idea of an intermediary \\\" universal \\\" language as a possible route to machine translation in his 1947 letter to Norbert Wiener , linguistics was unable to offer any models to apply until the 1960s . By virtue of its introduction of the concept of \\\" deep structure \\\" , Noam Chomsky 's theory of transformational generative grammar appeared to offer a route towards \\\" universal \\\" semantic representations and thus appeared to provide a model for the structure of a so - called interlingua . An interlingua is not a natural language , rather it can be seen as a meaning representation which is independent of both the source and the target language of translation . An interlingua system maps from a language 's surface structure to the interlingua and vice versa . A truly interlingual approach to system design has obvious advantages , the most important of which is economy , since an interlingual representation can be applied for any language pair and facilitates addition of other language pairs without major additions to the system . The next section looks at \\\" transfer \\\" systems . In a transfer model the intermediate representation is language dependent , there being a bilingual module whose function it is to interpose between source language and target language intermediate representations . Thus we can not say that the transfer module is language independent . ( For n languages the number of transfer modules required would be n ( n -1 ) or n ( n -1 ) /2 if the modules are reversible ) . An important advance in 2 G systems when compared to 1 G was the separation of algorithms ( software ) from linguistic data ( lingware ) . In a system such as the Georgetown model the program mixed language modelling , translation and the processing thereof in one program . This meant that the program was monolithic and it was easy to introduce errors when trying to rectify an existing shortcoming . The move towards separating software and lingware was hastened by parallel advances in both computational and linguistic techniques . The adoption of linguistic formalisms in the design of systems and the development of high level programming languages enabled MT workers to code in a more problem - oriented way . The development in programming languages meant that it was becoming ever easier to code rules for translation in a meaningful manner and arguably improved the quality of these rules . The declarative nature of linguistic description could now be far more explicitly reflected in the design of programs for MT . . Early MT systems were predominantly parser - based , one of the first steps in such a system being to parse and tag the source language : see Section 5 on Parsing and Tagging . More recent current approaches to MT rely less on formal linguistic descriptions than the transfer approach described above . Translation Memory ( TM ) systems are now in widespread commercial use : see below and Chapter 10 of Arnold et al . ( 1994 ) . Example - Based Machine Translation ( EBMT ) is a relatively new technology which aims to combine both traditional MT and more recent TM paradigms by reusing previous translations and applying various degrees of linguistic knowledge to convert fuzzy matches into exact ones : see the Wikipedia article on EBMT . However , some early definitions of EBMT refer to what is now known as TM and they often exclude the concept of fuzzy matches . Essentially , Google Translat e begins by examining and comparing massive corpora of texts on the Web that have already been translated by human beings . It looks for matches between source and target texts and uses complex statistical analysis routines to look for statistically significant patterns , i.e. it works out the rules of the interrelationships between source and target texts for itself . As more and more corpora are added to the Web this means that Google Translate will keep improving until it reaches a point where it will be very difficult to tell that a machine has done the translation . I remember early machine translation tools translating \\\" Wie geht es dir ? \\\" as \\\" How goes it you ? \\\" Now Google Translate gets it right : \\\" How are you ? \\\" Thus we have , in a sense , come full circle in that Weaver 's ideas of applying statistical techniques are seen as a fruitful basis for MT . . 3.2 Commercial MT packages . There are many automatic translation packages on the market - as well as free packages on the Web . While such packages may be useful for extracting the gist of a text they should not be seen as a serious replacement for the human translator . Some are not all that bad , producing translations that are half - intelligible , letting you know whether a text is worth having translated properly . See : . Professional human translators are making increasing use of Translation Memory ( TM ) packages . TM packages store texts that have previously been translated , together with their source texts , in a large database . Chunks of new texts to be translated are then matched against the translated texts in the database and suggested translations are offered to the human translator wherever a match is found . The human translator has to intervene regularly in this process of translation , making corrections and amendments as necessary . TM systems can save hours of time ( estimated at up to 80 % of a translator 's time ) , especially when translating texts that are repetitive or that use lots of standard phrases and sentence formulations . Producing updates of technical manuals is a typical application of TM systems . Examples of TM systems include : . An example of automatic translations can be found at the Newstran website . This site is extremely useful for locating newspapers in a wide range of languages . You can also locate selected newspapers that have been translated using a Machine Translation system . Another approach to translation is the stored phrase bank , for example LinguaWrite , which was aimed at the business user and contained a large database of equivalent phrases and sentences in different languages to facilitate the writing of business letters . LinguaWrite was programmed by Marco Bruzzone in the 1980s and marketed by Camsoft , but it is no longer available and has not been updated . David Sephton 's Tick - Tack ( Primrose Publishing ) adopted a similar approach , beginning as a package consisting of \\\" building blocks \\\" of language for business communication , but it now embraces other topics . 3.3 Just for fun . 3.3.1 Some apocryphal stuff . The following examples have often been cited as mistakes made by machine translation ( MT ) systems . Whether they are real examples or not can not be verified . Russian - English : In a technical text that had been translated from Russian into English the term water sheep kept appearing . When the Russian source text was checked it was found that it was actually referring to a hydraulic ram . Russian - English : Idioms are often a problem . Russian - English : Another example , similar to the one above , is where out of sight , out of mind ended up being translated as the equivalent of blind and stupid . MT systems do , however , often make mistakes . The Systran MT system , which has been used by the European Commission , translated the English phrase pregnant women and children into des femmes et enfants enceints , which implies that both the women and the children are pregnant . Although it is an interpretation of the original phrase that is theoretically possible , it is also clearly wrong . 3.3.2 Translations of nursery rhymes . Try using an online machine translator to translate a text from English into another language and then back again . The results are often amusing , especially if you are translating nursery rhymes ! ( i ) Bah , bah , black sheep translated into French and then back again into English , using Babel Fish . English source text : Bah , bah , black sheep , have you any wool ? Yes sir , yes sir , three bags full . One for the master , one for the dame , and one for the little boy who lives down the lane . French translation : Bah , bah , mouton noir , vous ont n'importe quelles laines ? Oui monsieur , oui monsieur , trois sacs compl\\u00e8tement . Un pour le ma\\u00eetre , un pour dame , et un pour le petit gar\\u00e7on qui vit en bas de la ruelle . And back into English again : Bah , bah , black sheep , have you n ' imports which wools ? Yes Sir , yes Sir , three bags completely . For the Master , for lady , and for the little boy who lives in bottom of the lane . ( ii ) Humpty Dumpty translated into Italian and then back again into English , using Babel Fish . English source text : Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall . Humpty Dumpty had a great fall . Italian translation : Humpty Dumpty si \\u00e8 seduto su una parete . Humpty Dumpty ha avuto una grande caduta . I cavalli di tutto il re e gli uomini di tutto il re non hanno potuto un Humpty ancora . And back into English again : Humpty Dumpty has been based on a wall . Humpty Dumpty has had a great fall . The horses of all the king and the men of all the king have not been able a Humpty still . ( iii ) Humpty Dumpty translated into Italian and then back again into English , using Google Translate . English source text : Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall . Humpty Dumpty had a great fall . Italian translation : Humpty Dumpty sedeva su un muro . Humpty Dumpty ha avuto un grande caduta . Tutti i cavalli del re e tutti gli uomini del re non poteva mettere Humpty di nuovo insieme . And back into English again : Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall . Humpty Dumpty had a great fall . All the king 's horses and all the king 's men could not put Humpty together again . Now , the above is an interesting result ! Google Translate used to be a very unreliable MT tool . It drives language teachers mad , as their students often use it to do their homework , e.g. translating from a given text into a foreign language or drafting their own compositions and then translating them . Mistakes made by Google Translate used to be very easy to spot , but ( as indicated above in Section 3.1 ) Google changed its translation engine a few years ago and now uses a Statistical Machine Translation ( SMT ) approach . The Humpty Dumpty translation back into English from the Italian appears to indicate that Google Translate has matched the whole text and got it right . Clever ! 3.3.3 Translations of business and journalistic texts . ( i ) A business text , translated with Google Translate and Babel Fish . Google Translate was used to translate the following text from German into English : Die Handelskammer in Saarbr\\u00fccken hat uns Ihre Anschrift zur Verf\\u00fcgung gestellt . Wir sind ein mittelgro\\u00dfes Fachgesch\\u00e4ft in Stuttgart , und wir spezialisieren uns auf den Verkauf von Personalcomputern . This was rendered as : The Chamber of Commerce in Saarbr\\u00fccken has provided us your address is available . We are a medium sized shop in Stuttgart , and we specialize in sales of personal computers . Babel Fish produced a better version : The Chamber of Commerce in Saarbruecken put your address to us at the disposal . We are a medium sized specialist shop in Stuttgart , and we specialize in the sale of personal computers . ( ii ) A journalistic text , translated with Google Translate and Babel Fish . Die deutsche Exportwirtschaft k\\u00e4mpft mit der weltweiten Konjunkturflaute und muss deshalb von den Zeiten zweistelligen Wachstums Abschied nehmen . [ Ludolf Wartenberg vom Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie ] . This was rendered by Google Translate as : The German export economy is struggling with the global downturn and must therefore take the times of double - digit growth goodbye . [ Ludolf Wartenberg from the Federation of German Industry ] . The German export trade and industry fights with the world - wide recession and must take therefore from the times of two digit growth parting . [ Ludolf waiting mountain of the Federal association of the German industry . ] Computers are normally associated with two standard input devices , the keyboard and the mouse , and two standard output devices , the display screen and the printer . All these restrict language input and output . However , computer programs and hardware devices that enable the computer to handle human speech are now commonplace . All modern computers allow the user to plug in a microphone and record his / her own voice . A variety of other sources of sound recordings can also be used . Storing these sound files is not a problem anymore as a result of the immensely increased capacity and reduced cost of storage media and improved compression techniques that enable the size of sound files to be substantially reduced . For further information on the applications of sound recording and playback technology to CALL see Module 2.2 , Introduction to multimedia CALL . A range of computer software is available for speech analysis . Spoken input can be analysed according to a wide variety of parameters and the analysis can be represented graphically or numerically . Of course , graphic output is not immediately useful for the uninitiated viewer , and hence we are not arguing that this kind of graphical representation will prove useful to the language learner . On the other hand , specialists are well capable of interpreting this speech analysis data . The information we get from speech analysis has proven very valuable indeed for speech synthesis and speech recognition , which are dealt with in the following two sections . 4.1 Speech synthesis . Speech synthesis describes the process of generating human - like speech by computer . Producing natural sounding speech is a complex process in which one has to consider a range of factors that go beyond just converting characters to sounds because very often there is no one - to - one relation between them . The intonation of particular sentence types and the rhythm of particular utterances also have to be considered . Currently speech synthesis is far more advanced and more robust than speech recognition ( see Section 4.2 below ) . The naturalness of artificially produced utterances is now very impressive compared to what used to be produced by earlier speech synthesis systems in which the intonation and timing were far from natural and resulted in the production of monotonous , robot - like speech . Many people are now unaware that so - called talking dictionaries use speech synthesis software rather than recordings of human voices . In - car satellite navigation ( satnav ) systems can produce a range of different types of human voices , both male and female in a number of different languages , and \\\" talk \\\" to the car driver guiding him / her to a chosen destination . So far , however , speech synthesis has not been as widely used in CALL as speech recognition . This is probably due to the fact that language teachers ' requirements regarding the presentation of spoken language are very demanding . Anything that sounds artificial is likely to be rejected . Some language teachers even reject speakers whose regional accent is too far from what is considered standard or received pronunciation . There is , however , a category of speech synthesis technology known as Text To Speech ( TTS ) technology that is widely used for practical purposes . TTS software falls into the category of assistive technology , which has a vital role in improving accessiblity for a wide range of computer users with special needs , which is now governed by legislation in the UK . The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act ( SENDA ) of 2001 covers educational websites and obliges their designers \\\" to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that people who are disabled are not put at a substantial disadvantage compared to people who are not disabled . \\\" See JISC 's website on Disability Legislation and ICT in Further and Higher Education - Essentials . See the Glossary for definitions of assistive technology and accessiblity . TTS is important in making computers accessible to blind or partially sighted people as it enables them to \\\" read \\\" from the screen . TTS technology can be linked to any written input in a variety of languages , e.g. automatic pronunciation of words from an online dictionary , reading aloud of a text , etc . These are examples of TTS software : . Festival Speech Synthesis System : From the Centre for Speech Technology Research at the University of Edinburgh . Festival offers a general framework for building speech synthesis systems as well as including examples of various modules . Just for fun I entered the phrase \\\" Pas d'elle yeux Rh\\u00f4ne que nous \\\" into a couple of French language synthesisers . It 's a nonsense sentence in French but it comes out sounding like a French person trying to pronounce a well - known expression in English . Try it ! There are also Web - based tools that enable you to create animated cartoons or movies incorporating TTS , for example : . Voki enables you to create and customise your own speaking cartoon character . You can choose the TTS option ( as in Graham Davies 's example on the right ) to give the character a voice , or you can record your own voice . ReadTheWords : A tool that works in much the same way as Voki , but without the option of recording one 's own voice . An excellent tool that helps people with hearing impairments to learn how to articulate is the CSLU Speech Toolkit . To what extent speech synthesis systems are suitable for CALL is a matter for further discussion . See the article by Handley & Hamel ( 2005 ) , who report on their progress towards the development of a benchmark for determining the adequacy of speech synthesis systems for use in CALL . The article mentions a Web - based package called FreeText , for advanced learners of French , the outcome of a project funded by the European Commission . 4.2 Speech recognition . Speech recognition describes the use of computers to recognise spoken words . Speech recognition has not reached such a high level of performance as speech synthesis ( see Section 4.1 above ) , but it has certainly become usable in CALL in recent years . EyeSpeak English is a typical example of the use of speech recognition software for helping students improve their English pronunciation . Speech recognition is a non - trivial task because the same spoken word does not produce entirely the same sound waves when uttered by different people or even when uttered by the same person on different occasions . The process is complex : the computer has to digitise the sound , transform it to discard unneeded information , and then try to match it with words stored in a dictionary . The most efficient speech recognition systems are speaker - dependent , i.e. they are trained to recognise a particular person 's speech and can then distinguish thousands of words uttered by that person . If one remembers that each of the parameters analysed could have been affected by some speaker - independent background noise or by some idiosyncratic pronunciation features of this particular speaker then it already becomes clear how difficult the interpretation of the analysis data is for a speech recognition program . The following information is taken from an article written by Norman Harris of DynEd , a publisher of CALL software incorporating ASR : . Speech recognition technology has finally come of age - at least for language training purposes for young adults and adults . The essence of real language is not in discrete single words - language students need to practice complete phrases and sentences in realistic contexts . Moreover , programs which were trained to accept a speaker 's individual pronunciation quirks were not ideally suited to helping students move toward more standard pronunciation . These technologies also failed if the speaker 's voice changed due to common colds , laryngitis and other throat ailments , rendering them useless until the speaker recovered or retrained the speech engine . The solution to these problems came with the development of continuous speech recognition engines that were speaker independent . These programs are able to deal with complete sentences spoken at a natural pace , not just isolated words . Such flexibility with regard to pronunciation paradigms means that today 's speaker - independent speech recognition programs are not ideal for direct pronunciation practice . Nonetheless , exercises which focus on fluency and word order , and with native speaker models which are heard immediately after a student 's utterance had been successfully recognized , have been shown to indirectly result in much improved pronunciation . Another trade off is that the greater flexibility and leniency which allows these programs to \\\" recognize \\\" sentences spoken by students with a wide variety of accents , also limits the accuracy of the programs , especially for similar sounding words and phrases . Some errors may be accepted as correct . Native speakers testing the \\\" understanding \\\" of programs \\\" tuned \\\" to the needs of non - native speakers may be bothered by this , but most teachers , after careful consideration of the different needs and psychologies of native speakers and learners , will accept the trade off . Students do not expect to be understood every time . If they are required occasionally to repeat a sentence which the program has not recognized or which the program has misinterpreted , there may be some small frustration , but language students are much more likely to take this in their stride than would native speakers . On the other hand , if the program does \\\" understand \\\" such students , however imperfect their pronunciation , they typically experience a huge sense of satisfaction , a feel good factor native speakers simply can not enjoy to anywhere near the same degree . The worst thing for a student is a program that is too demanding of perfection - such programs will quickly lead to student frustration or the kind of embarrassed , hesitant unwillingness to speak English typical of many classrooms . Even if we accept that accuracy needs to be responsive to proficiency in order to encourage students to speak , we must , as teachers , be concerned that errors do not become reinforced . A recent breakthrough is the implementation of apps such as Apple 's Siri on the iPhone 4S and Evi , which is available for the iPhone and the Android . These apps are quite impressive at recognising speech and providing answers to questions submitted by the user . Evi 's performance was tested by the author of this paragraph . \\\" She \\\" immediately provided correct answers to these questions submitted by voice input : . In which American state is Albuquerque ? In addition , Evi may link to relevant websites that provide further information . Text input is also accepted . In this section we outline the essentials of parsing , first of all by describing the components of a parsing system and then discussing different kinds of parser . We look at one linguistic phenomenon which causes problems for parsing and finally examine potential solutions to the difficulties raised by parsing . Put in simple terms , a parser is a program that maps strings of a language into its structures . The most basic components needed by a parser are a lexicon containing words that may be parsed and a grammar , consisting of rules which determine grammatical structures . The first parsers were developed for the analysis of programming languages ; obviously as artificial , regular languages they present fewer problems than a natural language . It is most useful to think of parsing as a search problem which has to be solved . It can be solved using an algorithm which can be defined as : . [ ... ] a formal procedure that always produces a correct or optimal result . An algorithm applies a step - by - step procedure that guarantees a specific outcome or solves a specific problem . The procedure of an algorithm performs a computation in a finite amount of time . Programmers specify the algorithm the program will follow when they develop a conventional program . ( Smith 1990 ) . Parsing algorithms define a procedure that looks for the optimum combination of grammatical rules that generate a tree structure for the input sentence . How might we define these grammatical rules in a concise way that is amenable to computer processing ? A useful construct for our purposes is a so - called context - free grammar ( CFG ) . A CFG consists of rules containing a single symbol on the left - hand side and one or more on the right - hand side . For example , the statement that a sentence can consist of : . a noun phrase and a verb phrase can be expressed by the following rewrite rule . S \\u00ae NP VP . This means that a sentence S can be ' rewritten ' as a noun phrase NP followed by a verb phrase VP which are in their turn defined in the grammar . A noun phrase , for example , can consist of a determiner DET and a noun N. These symbols are known as non - terminals and the words represented by these symbols are terminal symbols . Parsing algorithms can proceed top - down or bottom - up . In some cases , top - down and bottom - up algorithms can be combined . Below are simple descriptions of two parsing strategies . 5.1.1 Top Down ( depth first ) . Top down strategy works from non - terminal symbols : . S \\u00ae NP VP . and then breaks them down into constituents . The strategy assumes we have an S and tries to fit it in . If we choose to search depth first , then we proceed down one side of the tree at a time . The search will end successfully if it manages to break down the sentence into all its terminal symbols ( words ) . 5.1.2 Bottom up ( breadth first ) . A bottom up strategy looks at elements of an S and assigns categories to them to form larger constituents until we arrive at an S. If we choose to search breadth first , then we proceed consecutively through each layer and stop successfully once we have constructed a sentence . Let 's look now at one linguistic phenomenon which causes problems for parsers - that of so - called attachment ambiguity . Consider the following sentence : . The man saw the man in the park with a telescope . Parser output can be represented as a bracketed list or , more commonly , a tree structure . Here is the output of two possible parses for the sentence above . One way of dealing with the problem of sentences which have more than one possible parse is to concentrate on specific elements of the parser input and to not deal with such phenomena as attachment ambiguity . Ideally we expect a parser to successfully analyse a sentence on the basis of its grammar , but often there are problems caused by errors in the text or incompleteness of grammar and lexicon . Also the length of sentences and ambiguity of grammars often make it hard to successfully parse unrestricted text . An approach which addresses some of these issues is partial or shallow parsing . Abney ( 1997:125 ) succinctly describes partial parsing thus : . \\\" Partial parsing techniques aim to recover syntactic information efficiently and reliably from unrestricted text , by sacrificing completeness and depth of analysis . \\\" Partial parsers concentrate on recovering pieces of sentence structure which do not require large amounts of information ( such as lexical association information ) ; attachment remains unresolved for instance . We can see that in this way parsing efficiency is greatly improved . Another strategy for analysing language is part - of - speech tagging , in which we do not seek to find larger structures such as noun phrases but instead label each word in a sentence with its appropriate part of speech . Here is the original paragraph from Section 3 of this document : . In a transfer model the intermediate representation is language dependent , there being a bilingual module whose function it is to interpose between source language and target language intermediate representations . Thus we can not say that the transfer module is language independent . The following table shows the tagger output , and we can see that most of the words have been correctly identified . additional . languages . NNS . language . required . VBN . require . . . SENT . . . As with partial parsing , we are not trying to find correct attachments and since it is a limited task the success rate is quite high . The information derived from tagging can itself have input into partial parsing or into improving the performance of traditional parsers . Some of the decision task as to what is the correct part of speech to assign to a word is based on the probability of two or three word sequences ( bigrams and trigrams ) occurring , even where words can be assigned more than one part of speech . For instance , in our example tagged text the sequence ' the transfer module ' occurs . Transfer is of course also a verb , but the likelihood of a determiner ( the ) being followed by a verb is lower than the likelihood of a determiner noun sequence . See als o the Visual Interactive Syntax Learning ( VISL ) website . An online parser and a variety of other tools concerned with English grammar , including games and quizzes , can be found here . 5.1.3 Parsing erroneous input . Of course , in CALL we are dealing with texts that have been produced by language learners at various levels of proficiency and accuracy . It is therefore reasonable to assume that the parser has to be prepared to deal with linguistic errors in the input . One thing we could do is to complement our grammar for correct sentences with a grammar of incorrect sentences - an error grammar , i.e. we capture individual and/or typical errors in a separate rule system . The advantage of this error grammar approach is that the feedback can be very specific and is normally fairly reliable because this feedback can be attached to a very specific rule . The big drawback , however , is that individual learner errors have to be anticipated in the sense that each error needs to be covered by an adequate rule . However , as already stated it is not only in texts that have been produced by language learners that we find erroneous structures . Machine translation is facing similar problems . Dina & Malnati review approaches \\\" concerning the design and the implementation of grammars able to deal with ' real input ' . \\\" ( Dina & Malnati 1993:75 ) . They list four approaches : . The rule - based approach which relies on two sets of rules : one for grammatical input and the other for ungrammatical input . Dina & Malnati point out quite rightly that normally well - formedness conditions should be sufficient and the second set of rules results in linguistic redundancy . The main problem with using this approach in a parser - based CALL system is the problem of having to anticipate the errors learners are likely to make . The metarule - based approach uses a set of well - formedness rules and if none of them can be applied calls an algorithm that relaxes some constraints and records the kind of violation . Dina & Malnati note the procedurality of the algorithm causes problems when confronted with multiple errors - something very likely in any text produced by a language learner . The preference - based approach comprises an overgenerating grammar and a set of preference rules . \\\" [ ... ] each time a formal condition is removed from a b - rule to make its applicability context wider , a preference rule must be added to the grammar . Such a p - rule must be able to state - in the present context of the b - rule - the condition that has been previously removed . \\\" ( Dina & Malnati 1993:78 ) Again a source for linguistic redundancy which might result in inconsistencies in the grammar . They claim that , due to the overgeneration of possible interpretations , \\\" the system would be completely unusable in an applied context . \\\" ( ibid.:79 ) . The constraint - based approach is based on the following assumptions : . each ( sub)tree is marked by an index of error ( initially set to 0 ) ; . the violation of a constraint in a rule does not block the application , but increases the error index of the generated ( sub)tree ; . at the end of parsing the object marked by the smallest index is chosen . Consequently , the \\\" most plausible interpretation of a [ ... ] sentence is the one which satisfies the largest number of constraints . \\\" ( Dina & Malnati 1993:80 ) . We have seen in Section 3 that Machine Translation ( MT ) and the political and scientific interest in machine translation played a significant role in the acceptance ( or non - acceptance ) as well as the general development of Human Language Technologies . By 1964 , however , the promise of operational MT systems still seemed distant and the sponsors set up a committee , which recommended in 1966 that funding for MT should be reduced . It brought to an end a decade of intensive MT research activity . ( Hutchins 1986:39 ) . It is then perhaps not surprising that the mid-1960s saw the birth of another discipline : Computer Assisted Language Learning ( CALL ) . The PLATO project , which was initiated at the University of Illinois in 1960 , is widely regarded as the beginning of CALL - although CALL was just part of this huge package of general Computer Assisted Learning ( CAL ) programs running on mainframe computers . PLATO IV ( 1972 ) was probably the version of this project that had the biggest impact on the development of CALL ( Hart 1995 ) . At the same time , another American university , Brigham Young University , received government funding for a CALL project , TICCIT ( Time - Shared Interactive , Computer Controlled Information Television ) ( Jones 1995 ) . Other well - known and still widely used programs were developed soon afterwards : . The CALIS / WinCALIS ( Computer Aided Language Instruction System ) authoring tools , Duke University ( Borchardt 1995 ) . The TUCO package for learners of German , developed by Heimy Taylor and Werner Haas , Ohio State University . See Module 3.2 , Section 5.9 . The CLEF package for learners of French , which was produced by a consortium of Canadian universities in the late 1970s and is still going strong today . See Module 3.2 , Section 5.9 . In the UK , John Higgins developed Storyboard in the early 1980s , a total Cloze text reconstruction program for the microcomputer ( Higgins & Johns 1984:57 ) . ( Levy 1997:24 - 25 ) describes how other programs extended this idea further . See Section 8.3 , Module 1.4 , headed Total text reconstruction : total Cloze , for further information on total Cloze programs . In recent years the development of CALL has been greatly influenced by the technology and by our knowledge of and our expertise in using it , so that not only the design of most CALL software , but also its classification has been technology - driven . For example , Wolff ( 1993:21 ) distinguished five groups of applications : . The late 1980s saw the beginning of attempts which are mostly subsumed under Intelligent CALL ( ICALL ) , a \\\" mix of AI [ Artificial Intelligence ] techniques and CALL \\\" ( Matthews 1992b : i ) . Early AI - based CALL was not without its critics , however : . And that , fundamentally , is why my initial enthusiasm has now turned so sour . ( Last 1989:153 ) . For a more up - to - date and positive point of view of Artifical Intelligence , see Dodigovic ( 2005 ) . Bowerman ( 1993:31 ) notes : \\\" Weischedel et al . ( 1978 ) produced the first ICALL [ Intelligent CALL ] system which dealt with comprehension exercises . It made use of syntactic and semantic knowledge to check students ' answers to comprehension questions . \\\" As far as could be ascertained , this was just the early swallow that did not create a summer . Kr\\u00fcger - Thielmann ( 1992:51ff . ) lists and summarises the following early projects in ICALL : ALICE , ATHENA , BOUWSTEEN & COGO , EPISTLE , ET , LINGER , VP2 , XTRA - TE , Zock . Matthews ( 1993:5 ) identifies Linguistic Theory and Second Language Acquisition Theory as the two main disciplines which inform Intelligent CALL and which are ( or will be ) informed by Intelligent CALL . He adds : \\\" the obvious AI research areas from which ICALL should be able to draw the most insights are Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) and Intelligent Tutoring Systems ( ITS ) \\\" ( Matthews1993:6 ) . Matthews shows that it is possible to \\\" conceive of an ICALL system in terms of the classical ITS architecture \\\" ( ibid . ) The system consists of three modules - expert , student and teacher module - and an interface . The expert module is the one that \\\" houses \\\" the language knowledge of the system . It is this part which can process any piece of text produced by a learner - in an ideal system . This is usually done with the help of a parser of some kind : . ( Holland et al . 1993:28 ) . This notion of parser - based CALL not only captures the nature of the field much better than the somewhat misleading term \\\" Intelligent CALL \\\" ( Is all other CALL un - intelligent ? ) , it also identifies the use of Human Language Technologies as one possible approach in CALL alongside others such as multimedia - based CALL and Web - based CALL and thus identifies parser - based CALL as one possible way forward for CALL . In some cases , the ( technology - defined ) borders between these sub - fields of CALL are not even clearly identifiable , as we will see in some of the projects mentioned in the following paragraphs . To exemplify recent advances in the use of sophisticated human language technology in CALL , let us have a look at some of the projects that were presented at two conferences in the late 1990s . The first one is the Language Teaching and Language Technology conference in Groningen in 1997 ( Jager et al . 1998 ) . Witt & Young ( 1998 ) , on the other hand , are concerned with assessing pronunciation . They implemented and tested a pronunciation scoring algorithm which is based on speech recognition ( see Section 4.2 ) and uses hidden Markov models . \\\" The results show that - at least for this setup with artificially generated pronunciation errors - the GOP [ goodness of pronunciation ] scoring method is a viable assessment tool . \\\" A third paper on pronunciation at this conference , by Skrelin & Volskaja ( 1998 ) outlined the use of speech synthesis ( see Section 4.1 ) in language learning and lists dictation , distinction of homographs , a sound dictionary and pronunciation drills as possible applications . \\\" The project vision foresees two main areas where GLOSSER applications can be used . First , in language learning and second , as a tool for users that have a bit of knowledge of a foreign language , but can not read it easily or reliably \\\" ( Dokter & Nerbonne 1998:88 ) . Dokter & Nerbonne report on the French - Dutch demonstrator running under UNIX . The demonstrator : . uses morphological analysis to provide additional grammatical information on individual words and to simplify dictionary look - up ; . relies on automatic word selection ; . offers the opportunity to insert glosses ( taken form the dictionary look - up ) into the text ; . relies on string - based word sense disambiguation ( \\\" Whenever a lexical context is found in the text that is also provided in the dictionary , the example in the dictionary is highlighted . \\\" ( op.cit.:93 ) . Roosma & Pr\\u00f3sz\\u00e9ky ( 1998 ) draw attention to the fact that GLOSSER works with the following language pairs : English - Estonian - Hungarian , English - Bulgarian , French - Dutch and describe a demonstrator version running under Windows . Dokter et al ( 1998 ) conclude in their user study \\\" that Glosser - RuG improves the ease with which language students can approach a foreign language text \\\" ( Dokter et al . 1998:175 ) . The latter project relies on a spellchecker , morphological analyser , syntactic parser and a lexical database for Basque , and the authors report on the development of an interlanguage model . At another conference ( UMIST , May 1998 ) , which brought together a group of researchers who are exploring the use of HLT in CALL software , Schulze et al . ( 1999 ) and Tschichold ( 1999 ) discussed strategies for improving the success rate of grammar checkers . Menzel & Schr\\u00f6der ( 1999 ) described error diagnosis in a multi - level representation . The demonstration system captures the relations of entities in a simple town scenery . The available syntactic , semantic and pragmatic information is checked simultaneously for constraint violations , i.e. errors made by the language learners . Visser ( 1999 ) introduced CALLex , a program for learning vocabulary based on lexical functions . Diaz de Ilarraza et al . ( 1999 ) described aspects of IDAZKIDE , a learning environment for Spanish learners of Basque . The program contains the following modules : wide - coverage linguistic tools ( lexical database with 65,000 entries ; spell checker ; a word form proposer and a morphological analyser ) , an adaptive user interface and a student modelling system . The model of the students ' language knowledge , i.e. their interlanguage , is based on a corpus analysis ( 300 texts produced by learners of Basque ) . Foucou & K\\u00fcbler ( 1999 ) presented a Web - based environment for teaching technical English to students of computing . Ward et al . ( 1999 ) showed that Natural Language Processing techniques combined with a graphical interface can be used to produce meaningful language games . Davies & Poesio ( 1998 ) reported on tests of simple CALL prototypes that have been created using CSLUrp , a graphical authoring system for the creation of spoken dialogue systems . They argue that since it is evident that today 's dialogue systems are usable in CALL software , it is now possible and necessary to study the integration of corrective feedback in these systems . Mitkov ( 1998 ) outlined early plans for a new CALL project , The Language Learner 's Workbench . It is the aim of this project to incorporate a number of already available HLT tools and to package them for language learners . These examples of CALL applications that make use of Human Language Technologies are by no means exhaustive . They not only illustrate that research in HLT in CALL is vibrant , but also that HLT has an important contribution to make in the further development of CALL . Of course , both disciplines are still rather young and many projects in both areas , CALL and HLT , have not even reached the stage of the implementation of a fully functional prototype yet . A number of CALL packages that make use of speech recognition have reached the commercial market and are being used successfully by learners all over the world ( see Section 4.2 ) . Speech synthesis , certainly at word level , has achieved a clarity of pronunciation that makes it a viable tool for language learning ( see Section 4.1 ) . Many popular electronic dictionaries now incorporate speech synthesis systems . Part - of - speech taggers have reached a level of accuracy that makes them usable in the automatic pre - processing of learner texts . Morphological analysers for a number of languages automatically provide grammatical information on vocabulary items in context and make automatic dictionary look - ups of inflected or derived word forms possible . This progress in HLT and CALL has mainly been possible as the result of our better understanding of the structures of language - our understanding of linguistics . The lack of linguistic modelling and the insufficient deployment of Natural Language Processing techniques has sometimes been given as one reason for the lack of progress in some areas of CALL : see , for example , Levy ( 1997:3 ) , citing Kohn ( 1994 ) . [ ... ] Kohn suggests that current CALL is lacking because of poor linguistic modelling , insufficient deployment of natural language processing techniques , an emphasis on special - purpose rather than general - purpose technology , and a neglect of the ' human ' dimnesion of CALL ( Kohn 1994:32 ) . The examples in the previous section have shown that it is possible to apply certain linguistic theories ( e.g. phonology and morphology ) to Human Language Technologies and implement this technology in CALL software . This is , of course , true . However , it does not mean that interesting fragments or aspects of a given language can not be captured by a formal linguistic theory and hence implemented in a CALL application . In other words , if one can not capture the German language in its entirety in order to implement this linguistic knowledge in a computer program , this does not mean that one can not capture interesting linguistic phenomena of that language . This means even if we are only able to describe a fragment of a given language adequately we can still make very good use of this description in computer applications for language learning . What is the kind of knowledge we ought to have about language before we can attempt to produce an HLT tool that can be put to effective use in CALL ? Let us look at one particular aspect of language - grammar . In recent years , the usefulness of conscious learning of grammar has been discussed time and again , very often in direct opposition to what has been termed \\\" the communicative approach \\\" . ( ibid.:6 ) This assumption leads to the question of what role exactly the computer ( program ) has to play in a sensitive , rich and enjoyable grammar - learning process . The diversity of approaches outlined in this special issue of ReCALL on grammar illustrates that there are many different roads to successful grammar learning that will need to be explored . In this module , only the example of parser - based CALL will be discussed . Let us take a grammar checker for language learners as a specific example in point . This grammar checker could then be integrated into a CALL program , a word - processor , an email editor , a Web page editor etc . The design of such a grammar checker is mainly based on findings in theoretical linguistics and second language acquisition theory . Let us start with second language acquisition theory . Research in second language acquisition has proved that grammar learning can lead to more successful language acquisition . Here learners have the opportunity to correct grammatical errors and mistakes that they have made while concentrating on the subject matter and the communicative function of the text . It is at this stage that a grammar checker for language learners can provide useful and stimulating guidance . In order to ascertain the computational features of such a grammar checker , let us first consider what exactly we mean by \\\" grammar \\\" in a language learning context . Helbig discusses possible answers to this question from the point of view of the teaching and learning of foreign languages in general : . As a starting point for answering our question concerning the relevance ( and necessity ) of grammar in foreign language teaching we used a differentiation of what was and is understood by the term \\\" grammar \\\" : . Grammar A : the system of rules that is inherent to the object language itself and is independent of the fact whether it has been captured by Linguistics or not ; . Grammar B : the scientific - linguistic description of the language inherent system of rules , the modelling of Grammar A by Linguistics ; . Grammar C : the system of rules intern to the speaker and listener which is formed in the head of the learner during language acquisition and which forms the basis for him / her to produce and understand correct sentences and texts and to use them appropriately in communication . ( Helbig:1975 ) . Helbig identifies further a Grammar B1 and a Grammar B2 - the former being a linguistic grammar and the latter being a learner grammar . The description of grammar B1c is a literal translation of Helbig 's wording - in the terminology used now , the term \\\" interlanguage \\\" appears to be the most appropriate . The application of Helbig 's grammar classification to CALL produces the following results : . Grammar A remains as defined by Helbig . In other words it refers to the target grammar of the interlanguage continuum . Grammar B1a is the grammar which enables the parser to process grammatically well - formed sentences in the target language . Grammars B1b , B1c and B2 enable the grammar checking CALL tool to detect errors in the learner input and provide the linguistic information to generate feedback . Grammar C is the grammar system which the CALL tool should help to correct and expand . Additionally , the grammar checker will gather data for learner profiles which should allow useful insights into the development of Grammar C of learners you have used the program . Consequently , Grammar B in its entirety and Grammar C will have to be considered first and foremost when developing the grammar checker . The question then arises : If Grammar A provides the linguistic data for the parser developer , how can we \\\" feed \\\" these different grammars into a computer program ? The computer requires that any grammar which we intend to use in any program ( or programming language , for that matter ) be mathematically exact . Grammars which satisfy this condition are normally referred to as formal grammars . The mathematical description of these grammars uses set theory . Therefore , a language L is said to have a vocabulary V . If there were no restrictions on how to construct strings , the number of possible strings is infinite . This becomes clear when one considers that each vocabulary item of V could be repeated infinitely in order to construct a string . However , as language learners in particular know any language L adheres to a finite set of ( grammar ) rules . This explains why grammar teaching software that attempts to anticipate possible incorrect answers can only do this successfully if the answer domain is severely restricted and the anticipation process will therefore much simpler . Could a computer program perform this task - a task based on infinite possibilities ? Yes , it could - but not based on infinite possibilities . That is why it will be necessary to look for an approach which is based on a finite set of possibilities , which can then be pre - programmed . Let us therefore consider L the set of strings that can be constructed using the ( formal ) grammar G . A formal grammar can be defined as follows ( see e.g. Allen 1995 ): . G ( VN , VT , R , S ) . And here we are already dealing with sets which have a finite number of members . The number of grammatical rules is fairly limited . This is certainly the case when we only consider the basic grammar rules of a language that will have to be learned by the intermediate to early advanced learner . ( Note here what we said earlier about Grammar B2 - the learner grammar : It was only a subset of Grammar 1 - the linguistic grammar . ) Formal grammars have been used in a number of CALL projects . Matthews ( 1993 ) continues his discussion of grammar frameworks for CALL which he started in 1992 ( Matthews 1992a ) . He lists eight major grammar frameworks that have been used in CALL : . Of course , these are only some examples . More recently , Tschichold et al . ( 1994 ) reported on a prototype for correcting English texts produced by French learners . This system relies on a number of different finite state automata for pre - processing , filtering and detecting ( Tschichold et al.1994 ) . Brehony & Ryan ( 1994 ) report on \\\" Francophone Stylistic Grammar Checking ( FSGC ) using Link Grammars \\\" . They adapted the post - processing section of an existing parser so that it would detect stylistic errors in English input produced by French learners . His plea is for the use of the PPT ( Principles and Parameters Theory ( Chomsky 1986 ) as a grammar framework for CALL applications , basing his judgement on three criteria : computational effectiveness , linguistic perspicuity and acquisitional perspicuity ( Matthews 1993:9 ) . In later parts of his paper , Matthews compares rule- and principle - based frameworks using DCGs ( Definite Clause Grammars ) as the example for the latter . He concludes that principle - based frameworks ( and consequently principle - based parsing ) are the most suitable grammar frameworks for what he calls Intelligent CALL . Recently , other unification - based grammar frameworks not included in Matthews ' list have been used in CALL . Hagen , for instance , describes \\\" an object - oriented , unification - based parser called HANOI \\\" ( Hagen 1995 ) which uses formalisms developed in Head - Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) . He quotes Zajac : . Combining object - oriented approaches to linguistic description with unification - based grammar formalisms [ ... ] is very attractive . On one hand , we gain the advantages of the object - oriented approach : abstraction and generalisation through the use of inheritance . On the other hand , we gain a fully declarative framework , with all the advantages of logical formalisms [ ... ] . Of course , not even this extended list is comprehensive - at best it could be described as indicative of the variety of linguistic approaches used in parser - based Computer Assisted Language Learning and , in particular , in the field of grammar checking . At the end of this short excursion into formal grammar(s ) it can be concluded that any CALL grammar checker component needs as its foundation a formal grammar describing as comprehensively as possible the knowledge we have about the target language grammar . This was the grammar that Helbig ( 1975 ) refers to as Grammar B1a . But what part do the other grammars play in a CALL environment ? Let us stay with the example of a parser - based grammar checker for language learners . Hence , the provision of adequate feedback on the morpho - syntactic structure of parts of the text produced by learners is the most important task for this parser - based grammar checker . Let us therefore consider the place of feedback provision within a parser grammar . In other words , as a good teacher would do - the grammar checker would offer advice on how to change an ungrammatical structure into a corresponding grammatically well - formed structure . As stated earlier this approach would be based on an infinite number of construction possibilities . Therefore , the provision of adequate feedback and help to the learner appears to be difficult if not impossible . However , it has been indicated above that feedback could be linked to the finite sets on which the formal grammar relies . How can this be done ? Each member of the three sets which will have to be considered here . The non - terminal symbols like NP and VP , the words and the set of morpho - syntactic rules carry certain features that determine their behaviour in a sentence and determine their relation to other signs within the sentence . These features which restrict what the text producer can do with a given ( terminal or non - terminal ) symbol in a sentence and under what conditions a particular grammatical rule has to be applied will be labelled constraints . Let us return to our provisional description of feedback , which can now be formulated more precisely . Feedback shows the relation . by explaining the underlying constraint of the anticipated construction in L based on Grammar B2 . to support production of construction in L . and by reasoning about the likely cause of the rule violation . to extend Grammar C - the learner - inherent grammar . And secondly , this above description of feedback given by a grammar checker which is based on a modified parser shows that it is possible to construct tools that support the focus on form by learners during the reflection stage of a text production process . Even if the grammar checker were only to detect a small number of morpho - syntactic errors , this would be beneficial for the learners as long as they were aware of the limitations of this CALL tool . On the other hand , the feedback description contains still a number of question marks in parentheses after some of the important keywords - whether the intended aims of grammar checking can be achieved can only be validated through the use and thorough testing of such a grammar checker . We should better not make any such assumption ( in the scientific sense - we do hope for these improvements , of course ) and better wait until such a parser - based grammar checker is actually tested in a series of proper learning experiments . Let us now leave the discussion of some of the underlying linguistics behind and discuss the role of parser - based applications in language learning . Natural language parsers take written language as their input and produce a formal representation of the syntactic and sometimes semantic structure of this input . The role they have to play in computer - assisted language learning has been under scrutiny in the last decade : ( Matthews 1992a ) ; ( Holland et al . 1993 ) ; ( Nagata 1996 ) . See also Heift ( 2001 ) . Holland et al . discussed the \\\" possibilities and limitations of parser - based language tutors \\\" ( Holland et al . 1993:28 ) . Comparing parser - based CALL to what they label as conventional CALL they come to the conclusion that : . [ ... ] in parser - based CALL the student has relatively free rein and can write a potentially huge variety of sentences . ICALL thus permits practice of production skills , which require recalling and constructing , not just recognising [ as in conventional CALL ] , words and structures . ( Holland et al.1993:31 ) . However , at the same time , parsing imposes certain limitations . Parsers tend to concentrate on the syntax of the textual input , thus \\\" ICALL may actually subvert a principal goal of language pedagogy , that of communicating meanings rather than producing the right forms \\\" ( Holland et al.1993:32 ) . This disadvantage can be avoided by a \\\" focus on form \\\" which is mainly achieved by putting the parser / grammar checker to use within a relevant , authentic communicative task and at a time chosen by and convenient to the learner / text producer . Juozulynas ( 1994 ) evaluated the potential usefulness of syntactic parsers in error diagnosis . He analysed errors in an approximately 400 page corpus of German essays by American college students in second - year language courses . His study shows that : . [ ... ] syntax is the most problematic area , followed by morphology . ( Juozulynas 1994:5 ) . Juozulynas adapted a taxonomic schema by Hendrickson which comprises four categories : syntax , morphology , orthography , lexicon . Juozulynas ' argument for splitting orthography into spelling and punctuation is easily justified in the context of syntactic parsing . Parts of punctuation can be described by using syntactic bracketing rules , and punctuation errors can consequently be dealt with by a syntactic parser . Lexical and spelling errors form , according to Juozulynas , a rather small part of the overall number of learner errors . Some of these errors will , of course , be identified during dictionary look - up , but if words that are in the dictionary are used in a nonsensical way , the parser will not recognise them unless specific error rules ( e.g. for false friends ) are built in . Consequently , a parser - based CALL application can play a useful role in detecting many of the morpho - syntactic errors which constitute a high percentage of learner errors in freely produced texts . Nevertheless , the fact remains : . A second limitation of ICALL is that parsers are not foolproof . Because no parser today can accurately analyse all the syntax of a language , false acceptance and false alarms are inevitable . ( Holland et al . 1993:33 ) . This is something not only developers of parser - based CALL , but also language learners using such software have to take into account . In other words , this limitation of parser - based CALL has to be taken into consideration during the design and implementation process and when integrating this kind of CALL software in the learning process . A final limitation of ICALL is the cost of developing NLP systems . By comparison with simple CALL , NLP development depends on computational linguists and advanced programmers as well as on extensive resources for building and testing grammars . Beyond this , instructional shells and lessons must be built around NLP , incurring the same expense as developing shells and lessons for CALL . ( Holland et al . 1993:33 ) . It is mainly this disadvantage of parser - based CALL that explains the lack of commercially available ( and commercially viable ) CALL applications which make good use of HLT . However , it is to be hoped that this hurdle can be overcome in the not too distant future because sufficient expertise in the area has accumulated over recent years . More and more computer programs make good use of this technology , and many of these have already \\\" entered \\\" the realm of computer - assisted language learning , as can be seen from the examples in the previous section . Holland et al . ( 1993 ) answer their title question \\\" What are parsers good for ? \\\" on the basis of their own experience with BRIDGE , a parser - based CALL program for American military personnel learning German , and on the basis of some initial testing with a small group of experienced learners of German . They present the following points : . ICALL appears to be good for form - focused instruction offering learners the chance to work on their own linguistic errors by this method , not only to improve their performance in the foreign language but also to improve their language awareness . ICALL appears to be good for selected kinds of students . The authors list the following characteristics which might influence the degree of usefulness of ICALL for certain students : . i. intermediate proficiency . ii . analytical orientation . iii . tolerance of ambiguity . iv . confidence as learners . ICALL is good for research because the parser automatically tracks whole sentence responses and detects , classifies , and records errors . It might facilitate the assessment of the students grammatical competency and thus help us discover patterns of acquisition . ICALL [ ... ] can play a role in communicative practice . The authors argue for the embedding of parser - based CALL in \\\" graphics microworlds \\\" which help to capture some basic semantics . Given that we would like to harness the advantages of parser - based CALL , how do we take the limitations into consideration in the process of designing and implementing a parser - based CALL system ? What implications does the use of parsing technology have for human - computer interaction ? [ I]n discourse analytic terms ( Grice 1975 ) , the nature of the contract between student and CALL tutor is straightforward , respecting the traditional assumption that the teacher is right , whereas the ICALL contract is less well defined . ( Holland et al . 1993:33f . ) . The rigidity of traditional CALL in which the program controls the linguistic input by the learner to a very large extent has often given rise to a criticism of CALL which accuses CALL developers and practitioners of relying on behaviourist programmed instruction . If one wants to give learners full control over their linguistic input , for example , by relying on parsing technology , what are then the terms according to which the communicative interaction of computer ( program ) and learner can be defined ? The differences between humans and machines have obviously to be taken into consideration in order to understand the interaction of learners with CALL programs : . Machines are compiled out of individual parts for a very specific purpose ( totum fix et partibus ) ; whereas humans are holistic entities whose parts can be differentiated ( partes fiunt ex toto ) . Humans process all sorts of experiences and repeatedly and interactively create their own environment - something machines can not do . They \\\" calculate \\\" a problem on the basis of pre - wired rules . The main features of human thoughts are the inherent contradictions and the ability to cope with them , something that will not be calculable due to its complexity , variety and degree of detail ( Schmitz 1992:209f . ) . These differences between humans and machines can for our purposes , i.e. the theoretical description of human - computer interaction , be legitimately reduced to the distinction between actions and operations as is done in Activity Theory . The main point of this theory for our consideration here is that communicative activities can be divided into actions which are intentional , i.e. goal - driven ; and these can be sub - divided into operations which are condition - triggered . These operations are normally learnt as actions . In the example referred to in the quotation above , the gear - switching is learnt as an action . The learner - driver is asked by the driving instructor to change gear and this becomes the goal of the learner . Once the learner - driver has performed this action a sufficient number of times , this action becomes more and more automated and in the process loses more and more of its intentionality . A proficient driver might have the goal to accelerate the car which will necessitate switching into higher gear , but this is now triggered by a condition ( the difference between engine speed and speed of the car ) . It can thus be argued that humans learn to perform complex actions by learning to perform certain operations in a certain order . Machines , on the other hand , are only made to perform certain ( sometimes rather complex ) operations . This has some bearing on our understanding of the human - computer interaction that takes place when a learner uses language - learning software . When , for instance , the spell checker is started in a word - processing package , the software certainly does not have ' proof - read ' the learner 's document . The computer just responds to the clicking of the spellchecker menu item and performs the operation of checking the strings in the document against the entries in a machine dictionary . For the computer user ( in our case a learner ) , it might look like the computer is proof - reading the document . Normally , one only realises that no \\\" proper \\\" document checking is going on if a correctly spelled word is not found in the dictionary or nonsensical alternatives are given for a simple spelling error . Person X interacts with Person Y in that he observes Person Y 's action , reasons about the likely intention for that action and reacts according to this assumed intention . This , for example , explains why many learners get just as frustrated when an answer they believe to be right is rejected by the computer as they would get if it were rejected by their tutor . Of course , an ideal computer - assisted language learning system would avoid such pitfalls and not reject a correct response or overlook an incorrect one . Since any existing system can only approximate to this ideal , researchers and developers in parser - based CALL can only attempt to build systems that can perform complex structured sequences of ( linguistic ) operations so that learners can interact meaningfully and successfully with the computer . Grammatica is able to identify parts of speech in English and French with a fair degree of accuracy and show , for example , how verbs are conjugated in different tenses and how plurals of nouns are formed .

Different features have different relevance to a particular learning problem . Some features are less relevant ; while some very important . Instead of selecting the most relevant features using feature selection , an algorithm can be given this knowledge of feature importance based on expert opinion or prior learning . Learning can be faster and more accurate if learners take feature importance into account . Correlation aided Neural Networks ( CANN ) is presented which is such an algorithm . CANN treats feature importance as the correlation coefficient between the target attribute and the features . CANN modifies normal feed - forward Neural Network to fit both correlation values and training data . Empirical evaluation shows that CANN is faster and more accurate than applying the two step approach of feature selection and then using normal learning algorithms . Keywords : .

It is not intended to be a collection of CALL resources for use by language teachers in the classroom for teaching a specific language or by individual learners studying a language independently . There are links to some CALL resources in the individual modules ( see the Contents page ) , and you may find the Glossary useful as it acts both as a glossary of ICT and CALL terminology and as an index to the ICT4LT site as a whole . If you are looking for CALL resources see the following : . Graham Davies 's Favourite Websites page . This is a set of 500 + categorised and annotated links to online and offline CALL resources . Teachers ' discussion lists , blogs and wikis are good places to look for CALL resources : see Section 12 , Module 1.5 . The BBC 's WebWise learning materials are very useful for beginners . They cover the basics of using a computer and also include information on using the Web , email , social media , and safety and privacy issues . For more experienced computer users , Russell Stannard has created an excellent set of Teacher Training Videos for a range of ICT applications . The Training Zone at the website Centre for Information on Language Teaching ( CILT ) offers continuing professional development materials for teachers of languages to students aged 14 - 19 . The materials include a number of tutorials on using ICT . web2practice : A set of video guides to help lecturers , researchers and administrators to get started with Web 2.0 technologies . Produced by Will Allen and Steve Boneham of Netskills with funding from the JISC Users & Innovation Programme . The following topics are covered : . Social media . Microblogging . Podcasting . RSS feeds . Collaborative writing . In order to enable you to assess what you already know and need to now about ICT we have created a downloadable Word document containing a set of \\\" can do \\\" lists : ICT_Can_Do_Lists . The document is designed for : . trainers , to enable them to identify trainees ' strengths and weaknesses in ICT ; . language teachers undergoing training , to enable them to assess the development of their own ICT skills , experience and understanding . The \\\" can do \\\" document covers selected generic applications ( e.g. Word , browsers , email software , PowerPoint ) and software applications that are particularly useful for language teachers . Under the heading for each application there is a range of essential tasks that the teacher should be able to carry out in order to feel comfortable working with the software - a so - called \\\" can do \\\" list . The applications and the tasks have been selected according to their usefulness for teaching foreign languages . Teachers ' discussion lists , blogs and wikis are good places to look for ICT training resources : see Section 12 , Module 1.5 . In recent years there has been an increasing demand for training in the use of virtual worlds in language learning and teaching . Section 14.2.1 , Module 1.5 is an expanding section of the ICT4LT site that focuses on the virtual world of Second Life . Learning how to use a Second Life will take some time , but it is worth the effort ! Graham Davies aims to make your Second Life learning curve a little easier with this set of tutorial materials in Word format : Introduction to the Second Life Viewer . The materials take you step - by - step through the basics and include many links to other resources on the Web , including YouTube videos . Module 1.5 , Module 2.3 and Module 3.3 all focus on the Internet and the World Wide Web . Specific lists of links can be found in the bibliography and references section of each of these three modules . The list of links here is limited to links relating to topics dealt with in other ICT4LT modules , plus a number of official government sites , EU sites and Council of Europe sites . For a comprehensive list of links relating to language learning and teaching see Graham Davies 's Favourite Websites page . This is a bigger and more detailed set of links than those listed below , and it 's updated every week . The Ashcombe School 's Modern Foreign Languages website : Lots of materials , advice , software evaluations , worksheets , exercises for different languages , etc . A comprehensive and well maintained site - a lot more useful than most of the sites maintained by UK government agencies . See Case Study 5 in Module 3.1 , Managing a multimedia language centre . BECTA : The Council for Educational Technology ( CET ) , a forerunner of the British Educational and Communications Technology Agency ( BECTA ) , began to be active in the area of Modern Foreign Languages / ICT in the late 1970s . In 1981 the CET joined forces with CILT in the organisation of the first major conference focusing on Modern Foreign Languages / ICT . A number of Modern Foreign Languages software packages and Modern Foreign Languages / ICT printed publications were produced under the MEP initiative . A national centre , the Microelectronics Education Support Unit ( MESU ) , was then set up as a successor to the CET . The MESU was renamed the National Council for Educational Technology ( NCET ) , to be renamed yet again ( in 2000 ) as BECTA . BECTA was finally closed down in January 2011 . Its purpose is to enhance the UK 's reputation in the world as a valued partner . It does this by creating opportunities for people worldwide with programmes in education , English language teaching , the arts , science , governance and information through a network of 230 offices and teaching centres in 109 countries . The British Council receives a grant - in - aid from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) and earns income from teaching English , conducting British examinations and managing development and training contracts . CALL@Hull : Fred Riley 's website . Contains some of the resources originally located at the website of the CTICML and the C&IT Centre , University of Hull - both now defunct . CEMLL ( Centre for Excellence in Multimedia Language Learning ) : Based in the School of Languages and Literature at the University of Ulster , the focus of CEMLL is to research the use of computer - based multimedia teaching facilities and develop appropriate teaching methods . CEMLL 's approach to multimedia language learning is to integrate use of digital technology in class to promote active engagement and to support dynamic intervention . CILT : The Centre for Information on Language Teaching ( UK ) . Now known as The National Centre for Languages , which is a single national body embracing CILT and the Languages National Training Organisation ( LNTO ) . CILT was a founder partner in the ICT4LT project . CTICML , University of Hull : The CTICML ( Computers in Teaching Initiatitive Centre for Modern Languages ) was established at the University of Hull in 1989 . It was renamed the C&IT Centre in 2000 and finally closed down in 2002 , bringing to an end a long association between Hull and language learning technology . Some C&IT / CTICML resources were integrated into the Centre for Languages , Linguistics , and Area Studies ( LLAS ) , University of Southampton . Other resources have been integrated into the EUROCALL website and CALL@Hull , Fred Riley 's website . Department for Education ( DfE ) : The Department for Children , Schools and Families ( DCSF ) changed its name in May 2010 to the Department for Education ( DfE ) . Education Forum : An international forum which enables anyone from all over the world interested in education to post information , ask questions , and to take part in debates about education . The forum also helps teachers to find partners for subject specific and cross - curricular curriculum projects . It is hoped that the forum will provide a world community of teachers . European Centre for Modern Languages ( ECML ) : The Council of Europe 's centre in Graz , Austria . The ECML runs regular workshops for teachers of foreign languages , including workshops on ICT . European Computer Driving Licence ( ECDL ) : An internationally recognised qualification in ICT . See also the ECDL for Schools . which is designed specifically to help teachers , support staff and ICT coordinators develop practical computing skills for teaching and learning in the classroom and leads to an internationally recognised level of certification . Includes a Policy Group on New Technologies and Language Learning . Futurelab : A high - tech educational initiative . GetGED.org - GED preparation resources and study kits to help individuals prepare for the GED test or to continue their higher education . iLoveLanguages : A comprehensive guide to language - related Web sites . Tyler Chambers ( n\\u00e9 Jones ) is a great gatherer of information about foreign languages . Internet Archive : Also known as the Wayback Machine . Dead links on the Web are a growing problem . You find a nice site , bookmark it , or add it to a list of links like this one , and the next time that you try to access it , it 's gone or , worse still , it 's been transmogrified into an offensive site . Linkrot is a growing disease . It was estimated that in 1999 nearly 30 % of the links on the Web were dead - and the situation is certainly a lot worse now . Language Learning and Technology : A refereed journal , available only on the Web . Language Testing : See the module on Computer Aided Assessment ( CAA ) and language learning : Module 4.1 . See also DIALANG . Linguanet Worldwide : A multilingual project which developed out of the original Linguanet project ( now defunct ) . A substantial online catalogue of language learning resources is being built up here . The Open University Faculty of Education and Language Studies : The Open University offers distance learning courses in foreign languages . Study materials include printed course books and audio materials that cover survival language for the traveller as well as the communication skills needed in a range of settings , at home , work or leisure . The Open University makes use of both face - to - face tuition and online tuition using Moodle . See also this page : What is distance learning ? Virtual Round Table : The Virtual Round Table conference is a semi - annual live online conference on language learning technologies . Viruses , spam , adware and spyware : See Graham Davies 's Cautionary Tale , in which he describes his own experience with viruses , how to get rid of viruses and recent virus threats . The funding period came to an end in August 2001 and the project and website are now inactive . Authoring tools . See Module 2.5 , Introduction to CALL authoring programs . This module describes a number of different online and offlline authoring tools . See especially Section 6 , Module 2.5 , headed Language - specific tools for a multimedia age . . . Hot Potatoes : An authoring tool that was created by Martin Holmes and Stewart Arneil at the University of Victoria , Canada , and launched in 1998 . It enables the speedy creation of Web - based exercises for language learners , including multiple choice , gap - filling , matching , jumbled sentences , crosswords and short text entry . This authoring tool has proved extremely popular with language teachers and it continues to be used extensively for the creation of interactive exercises and tests on the Web . Markin was developed as a marking system for courses delivered via the Internet . It can produce marked work in the form of HTML files that can be delivered back to students and viewed by them in a Web browser , or as RTF files that can be viewed in a word - processor . AsiaCALL publishes the AsiaCALL Online Journal . Association for Language Learning ( ALL ) : The UK 's major association for language teachers . Most members are drawn from the primary and secondary school sectors , but membership is open to all language teachers . The website contains lots of information and useful links . ALL also maintains a discussion list known as ALLNET .

Incorporating influences traditionally associated with sociology and anthropology , socio - constructivism emphasizes the impact of collaboration , and negotiation on thinking and learning . A central notion in socio - constructivism is assisted learning , a concept that is influenced by socio - culturalism and its concept of proximal learning . Some also would include situatedness , i.e. interaction with the social and physical context . ( 1 ) A first form of socio - constructivism can be defined as an approach according to which individual knowledge relies on its social construction of it . ( Piaget , Doise and Mugny , 1984 ) . Especially relevant in this respect are the communication processes ( learning dialogs ) occurring in situations where at least two persons try to solve a problem . The social world of a learner includes the people that directly affect that person , including teachers , friends , students , administrators , and participants in all forms of activities . Accordingly , learning designs should enhance local collaboration and dialogue but also engage other actors ( e.g. domain experts ) to participate in certain ways . Research on collaborative learning is particularly interested in learning mechanisms that are triggered by specific collaborative activities . ( 2 ) Some authors identify with social constructivism or socio - cultural theory and trace their ideas back to Vygotsky ( 1978 ) , who focussed on the roles that society plays in the development of an individual . Assisted learning for example , occurs in the now - familiar zone of proximal development ( Vygotsky , 1978 ) where more able others actively scaffold the individual 's performance at a level beyond which the individual could perform alone . As Butterworth ( 1982 ) pointed out , their opposition has been exaggerated . Both authors acknowledge the intertwined social and individual aspects of development , but they attribute the primacy to the individual ( for Piaget ) or to the social environment ( for Vygotsky ) . ( 3 ) Some contemporary cognitive theorists and that belong to a situated cognition school of thought ( Lave , 1988 ) have expanded social learning to give nonsocial aspects of the environment an active role in the individual 's learning as well . Rather than a solitary process , these newer perspectives assume that effective learning occurs via interaction with and support from people and physical artefacts ( Suchman , 1987 ) . ( 4 ) Finally , distributed cognition views cognition as fundamentally ' shared ' or ' distributed ' over individuals . The distributed cognition approach is closer to the Vygotskyan position than to the Piagetian view since it considers the group rather than individual as the primary unit of analysis ( Resnick , 1991 ) . By its focus on social structure , distributed cognition is deeply intertwined with the ' situated cognition ' theory . Many publications address the issue to what extent different theories address different facets of learning . E.g. Cobb ( 1994 ) examines whether the \\\" mind \\\" is located in the head or in social action , and argues that both perspectives should be used in concert , as they are each as useful as the other . What is seen from one perspective as reasoning of a collection of individuals mutually adapting to each other 's actions can be seen in another as the norms and practices of a classroom community ( Cobb , 1998 ) . This dialectic is examined in more detail by Salomon and Perkins ( 1998 ) , who suggest ways that these \\\" acquisition \\\" and \\\" participation \\\" metaphors of learning interrelate and interact in synergistic ways . They model the social entity as a learner ( for example , a football team , a business or a family ) , compare it with the learning of an individual in a social setting , and identify three main types of relations : . Individual learning can be less or more socially - mediated learning . Individuals can participate in the learning of a collective , sometimes with what is learned distributed throughout the collective more than in the mind of any one individual . Individuals and social aspects of learning in both of these senses , can interact over time to strengthen one another in a ' reciprocal spiral relationship ' . 3 Pedagogic models . Teaching strategies using social constructivism as a referent include teaching in contexts that might be personally meaningful to students , negotiating taken - as - shared meanings with students , class discussion , small - group collaboration , and valuing meaningful activity over correct answers ( Wood et al , 1995 ) . Cobb ( 1994 ) contrasts the approach of delivering mathematics as \\\" content \\\" against the technique of fostering the emergence of mathematical ideas from the collective practices of the classroom community . Emphasis is growing on the teacher 's use of multiple epistemologies , to maintain dialectic tension between teacher guidance and student - initiated exploration , as well as between social learning and individual learning . Key functionalities of a socio - constructivist learning environment are : . Reflection & Exchange . Scaffolding & Storyboarding . Facilitation & Content . Monitoring & Assessment . Production , Investigation etc . . Psychological support & Community . In the last few years , socio - constructivism is often associated with scandinavian pedagogical reform . E.g. Manninen defines criteria for innovations ( in vocational training ) on the basis of \\\" good learning \\\" defined in \\\" cognitive learning model ( Engestr\\u00f6m 1988 ) , constructivism ( eg . Duffy & Jonassen 1992 ) , Self - Directed Learning , Open and Contextual Learning Environments ( Kauppi 1995 , Manninen 2000 ) , Web - based Learning Environments and Computer Mediated Communication ( eg . Paulsen 1995 , Matikainen & Manninen 2000 ) , Collaborative Learning ( Johnson & Johnson 1987 ) , Problem Based Learning ( Hakkarainen & al . 1999 ) , Transformative Learning ( Mezirow 1991 ) , Developmental work research and Activity Theory ( eg . Engestr\\u00f6m 1999 ) , Project Based Learning ( Miettinen & al . 1999 ) , Learning at Work -approaches , and models based on Cognitive and Collective Development of Expertise ( Bereiter & Scardamalia 1993 , Lave & Wenger 1991 ) . \\\" The authors of this report then present the following table which in our opinion also can be used to measure \\\" innovative \\\" constructivist learning in other settings than vocational training . Criteria . Ordinary vs. . Innovative . Constructiveness . Teaching does not pay much attention to how the subject matter is integrated in the existing knowledge structures of the student . Teaching and learning are clearly based on the learners active construction process and on the creation of higher level knowledge structures . Activeness . Learning environment does not support nor require the learner 's own active role in the learning process . Learning environment is based on the learner 's active role and commitment . Cooperativeness . Learning takes place mainly alone . Learning is based on cooperative and collaborative principles and takes place in groups . Contextuality . Learning takes place in an institution and/or is separated from the concrete situation of application of the knowledge . Learning takes place in a simulated or real - life situation , which equals the actual context where the knowledge will be applied . Problem based . Study objectives are based on study subjects in a traditional way , and cut into separate units in the curriculum . Learning approach is problem based and investigative . Ruokamo et al . ( 2002 ) in their article on pedagogical models in the design and assment of network - based university education came up with a similar list of criteria . The following list is a slightly amputated and modified copy ( plase read the orginnal and from which we also removed references in Finish since not many people are fluent in that language . DSchneider also will adapt this list to the terminology used in various other articles in this wiki ) . Constructive and Cumulative . Students build new knowledge upon the basis of their earlier knowledge ( de Corte 1995 ; Jonassen 1995 ; Lehtinen 1997 ; Ruokamo & Pohjolainen 1999 ; Mannisenm\\u00e4ki 2000 ; Nevgi & Tirri 2001 ) . The teacher should construct pedagogical scenarios in such a way that a student can build on his or her prior knowledge ( Tella et al . 2001 ) . Active and Self - Directed . The roles of the students and other members of the learning community are active . The students commit themselves to objective - oriented ( Uljens 1997 ) and sensible processing , for which they are responsible . ( Jonassen 1995 ; de Corte 1995 ; Lehtinen 1997 ; Ruokamo & Pohjolainen 1999 ; Mannisenm\\u00e4ki 2000 ; Nevgi & Tirri 2001 . ) 2b . Sharing and Community . [ category split off from 2 . by DSchneider ] : A learning and studying environment enables a new kind of teacher - student relationship , which emphasizes communalism and the personal expertise of the students . ( Sinko & Lehtinen 1998 ; Manninen et al . 2000 . ) Students are encouraged to express new ideas and models of thinking and to engage in knowledge building activities . This way the entire community can see and profit from the ' media traces ' born during the process of learning ( Sharan & Sharan 1992 ; Vahtivuori , Wager & Passi 1999 ; Mannisenm\\u00e4ki 2000 ; Tella et al . 2001 ) . Cooperative and Communal . Students work together and build new knowledge in cooperation with one another while benefiting from the knowledge and skills of others ( de Corte 1995 ; Jonassen 1995 ; Lehtinen 1997 ; Ruokamo & Pohjolainen 1999 ; Mannisenm\\u00e4ki 2000 ; Nevgi & Tirri 2001 ) . Communalism is also embedded in dialogic thought ( cf . Vygotsky 1934/1962 ; Vahtivuori , Wager & Passi 1999 ; Tella et al . 2001 ) . Based on the theory of shared expertise , social interaction and communal modes of learning and studying are emphasized . The teacher as tutor is expected to maintain dialog and contact with the students in network - based education ( NBE ) ( Passi & Vahtivuori 1998 ; Sinko & Lehtinen 1998 ; Ruokamo & Pohjolainen 1999 ; Manninen et al . 1999 ; 2000 . ) Conversational and Interactive . A central element of the teaching - studying - learning ( TSL ) process on the net is dialog ( Jonassen 1995 ; Tella & Mononen - Aaltonen 1998 ; Mannisenm\\u00e4ki 2000 ) . Dialog and dialogic communication , i.e. , comprehensive understanding of and respect for one another as well as interaction and interactivity are at the core of NBE ( Tella & Mononen - Aaltonen 1998 ) . Many different channels of communication should be used , e.g. common and shared conversation and working spaces in which documents can be worked on together ( e.g. wikis ) . Contextual and Situational . On a side - note , gaining experiences in NBE is at least as important as in the face - to - face TSL process ( Ackermann 1994 ; Boud & Feletti 1999 ; Vahtivuori 2001 ) . 5b Simulations and Microworlds [ split off from 5 by DKS ] ] Among other things , simulations , videos , Internet links , implementations in the microworlds and applied problem - based situations are used in the learning and studying environment ( Mannisenm\\u00e4ki 2000 ) . Especially promising are on - line strategic and role games that include the principles and criteria linked to the community and experience ( Vahtivuori 2001 ) . Transferable . Students know how to use their knowledge and skills in other situations and how to learn , adopt and benefit from them when learning new topics ( Ruokamo & Pohjolainen 1999 ; Mannisenm\\u00e4ki 2000 ; Nevgi & Tirri 2001 ) . A learning and studying environment supports emerging learning skills , problem solving skills and the skills of self - directed learning . ( Sinko & Lehtinen 1998 ; Manninen et al . 2000 . ) A learning and studying environment includes cognitive tools , hypertext , professional systems , and databanks that underpin meaningful learning ( Mannisenm\\u00e4ki 2000 ) . Goal - Oriented and Purposive . Students achieve a cognitive goal proactively . They can define and set objectives of their own ( de Corte 1995 ; Jonassen 1995 ; Lehtinen 1997 ; Ruokamo & Pohjolainen 1999 ; Mannisenm\\u00e4ki 2000 ) . The guidance and support given by the teacher are related to goal - oriented and purposive studying ( Uljens 1997 ; Mononen - Aaltonen 1999 ) . Self - guidance and a genuine attempt to learn also contribute to creating a learning and studying environment ( Sinko & Lehtinen 1998 ; Manninen et al . 2000 ) . A learning environment includes various tools for planning and monitoring one 's learning process ( see self - regulation . Here , a teacher helps to support the materialization of his or her own curriculum ( Manninen et al . 1999 ; Mannisenm\\u00e4ki 2000 ) ( see learning e - portfolios ) . Guided . Learning itself as well as the learner 's assessment of his or her own skill are promoted by the teacher and by the feedback and support from other students and actors ( cf . Vygotsky 1934/1962 ; Nevgi & Tirri 2001 ) . Roles can become multi - facetted , e.g. students and teachers take turns in acting as guides and experts . ( Tella et al . 2001 . ) Learning environments must provide facilities for e - tutoring and e - coaching . Individual . Humans have individual learning styles and strategies . Learning and studying are always influenced by the students ' prior knowledge , concepts of learning , foci of interest and motivation ( de Corte 1995 ; Lehtinen 1997 ) . A learning and studying environment is basically individual ( Nevgi & Tirri 2001 ) , that is , it is never the same to all students . Learners can construct their own individualized interpretation of the challenges and opportunities posed by the environment . Reflective . Learners express what they have learnt and they examine the thinking processes and decisions required by the learning process ( Jonassen 1995 ; Ruokamo & Pohjolainen 1999 , Mannisenm\\u00e4ki 2000 ; Nevgi & Tirri 2001 ) . Information retrieval and processing as well as the skills of critical assessment are emphasized in the modern learning environment ( Sinko & Lehtinen 1998 ; Manninen et al . 2000 ) . A learning environment includes the tools , such as diaries and the tools for a learning e - portfolio , necessary to support the assessment of one 's learning and active output ( Mannisenm\\u00e4ki 2000 ) . Abstract . Learning can be defined as the construction of new ideas at an abstract level ; the development of theoretical ideas reaches from practical experience to the deeper level ( Lehtinen 1997 ) . The learning and studying environment enables students to review the socio - constructive process of abstract scientific theories and ideals ( Lehtinen 1997 ) . Here , the support given by the teacher is the more important the younger the students are . DSchneider believes that good socio - constructivist designs do not need to be \\\" feature - complete \\\" according to such lists . Also , to make sure that students can follow their preferred learning style is simply incompatible with more sophisticated collaborative storyboards that are popular in CSCL . Finally , too strong guidance conflicts with the idea that learners should learn to plan and develop learning strategies . The good question to ask is \\\" what are the learning goals \\\" ?

Eggs and larvae of anchoveta Engraulis ringens off northern Chile during the 1997 - 1998 El Ni\\u00f1o event .

The impact of the El Ni\\u00f1o event ( 1997 - 1998 ) on the spatial dynamics as well as on the changes in the aggregation patterns of anchoveta eggs and larvae due to the alteration in the thermal anomalies were analyzed . The increase in zooplankton biomass linked to a change in the species composition suggests a negative impact on the anchoveta larval feeding . Our results suggest that abrupt changes in the environment would have immediate consequences on the spatial distribution of anchoveta in early life stages , causing a potential impact on the recruitment of this small pelagic fish in the Humboldt Current System off northern Chile . Key words : Chile - Humboldt Current System , fish larvae , thermal anomaly , coastal upwelling , zooplankton . The coastal upwelling zone of the Humboldt Current System ( HCS ) in the eastern South Pacific is well known for its high primary productivity ( up to 20 g C m -2 d -1 , Daneri et al . 2000 , Montero et al . 2007 ) , which sustains high zooplankton biomass and abundance of coastal and oceanic small pelagic fish such as anchoveta , sardine ( Cushing 1990 ) , horse mackerel ( Alheit & Bernal 1993 , Cubillos et al . 2008 ) and sculpin ( Landaeta et al . High coastal productivity is sustained mainly by the fertilizing effect of the coastal upwelling driven by equatorward alongshore wind stress , producing important nutrient supply to the euphotic zone above the continental shelf . Also , the offshore propagation of mesoscale eddies and meandering currents contributes significantly to expanding the area of high chlorophyll concentration beyond the coastal upwelling centre ( Correa - Ramirez et al . The HCS is subject to strong inter - annual variability due to the effects of the El Ni\\u00f1o Southern Oscillation events ( ENSO ) . Probably due to the catastrophic collapse of the Peruvian fisheries after the 1972 - 1973 El Ni\\u00f1o event , much of the actual knowledge about the effects of the ENSO over the HCS region comes from studies on Peruvian ecosystems . Numerous reports have approached both the physical variability ( Fahrbach et al . 1991 ) and the biological consequences of the El Ni\\u00f1o event on the pelagic ecosystems ( Barber & Chavez 1983 , 1986 , Thomas et al . 2001 ) , benthic communities ( Tarazona et al . 1988 , Arntz & Tarazona 1990 ) , and fisheries ( Alamo & Bouchon 1987 , Arntz & Tarazona 1990 ) . For Chilean waters , the warm phase of ENSO events negatively affects the settlement of gastropods ( Moreno et al . 1998 ) , cohort somatic growth and survival rates of coastal fishes ( Hern\\u00e1ndez - Miranda & Ojeda 2006 ) , abundance and composition of pelagic copepods ( Hidalgo & Escribano 2001 ) and larval fishes ( Rodriguez - Gra\\u00f1a & Castro 2003 , Landaeta et al . However , during El Ni\\u00f1o , the diversity of marine fishes increases ( Kong et al . 1985 ) as well as the biomass of the calanoid copepod Calanus chilensis ( Escribano & Hidalgo 2000 ) . Some reports on the upwelling systems off northern Chile ( 18\\u00ba-30\\u00baS ) have shown inter - annual fluctuation in the anchoveta catches ( Blanco et al . 2001 ) along with changes in the composition and abundance of plankton communities ( Iriarte et al . 2000 , Gonz\\u00e1lez et al . During the El Ni\\u00f1o of 1997 - 1998 the phytoplankton community off Antofagasta ( 23 \\u00b0 38 'S , 70 \\u00b0 24'W ) was mainly composed of small species , including diatoms and autotrophic flagellates . The zooplankton community off northern Chile during non - El Ni\\u00f1o conditions was dominated mostly by large copepods and euphausiids endemic to the HCS ( Hidalgo & Escribano 2001 , Fern\\u00e1ndez et al . However , time - series data of zooplankton from the Antofagasta coast show a substitution toward small - sized species , although in general terms the total biomass close to the coast did not suffer a sudden collapse in comparison with previous years ( Ulloa et al . Regarding the commercially important pelagic species from northern Chile , the anchoveta Engraulis ringens is a fast growing species inhabiting coastal zones with high productivity rates ( Bertrand et al . 2004a ) , whereas the sardine Sardinops sagax is associated to oceanic waters and frontal zones between these zones and the coastal waters ( Castillo et al . 1996 , Bertrand et al . 2004a ) . Anchoveta stocks in northern Chile are restricted to a temperature range fluctuating between 12\\u00ba-18\\u00baC during austral winter ( unpublished data ) . 2000 , 2009 , Hern\\u00e1ndez & Castro 2000 , Bustos et al . Low oxygen concentrations in subsurface waters of coastal upwelling zones might also affect zoo- and ichthyoplankton vertical distribution ( Pavez et al . 1996 , Giesecke & Gonz\\u00e1lez 2004 ) . The limits of temperature and oxygen tolerance for anchoveta and sardine in this region have been reported to fluctuate between 14\\u00ba-21 \\u00b0 C and 16\\u00ba-23 \\u00b0 C , and between 1.8 ml L -1 and 2.0 ml L -1 respectively . These factors are often closely related ( Morales et al . The above mentioned oxygen concentrations are found at 30 m depth and may be responsible for a restricted vertical distribution of the anchoveta . Climatic changes at different time scales would be the responsible factors causing alterations to both the aggregation and spawning patterns of pelagic fish associated to coastal upwelling environments ( Chavez et al . 2003 , Bertrand et al . 2004a ) . Consequently we hypothesized that the spatial distribution of early life stages of anchoveta in coastal areas of northern Chile changed as El Ni\\u00f1o 1997 - 98 event developed . MATERIALS AND METHODS . Oceanographic sampling . During 1996 , 1997 and 1998 , the Instituto de Fomento Pesquero ( IFOP ) carried out six oceanographic cruises off northern Chile between Arica ( 18\\u00ba50 'S ) and Antofagasta ( 23\\u00ba65\\u00b4S ) . According to the recorded values of sea - surface temperature ( SST ) and thermal anomaly changes , the cruises were grouped into two categories : Before El Ni\\u00f1o ( Cruises 1 - 2 - 3 ) and During El Ni\\u00f1o ( Cruises 4 - 5 - 6 ) . At each station , data on the temperature ( \\u00b0 C ) , salinity ( PSU ) and dissolved oxygen content ( ml L -1 ) , were obtained from the surface to 600 m by means of a SENSORIAL CTD OCEAN model OS 200 . Inter - annual variability in the monthly anomalies of SST was estimated by subtracting the average annual cycle in the period 1966 - 1999 . Satellite NOAA images of SST were used in the analysis of the evolution of the El Ni\\u00f1o event for the period 1995 - 1999 . Off the northern Chilean coast ( 18\\u00ba50'-23\\u00ba65 'S ) monthly averages of SST were obtained and subsequently monthly anomalies were calculated using the climatologically distribution average of SST in the study area . Figure 1 . Geographic location of stations and transect off the northern coast of Chile . The continuous and discontinuous line shows the location of coastal and oceanic stations , respectively Figura 1 . Localizaci\\u00f3n geogr\\u00e1fica de las estaciones y transectos frente a las costas del norte de Chile . Las l\\u00edneas continua y discontinua muestran la ubicaci\\u00f3n de las estaciones costeras y oce\\u00e1nicas , respectivamente . Sampling and analysis of ichthyoplankton . Zooplankton was collected through stratified vertical samplings ( 0 - 20 ; 20 - 60 and 60 - 100 m depth ) . A WP-2 net was utilized , with an opening mouth of 57 cm diameter ( 0.25 m 2 mouth area ) , total length of 261 cm and 297 \\u00b5m mesh size , equipped with a double opening - closing system , and a calibrated TSK flowmeter . A total of 204 samples were collected throughout the surveys , and preserved in 4 % buffered formalin . In the laboratory , anchoveta eggs and larvae were removed for counting and identification , following Orellana & Balbont\\u00edn ( 1983 ) . Zooplankton biomass was measured through displaced volume of wet weight . The number of individuals collected in the different sampling strata was standardized to a number per unit of volume of filtered water ( densities ) : 1,000 m 3 for fish larvae ( densities ) for comparisons in the vertical axis ( mean depth ) . The integrated abundance of eggs and larvae in the water column ( larvae 10 m -2 ) was also estimated for each sampling station . For the analysis and display of spatial information GIS , ArcView version 3.3 ( ESRI 1996 ) was utilized . Data were analyzed using raster or grid models ( Bosque - Sendra 1992 ) . Files that contained the physical and biological attributes collected at each station were converted into SHAPE files . Coverage of points for each cruise was generated from these files . Furthermore , continuous surface grids were generated through the interpolation method , which were subsequently analyzed using the SURFACE module from ArcView . The grids were conducted at a distance of 10 km between points using a surface interpolation technique : IDW ( Jongman et al . 1995 ) , this method assumes that each point has a local influence that decreases with distance and does not require a semi - variogram . The IDW interpolation was used to generate grids of thermal anomaly , calculated on the basis of average monthly sea - surface temperature for the different cruises . Data processing . Kruskal - Wallis test ( 1952 ) was applied to determine differences within eggs and larvae abundance and zooplankton biomass , using the location of the stations ( coastal / oceanic ) and periods ( Before El Ni\\u00f1o / During El Ni\\u00f1o ) as factors . To investigate the relationship between oceanographic variables and the anchoveta larvae and egg abundance as well as zooplankton biomass , Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) was utilized ( Jongmann et al . 1995 ) , over log ( x+1 ) transformed data to homogenize variances . This technique consists of identifying ' a minimum set of functional components ' ( oceanographic variables ) to explain the distribution of dependent variables ( larvae and eggs distribution ) . The Spearman correlation analysis ( Hays 1981 ) was utilized to investigate changes in the relationships between biological ( i.e . , anchoveta eggs - larvae and zooplankton abundance ) and physical variables ( i.e. , SST , thermal anomalies , salinity and oxygen ) during different El Ni\\u00f1o conditions . All statistical analyses were conducted using STATISTICA 7.0 software package . RESULTS . Physical environmental anomalies before El Ni\\u00f1o . The spatial distribution of sea - surface temperature ( SST ; Fig.2 ) registered during September 1996 ( austral spring ) showed values fluctuating between 14.0 - 16.7 \\u00b0 C , with cold zones corresponding to recently upwelled waters ( Fig . 2a ) . For May 1997 ( autumn ) , an increase in the surface temperature was observed with values from 18.0 to 22.4 \\u00b0 C , although some isolated centres of cold water remained nearshore ( Fig . 2b ) . In August 1997 ( winter ) the SST oscillated between 17.5 - 20.6\\u00baC , with a strong presence of warm waters covering an area that includes Bah\\u00eda Mejillones ( Fig . 2c ) . The salinity registered in September 1996 showed values ranging between 34.4 - 34.9 psu , typical for Equatorial Subsurface Waters ( ESSW ) . A small increase in salinity 34.7 - 35.3 psu was observed in May 1997 associated with revenue warm water from a subtropical origin ( Fig . 3 ) . The concentration of dissolved oxygen found during September 1996 , May 1997 and August 1997 showed relatively stable levels ranging between 4.0 - 6.9 ml L -1 ( Table 1 ) . Figure 2 .

The warm SST anomalies reported in the Equatorial Pacific 1 clearly showed the El Ni\\u00f1o events of 1982 - 83 , 1987 , 1991 - 1992 and 1997 - 98 . While these events have been of different intensities , the local SST data shows an increase in anomaly values for coastal areas , mainly associated with upwelling zones ( Fig . 4 ) . According to information , the manifestation of the 1997 - 1998 El Ni\\u00f1o event showed warm water anomalies in May 1997 , reaching values of +1 \\u00b0 C between August and December . Figure 4 .

Distribution and abundance of zooplankton biomass . Periods were characterized by differences in the distribution and abundance of zooplankton . In September 1996 the highest biomass concentrations were located at nearshore stations associated with cold waters . In May 1997 - August 1997 , a clear decrease in zooplankton values associated with the presence of warm waters of subtropical origin were observed ( Fig . 2 ) . An important signal regarding anchoveta egg abundance ( 29,539 eggs per 10 m 2 ) for the nearshore stations off Arica was detected in September 1996 ( Fig . 4 ) . The distribution and abundance of anchoveta larvae in September 1996 was relatively homogenous in most stations . However , two centres of higher larval abundance were found in the stations nearshore to Arica and Rio Loa ( 19,916 and 14,958 ind . per 10 m 2 , respectively ) . In May 1997 , all the stations registered a low abundance of anchoveta eggs and larvae , particularly for nearshore areas ( Figs . 4 and 5 ) . The August 1997 cruise showed a general low abundance of anchoveta eggs and larvae . However , two zones which showed a large abundance of anchoveta eggs ( 71,908 eggs per 10 m 2 ) and larvae ( 17,614 ind . per 10 m 2 ) were found in the nearshore stations of Antofagasta ( Fig . 6 ) . An increase in fish larvae abundance from South to North was found in the study area , mainly associated with surface layers in those nearshore stations . Figure 5 .

Distribuci\\u00f3n vertical de larvas de anchoveta en tres transectas para las diferentes condiciones El Ni\\u00f1o . Physical environmental anomalies during El Ni\\u00f1o . The SST in December 1997 ( austral summer ) demonstrated the arrival of El Ni\\u00f1o to the northern coast of Chile with values of 20.2 - 24.1 \\u00b0 C , with the intrusion of warm waters extending to Antofagasta ( Fig . 2d ) . During February 1998 ( summer ) SST oscillated between 20.6 - 26.2 \\u00b0 C , indicating that the El Ni\\u00f1o condition was maintained in the area ( Fig . 2e ) . In December 1997 the salinity showed values that fluctuated between 34.8 - 35.8 psu typical for Subtropical Surface Waters ( SSW ) . No significant differences were detected in the salinity values before and during El Ni\\u00f1o ( Fig . 3 ) . During December 1997 , February 1998 and May 1998 , a decrease in the maximum oxygen values was also observed ( Table 1 ) . Thermal anomalies . Distribution and abundance of zooplankton biomass . A similar spatial trend was observed during February and May 1998 . However , zooplankton biomass did not differ among cruises nor between El Ni\\u00f1o conditions ( Table 3 ) . Spatial distribution of anchoveta eggs and larvae . Two isolated clusters of anchoveta eggs were registered in nearshore zones off Arica and Antofagasta in December 1997 ( Fig . 4 ) . The abundance of anchoveta larvae was low during the December 1997 cruise . In February 1998 the highest egg density ( 58,937 eggs 10 m -2 ) was collected at the nearshore stations off Antofagasta , where low larval abundance was found . During May 1998 , results showing a low abundance of anchoveta larvae was obtained ( mean \\u00b1 SD , 94 \\u00b1 340 ind . 10 m -2 , Table 2 ) , however restricted only to some nearshore stations off Arica , Rio Loa and Tocopilla . During this period the vertical distribution of anchoveta larvae was influenced by the increase of surface temperature , limiting aggregations near the coast above the 15 \\u00b0 C isotherm and at mid - depths ( 20 - 100 m depth ) ( Fig . 6 ) .

Relationship of biological variables with the different El Ni\\u00f1o conditions . The Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) between biological variables ( e.g . , anchoveta eggs - larvae and zooplankton biomass ) and oceanographic variables before El Ni\\u00f1o showed that the two first components explained 70.19 % of the variance . In this period two types of associations were observed : the first group was composed of biological variables associated with high levels of dissolved oxygen ( 4.5 - 6.7 ml L -1 ) , and the second group was composed only of oceanographic variables ( e.g . , SST ; Salinity ) ( Fig . 7a ) . During the El Ni\\u00f1o , the two first components explained 63.91 % of the variance . Moreover , similarly to the previous period , two other associations were detected : the first group the zooplankton to high values of sea - surface temperature and salinity . The second group was composed of anchoveta eggs and larvae associated with dissolved oxygen ( Fig . 7b ) . Figure 7 .

Relationship between physical and biological variables . Before El Ni\\u00f1o conditions , anchoveta larvae showed a significant positive relationship with thermal anomalies , and a negative relationship with salinity ( Table 4 ) . Anchoveta eggs showed significant negative relationships with SST and salinity . Zooplankton showed positive and significant changes with thermal anomalies and dissolved oxygen concentrations .

Anchoveta larvae showed a negative and significant relationship with salinity values . DISCUSSION . In this study , the abundance of anchoveta eggs and larvae showed variations in their distribution patterns during El Ni\\u00f1o 1997 - 98 conditions , while the traditional spawning sites for anchoveta ( Loeb & Rojas 1988 ) were gradually moved southward as the El Ni\\u00f1o intensified . In the 1997 - 1998 period , the 15 \\u00b0 C isotherm remained at 70 m depth and was located 50 nautical miles offshore while on the surface the physical effects to El Ni\\u00f1o reached central - southern Chile ( Arcos et al . 2002 ) , and the photic layer deepened below 100 m ( Gonzalez et al . Along with the changes in the water bodies associated with the coastal zone , the thermocline , oxycline and minimum oxygen layer ( MOL ) also deepened , causing oxygenation of the subsurface waters near the shelf and shelf break ( Blanco et al . The coastal upwelling persisted during the warm phase ( Carr et al . 2002 ) but the nutricline deepened , thus limiting the input of new nutrients to the photic area and favouring regenerated production ( Carr 2003 ) . The measurements made during these cruises correspond to a transition summer of an El Ni\\u00f1o event ( or Pre - El Ni\\u00f1o , January 1997 ) and an El Ni\\u00f1o Winter ( July 1997 ) . As a result , an anomalous decrease in the frequency and magnitude of upwelling events at the study area also occurred . Based on satellite images of sea surface temperature ( IGOSS , NOAA image ) , it was found that during December 1997 the positive thermal anomaly was approximately 3 - 4 \\u00b0 C ( Gonz\\u00e1lez et al . An immediate consequence to the organisms that face a physical environment with the oceanographic features mentioned above , involves acquiring the ability to continually adjust to the components of low - frequency variation , or to face the risk of being unable to adapt to local conditions ( Bakun 2001 ) . 1996 ) with low concentration values ( approx . 1.0 ml O 2 L -1 ) in its higher limit , associated to the intrusion of water masses of equatorial subsurface origin , as well as to cold waters from coastal upwelling . Thus , the depth attained by the anchoveta larvae through vertical migration could not exceed the upper limit of the minimum oxygen layer . However , a period of environmental stress caused by the El Ni\\u00f1o event has an immediate effect on the anchoveta population which are moving their usual spawning sites southwardly ( Espino 1999 ) . The immediate impact on the anchoveta populations is highlighted through the differences in the distribution patterns observed for its early life stages over the different campaigns . For example , in regards to the cod from the northwest Atlantic , the changes in the aggregation patterns of its larvae had a strong impact on the population dynamics , altering the susceptibility of this species to fishing pressures ( Rose & Kulka 1999 ) . With the arrival of warm surface water during El Ni\\u00f1o conditions , high levels of zooplankton biomass on the northern coast of Chile have been recorded . The presence of warm water masses would produce an ecological replacement of plankton ( Lluch - Belda et al . 2005 ) and a change in the size structure of the zooplankton , from large to a smaller size ( Ulloa et al . This replacement in the phyto- and zooplankton composition could be due mostly to exotic species that differ in shape and size to the actual ones found during cold non - El Ni\\u00f1o conditions ( Gonz\\u00e1lez et al . 2000 , Hidalgo & Escribano 2001 ) . 1996 , Llanos - Rivera et al . Thus , anchoveta are incapable of sustaining growth based exclusively on a diet composed of phytoplankton ( Espinoza et al . Consequently , high mortality rates may result because of a low availability of trophic resources in some coastal areas of northern Chile , forcing the species to use energy storage ( Cubillos et al . 2001 ) that involves changing its reproductive tactics while waiting for favourable environmental conditions ( i.e. , skipping spawning ) . The multivariate analysis showed changes in the relationships between the physical and biological variables during different El Ni\\u00f1o conditions . This suggests that during this period the associations among different variables would not be so strong . During the El Ni\\u00f1o event both anchoveta larvae and eggs show a marked segregation only with oxygen values close to 5 mg L -1 , not so with other hydrographic variables . Thus , it is reasonable to assume that the different distribution patterns of anchoveta eggs and larvae found off the northern Chilean coast would be the result of an ongoing search of favorable environmental conditions that apparently are influenced by oxygen . Changes in the typical reproductive seasonality ( Cubillos et al . 2001 ) of the anchoveta probably represent variability in the distribution of eggs and larvae in relation to environmental alterations in the short , medium and long term . The thermal conditions in northern Chile during periods before and after El Ni\\u00f1o and its relation to the anchoveta distribution patterns partially explain the displacement of anchoveta spawning areas . The effect of the progressive increase in temperature would leave a strip where the spawning is virtually non - existent , except for a few nearshore stations located in Arica and Antofagasta , it was possible to find anchoveta egg cores . Consequently , the distribution patterns of anchoveta larvae in northern Chile were altered as part of a strategy to cope with strong environmental changes . In agreement with Bertrand et al . ( 2004a ) , the anchoveta behaviour seems to be forced by bio - physical requirements as a result of adaptation to highly variable environmental conditions . We believe that events of this magnitude partially explain anchoveta population dynamics because of strong climate changes that occur at different time scales in the HCS , significantly altering the successive recruitment processes in northern Chile after a strong El Ni\\u00f1o event .

Genetic evaluation of dairy cattle using test - day models is now common internationally . In South Africa a fixed regression test - day model is used to generate breeding values for dairy animals on a routine basis . The model is , however , often criticized for erroneously assuming a standard lactation curve for cows in similar contemporary groups and homogeneity of additive genetic variances across lactation and for its inability to account for persistency of lactation . The random regression test - day model has been suggested as a more appropriate method and is currently implemented by several Interbull member - countries . This review traces the development of random regression methods and their adoption in test - day models . Comparisons are drawn with the fixed regression test - day model . The paper discusses reasons for suggesting the adoption of the random regression approach for dairy cattle evaluation in South Africa and identifies the key areas where research efforts should focus . Genetic evaluation of dairy sires and cows has evolved immensely over the years . From the initial stages when simple dam - daughter comparisons were made , rapid advances in computer hardware and improvements in computing algorithms have made it possible to implement modern methods for analysis . Several countries are now using best linear unbiased prediction ( BLUP ) under animal models for national genetic evaluations based either on lactation yields or test - day yields . In South Africa , estimates of breeding values ( BV ) for production traits and somatic cell scores of dairy cattle are based on test - day ( TD ) yields of milk , protein , fat , as well as somatic cell count . Within the National Dairy Animal Improvement Scheme of South Africa , daily yields of milk , protein and fat percentages are recorded every five weeks . These recordings are subsequently used directly in genetic evaluations using a fixed regression test - day model ( Mostert et al . , 2006b ) instead of yields aggregated over 305-days of lactation . A test - day model ( TDM ) is a statistical procedure which considers all genetic and environmental effects directly on a test - day basis ( Swalve , 1995 ) . Data for test - day production of dairy cows provide an example of repeated measures or longitudinal data , the essential feature of which is the presence of correlations between tests on the same animal . It is important to explore the potential of any statistical and computing technique which allows a direct and more efficient utilization of all available test - day records for genetic evaluation of dairy cattle . Use of the TDM approach allows a more detailed statistical model to be developed , which accounts for environmental variation specific to individual TD yields and genetic effects associated with individual animals . It offers the opportunity to directly account for short - term environmental factors specific to individual yields such as gestation period . The TDM also overcomes the need to predict 305-day yields or for projection of incomplete lactations . Furthermore , the TDM allows for precise definition of the contemporary group ( CG ) . With the TD approach , definition of CG including test - month improves the properties of the statistical model . Solutions emanating from such CG effects can be utilized to improve herd management . Within the TDM approach , the genetic component of the lactation curve can be modelled by fitting regression coefficients for each animal , commonly referred to as random regression ( RR ) coefficients ( Schaeffer & Dekkers , 1994 ) . The additive genetic solutions can be extracted from the BV estimates for the RR coefficients ( Jamrozik et al . , 1997 ) . It becomes possible to genetically rank animals for each TD yield by estimating a BV of each animal for each TD yield . The estimated BV is given as a product of the RR coefficients and the days in milk ( DIM ) dependent covariates . Monitoring of management of individual herds and of individual cows within a herd is also an added advantage through the simple comparison between actual and expected production . For the South African Holstein and Jersey cow populations , Mostert et al . ( 2004 ; 2006a ) reported genetic correlations between TD milk yields of different lactations to differ from one . This study led to the implementation of a fixed regression TD model , but recommended the use of RR functions in the genetic evaluation of South African dairy cattle . A random regression TDM approach was first implemented in Canada ( Schaeffer et al . , 2000 ) in 1999 and several countries that are members of Interbull have since adopted various forms of the methodology , including Belgium , Germany , the Netherlands , Italy , Finland , Denmark and Sweden ( Interbull , 2009 ) . Interbull is an international non - profit making organization responsible for promotion , development and standardization of genetic evaluation of dairy cattle . There are currently 27 countries , including South Africa , participating in Interbull evaluations . South Africa participates in international genetic evaluations of dairy cattle conducted by Interbull for which it has been a member since 1999 . The purpose of this review is to describe the random regression methodology in dairy cattle genetic evaluation and explore how a framework of their adoption for TD data analysis in South Africa can be built . Methods for genetic evaluation of TD records . Interest has grown in changing the data used in genetic evaluation of dairy cattle from combined 305-day mature equivalent lactation yields to individual TD yields . The 305-day mature equivalent adjusts the current production record for a cow to what she would be producing after three years in lactation or greater as a mature cow . The current method for genetic evaluation uses several daily measurements usually taken once a month ( test - day ) on an individual cow over the course of the lactation . The idea of using TD measurements in genetic evaluation has been a subject for research for a long time ( Searle , 1961 ; Meyer et al . , 1989 ; Stanton et al . , 1992 ; Ptak & Schaeffer , 1993 ; Meyer & Hill , 1997 ; Wiggans & Goddard , 1997 ) . Data from the milk recording scheme are often analyzed by regarding TD records from a cow in single or multiple trait analyses or as repeated measurements of the same trait along a lactation curve , potentially applying some correction for DIM or age at recording . Various methods have been used to analyze TD records which represent longitudinal data ( Swalve , 1995 ; 2000 ; Misztal et al . , 2000 ; Schaeffer et al . , 2000 ; Jensen , 2001 ) . Most of these methods can be regarded as being derived from a model in which the traits have a patterned covariance matrix , but these methods vary in assumptions about the structure of the covariance matrix ( White et al . , 1999 ) . Firstly , in single trait analysis with a repeatability model , constant genetic variance over DIM and a genetic correlation of one between TD records taken at different DIM , is assumed ( Ptak & Schaeffer , 1993 ) . Secondly , multivariate analysis treats each TD record at different DIM as a different trait ( Meyer et al . , 1989 ; Pander et al . , 1992 ) . Swalve ( 1995 ) observed that some authors arbitrarily divided the DIM range into intervals ( early , mid and late lactation ) that represent individual , but correlated traits and treated the measurements of these different intervals as different traits . The approach has major drawbacks that include inadequate use of information provided at test - days , hence fails to account for constraints imposed on the covariance structure . Thirdly , lactation curves have been fitted at a phenotypic level and the parameters of the curve have subsequently been analyzed as new traits ( Stanton et al . , 1992 ) . However , this approach results in failure to fully account for the systematic environmental effects ( VanRaden , 1997 ) . The random regression approach . The additive genetic values ( estimated breeding values , EBV ) of animals are usually obtained from mixed model analyses . For the trait under consideration , a linear regression of observations on indicator variables is performed . Animals ' additive genetic effects are fitted as random effects . Because functions of time , such as DIM , can be readily modelled in the mixed model framework ( Henderson , 1982 ) , trajectories ( e.g. lactation curve ) can be described . The covariables are usually nonlinear functions such as polynomials or splines relating time to the traits e.g. milk , fat or protein yield . Fitting sets of RR coefficients for each individual random factor ( e.g. additive genetic and permanent environmental effects ) produces the estimates of the corresponding trajectories . This in short , describes the RR model . For the evaluation of TD records , the RR test - day animal model is considered the most appealing statistically . It is often used to fit the RR coefficients in a linear model to obtain genetic parameters and breeding values . There are two approaches to the RR model ( RRM ) : RR on lactation curve functions ( e.g. the Wilmink 's function ) or RR on polynomials or splines . The number of parameters that can be fitted to describe a lactation curve is flexible with the RR where a lactation curve function is used . Jamrozik & Schaeffer ( 2002 ) found that the TDM with Legendre polynomials outperformed the TDM with a lactation curve function , considering the same number of parameters in terms of statistics on the goodness of fit . History of random regression models in dairy cattle genetic evaluation . The general concept of using RR for analysis of covariance in an animal breeding context was suggested by Henderson ( 1982 ) . Kirkpatrick & Heckman ( 1989 ) and Kirkpatrick et al . ( 1990 ; 1994 ) introduced the infinite - dimensional model for traits measured repeatedly per individual , and suggested to model genetic covariances of trajectories through covariance functions . However , initial applications of the RRM were in genetic evaluation of dairy cows , using records from individual test - days to model the lactation curve ( Schaeffer & Dekkers , 1994 ; Jamrozik et al . Since then , the RRM has become a standard for analyses of repeated measured records from animal breeding schemes . Other areas of animal breeding that have already utilized RRM include conformation traits ( Uribe et al . , 2000 ) , body condition scores ( Berry et al . The RRM has also been used for analysis of survival data ( Veerkamp et al . , 2001 ) and for assessing genotype by environment interactions using a continuum of an environmental parameter as covariance functions in reaction norms ( Strandberg et al . , 2000 ; Calus & Veerkamp , 2003 ; Berry et al . , 2003b ; Shariati et al . Differences between random regression and fixed regression test -day models . , 2006b ) . Contemporary groups include cows tested on the same day within a herd ( herd - test date , HTD ) which reduces residual variation substantially more than would herd - year - season of calving groups ( Ptak & Schaeffer , 1993 ) . Further , the model assumes a standard fixed lactation curve for all cows in the same age - season subclass , and the estimated additive genetic effects of animals reflect differences in the height of these curves . Thus , differences in lactation persistency are ignored . Correlations between yields at different days in milk are assumed to be the same regardless of time elapsing between test - day measures . The assumption that the variances are homogenous throughout the lactation is difficult to justify . Studies on heterogeneity of variance have been conducted in South Africa . Specifically , it had been discovered that older sire proofs were much higher than for younger bulls with progeny still active in the herds ( Mostert et al . , 2006a ) . As a result , the SA fixed regression test - day model incorporates a fixed calving year effect to account for this . However , failure to pre - adjust for heterogeneous variance in test - day models often inflates genetic variances resulting in biased estimated breeding values and lowers their accuracy ( Strabel et al . , 2006a ) . where HTD is the fixed herd TD effect , a is the random additive genetic effect of the cow , p is the random permanent environmental effect associated with each cow and e is the random residual ( Swalve , 2000 ; Jensen , 2001 ) . The lactation curve is modelled using the regression parameters b i and x i are the corresponding time ( days in milk ) covariates . An extension of the fixed regression TDM to a RRM would be desirable in several ways . It will allow for the inclusion of random regression coefficients for the lactation curve for each cow ( Henderson , 1982 ) . The lactation curve for an individual cow could be viewed as two sets of regressions on DIM . Fixed regressions for all cows belonging to the same subclass of age - season of calving describe the general shape for that cow , and the random regressions for a cow describe the deviations from the fixed regressions , which allow cows to have differently shaped lactation curves . A random regressions test - day model ( RR - TDM ) is an extension of the TDM with fixed regressions . The basic structure of RRM is similar in most applications . The shape of the lactation curve is assumed to be influenced by random genetic and permanent environmental effects . As such , genetic and permanent environmental correlations between yields at different DIM can take values less than one . An added advantage is that the model can accommodate heterogeneous additive genetic and permanent environmental variances during lactation , the degree of which varies according to the regression functions chosen to model the trajectory of lactation . The covariates used in the regression part of TDM are usually functions of the day in lactation when the measurements were made . The different subscripts indicate that the covariates in different parts of the model are not necessarily the same . When compared with the fixed regression TDM , this corresponds to using regressions to model the additive genetic and the permanent environmental effects . The results of the genetic evaluations for the South African dairy herd have had a fixed regression model defined by the following parameter sizes shown in Table 1 ( Personal communication : B. Mostert , 2010 , ARC , Private Bag X02 , Irene 0062 , South Africa ) . Using a random regression model would probably increase the number of dairy cattle evaluated thereby improving the accuracy of estimating their proofs . Choice of basis functions . Theoretically , any function can be used in RRM as a basis function ( Swalve , 2000 ; Meyer , 2005b ) . Legendre polynomials are the most common , because the correlations between parameters are lower than with other functions ( Kirkpatrick et al . , 1990 ; 1994 ; Van der Werf , 1997 ) . Orthogonal polynomials are able to model lactation curves for a range of covariance structures , but they also have undesirable properties ( Misztal , 2006 ) . Fit at the extremes of the trajectories may be poor especially for high orders of fit ( Meyer , 2005b ) and there may be problems of convergence for large data sets . Several alternatives have been proposed and these include fractional polynomials and linear and B - splines . Fractional polynomials use roots and logs and were advocated for by Robert - Granie \\u00b4 et al . Splines are curves constructed from piece - wise lower degree polynomials which are joined smoothly at selected points ( knots ) . Splines are readily fitted within the mixed model analyses ( Verbyla et al . , 1999 ; Ruppert et al . White et al . ( 1999 ) used cubic splines , while Torres & Quaas ( 2001 ) used B - splines with 10 knots in separate RR analyses of test - day records of dairy cows . Too many knots would increase model complexity , while too few knots would reduce accuracy in estimates ( Meyer , 2005b ) . It is important to compare RR models with South African data using lactation curve functions , orthogonal polynomials and splines . Advantages of random regression models . Advantages of RR test - day models over other approaches of evaluating test - day records are now widely acknowledged ( Bohmanova et al . , 2008 ; Hammami et al . , 2008 ) : . Every record contributes information at the value of the control variable at which it is measured . Arbitrary or inappropriate corrections for the differences in the control variable are therefore rendered useless ( Van der Werf , 1997 ) . With regards to estimation of variance components , random regression models facilitate parsimonious description of changing and potentially complex covariance structures , thereby utilizing the data more efficiently and generating breeding values of higher accuracies ( Jamrozik & Schaeffer , 1997 ; Meyer , 1998 ) . Because the lactation curve is allowed to differ for each cow , this facilitates accounting for the variability in persistency and makes possible the prediction of evaluations for persistency , thereby providing additional information for selection ( Jamrozik et al . , 1998 ; Swalve & Gengler , 1999 ; Lin & Togashi , 2005 ) . The RRM also allows a cow to be evaluated on the basis of any number of TD records during lactation . Related to this , as only eight to 10 TD yields per cow per lactation may be collected , this could result in lower costs of recording ( Schaeffer et al . However , there are issues of accuracy associated with this . EBVs based on one test tend to be of low accuracy . A number of countries require a minimum of three test - day records per lactation for inclusion in genetic evaluation . The RRM for TD yields can account more precisely for environmental factors that could affect cows differently during lactation ( Schaeffer & Dekkers , 1994 ) . Due to emphasis on more yield information , a RRM results in top animals which are less related and hence results in reduced rates of inbreeding compared to lactation models ( Mrode & Coffey , 2008 ) . Partitioning variance with random regression model . The first estimates of variance components for test - day milk yields obtained by RRM were published by Jamrozik & Schaeffer ( 1997 ) . The RRM were used for modelling genetic effects only . Meyer & Hill ( 1997 ) and Meyer ( 1998 ) demonstrated the use of covariance functions to model additive genetic and permanent environmental effects in random regression TDMs . The covariance function describes the covariance structure of an infinite - dimension character , such as test - day milk yields , as a function of time . The covariance function is equivalent to a RRM if the same functions are used ( Meyer & Hill , 1997 ; Van der Werf et al . The equivalence of the RRM with the covariance function is useful when analyzing data observed at many time periods , because the number of regression coefficients determines the number of covariances to be estimated for each source of variation in a RRM . In a univariate RRM , k regression coefficients result in k(k+1)/2 covariance estimates . The covariance function is used to reduce the rank of the covariance matrix from n , the number of traits , to k , the number of functions , when starting from a multiple trait approach ( Meyer & Fitzpatrick , 2005 ) . The further development of the variance component estimation by RRM included modelling of permanent environmental effects by random regressions ( Van der Werf et al . , 1998 ; Olori et al . , 1999 ; Rekaya et al . , 1999 ; Strabel & Misztal , 1999 ) . In addition , other authors modelled the heterogeneity of residual variance across the lactations ( Jamrozik & Schaeffer , 1997 ; Jamrozik et al . , 1998 ; Brotherstone et al . , 2000 ; Jaffrezic et al . Parameters obtained in various models and with various data sets showed great variability in both average values and shapes of trajectories ( Misztal et al . The heritability estimates of the first lactation milk yield for particular DIM resulting from RR models ranged between 0.14 ( Strabel & Misztal , 1999 ) and 0.51 ( Olori et al . Some authors reported high heritabilities at the beginning and at the end of lactation ( Jamrozik & Schaeffer , 1997 ; Olori et al . , 1999 ; Kettunen et al . Other authors found the highest heritabilities in the middle of lactation ( e.g. Swalve , 1995 ; Rekaya et al . , 1999 ; Liu et al . , 2000 ; Pool et al . , 2000 ; Jakobsen et al . , 2002 ; Druet et al . Standard mixed - model - based variance component procedures ( i.e. Restricted maximum Likelihood : REML or Bayesian methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology : MCMC ) can be used to estimate covariance functions directly from the data ( Jensen , 2001 ) . High computational demands limit the size of the datasets and the nature of the models that can be analyzed using REML , but algorithms for multivariate analyses via AIREML are readily adapted to the estimation of covariances among random regression coefficients ( Meyer & Kirkpatrick , 2005 ) . Sorensen & Gianola ( 2002 ) noted that Bayesian estimation is now standard for quantitative genetic analyses . Particularly popular are schemes that sample from fully conditional posterior distributions of the parameters of interest . These are computationally easy to implement . Jamrozik ( 2004 ) discussed implementation issues of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for random regression analyses . Modelling environmental effects in the random regression model . Milk production is influenced by exactly the same environmental factors whether a TDM or lactation model is used in genetic evaluation . However , for a TDM , the stage of lactation is an important consideration , because of the curvilinear relationship that exists between the stage of lactation and milk production ( Swalve , 1995 ; 2000 ) . The TDMs often use types of covariates or mathematical functions , in a regression , to account for stage of lactation . Meyer ( 2005a ) and Meyer & Kirkpatrick ( 2005 ) noted that the resultant lactation curve parameters can be considered as examples of ' function - valued traits ' implying that mathematical functions are in use . The adoption of TDM over the lactation model replaced the use of herd - year - season ( HYS ) with herd - test - date ( HTD ) . The HTD accounts for the effects of herd and the year and the season of production whereas HYS effect is commonly used to account for the effects of the individual herd , the year , and the season of calving and the interactions among them . With a TDM , further effects that can be fitted in the analysis include age at calving , parity and pregnancy ( Swalve , 1995 ) . The random regression TDM can account for many environmental factors that could affect cows differently during the lactation ( Schaeffer & Deckers , 1994 ) . The lactation curve is split into two parts : a fixed part ( average lactation curve ) and a random animal specific part ( deviation from the average curve ) . To account for the variability within lactation stage , an appropriate sub - model is fitted on stage of lactation , nested within parts of the model that account for environmental effects . There are profound differences in the manner in which environmental variation is accounted for with RRM in respect to definition of subgroups for fixed regression on the stage of lactation ( Zavadilova et al . Frequently used factors are season of calving and/or classes of age at calving ( Reents et al . , 1998 ; Strabel & Misztal , 1999 ; Lidauer et al . , 2000 ; Schaeffer et al . Other models used include the effects of days carried calf ( Lidauer et al . For South Africa , it is important to investigate how best the information collected when testing herds can be used in genetic analysis to account for the environmental variation . Mostert et al . ( 2006b ) defined a fixed regression TD - model which passed the necessary trend validation tests required by Interbull to ensure that the model sufficiently accounts for all environmental effects . Such studies can also attempt to recommend inclusion of valuable variables that the current milk recording system ignores or encourage inclusion of some traits such as fertility measures in the routine genetic evaluations . The SA Dairy Animal Improvement Scheme records artificial insemination information . Unfortunately , the participants of the Scheme are still reluctant to participate . Persistency of lactation . Dairy breeders focus on modelling the individual genetic curves of the cows and estimating genetic parameters of the lactation curves to select for lactation yields or persistency ( Shanks et al . , 1981 ; Danell , 1982 ; Ferris et al . , 1985 ; Gengler , 1996 ; Jamrozik & Schaeffer , 1997 ) . Although the definition of persistency varies , generally it refers to the rate of decline in production after peak milk yield production has been reached ( Swalve & Gengler , 1999 ) . High persistency is associated with a slow rate of decline in production whereas low persistency is associated with a rapid rate of decline . Persistent cows are more desirable because they are more efficient in roughage usage , suffer less metabolic stress due to high peak yield and are thus more disease - resistant ( Solkner & Fuchs , 1987 ) . Genetic modification of the lactation curves are concerned with the artificial redistribution of total lactation responses among different stages of the lactation ( Lin & Togashi , 2005 ) . In a recent study , Mostert et al . ( 2008 ) laid out the framework for inclusion of persistency of lactation in genetic evaluation of South African dairy cattle based on the Canadian Persistency Index . As a result , persistency of production has been implemented in routine genetic evaluations thereby highlighting the economic importance of persistency . In describing the persistency of milk production during lactation , the choice of a parameter that gives a correct description of the shape of a lactation curve is important . It is therefore important to develop an evaluation method in which genetic differences in persistency can be evaluated on a routine basis . A key issue in genetic evaluation of persistency is trait definition . Gengler ( 1995 ; 1996 ) identified three types of measures of persistency which are : measures based on ratios of yields , measures based on variation of yields and measures developed out of functions that describe lactation yields . There is , however , no clear consensus on how best to mathematically model persistency . The procedure most widely used to measure lactation persistency nowadays is based on the by - product of the random regression test day model . Druet et al . ( 2005 ) showed that the first and second eigenvectors of the estimated genetic covariance matrix in a random regression model may serve as proxies for yield and persistency . Use of these eigenvectors in random regression test - day models is computationally advantageous but there is still no clear biological interpretation of the eigenvectors . Conclusion . Attempts to improve the accuracy of estimated breeding values , reduce the generation interval and boost response to selection for dairy cattle and the quest to provide more comprehensive management information to dairy farmers are stimulating interest in advancing the conceptual framework of the TDM . The RRM approach probably wields the potential to realize these benefits from the South African dairy cattle genetic evaluation programme . Replacing the current TDM with a RRM requires research to demonstrate the benefits . Currently research should be focused on defining the RRM to be implemented , investigating the environmental effects to be included in the model and estimating the covariance structure among observations and genetic parameters for traits to be included in the breeding programme for dairy cattle in South Africa . These are the requisite steps towards adoption of a RRM framework for analysis of dairy TD records . Acknowledgements .

Atmospheric effects from large biomass fires ( greater than a few thousand hectares ) have received a great deal of interest in recent years , both in terms of effects on atmospheric chemistry ( Crutzen and Andreae 1990 , Crutzen and Carmichael 1993 , Levine et al . 1995 , McKenzie et al . 1995 , Galanter et al . 2000 , Marion et al . 2001 , Thompson et al . 2001 ) and concern related to health effects when smoke impacts population centers ( Lipari et al . 1984 , Lewis et al . 1988 , Nichol 1998 ) . A number of studies of biomass fires have concentrated on fires occurring in the Amazon Basin ( Andreae et al . 1988 , Lee et al . 1998 , Liu et al . 2000 , Yamasoe et al . 2000 , da Rocha et al . 2005 , Schroeder et al . 2007 ) and savanna fires in Africa ( Lee et al . 1998 , Marion et al . More recently , in the year 2000 summer fire season in the United States , more than 80,000 wildfires in the western USA burned about 27,500 km 2 ( Pelley 2000 ) raising issues of air quality effects in the western US due to these fire events . 2000 , Yamasoe et al . 2000 ) , biomass fires have the potential to produce large quantities of oxygenated organic species such as aldehydes , ketones and carboxylic acids ( Lipari et al . 1984 , Andreae et al . 1988 , McKenzie et al . 1995 , Dibb et al . 1996 , Lee et al . 1998 , Yokelson et al . 1999 , Holtzinger et al . 1999 ) as well as hydrocarbons ( Larsen et al . 1992 , Bernd et al . 2003 ) , sulfate and nitrate ( Andreae et al . 1988 , Gorzelska et al . 19 94 , D ibb et al . 1996 , Maenhaut et al . 1996 ) , and associated gaseous pollutant species such as O3 , NOx , and CO ( Liu et al . 1999 , Galanter et al . 2000 , Marion et al . 2001 , Thompson et al . Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are also produced by biomass burning and found in the stratosphere ( Jenkins et al . 2001 , Mandalakis et al . Many of the literature reports dealing with products of biomass burning have been related to fireplace and wood burning stove emissions ( Dasch 1982 , Lipari et al . 1984 , Zak et al . 1984 , Andreae et al . 1988 , Popp et al . 1996 ) , to laboratory burns ( McKenzie et al . 1995 , Yokelson et al . 1996 , Yokelson et al . 1997 , Goode et al . 1999 , Holtzinger et al . 1999 ) and to plume measurements using aircraft ( Andreae et al . 1988 , Gorzelska et al . 1994 , Worden et al . 1997 , Lee et al . 1998 , Yokelson et al . 1999 , Marion et al . Few measurements have been made on local or long range ground level effects from large forest / biomass fires ( Dibb et al . 1996 , Yamasoe et al . 2000 , Liu et al . 2000 ) , partly due to the difficulty of approaching hot , large fires and partly due to difficulties in a priori determination of a site that will be affected by the smoke plume . It is believed that the entire region was impacted by haze carried approximately 3000 km from the source of the spring 1998 Mexican / Central American fires . It should be noted that the background data collected before the haze incursion was part of a different study and when the regional haze developed , measurements were again taken at the same site used for the background data . For a number of days before the haze episode in NM , large areas of Texas , Louisiana and the lower Mississippi River valley were inundated by smoke from the fires . However , the haze in those places came from the same source but from a trajectory that went to the north of the fire and then to the west . Haze arriving into El Paso , Socorro and Albuquerque came from the trajectory shown in figure 1 . The field sample site for the collection of carbonyl compounds , carboxylic acids and hydrocarbons is located in a rural , agricultural area in the Rio Grande flood plain near Socorro , NM ( Lat . 34\\u00c2\\u00ba , Long . 106\\u00c2\\u00ba 7 ' , pop . The sample site had been used for several years for studies of biogenic emissions from cottonwood trees and for ambient sampling of atmospheric species in a rural , high desert environment . Neither of these studies were specifically in operation for smoke impact evaluation , but serendipitously allowed smoke plume impact to be evaluated at the site . While these are urban sites and atmospheric species are affected by strong , local sources , the data do show some perturbation that may be attributed to the smoke . Unfortunately , no NOx or O3 instrumentation was available in Socorro at the time , and Albuquerque and El Paso were experiencing a haze episode at the same time underscoring the widespread , regional nature of the episode . PM 10 samples were collected in Socorro using standard PM 10 sampling methodology . Evidence for the source of the haze . In addition to the obvious visual manifestation of increased haziness and significantly decreased visibility , satellite data support the changes occurring from the clean air period to the haze episode . While it is recognized that satellite imagery does not necessarily always reflect ground level concentrations , the regional and ground level visibility were severely degraded , a fact that was reflected in numerous headlines in the regional newspapers . Also , as a verification of the regional impact of the Mexican and Central American fires , an isentropic air trajectory model was used to examine the back trajectories of the air masses arriving to the Socorro , NM area during the study periods . Details on the methodology and uncertainties of the model can be found in Harris and Kahl ( 1994 ) . Analyses . 1988 , Zhou and Mopper 1990 , Grosjean 1991 ) with specific descriptions regarding blanks , duplicates , detection limits , instrumentation , and calibration described in Gaffney et al . Briefly , the cartridges were cleaned with acetonitrile , coated with DNPH , wrapped in aluminum foil and stored in a refrigerator in dark containers . Air samples were pulled through a 5 \\u00b5m Teflon filter and then through the cartridges at about 1 L / min , with air flow controlled by rotameters calibrated several times daily with mass flow meters ( Aalborg Corp. ) . The samples were analyzed by HPLC ( Waters Corp. ) . Water mist nebulizers ( 40 mL capacity ) specially constructed for trapping acids were used with the procedures described by Cofer et al . ( 1985 ) and modified by Popp et al . Specific descriptions of all protocols for blanks , duplicates , detection limits , instrumentation and calibration used are given by Gaffney et al . Following sample collection , the nebulizer was rinsed several times with distilled deionized water into volumetric flasks . Gas analyses for NO x and O 3 were performed in Albuquerque and El Paso by the city of Albuquerque Air Quality Control Division and by the El Paso City / County Health District according to EPA approved standard methods . Data were obtained from Albuquerque Air Quality Division personnel . Hydrocarbon samples were collected from the gas phase into 3.8 L Tedlar bags via a peristaltic pump and analyzed using GC / FID . Detailed methodology concerning calibration and quality assurance followed that of Martin et al . C1 and C2 compounds were not reported separately because the GC was set up to analyze isoprene and monoterpenes during the clean air period and there was insufficient time to recalibrate when the haze episode occurred . Aerosol samples were collected , extracted , and analyzed using the procedures similar to those described by Dixon and Aasen ( 1999 ) . The low flow rates were used to integrate samples over several days and were not originally intended for the haze samples , but the same procedure was used for all sample sets for consistency . The filters were extracted with 0.5 mL of ethanol to \\\" wet \\\" the filter and deionized water or a preserving solution containing phosphoric acid ( for analysis of S ( IV ) species not reported here ) to a total volume of 20 mL. Blank filters were extracted using the identical procedures to determine detection limits . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION . Carbonyl compounds . Average concentrations of carbonyl compounds are summarized in table I and shown in figures 2 and 3 . The smoke episode occurred in two distinct stages during the three sampling days about a week after clear air measurements were made . During the early haze period , the total carbonyls measured were 4.4 times higher than the previous week 's clear air measurements . Overall , the total carbonyls were 2.7 times higher during the entire smoke episode than during the clean air period . Formaldehyde and acetaldehyde , which normally contribute the largest percentages to total carbonyl compounds measured in ambient air in this region ( Gaffney et al . 1997 , Martin et al . 1999 ) showed relatively smaller increases of 2.0 times and 3.2 times , respectively , when comparing the hazy period to the clean air period . This observation is likely due to the greater reactivity and higher photolysis rates of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde relative to acetone and MEK . Subsequently , the shorter chain carbonyl compounds would likely have been regenerated by oxidation of hydrocarbons produced by the fires . The average ambient concentrations of acetic and formic acids did not show increases similar to the carbonyl compounds . As shown in table I , only slight increases of 1.1 times ( acetic acid ) and 1.4 times ( formic acid ) were found when comparing overall averages for the clean air and hazy sample periods . While these carboxylic acid species have also been identified as major components in biomass burning ( Lipari et al . 1984 , Andreae et al . 1988 , McKenzie et al . 1995 , Dibb et al . 1998 , Blake et al . However , the change observed between the two smoky periods is similar to that observed over the duration of the clean air period ( see Fig . 6b ) . C3s remained high during the early and late smoke periods . Average values for NO x and O 3 concentrations measured in Albuquerque , NM and El Paso , TX during the clean air and hazy periods are summarized in table I and shown on a daily average basis in figure 7 . The NO x concentrations in Albuquerque averaged 2.1 times higher and O 3 concentrations averaged 1.6 times lower during the smoke period when compared to the cleaner period . Similar comparisons for El Paso showed NOx to be 1.4 time higher and O 3 to be 1.2 times lower during the study period . As shown in figure 7 , the daily average concentrations of both species were steady during the clear air period and began to change between May 15 and 16 , about the time the haze became noticeable . For comparison , the average summer NO x and O 3 concentrations found in Albuquerque during a previous study were 20 ppbv and 35 ppbv , respectively ( Gaffney et al . Ozone concentrations might have been decreased by lower UV intensity during the smoke , while NOx concentrations could have increased due to meteorological conditions ( inversion layer that also trapped smoke near the ground ) . Ozone concentration increases during biomass burning ( Cooney 2008 ) . The particles causing the haze may have been too small to contribute significantly to the mass on the filters , but no particle size analysis was available at the time . Soluble nitrate and sulfate associated with the particulate samples collected on the Teflon filters during the haze period were 13 and 2.7 times greater , respectively , than during the clear air period ( see Table I and Fig . 8 ) . It is likely that oxidation of SO 2 and NO x produced during the fires is the source of the excess nitrate and sulfate associated with the particulate material . The increases for nitrate ( Andreae et al . 1988 , Gorzelska et al . 1994 , Dibb et al . 1996 ) and sulfate ( Andreae et al . 1988 , Gorzelska et al . 1994 , Dibb et al . 1996 , Maenhaut et al . 1996 ) are consistent with previous observations . Gorzelska et al . Analysis of air associated with very unusual , regionally observed hazy conditions detected increases over clean air background levels . Some of these compounds would likely have undergone reactions during transport of the air mass , but study of such changes was beyond the scope of this study . In addition , concentrations of other species such as NO x and O 3 may be affected . It is not evident from this study that ground level O 3 concentrations are enhanced long distances from large fires , even though strong evidence exists for the presence of high levels of fine aerosols and gaseous ozone precursors . This may be consistent with the strong optical absorption of the smokes that leads to the reduction of UVB which in turn drives the photochemical processes of ozone formation ( Gaffney et al . In this study , no significant increases of PM10 levels were observed under very hazy conditions suggesting transport of only very small particles . These fine particles are important as climate forcing agents due to their optically high absorption and are also important as they may have significant health impacts . The results from this work clearly indicate that regional scale impacts from biomass burning must be considered when addressing air quality impacts from air toxics and fine aerosols .

The rule stabilizes by allowing the modification threshold , \\\\(\\\\theta_M\\\\ , \\\\ ) to vary as a super - linear function of the previous activity of the cell . Unlike traditional methods of stabilizing Hebbian learning , this \\\" sliding threshold \\\" provides a mechanism for incoming patterns , as opposed to converging afferents , to compete . A detailed exploration can be found in the book Theory of Cortical Plasticity ( Cooper et al . , 2004 ) . For an open - source implementation of the BCM , amongst other synaptic modification rules , see the Plasticity package . In the mid 1970s there had already been years of experimentation in visual cortex that led to two ( sometimes controversial ) conclusions . In normal animals , visual cortical neurons are selective and binocular . These properties depend on the visual experience of the animal . In order to account for these two experimental conclusions , Bienenstock et al . proposed three postulates . The BCM theory of synaptic plasticity , as described briefly in the previous section , and in more detail in the sections below , is based on these three postulates . The change in synaptic weights ( \\\\(d w_i / dt\\\\ ) ) is proportional to presynaptic activity ( \\\\(x_i\\\\ ) ) . The change in synaptic weights is proportional to a non - monotonic function ( denoted by \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\ ) ) of the postsynaptic activity ( \\\\(y\\\\ ) ) : . \\\\ ) . The modification threshold ( \\\\(\\\\theta_M\\\\ ) ) is itself a super - linear function of the history of postsynaptic activity \\\\(y\\\\ . \\\\ ) . Mathematical forms of BCM . BCM as specified by the three postulates in the introduction is under - determined : there are many mathematical forms which satisfy them . Traditionally , it has been the approach of researchers to use the simplest form that is still consistent with the experiments . Some of the common forms are below . Original BCM ( Bienenstock et al . 1982 ) . The average used for the threshold is assumed to be an average over all input patterns , although a temporal average will usually be equivalent . Intrator and Cooper ( Intrator and Cooper , 1992 ) . Similar rules can be derived from objective functions based on kurtosis and skewness , although not all of them have the stability properties of this one . ( Blais et al . , 1999 , Cooper et al . , 2004 ) . In order to have stable fixed points , the average used for the modification threshold is calculated with the square of the output , as opposed to the original form which squared the average of the output itself . If the mean of the output is zero , then the original form would have only trivial stable fixed points . The Intrator and Cooper form , also called the IBCM rule , has some nice mathematical properties ( see Intrator and Cooper , 1992 , Cooper et al . 2004 ) : . It is an exploratory projection index that emphasizes deviation from a Gaussian distribution at the center of the distribution , in the form of multi - modality . The formulation naturally extends to a lateral inhibition network ( with a non - linear saturation transfer function ) , which can find several projections at once . The number of calculations of the gradient grows linearly with the number of projections sought , thus it is very efficient in high dimensional feature extraction . The search is constrained by seeking projections that are orthogonal to all but one of the clusters ( in the original space ) . Thus , there are at most \\\\(K\\\\ ) optimal projections and not \\\\(K(K-1)/2\\\\ ) separating hyper - planes as in discriminant analysis methods . This property is very important as it suggests why the \\\" curse of dimensionality \\\" is less problematic with this learning rule -- every minima is an optimal one . \\\\ ) This property , which directly results from the analysis ( see Intrator , 1996 ) is essential for creating coincidence detectors , and it also indicates the optimality of the learning rule in terms of energy ( or code ) conservation . The IBCM rule has been used in many applications . In speech , it was used to provide discrimination between phonetic features ( Intrator , 1992 , Seebach et al . , 1994 ) . In vision , it was used to model 3D object recognition and produce a model that compared favorably with experimental results . The experiment was constructed to enable distinction between different 3D model representations ( Intrator and Gold , 1993 , Intrator et al . , 1995 ) . The IBCM was also proposed in a general framework of combining unsupervised learning with supervised learning ( Intrator , 1993 ) and in many other pattern classification tasks ( Dotan and Intrator , 1998 , Huynh et al , 1998 ) . Law and Cooper ( Law and Cooper , 1994 ) . The Law and Cooper form has all of the same fixed points as the Intrator and Cooper form , but speed of synaptic modification increases when the threshold is small , and decreases as the threshold increases . The practical result is that the simulation can be run with artificially high learning rates , and wild oscillations are reduced . This form has been used primarily when running simulations of networks , where the run - time of the simulation can be prohibitive . Experimental verification . In order to make comparison between theory and experiment , various simplifying assumptions must be made . In general these involve . the synaptic modification postulate . the network architecture . the nature of the visual environment . Results at all levels of complexity that have been examined are in good agreement with experiment . Highly selective oriented receptive fields evolve for natural image environments ( Law and Cooper , 1994 , Shouval et al . , 1996 ) . Figure 2 : The BCM Rule develops orientation selectivity in a natural image environment . Shown are the responses to an oriented stimulus versus time , for the left and right eye ( bottom ) and the final synaptic weight configuration ( top ) . When a two eye visual environment is used , receptive fields with varying degrees of ocular dominance evolve ( Shouval et al . , 1996 , Shouval et al . , 1997 ) . The effect of network interactions has been analyzed ( Cooper and Scofield , 1988 ) and simulated ( Shouval et al . , 1997 ) . Simulations reveal the same type of receptive fields as in the single cell case but with ocular dominance patches and slowly varying orientation selectivity . Deprivation experiments have been simulated as well ( Clothiaux et al . , 1991 , Blais et al . , 1996 , Blais et al . , 1999 ) and the development of direction selectivity has been shown ( Blais et al . , 2000 ) . All types of experimental results can be replicated by BCM neurons for the same set of parameters . Throughout these simulations it is assumed that the input channel ( or channels ) originating from the closed eye ( or eyes ) provides an input of uncorrelated noise to the cortical cell . The results obtained are critically dependent on the level of this noise . The time it takes oriented receptive fields to decay in deprivation experiments such as MD , RS and BD all depend on the level of noise -- the higher the noise level the faster the decay time . This happens because noise from the deprived eye seldom create activities that are higher than the threshold \\\\(\\\\theta_M\\\\ ) and thus mostly contribute to the decay ; the stronger they are the faster the decay . Such results are contrary to what would be obtained using models that employ explicit competition between the eyes ( Blais et al . , 1999 ) where the decay time , typically , increases as the level of noise increases . Figure 3 : Dynamics of monocular deprivation using the BCM Rule . Shown are the responses to oriented stimuli versus time for the left and right ( deprived ) eyes . Above is deprivation with high noise in the deprived channel , analogous to lid suture , and below is deprivation with low noise in the deprived channel , analogous to TTX injection in the deprived eye . BCM predicts that deprivation effects occur faster in the presence of larger , uncorrelated , deprived - eye activity . The level of noise might be experimentally manipulated in deprivation experiments by using different methods of deprivation . It was thought that retinal activity in lid sutured animals should be higher than in those with a dark patch placed on the eyes and should be reduced close to zero in animals that have TTX ( a sodium channel blocker ) injected to the eye . The relevant parameter , for the models , is LGN activity . If the level of LGN activity indeed depends on the retinal activity we could use these different protocols to manipulate the noise level in the LGN and thus to determine experimentally which of the different proposed models agrees better with experimental results . A set of experiments performed by Rittenhouse et al . ( 1999 ) seem to show that the level of the noise in the deprived eye could be manipulated by comparing normal MD with lid suture to MD in which TTX was injected into the eye . TTX abolishes action potentials in the retina and was thought to significantly reduce the spontaneous rate in LGN . The interpretation of Rittenhouse was based on the assumption that TTX reduces the noise level in LGN . Recent experimental results may question this assumption . This has led to an ongoing reexamination of both experiment and theory . Whatever the outcome , this is an excellent illustration of the fruitfulness of intersection between theory and experiment . Cellular basis . Postulate 1 states that plasticity will occur only in synapses that are stimulated presynaptically . This is what biologists refer to as synapse specificity . Synapse specificity has strong support for both LTP and LTD ( Dudek and Bear , 1992 ) . In addition this assumption is consistent with the observation that more presynaptic activity results in a higher degree of plasticity , although this might not be linear . There is now substantial evidence both in hippocampus and neocortex ( Dudek and Bear , 1992 , Mulkey and Malenka , 1992 , Artola and Singer , 1992 , Kirkwood and Bear , 1994 , Mayford et al . , 1995 ) in support of postulate 2 . There is significant evidence that active synapses undergo LTD or LTP depending on the level of postsynaptic spiking or depolarization in a manner that is consistent with the BCM theory , as shown in Figure 4 . This experiment shows that in deprived animals \\\\(\\\\theta_M\\\\ ) is lower than in normal animals . In control slices from the hippocampus no change in \\\\(\\\\theta_M\\\\ ) is observed . Figure 4 : Experimental verification of the BCM rule from Kirkwood et al . , 1996 . An additional experiment by Wang and Wagner in 1999 has produced similar results in hippocampal slices in which the postsynaptic activity was controlled directly by different stimulation protocols ( that did not induce plasticity ) directly in the slice . Here too they observed that the threshold in highly stimulated slices is higher than in control slices . From rates to spikes . BCM , as originally formulated , is a phenomenological rate - based model ( see models of synaptic plasticity ) . As such , the concept of spike - timing plays no role in the theory . A more detailed treatment of the biological mechanisms should be able to account for both spike - timing dependent plasticity ( STDP ) and BCM . These more biophysical models have not been formally shown to be equivalent to BCM , but they do capture some of the features of BCM . Biophysics of BCM theory . This formalism allows for studying stability properties in the case of networks of connected non - linear neurons . The stability properties are highly influenced by the connectivity schema . It has been proposed that one of the elementary mechanisms governing the induction of LTP and LTD is the conductance change of the AMPA ion channel as a result of a bidirectional phosphorylation or dephosphorylation in an activity dependent way ( Kameyama et al . , 2000 ) . Figure 5 : Phosphorylation cycle of AMPAr adapted from ( Kameyama et al . , 2000 ) . \\\\ ) . The stability properties , as well as the equivalence with the BCM model , strongly depends on the type and number of involved enzymes , and ultimately on the structure of the \\\\(R\\\\ ) matrix ( Castellani et al . , 2005 ) . BCM and scaling . One very interesting consequence of BCM is a possible explanation of what is called synaptic scaling . Recently , homeostatic forms of synaptic modification , called synaptic scaling , have been observed ( Turrigiano and Nelson , 2004 ) . In scaling , chronic increases ( decreases ) in the global levels of cellular activity weaken ( strengthen ) the synaptic weights . At first sight , scaling seems to contradict previous results on experience - dependent synaptic modifications , such as LTD and LTP , where synaptic strengths increase with high , and decrease with low levels of neural excitation . But scaling is reminiscent of metaplasticity ( the sliding modification threshold ) . This time difference plays an important role in understanding the genetic basis of these events . The outputs to the 5 patterns are shown with colored vertical lines , and the modification \\\\(\\\\phi(\\\\cdot)\\\\ ) function is drawn with the modification threshold labeled . If the activities start below the threshold , the modification threshold decreases and \\\" picks up \\\" some of the patterns . Likewise , if the responses are above the threshold , the threshold increases and stabilizes the output . The result , in this case with independent patterns , is that the neuron becomes responsive to just one of the patterns , and is highly selective . In a natural image environment , the neurons become selective to orientation . Figure 7 : Examples of deprivation protocols in the natural image environment , using the BCM Rule . Competition : monocular versus binocular deprivation . BCM contains such competition as a natural consequence , without imposing another competitive constraint on the synaptic modification . In essence , with binocular deprivation , the neuron 's modification threshold drops , making reductions in the synapses more difficult to obtain . In contrast , the open eye in monocular deprivation keeps the activity high , and thus the threshold does not drop significantly , making the reduction of synapses easier to obtain . Figure 8 : Monocular deprivation ( MD ) versus Binocular deprivation ( BD ) . The structured presynaptic input into the open eye in monocular deprivation keeps the activity high , and thus keeps the modification threshold higher than in the case of binocular deprivation . As a result , the negative part of the \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\ ) function is larger in MD , and deprivation occurs much more rapidly than in BD . One consequence of this is the noise - dependence discussed in the previous section . Hebbian learning and BCM . BCM differs significantly from Hebbian modification in its consequences . These differences are briefly summarized here , but a more thorough comparison can be found in ( Cooper et al . , 2004 ) and the software package Plasticity . Hebbian learning . BCM . Statistics . Depends only on 2nd - order statistics . Fails to converge in whitened ( sphered ) environments . Depends on higher - order statistics , and can find structure in nearly any environment . Noise dependence of deprivation . More input of uncorrelated noise into the closed eye for deprivation slows the deprivation effect . More input into the closed eye for deprivation increases the deprivation effect . Orientation and direction selectivity . Requires an asymmetry , either in the neural architecture or the temporal structure , to achieve direction selectivity . Both strong orientation and direction selectivity can not be achieved simultaneously ( Blais , 1999 ) . Spatio - temporal correlations on the order of the receptive field size are required to achieve both strong orientation and direction selectivity , such as a movie environment . References .

Many of the issues raised in the paper have been addressed by recent innovations in bookmarking . For example , browser - based bookmarks allow you to automatically check if pages have changed or disappeared . This paper made me think about organizational strategies for categorized tasks . Tasks in Planner and other PIMs that allow you to directly hyperlink to resources ( Microsoft Entourage , Microsoft Outlook ) act as bookmarks , creating a personal information space annotated by the things you need to do . Task- and schedule - related personal information suffers from many of the same problems as the World Wide Web . Information overload comes in the form of e - mail about tasks and appointments . The inbox is polluted by irrelevant messages . Task- and schedule - related information tends to be less chaotic than the Web because the former is personal by nature , but it still lacks aggregate structure and a global view . This paper makes me want to look into the organizational strategies of PIM users . For example , how do people categorize their tasks ? Creation - time filing or sporadic filing ? How do they choose categories ? How do they deal with long task lists ? Do they really reorder tasks for priorities , or just scan through them and pick items ? Can I characterize PIM users by scale , like the way Abrams describes light to heavy bookmark users , citing characteristic strategies ?
