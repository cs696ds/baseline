Starting with a brief outline of some of the early attempts in HLT , using the example of Machine Translation ( MT ) , it will become apparent that experiences and results in this area had a direct bearing on some of the developments in CALL . CALL soon became a multi - disciplinary field of research , development and practice . Some researchers began to develop CALL applications that made use of Human Language Technologies , and a few such applications will be introduced in this module . The advantages and limitations of applying HLT to CALL will be discussed , using the example of parser - based CALL . This brief discussion will form the basis for first hypotheses about the nature of human - computer interaction ( HCI ) in parser - based CALL .

Mathias Schulze : At this time of writing this module Mathias was a lecturer in German at UMIST , now merged with the University of Manchester , UK . He is now working at the University of Waterloo , Canada . His main research interest is in parser - based CALL and linguistics . He is an active member of the NLP SIG within the EUROCALL professional association and ICALL within the CALICO professional association . Graham Davies , ICT4LT Editor , Thames Valley University , UK . Graham has been interested in Machine Translation since 1976 . Human Language Technologies ( HLT ) is a relatively new term that embraces a wide range of areas of research and development in the sphere of what used to be called Language Technologies or Language Engineering . The aim of this module is to familiarise the student with key areas of HLT , including a range of Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) applications . NLP is a general term used to describe the use of computers to process information expressed in natural ( i.e. human ) languages . The term NLP is used in a number of different contexts in this document and is one of the most important branches of HLT . There is a Special Interest Group in Language Processing , NLP SIG , within the EUROCALL professional association , and a Special Interest Group in Intelligent Computer Assisted Language Instruction ( ICALL ) within the CALICO professional association . Both have similar aims , namely to further research in a number of areas that are mentioned in this module , such as : . Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) . Computational Linguistics . Corpus - Driven and Corpus Linguistics . Formal Linguistics . Machine Aided Translation ( MAT ) . Machine Translation ( MT ) . Natural Language Interfaces . Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) . Theoretical Linguistics . All of the above are areas of research that have produced results which have proven , are proving and will prove very useful in the field of Computer Assisted Language Learning . Of course , this module can not teach you everything there is to know about HLT . This is neither necessary nor possible . The two main authors of this module are living proof of that ; they both started off as language teachers and then got interested in HLT . A multilingual CD - ROM titled A world of understanding was produced in 1998 on behalf of the Information Society and Media Directorate General of the European Commission under its former name , DGXIII . The aim of the CD - ROM was to demonstrate the importance of HLT in helping to realise the benefits of the Multilingual Information Society , in particular forming a review and record of the Language Engineering Sector of the Fourth Framework Programme of the European Union ( 1994 - 98 ) . 1.1 Introduction to HLT . [ ... ] there is no doubt that the development of tools ( technology ) depends on language - it is difficult to imagine how any tool - from a chisel to a CAT scanner - could be built without communication , without language . What is less obvious is that the development and the evolution of language - its effectiveness in communicating faster , with more people , and with greater clarity - depends more and more on sophisticated tools . ( European Commission : Language and technology 1996:1 ) . Language and technology lists the following examples of language technology ( using an admittedly broad understanding of the term ) : . photocopier ( p. 10 ) . laser printer ( p. 11 ) . fax machine ( p. 12 ) . desktop publishing ( p. 13 ) . scanner , modem ( p. 15 ) . electronic mail ( p. 16 ) . machine translation ( p. 17 ) . translator 's workbench ( p. 18 ) . tape recorder , database search engines ( p. 19 ) . telephone ( p. 25 ) . Many of these are already being used in language learning and teaching . The field of human language technology covers a broad range of activities with the eventual goal of enabling people to communicate with machines using natural communication skills . Research and development activities include the coding , recognition , interpretation , translation , and generation of language . [ ... ] Advances in human language technology offer the promise of nearly universal access to online information and services . Since almost everyone speaks and understands a language , the development of spoken language systems will allow the average person to interact with computers without special skills or training , using common devices such as the telephone . These systems will combine spoken language understanding and generation to allow people to interact with computers using speech to obtain information on virtually any topic , to conduct business and to communicate with each other more effectively . [ Source : Foreword to ( Cole 1997 ) ] . Facilitating and supporting all aspects of human communication through machines has interested researchers for a number of centuries . The use of mechanical devices to overcome language barriers was proposed first in the seventeenth century . Then , suggestions for numerical codes to be used to mediate between languages were made by Leibnitz , Descartes and others ( v. Hutchins 1986:21 ) . The beginnings of what we describe today as Human Language Technologies are , of course , closely connected to the advent of computers . ( i ) Various games , e.g. chess , noughts and crosses , bridge , poker ( ii ) The learning of languages ( iii ) Translation of languages ( iv ) Cryptography ( v ) Mathematics . Of these ( i ) , ( iv ) , and to a lesser extent ( iii ) and ( v ) are good in that they require little contact with the outside world . For instance in order that the machine should be able to play games its only organs need be ' eyes ' capable of distinguishing the various positions on a specially made board , and means for announcing its own moves . Mathematics should preferably be resticted to branches where diagrams are not much used . Of the above possible fields the learning of languages would be the most impressive , since it is the most human of these activities . This field sees however to depend too much on sense organs and locomotion to be feasible . ( Turing 1948:9 ) . Later on , Machine Translation enjoyed a period of popularity with researchers and funding bodies in the United States and the Soviet Union : . From 1956 onwards , the dollars ( and roubles ) really started to flow . Between 1956 and 1959 , no less than twelve research groups became established at various US universities and private corporations and research centres . Although linguists , language teachers and computer users today may find these predictions ridiculous , it was the enthusiasm and the work during this time that form the basis of many developments in HLT today . Research and development in HLT is nowadays more rapidly transferred into commercial systems than was the case up until the 1980s . Indeed HLT is becoming increasingly pervasive in our everyday lives . Here are some examples : . Machine Translation ( Section 3 ): There are many online translation systems that can be accessed free of charge , causing headaches for teachers whose students thought that they could save themselves time and who were blissfully unaware of the unreliability of their output ( Section 3.2 ) . Speech synthesis ( Section 4.1 ): Satellite navigation ( satnav ) devices for motor vehicles use systems that read out road numbers , street names and directions for the driver , and their output is surprisingly good . Speech recognition ( Section 4.2 ): If you make a telephone call to a customer support service you may hear a telephone recording that asks you to say a word or short phrase so that you can be connected to the appropriate department . Other previously unexpected areas of use are emerging . It is now , for instance , common for mobile phones to have what is known as predictive text input to aid the writing of short text messages . Instead of having to press one of the nine keys a number of times to produce the correct letter in a word , software in the phone compares users ' key presses to a linguistic database to determine the correct ( or most likely ) word . Most Internet search engines also now incorporate some kind of linguistic technology to enable users to enter a query in natural language , for example \\\" What is meant by log - likelihood ratio ? \\\" is as acceptable a query as simply \\\" log - likelihood ratio \\\" . What are the possible benefits for language teaching and learning of using HLT ? Here are some examples : . Teachers might want to preprocess a text to highlight certain grammatical phenomena or patterns . This can easily be done with a word - processor . Teachers might use part - of - speech taggers ( see Section 5 ) which could save them the trouble of having to manually annotate a text . Parsers available either on the Web or for local use on PCs can generate a graphical representation of sentence structure that may be useful for grammatical analysis for more advanced learners . Machine Translation ( MT ) has been the dream of computer scientists since the 1940s . The student 's attention is drawn in particular to the following publications , which provide a very useful introduction to MT : . Hutchins ( 1999 ) \\\" The development and use of machine translation systems and computer - based translation tools \\\" . Paper given at the International Symposium on Machine Translation and Computer Language Information Processing , 26 - 28 June 1999 , Beijing , China . 3.1 Machine Translation : a brief history . Initial work on Machine Translation ( MT ) systems was typified by what we would now consider to be a naive approach to the \\\" problem \\\" of natural language translation . Successful decoding of encrypted messages by machines during World War II led some scientists , most notably Warren Weaver , to view the translation process as essentially analogous with decoding . The concept of Machine Translation in the modern age can be traced back to the 1940s . Warren Weaver , Director of the Natural Sciences Division of the Rockefeller Foundation , wrote to his friend Norbert Wiener on 4 March 1947 - short ly after the first computers and computer programs had been produced : . Recognising fully , even though necessarily vaguely , the semantic difficulties because of multiple meanings , etc . , I have wondered if it were unthinkable to design a computer which would translate . Even if it would translate only scientific material ( where the semantic difficulties are very notably less ) , and even if it did produce an inelegant ( but intelligible ) result , it would seem to me worth while . When I look at an article in Russian , I say \\\" This is really written in English , but it has been coded in some strange symbols . I will now proceed to decode \\\" . Have you ever thought about this ? As a linguist and expert on computers , do you think it is worth thinking about ? Cited in Hutchins ( 1997 ) . Weaver was possibly chastened by Wiener 's pessimistic reply : . I frankly am afraid the boundaries of words in different languages are too vague and the emotional and international connotations are too extensive to make any quasi - mechanical translation scheme very hopeful . But Weaver remained undeterred and composed his famous 1949 Memorandum , titled simply \\\" Translation \\\" , which he sent to some 30 noteworthy minds of the time . It posited in more detail the need for and possibility of MT . Thus began the first era of MT research . A direct system would comprise a bilingual dictionary containing potential replacements or target language equivalents for each word in the source language . A restriction of such MT systems was therefore that they were unidirectional and could not accommodate many languages unlike the systems that followed . Rules for choosing correct replacements were incorporated but functioned on a basic level ; although there was some initial morphological analysis prior to dictionary lookup , subsequent local re - ordering and final generation of the target text , there was no scope for syntactic analysis let alone semantic analysis ! Inevitably this often led to poor quality output , which certainly contributed to the severe criticism of MT in the 1966 Automatic Language Processing Advisory Committee ( ALPAC ) report which stated that it saw little use for MT in the foreseeable future . The damning judgment of the ALPAC report effectively halted research funding for machine translation in the USA throughout the 1960s and 1970s . We can say that both technical constraints and the lack of a linguistic basis hampered MT systems . The system developed at Georgetown University , Washington DC , and first demonstrated at IBM in New York in 1954 had no clear separation of translation knowledge and processing algorithms , making modification of the system difficult . In the period following the ALPAC report the need was increasingly felt for an approach to MT system design which would avoid many of the pitfalls of 1 G systems . By this time opinion had shifted towards the view that linguistic developments should influence system design and development . Indeed it can be said that the second generation ( 2 G ) of \\\" indirect \\\" systems owed much to linguistic theories of the time . 2 G systems can be divided essentially into \\\" interlingual \\\" and \\\" transfer \\\" systems . We will look first of all at interlingual systems , or rather those claiming to adopt an interlingual approach . Although Warren Weaver had put forward the idea of an intermediary \\\" universal \\\" language as a possible route to machine translation in his 1947 letter to Norbert Wiener , linguistics was unable to offer any models to apply until the 1960s . By virtue of its introduction of the concept of \\\" deep structure \\\" , Noam Chomsky 's theory of transformational generative grammar appeared to offer a route towards \\\" universal \\\" semantic representations and thus appeared to provide a model for the structure of a so - called interlingua . An interlingua is not a natural language , rather it can be seen as a meaning representation which is independent of both the source and the target language of translation . An interlingua system maps from a language 's surface structure to the interlingua and vice versa . A truly interlingual approach to system design has obvious advantages , the most important of which is economy , since an interlingual representation can be applied for any language pair and facilitates addition of other language pairs without major additions to the system . The next section looks at \\\" transfer \\\" systems . In a transfer model the intermediate representation is language dependent , there being a bilingual module whose function it is to interpose between source language and target language intermediate representations . Thus we can not say that the transfer module is language independent . ( For n languages the number of transfer modules required would be n ( n -1 ) or n ( n -1 ) /2 if the modules are reversible ) . An important advance in 2 G systems when compared to 1 G was the separation of algorithms ( software ) from linguistic data ( lingware ) . In a system such as the Georgetown model the program mixed language modelling , translation and the processing thereof in one program . This meant that the program was monolithic and it was easy to introduce errors when trying to rectify an existing shortcoming . The move towards separating software and lingware was hastened by parallel advances in both computational and linguistic techniques . The adoption of linguistic formalisms in the design of systems and the development of high level programming languages enabled MT workers to code in a more problem - oriented way . The development in programming languages meant that it was becoming ever easier to code rules for translation in a meaningful manner and arguably improved the quality of these rules . The declarative nature of linguistic description could now be far more explicitly reflected in the design of programs for MT . . Early MT systems were predominantly parser - based , one of the first steps in such a system being to parse and tag the source language : see Section 5 on Parsing and Tagging . More recent current approaches to MT rely less on formal linguistic descriptions than the transfer approach described above . Translation Memory ( TM ) systems are now in widespread commercial use : see below and Chapter 10 of Arnold et al . ( 1994 ) . Example - Based Machine Translation ( EBMT ) is a relatively new technology which aims to combine both traditional MT and more recent TM paradigms by reusing previous translations and applying various degrees of linguistic knowledge to convert fuzzy matches into exact ones : see the Wikipedia article on EBMT . However , some early definitions of EBMT refer to what is now known as TM and they often exclude the concept of fuzzy matches . Essentially , Google Translat e begins by examining and comparing massive corpora of texts on the Web that have already been translated by human beings . It looks for matches between source and target texts and uses complex statistical analysis routines to look for statistically significant patterns , i.e. it works out the rules of the interrelationships between source and target texts for itself . As more and more corpora are added to the Web this means that Google Translate will keep improving until it reaches a point where it will be very difficult to tell that a machine has done the translation . I remember early machine translation tools translating \\\" Wie geht es dir ? \\\" as \\\" How goes it you ? \\\" Now Google Translate gets it right : \\\" How are you ? \\\" Thus we have , in a sense , come full circle in that Weaver 's ideas of applying statistical techniques are seen as a fruitful basis for MT . . 3.2 Commercial MT packages . There are many automatic translation packages on the market - as well as free packages on the Web . While such packages may be useful for extracting the gist of a text they should not be seen as a serious replacement for the human translator . Some are not all that bad , producing translations that are half - intelligible , letting you know whether a text is worth having translated properly . See : . Professional human translators are making increasing use of Translation Memory ( TM ) packages . TM packages store texts that have previously been translated , together with their source texts , in a large database . Chunks of new texts to be translated are then matched against the translated texts in the database and suggested translations are offered to the human translator wherever a match is found . The human translator has to intervene regularly in this process of translation , making corrections and amendments as necessary . TM systems can save hours of time ( estimated at up to 80 % of a translator 's time ) , especially when translating texts that are repetitive or that use lots of standard phrases and sentence formulations . Producing updates of technical manuals is a typical application of TM systems . Examples of TM systems include : . An example of automatic translations can be found at the Newstran website . This site is extremely useful for locating newspapers in a wide range of languages . You can also locate selected newspapers that have been translated using a Machine Translation system . Another approach to translation is the stored phrase bank , for example LinguaWrite , which was aimed at the business user and contained a large database of equivalent phrases and sentences in different languages to facilitate the writing of business letters . LinguaWrite was programmed by Marco Bruzzone in the 1980s and marketed by Camsoft , but it is no longer available and has not been updated . David Sephton 's Tick - Tack ( Primrose Publishing ) adopted a similar approach , beginning as a package consisting of \\\" building blocks \\\" of language for business communication , but it now embraces other topics . 3.3 Just for fun . 3.3.1 Some apocryphal stuff . The following examples have often been cited as mistakes made by machine translation ( MT ) systems . Whether they are real examples or not can not be verified . Russian - English : In a technical text that had been translated from Russian into English the term water sheep kept appearing . When the Russian source text was checked it was found that it was actually referring to a hydraulic ram . Russian - English : Idioms are often a problem . Russian - English : Another example , similar to the one above , is where out of sight , out of mind ended up being translated as the equivalent of blind and stupid . MT systems do , however , often make mistakes . The Systran MT system , which has been used by the European Commission , translated the English phrase pregnant women and children into des femmes et enfants enceints , which implies that both the women and the children are pregnant . Although it is an interpretation of the original phrase that is theoretically possible , it is also clearly wrong . 3.3.2 Translations of nursery rhymes . Try using an online machine translator to translate a text from English into another language and then back again . The results are often amusing , especially if you are translating nursery rhymes ! ( i ) Bah , bah , black sheep translated into French and then back again into English , using Babel Fish . English source text : Bah , bah , black sheep , have you any wool ? Yes sir , yes sir , three bags full . One for the master , one for the dame , and one for the little boy who lives down the lane . French translation : Bah , bah , mouton noir , vous ont n'importe quelles laines ? Oui monsieur , oui monsieur , trois sacs compl\\u00e8tement . Un pour le ma\\u00eetre , un pour dame , et un pour le petit gar\\u00e7on qui vit en bas de la ruelle . And back into English again : Bah , bah , black sheep , have you n ' imports which wools ? Yes Sir , yes Sir , three bags completely . For the Master , for lady , and for the little boy who lives in bottom of the lane . ( ii ) Humpty Dumpty translated into Italian and then back again into English , using Babel Fish . English source text : Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall . Humpty Dumpty had a great fall . Italian translation : Humpty Dumpty si \\u00e8 seduto su una parete . Humpty Dumpty ha avuto una grande caduta . I cavalli di tutto il re e gli uomini di tutto il re non hanno potuto un Humpty ancora . And back into English again : Humpty Dumpty has been based on a wall . Humpty Dumpty has had a great fall . The horses of all the king and the men of all the king have not been able a Humpty still . ( iii ) Humpty Dumpty translated into Italian and then back again into English , using Google Translate . English source text : Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall . Humpty Dumpty had a great fall . Italian translation : Humpty Dumpty sedeva su un muro . Humpty Dumpty ha avuto un grande caduta . Tutti i cavalli del re e tutti gli uomini del re non poteva mettere Humpty di nuovo insieme . And back into English again : Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall . Humpty Dumpty had a great fall . All the king 's horses and all the king 's men could not put Humpty together again . Now , the above is an interesting result ! Google Translate used to be a very unreliable MT tool . It drives language teachers mad , as their students often use it to do their homework , e.g. translating from a given text into a foreign language or drafting their own compositions and then translating them . Mistakes made by Google Translate used to be very easy to spot , but ( as indicated above in Section 3.1 ) Google changed its translation engine a few years ago and now uses a Statistical Machine Translation ( SMT ) approach . The Humpty Dumpty translation back into English from the Italian appears to indicate that Google Translate has matched the whole text and got it right . Clever ! 3.3.3 Translations of business and journalistic texts . ( i ) A business text , translated with Google Translate and Babel Fish . Google Translate was used to translate the following text from German into English : Die Handelskammer in Saarbr\\u00fccken hat uns Ihre Anschrift zur Verf\\u00fcgung gestellt . Wir sind ein mittelgro\\u00dfes Fachgesch\\u00e4ft in Stuttgart , und wir spezialisieren uns auf den Verkauf von Personalcomputern . This was rendered as : The Chamber of Commerce in Saarbr\\u00fccken has provided us your address is available . We are a medium sized shop in Stuttgart , and we specialize in sales of personal computers . Babel Fish produced a better version : The Chamber of Commerce in Saarbruecken put your address to us at the disposal . We are a medium sized specialist shop in Stuttgart , and we specialize in the sale of personal computers . ( ii ) A journalistic text , translated with Google Translate and Babel Fish . Die deutsche Exportwirtschaft k\\u00e4mpft mit der weltweiten Konjunkturflaute und muss deshalb von den Zeiten zweistelligen Wachstums Abschied nehmen . [ Ludolf Wartenberg vom Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie ] . This was rendered by Google Translate as : The German export economy is struggling with the global downturn and must therefore take the times of double - digit growth goodbye . [ Ludolf Wartenberg from the Federation of German Industry ] . The German export trade and industry fights with the world - wide recession and must take therefore from the times of two digit growth parting . [ Ludolf waiting mountain of the Federal association of the German industry . ] Computers are normally associated with two standard input devices , the keyboard and the mouse , and two standard output devices , the display screen and the printer . All these restrict language input and output . However , computer programs and hardware devices that enable the computer to handle human speech are now commonplace . All modern computers allow the user to plug in a microphone and record his / her own voice . A variety of other sources of sound recordings can also be used . Storing these sound files is not a problem anymore as a result of the immensely increased capacity and reduced cost of storage media and improved compression techniques that enable the size of sound files to be substantially reduced . For further information on the applications of sound recording and playback technology to CALL see Module 2.2 , Introduction to multimedia CALL . A range of computer software is available for speech analysis . Spoken input can be analysed according to a wide variety of parameters and the analysis can be represented graphically or numerically . Of course , graphic output is not immediately useful for the uninitiated viewer , and hence we are not arguing that this kind of graphical representation will prove useful to the language learner . On the other hand , specialists are well capable of interpreting this speech analysis data . The information we get from speech analysis has proven very valuable indeed for speech synthesis and speech recognition , which are dealt with in the following two sections . 4.1 Speech synthesis . Speech synthesis describes the process of generating human - like speech by computer . Producing natural sounding speech is a complex process in which one has to consider a range of factors that go beyond just converting characters to sounds because very often there is no one - to - one relation between them . The intonation of particular sentence types and the rhythm of particular utterances also have to be considered . Currently speech synthesis is far more advanced and more robust than speech recognition ( see Section 4.2 below ) . The naturalness of artificially produced utterances is now very impressive compared to what used to be produced by earlier speech synthesis systems in which the intonation and timing were far from natural and resulted in the production of monotonous , robot - like speech . Many people are now unaware that so - called talking dictionaries use speech synthesis software rather than recordings of human voices . In - car satellite navigation ( satnav ) systems can produce a range of different types of human voices , both male and female in a number of different languages , and \\\" talk \\\" to the car driver guiding him / her to a chosen destination . So far , however , speech synthesis has not been as widely used in CALL as speech recognition . This is probably due to the fact that language teachers ' requirements regarding the presentation of spoken language are very demanding . Anything that sounds artificial is likely to be rejected . Some language teachers even reject speakers whose regional accent is too far from what is considered standard or received pronunciation . There is , however , a category of speech synthesis technology known as Text To Speech ( TTS ) technology that is widely used for practical purposes . TTS software falls into the category of assistive technology , which has a vital role in improving accessiblity for a wide range of computer users with special needs , which is now governed by legislation in the UK . The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act ( SENDA ) of 2001 covers educational websites and obliges their designers \\\" to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that people who are disabled are not put at a substantial disadvantage compared to people who are not disabled . \\\" See JISC 's website on Disability Legislation and ICT in Further and Higher Education - Essentials . See the Glossary for definitions of assistive technology and accessiblity . TTS is important in making computers accessible to blind or partially sighted people as it enables them to \\\" read \\\" from the screen . TTS technology can be linked to any written input in a variety of languages , e.g. automatic pronunciation of words from an online dictionary , reading aloud of a text , etc . These are examples of TTS software : . Festival Speech Synthesis System : From the Centre for Speech Technology Research at the University of Edinburgh . Festival offers a general framework for building speech synthesis systems as well as including examples of various modules . Just for fun I entered the phrase \\\" Pas d'elle yeux Rh\\u00f4ne que nous \\\" into a couple of French language synthesisers . It 's a nonsense sentence in French but it comes out sounding like a French person trying to pronounce a well - known expression in English . Try it ! There are also Web - based tools that enable you to create animated cartoons or movies incorporating TTS , for example : . Voki enables you to create and customise your own speaking cartoon character . You can choose the TTS option ( as in Graham Davies 's example on the right ) to give the character a voice , or you can record your own voice . ReadTheWords : A tool that works in much the same way as Voki , but without the option of recording one 's own voice . An excellent tool that helps people with hearing impairments to learn how to articulate is the CSLU Speech Toolkit . To what extent speech synthesis systems are suitable for CALL is a matter for further discussion . See the article by Handley & Hamel ( 2005 ) , who report on their progress towards the development of a benchmark for determining the adequacy of speech synthesis systems for use in CALL . The article mentions a Web - based package called FreeText , for advanced learners of French , the outcome of a project funded by the European Commission . 4.2 Speech recognition . Speech recognition describes the use of computers to recognise spoken words . Speech recognition has not reached such a high level of performance as speech synthesis ( see Section 4.1 above ) , but it has certainly become usable in CALL in recent years . EyeSpeak English is a typical example of the use of speech recognition software for helping students improve their English pronunciation . Speech recognition is a non - trivial task because the same spoken word does not produce entirely the same sound waves when uttered by different people or even when uttered by the same person on different occasions . The process is complex : the computer has to digitise the sound , transform it to discard unneeded information , and then try to match it with words stored in a dictionary . The most efficient speech recognition systems are speaker - dependent , i.e. they are trained to recognise a particular person 's speech and can then distinguish thousands of words uttered by that person . If one remembers that each of the parameters analysed could have been affected by some speaker - independent background noise or by some idiosyncratic pronunciation features of this particular speaker then it already becomes clear how difficult the interpretation of the analysis data is for a speech recognition program . The following information is taken from an article written by Norman Harris of DynEd , a publisher of CALL software incorporating ASR : . Speech recognition technology has finally come of age - at least for language training purposes for young adults and adults . The essence of real language is not in discrete single words - language students need to practice complete phrases and sentences in realistic contexts . Moreover , programs which were trained to accept a speaker 's individual pronunciation quirks were not ideally suited to helping students move toward more standard pronunciation . These technologies also failed if the speaker 's voice changed due to common colds , laryngitis and other throat ailments , rendering them useless until the speaker recovered or retrained the speech engine . The solution to these problems came with the development of continuous speech recognition engines that were speaker independent . These programs are able to deal with complete sentences spoken at a natural pace , not just isolated words . Such flexibility with regard to pronunciation paradigms means that today 's speaker - independent speech recognition programs are not ideal for direct pronunciation practice . Nonetheless , exercises which focus on fluency and word order , and with native speaker models which are heard immediately after a student 's utterance had been successfully recognized , have been shown to indirectly result in much improved pronunciation . Another trade off is that the greater flexibility and leniency which allows these programs to \\\" recognize \\\" sentences spoken by students with a wide variety of accents , also limits the accuracy of the programs , especially for similar sounding words and phrases . Some errors may be accepted as correct . Native speakers testing the \\\" understanding \\\" of programs \\\" tuned \\\" to the needs of non - native speakers may be bothered by this , but most teachers , after careful consideration of the different needs and psychologies of native speakers and learners , will accept the trade off . Students do not expect to be understood every time . If they are required occasionally to repeat a sentence which the program has not recognized or which the program has misinterpreted , there may be some small frustration , but language students are much more likely to take this in their stride than would native speakers . On the other hand , if the program does \\\" understand \\\" such students , however imperfect their pronunciation , they typically experience a huge sense of satisfaction , a feel good factor native speakers simply can not enjoy to anywhere near the same degree . The worst thing for a student is a program that is too demanding of perfection - such programs will quickly lead to student frustration or the kind of embarrassed , hesitant unwillingness to speak English typical of many classrooms . Even if we accept that accuracy needs to be responsive to proficiency in order to encourage students to speak , we must , as teachers , be concerned that errors do not become reinforced . A recent breakthrough is the implementation of apps such as Apple 's Siri on the iPhone 4S and Evi , which is available for the iPhone and the Android . These apps are quite impressive at recognising speech and providing answers to questions submitted by the user . Evi 's performance was tested by the author of this paragraph . \\\" She \\\" immediately provided correct answers to these questions submitted by voice input : . In which American state is Albuquerque ? In addition , Evi may link to relevant websites that provide further information . Text input is also accepted . In this section we outline the essentials of parsing , first of all by describing the components of a parsing system and then discussing different kinds of parser . We look at one linguistic phenomenon which causes problems for parsing and finally examine potential solutions to the difficulties raised by parsing . Put in simple terms , a parser is a program that maps strings of a language into its structures . The most basic components needed by a parser are a lexicon containing words that may be parsed and a grammar , consisting of rules which determine grammatical structures . The first parsers were developed for the analysis of programming languages ; obviously as artificial , regular languages they present fewer problems than a natural language . It is most useful to think of parsing as a search problem which has to be solved . It can be solved using an algorithm which can be defined as : . [ ... ] a formal procedure that always produces a correct or optimal result . An algorithm applies a step - by - step procedure that guarantees a specific outcome or solves a specific problem . The procedure of an algorithm performs a computation in a finite amount of time . Programmers specify the algorithm the program will follow when they develop a conventional program . ( Smith 1990 ) . Parsing algorithms define a procedure that looks for the optimum combination of grammatical rules that generate a tree structure for the input sentence . How might we define these grammatical rules in a concise way that is amenable to computer processing ? A useful construct for our purposes is a so - called context - free grammar ( CFG ) . A CFG consists of rules containing a single symbol on the left - hand side and one or more on the right - hand side . For example , the statement that a sentence can consist of : . a noun phrase and a verb phrase can be expressed by the following rewrite rule . S \\u00ae NP VP . This means that a sentence S can be ' rewritten ' as a noun phrase NP followed by a verb phrase VP which are in their turn defined in the grammar . A noun phrase , for example , can consist of a determiner DET and a noun N. These symbols are known as non - terminals and the words represented by these symbols are terminal symbols . Parsing algorithms can proceed top - down or bottom - up . In some cases , top - down and bottom - up algorithms can be combined . Below are simple descriptions of two parsing strategies . 5.1.1 Top Down ( depth first ) . Top down strategy works from non - terminal symbols : . S \\u00ae NP VP . and then breaks them down into constituents . The strategy assumes we have an S and tries to fit it in . If we choose to search depth first , then we proceed down one side of the tree at a time . The search will end successfully if it manages to break down the sentence into all its terminal symbols ( words ) . 5.1.2 Bottom up ( breadth first ) . A bottom up strategy looks at elements of an S and assigns categories to them to form larger constituents until we arrive at an S. If we choose to search breadth first , then we proceed consecutively through each layer and stop successfully once we have constructed a sentence . Let 's look now at one linguistic phenomenon which causes problems for parsers - that of so - called attachment ambiguity . Consider the following sentence : . The man saw the man in the park with a telescope . Parser output can be represented as a bracketed list or , more commonly , a tree structure . Here is the output of two possible parses for the sentence above . One way of dealing with the problem of sentences which have more than one possible parse is to concentrate on specific elements of the parser input and to not deal with such phenomena as attachment ambiguity . Ideally we expect a parser to successfully analyse a sentence on the basis of its grammar , but often there are problems caused by errors in the text or incompleteness of grammar and lexicon . Also the length of sentences and ambiguity of grammars often make it hard to successfully parse unrestricted text . An approach which addresses some of these issues is partial or shallow parsing . Abney ( 1997:125 ) succinctly describes partial parsing thus : . \\\" Partial parsing techniques aim to recover syntactic information efficiently and reliably from unrestricted text , by sacrificing completeness and depth of analysis . \\\" Partial parsers concentrate on recovering pieces of sentence structure which do not require large amounts of information ( such as lexical association information ) ; attachment remains unresolved for instance . We can see that in this way parsing efficiency is greatly improved . Another strategy for analysing language is part - of - speech tagging , in which we do not seek to find larger structures such as noun phrases but instead label each word in a sentence with its appropriate part of speech . Here is the original paragraph from Section 3 of this document : . In a transfer model the intermediate representation is language dependent , there being a bilingual module whose function it is to interpose between source language and target language intermediate representations . Thus we can not say that the transfer module is language independent . The following table shows the tagger output , and we can see that most of the words have been correctly identified . additional . languages . NNS . language . required . VBN . require . . . SENT . . . As with partial parsing , we are not trying to find correct attachments and since it is a limited task the success rate is quite high . The information derived from tagging can itself have input into partial parsing or into improving the performance of traditional parsers . Some of the decision task as to what is the correct part of speech to assign to a word is based on the probability of two or three word sequences ( bigrams and trigrams ) occurring , even where words can be assigned more than one part of speech . For instance , in our example tagged text the sequence ' the transfer module ' occurs . Transfer is of course also a verb , but the likelihood of a determiner ( the ) being followed by a verb is lower than the likelihood of a determiner noun sequence . See als o the Visual Interactive Syntax Learning ( VISL ) website . An online parser and a variety of other tools concerned with English grammar , including games and quizzes , can be found here . 5.1.3 Parsing erroneous input . Of course , in CALL we are dealing with texts that have been produced by language learners at various levels of proficiency and accuracy . It is therefore reasonable to assume that the parser has to be prepared to deal with linguistic errors in the input . One thing we could do is to complement our grammar for correct sentences with a grammar of incorrect sentences - an error grammar , i.e. we capture individual and/or typical errors in a separate rule system . The advantage of this error grammar approach is that the feedback can be very specific and is normally fairly reliable because this feedback can be attached to a very specific rule . The big drawback , however , is that individual learner errors have to be anticipated in the sense that each error needs to be covered by an adequate rule . However , as already stated it is not only in texts that have been produced by language learners that we find erroneous structures . Machine translation is facing similar problems . Dina & Malnati review approaches \\\" concerning the design and the implementation of grammars able to deal with ' real input ' . \\\" ( Dina & Malnati 1993:75 ) . They list four approaches : . The rule - based approach which relies on two sets of rules : one for grammatical input and the other for ungrammatical input . Dina & Malnati point out quite rightly that normally well - formedness conditions should be sufficient and the second set of rules results in linguistic redundancy . The main problem with using this approach in a parser - based CALL system is the problem of having to anticipate the errors learners are likely to make . The metarule - based approach uses a set of well - formedness rules and if none of them can be applied calls an algorithm that relaxes some constraints and records the kind of violation . Dina & Malnati note the procedurality of the algorithm causes problems when confronted with multiple errors - something very likely in any text produced by a language learner . The preference - based approach comprises an overgenerating grammar and a set of preference rules . \\\" [ ... ] each time a formal condition is removed from a b - rule to make its applicability context wider , a preference rule must be added to the grammar . Such a p - rule must be able to state - in the present context of the b - rule - the condition that has been previously removed . \\\" ( Dina & Malnati 1993:78 ) Again a source for linguistic redundancy which might result in inconsistencies in the grammar . They claim that , due to the overgeneration of possible interpretations , \\\" the system would be completely unusable in an applied context . \\\" ( ibid.:79 ) . The constraint - based approach is based on the following assumptions : . each ( sub)tree is marked by an index of error ( initially set to 0 ) ; . the violation of a constraint in a rule does not block the application , but increases the error index of the generated ( sub)tree ; . at the end of parsing the object marked by the smallest index is chosen . Consequently , the \\\" most plausible interpretation of a [ ... ] sentence is the one which satisfies the largest number of constraints . \\\" ( Dina & Malnati 1993:80 ) . We have seen in Section 3 that Machine Translation ( MT ) and the political and scientific interest in machine translation played a significant role in the acceptance ( or non - acceptance ) as well as the general development of Human Language Technologies . By 1964 , however , the promise of operational MT systems still seemed distant and the sponsors set up a committee , which recommended in 1966 that funding for MT should be reduced . It brought to an end a decade of intensive MT research activity . ( Hutchins 1986:39 ) . It is then perhaps not surprising that the mid-1960s saw the birth of another discipline : Computer Assisted Language Learning ( CALL ) . The PLATO project , which was initiated at the University of Illinois in 1960 , is widely regarded as the beginning of CALL - although CALL was just part of this huge package of general Computer Assisted Learning ( CAL ) programs running on mainframe computers . PLATO IV ( 1972 ) was probably the version of this project that had the biggest impact on the development of CALL ( Hart 1995 ) . At the same time , another American university , Brigham Young University , received government funding for a CALL project , TICCIT ( Time - Shared Interactive , Computer Controlled Information Television ) ( Jones 1995 ) . Other well - known and still widely used programs were developed soon afterwards : . The CALIS / WinCALIS ( Computer Aided Language Instruction System ) authoring tools , Duke University ( Borchardt 1995 ) . The TUCO package for learners of German , developed by Heimy Taylor and Werner Haas , Ohio State University . See Module 3.2 , Section 5.9 . The CLEF package for learners of French , which was produced by a consortium of Canadian universities in the late 1970s and is still going strong today . See Module 3.2 , Section 5.9 . In the UK , John Higgins developed Storyboard in the early 1980s , a total Cloze text reconstruction program for the microcomputer ( Higgins & Johns 1984:57 ) . ( Levy 1997:24 - 25 ) describes how other programs extended this idea further . See Section 8.3 , Module 1.4 , headed Total text reconstruction : total Cloze , for further information on total Cloze programs . In recent years the development of CALL has been greatly influenced by the technology and by our knowledge of and our expertise in using it , so that not only the design of most CALL software , but also its classification has been technology - driven . For example , Wolff ( 1993:21 ) distinguished five groups of applications : . The late 1980s saw the beginning of attempts which are mostly subsumed under Intelligent CALL ( ICALL ) , a \\\" mix of AI [ Artificial Intelligence ] techniques and CALL \\\" ( Matthews 1992b : i ) . Early AI - based CALL was not without its critics , however : . And that , fundamentally , is why my initial enthusiasm has now turned so sour . ( Last 1989:153 ) . For a more up - to - date and positive point of view of Artifical Intelligence , see Dodigovic ( 2005 ) . Bowerman ( 1993:31 ) notes : \\\" Weischedel et al . ( 1978 ) produced the first ICALL [ Intelligent CALL ] system which dealt with comprehension exercises . It made use of syntactic and semantic knowledge to check students ' answers to comprehension questions . \\\" As far as could be ascertained , this was just the early swallow that did not create a summer . Kr\\u00fcger - Thielmann ( 1992:51ff . ) lists and summarises the following early projects in ICALL : ALICE , ATHENA , BOUWSTEEN & COGO , EPISTLE , ET , LINGER , VP2 , XTRA - TE , Zock . Matthews ( 1993:5 ) identifies Linguistic Theory and Second Language Acquisition Theory as the two main disciplines which inform Intelligent CALL and which are ( or will be ) informed by Intelligent CALL . He adds : \\\" the obvious AI research areas from which ICALL should be able to draw the most insights are Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) and Intelligent Tutoring Systems ( ITS ) \\\" ( Matthews1993:6 ) . Matthews shows that it is possible to \\\" conceive of an ICALL system in terms of the classical ITS architecture \\\" ( ibid . ) The system consists of three modules - expert , student and teacher module - and an interface . The expert module is the one that \\\" houses \\\" the language knowledge of the system . It is this part which can process any piece of text produced by a learner - in an ideal system . This is usually done with the help of a parser of some kind : . ( Holland et al . 1993:28 ) . This notion of parser - based CALL not only captures the nature of the field much better than the somewhat misleading term \\\" Intelligent CALL \\\" ( Is all other CALL un - intelligent ? ) , it also identifies the use of Human Language Technologies as one possible approach in CALL alongside others such as multimedia - based CALL and Web - based CALL and thus identifies parser - based CALL as one possible way forward for CALL . In some cases , the ( technology - defined ) borders between these sub - fields of CALL are not even clearly identifiable , as we will see in some of the projects mentioned in the following paragraphs . To exemplify recent advances in the use of sophisticated human language technology in CALL , let us have a look at some of the projects that were presented at two conferences in the late 1990s . The first one is the Language Teaching and Language Technology conference in Groningen in 1997 ( Jager et al . 1998 ) . Witt & Young ( 1998 ) , on the other hand , are concerned with assessing pronunciation . They implemented and tested a pronunciation scoring algorithm which is based on speech recognition ( see Section 4.2 ) and uses hidden Markov models . \\\" The results show that - at least for this setup with artificially generated pronunciation errors - the GOP [ goodness of pronunciation ] scoring method is a viable assessment tool . \\\" A third paper on pronunciation at this conference , by Skrelin & Volskaja ( 1998 ) outlined the use of speech synthesis ( see Section 4.1 ) in language learning and lists dictation , distinction of homographs , a sound dictionary and pronunciation drills as possible applications . \\\" The project vision foresees two main areas where GLOSSER applications can be used . First , in language learning and second , as a tool for users that have a bit of knowledge of a foreign language , but can not read it easily or reliably \\\" ( Dokter & Nerbonne 1998:88 ) . Dokter & Nerbonne report on the French - Dutch demonstrator running under UNIX . The demonstrator : . uses morphological analysis to provide additional grammatical information on individual words and to simplify dictionary look - up ; . relies on automatic word selection ; . offers the opportunity to insert glosses ( taken form the dictionary look - up ) into the text ; . relies on string - based word sense disambiguation ( \\\" Whenever a lexical context is found in the text that is also provided in the dictionary , the example in the dictionary is highlighted . \\\" ( op.cit.:93 ) . Roosma & Pr\\u00f3sz\\u00e9ky ( 1998 ) draw attention to the fact that GLOSSER works with the following language pairs : English - Estonian - Hungarian , English - Bulgarian , French - Dutch and describe a demonstrator version running under Windows . Dokter et al ( 1998 ) conclude in their user study \\\" that Glosser - RuG improves the ease with which language students can approach a foreign language text \\\" ( Dokter et al . 1998:175 ) . The latter project relies on a spellchecker , morphological analyser , syntactic parser and a lexical database for Basque , and the authors report on the development of an interlanguage model . At another conference ( UMIST , May 1998 ) , which brought together a group of researchers who are exploring the use of HLT in CALL software , Schulze et al . ( 1999 ) and Tschichold ( 1999 ) discussed strategies for improving the success rate of grammar checkers . Menzel & Schr\\u00f6der ( 1999 ) described error diagnosis in a multi - level representation . The demonstration system captures the relations of entities in a simple town scenery . The available syntactic , semantic and pragmatic information is checked simultaneously for constraint violations , i.e. errors made by the language learners . Visser ( 1999 ) introduced CALLex , a program for learning vocabulary based on lexical functions . Diaz de Ilarraza et al . ( 1999 ) described aspects of IDAZKIDE , a learning environment for Spanish learners of Basque . The program contains the following modules : wide - coverage linguistic tools ( lexical database with 65,000 entries ; spell checker ; a word form proposer and a morphological analyser ) , an adaptive user interface and a student modelling system . The model of the students ' language knowledge , i.e. their interlanguage , is based on a corpus analysis ( 300 texts produced by learners of Basque ) . Foucou & K\\u00fcbler ( 1999 ) presented a Web - based environment for teaching technical English to students of computing . Ward et al . ( 1999 ) showed that Natural Language Processing techniques combined with a graphical interface can be used to produce meaningful language games . Davies & Poesio ( 1998 ) reported on tests of simple CALL prototypes that have been created using CSLUrp , a graphical authoring system for the creation of spoken dialogue systems . They argue that since it is evident that today 's dialogue systems are usable in CALL software , it is now possible and necessary to study the integration of corrective feedback in these systems . Mitkov ( 1998 ) outlined early plans for a new CALL project , The Language Learner 's Workbench . It is the aim of this project to incorporate a number of already available HLT tools and to package them for language learners . These examples of CALL applications that make use of Human Language Technologies are by no means exhaustive . They not only illustrate that research in HLT in CALL is vibrant , but also that HLT has an important contribution to make in the further development of CALL . Of course , both disciplines are still rather young and many projects in both areas , CALL and HLT , have not even reached the stage of the implementation of a fully functional prototype yet . A number of CALL packages that make use of speech recognition have reached the commercial market and are being used successfully by learners all over the world ( see Section 4.2 ) . Speech synthesis , certainly at word level , has achieved a clarity of pronunciation that makes it a viable tool for language learning ( see Section 4.1 ) . Many popular electronic dictionaries now incorporate speech synthesis systems . Part - of - speech taggers have reached a level of accuracy that makes them usable in the automatic pre - processing of learner texts . Morphological analysers for a number of languages automatically provide grammatical information on vocabulary items in context and make automatic dictionary look - ups of inflected or derived word forms possible . This progress in HLT and CALL has mainly been possible as the result of our better understanding of the structures of language - our understanding of linguistics . The lack of linguistic modelling and the insufficient deployment of Natural Language Processing techniques has sometimes been given as one reason for the lack of progress in some areas of CALL : see , for example , Levy ( 1997:3 ) , citing Kohn ( 1994 ) . [ ... ] Kohn suggests that current CALL is lacking because of poor linguistic modelling , insufficient deployment of natural language processing techniques , an emphasis on special - purpose rather than general - purpose technology , and a neglect of the ' human ' dimnesion of CALL ( Kohn 1994:32 ) . The examples in the previous section have shown that it is possible to apply certain linguistic theories ( e.g. phonology and morphology ) to Human Language Technologies and implement this technology in CALL software . This is , of course , true . However , it does not mean that interesting fragments or aspects of a given language can not be captured by a formal linguistic theory and hence implemented in a CALL application . In other words , if one can not capture the German language in its entirety in order to implement this linguistic knowledge in a computer program , this does not mean that one can not capture interesting linguistic phenomena of that language . This means even if we are only able to describe a fragment of a given language adequately we can still make very good use of this description in computer applications for language learning . What is the kind of knowledge we ought to have about language before we can attempt to produce an HLT tool that can be put to effective use in CALL ? Let us look at one particular aspect of language - grammar . In recent years , the usefulness of conscious learning of grammar has been discussed time and again , very often in direct opposition to what has been termed \\\" the communicative approach \\\" . ( ibid.:6 ) This assumption leads to the question of what role exactly the computer ( program ) has to play in a sensitive , rich and enjoyable grammar - learning process . The diversity of approaches outlined in this special issue of ReCALL on grammar illustrates that there are many different roads to successful grammar learning that will need to be explored . In this module , only the example of parser - based CALL will be discussed . Let us take a grammar checker for language learners as a specific example in point . This grammar checker could then be integrated into a CALL program , a word - processor , an email editor , a Web page editor etc . The design of such a grammar checker is mainly based on findings in theoretical linguistics and second language acquisition theory . Let us start with second language acquisition theory . Research in second language acquisition has proved that grammar learning can lead to more successful language acquisition . Here learners have the opportunity to correct grammatical errors and mistakes that they have made while concentrating on the subject matter and the communicative function of the text . It is at this stage that a grammar checker for language learners can provide useful and stimulating guidance . In order to ascertain the computational features of such a grammar checker , let us first consider what exactly we mean by \\\" grammar \\\" in a language learning context . Helbig discusses possible answers to this question from the point of view of the teaching and learning of foreign languages in general : . As a starting point for answering our question concerning the relevance ( and necessity ) of grammar in foreign language teaching we used a differentiation of what was and is understood by the term \\\" grammar \\\" : . Grammar A : the system of rules that is inherent to the object language itself and is independent of the fact whether it has been captured by Linguistics or not ; . Grammar B : the scientific - linguistic description of the language inherent system of rules , the modelling of Grammar A by Linguistics ; . Grammar C : the system of rules intern to the speaker and listener which is formed in the head of the learner during language acquisition and which forms the basis for him / her to produce and understand correct sentences and texts and to use them appropriately in communication . ( Helbig:1975 ) . Helbig identifies further a Grammar B1 and a Grammar B2 - the former being a linguistic grammar and the latter being a learner grammar . The description of grammar B1c is a literal translation of Helbig 's wording - in the terminology used now , the term \\\" interlanguage \\\" appears to be the most appropriate . The application of Helbig 's grammar classification to CALL produces the following results : . Grammar A remains as defined by Helbig . In other words it refers to the target grammar of the interlanguage continuum . Grammar B1a is the grammar which enables the parser to process grammatically well - formed sentences in the target language . Grammars B1b , B1c and B2 enable the grammar checking CALL tool to detect errors in the learner input and provide the linguistic information to generate feedback . Grammar C is the grammar system which the CALL tool should help to correct and expand . Additionally , the grammar checker will gather data for learner profiles which should allow useful insights into the development of Grammar C of learners you have used the program . Consequently , Grammar B in its entirety and Grammar C will have to be considered first and foremost when developing the grammar checker . The question then arises : If Grammar A provides the linguistic data for the parser developer , how can we \\\" feed \\\" these different grammars into a computer program ? The computer requires that any grammar which we intend to use in any program ( or programming language , for that matter ) be mathematically exact . Grammars which satisfy this condition are normally referred to as formal grammars . The mathematical description of these grammars uses set theory . Therefore , a language L is said to have a vocabulary V . If there were no restrictions on how to construct strings , the number of possible strings is infinite . This becomes clear when one considers that each vocabulary item of V could be repeated infinitely in order to construct a string . However , as language learners in particular know any language L adheres to a finite set of ( grammar ) rules . This explains why grammar teaching software that attempts to anticipate possible incorrect answers can only do this successfully if the answer domain is severely restricted and the anticipation process will therefore much simpler . Could a computer program perform this task - a task based on infinite possibilities ? Yes , it could - but not based on infinite possibilities . That is why it will be necessary to look for an approach which is based on a finite set of possibilities , which can then be pre - programmed . Let us therefore consider L the set of strings that can be constructed using the ( formal ) grammar G . A formal grammar can be defined as follows ( see e.g. Allen 1995 ): . G ( VN , VT , R , S ) . And here we are already dealing with sets which have a finite number of members . The number of grammatical rules is fairly limited . This is certainly the case when we only consider the basic grammar rules of a language that will have to be learned by the intermediate to early advanced learner . ( Note here what we said earlier about Grammar B2 - the learner grammar : It was only a subset of Grammar 1 - the linguistic grammar . ) Formal grammars have been used in a number of CALL projects . Matthews ( 1993 ) continues his discussion of grammar frameworks for CALL which he started in 1992 ( Matthews 1992a ) . He lists eight major grammar frameworks that have been used in CALL : . Of course , these are only some examples . More recently , Tschichold et al . ( 1994 ) reported on a prototype for correcting English texts produced by French learners . This system relies on a number of different finite state automata for pre - processing , filtering and detecting ( Tschichold et al.1994 ) . Brehony & Ryan ( 1994 ) report on \\\" Francophone Stylistic Grammar Checking ( FSGC ) using Link Grammars \\\" . They adapted the post - processing section of an existing parser so that it would detect stylistic errors in English input produced by French learners . His plea is for the use of the PPT ( Principles and Parameters Theory ( Chomsky 1986 ) as a grammar framework for CALL applications , basing his judgement on three criteria : computational effectiveness , linguistic perspicuity and acquisitional perspicuity ( Matthews 1993:9 ) . In later parts of his paper , Matthews compares rule- and principle - based frameworks using DCGs ( Definite Clause Grammars ) as the example for the latter . He concludes that principle - based frameworks ( and consequently principle - based parsing ) are the most suitable grammar frameworks for what he calls Intelligent CALL . Recently , other unification - based grammar frameworks not included in Matthews ' list have been used in CALL . Hagen , for instance , describes \\\" an object - oriented , unification - based parser called HANOI \\\" ( Hagen 1995 ) which uses formalisms developed in Head - Driven Phrase Structure Grammar ( HPSG ) . He quotes Zajac : . Combining object - oriented approaches to linguistic description with unification - based grammar formalisms [ ... ] is very attractive . On one hand , we gain the advantages of the object - oriented approach : abstraction and generalisation through the use of inheritance . On the other hand , we gain a fully declarative framework , with all the advantages of logical formalisms [ ... ] . Of course , not even this extended list is comprehensive - at best it could be described as indicative of the variety of linguistic approaches used in parser - based Computer Assisted Language Learning and , in particular , in the field of grammar checking . At the end of this short excursion into formal grammar(s ) it can be concluded that any CALL grammar checker component needs as its foundation a formal grammar describing as comprehensively as possible the knowledge we have about the target language grammar . This was the grammar that Helbig ( 1975 ) refers to as Grammar B1a . But what part do the other grammars play in a CALL environment ? Let us stay with the example of a parser - based grammar checker for language learners . Hence , the provision of adequate feedback on the morpho - syntactic structure of parts of the text produced by learners is the most important task for this parser - based grammar checker . Let us therefore consider the place of feedback provision within a parser grammar . In other words , as a good teacher would do - the grammar checker would offer advice on how to change an ungrammatical structure into a corresponding grammatically well - formed structure . As stated earlier this approach would be based on an infinite number of construction possibilities . Therefore , the provision of adequate feedback and help to the learner appears to be difficult if not impossible . However , it has been indicated above that feedback could be linked to the finite sets on which the formal grammar relies . How can this be done ? Each member of the three sets which will have to be considered here . The non - terminal symbols like NP and VP , the words and the set of morpho - syntactic rules carry certain features that determine their behaviour in a sentence and determine their relation to other signs within the sentence . These features which restrict what the text producer can do with a given ( terminal or non - terminal ) symbol in a sentence and under what conditions a particular grammatical rule has to be applied will be labelled constraints . Let us return to our provisional description of feedback , which can now be formulated more precisely . Feedback shows the relation . by explaining the underlying constraint of the anticipated construction in L based on Grammar B2 . to support production of construction in L . and by reasoning about the likely cause of the rule violation . to extend Grammar C - the learner - inherent grammar . And secondly , this above description of feedback given by a grammar checker which is based on a modified parser shows that it is possible to construct tools that support the focus on form by learners during the reflection stage of a text production process . Even if the grammar checker were only to detect a small number of morpho - syntactic errors , this would be beneficial for the learners as long as they were aware of the limitations of this CALL tool . On the other hand , the feedback description contains still a number of question marks in parentheses after some of the important keywords - whether the intended aims of grammar checking can be achieved can only be validated through the use and thorough testing of such a grammar checker . We should better not make any such assumption ( in the scientific sense - we do hope for these improvements , of course ) and better wait until such a parser - based grammar checker is actually tested in a series of proper learning experiments . Let us now leave the discussion of some of the underlying linguistics behind and discuss the role of parser - based applications in language learning . Natural language parsers take written language as their input and produce a formal representation of the syntactic and sometimes semantic structure of this input . The role they have to play in computer - assisted language learning has been under scrutiny in the last decade : ( Matthews 1992a ) ; ( Holland et al . 1993 ) ; ( Nagata 1996 ) . See also Heift ( 2001 ) . Holland et al . discussed the \\\" possibilities and limitations of parser - based language tutors \\\" ( Holland et al . 1993:28 ) . Comparing parser - based CALL to what they label as conventional CALL they come to the conclusion that : . [ ... ] in parser - based CALL the student has relatively free rein and can write a potentially huge variety of sentences . ICALL thus permits practice of production skills , which require recalling and constructing , not just recognising [ as in conventional CALL ] , words and structures . ( Holland et al.1993:31 ) . However , at the same time , parsing imposes certain limitations . Parsers tend to concentrate on the syntax of the textual input , thus \\\" ICALL may actually subvert a principal goal of language pedagogy , that of communicating meanings rather than producing the right forms \\\" ( Holland et al.1993:32 ) . This disadvantage can be avoided by a \\\" focus on form \\\" which is mainly achieved by putting the parser / grammar checker to use within a relevant , authentic communicative task and at a time chosen by and convenient to the learner / text producer . Juozulynas ( 1994 ) evaluated the potential usefulness of syntactic parsers in error diagnosis . He analysed errors in an approximately 400 page corpus of German essays by American college students in second - year language courses . His study shows that : . [ ... ] syntax is the most problematic area , followed by morphology . ( Juozulynas 1994:5 ) . Juozulynas adapted a taxonomic schema by Hendrickson which comprises four categories : syntax , morphology , orthography , lexicon . Juozulynas ' argument for splitting orthography into spelling and punctuation is easily justified in the context of syntactic parsing . Parts of punctuation can be described by using syntactic bracketing rules , and punctuation errors can consequently be dealt with by a syntactic parser . Lexical and spelling errors form , according to Juozulynas , a rather small part of the overall number of learner errors . Some of these errors will , of course , be identified during dictionary look - up , but if words that are in the dictionary are used in a nonsensical way , the parser will not recognise them unless specific error rules ( e.g. for false friends ) are built in . Consequently , a parser - based CALL application can play a useful role in detecting many of the morpho - syntactic errors which constitute a high percentage of learner errors in freely produced texts . Nevertheless , the fact remains : . A second limitation of ICALL is that parsers are not foolproof . Because no parser today can accurately analyse all the syntax of a language , false acceptance and false alarms are inevitable . ( Holland et al . 1993:33 ) . This is something not only developers of parser - based CALL , but also language learners using such software have to take into account . In other words , this limitation of parser - based CALL has to be taken into consideration during the design and implementation process and when integrating this kind of CALL software in the learning process . A final limitation of ICALL is the cost of developing NLP systems . By comparison with simple CALL , NLP development depends on computational linguists and advanced programmers as well as on extensive resources for building and testing grammars . Beyond this , instructional shells and lessons must be built around NLP , incurring the same expense as developing shells and lessons for CALL . ( Holland et al . 1993:33 ) . It is mainly this disadvantage of parser - based CALL that explains the lack of commercially available ( and commercially viable ) CALL applications which make good use of HLT . However , it is to be hoped that this hurdle can be overcome in the not too distant future because sufficient expertise in the area has accumulated over recent years . More and more computer programs make good use of this technology , and many of these have already \\\" entered \\\" the realm of computer - assisted language learning , as can be seen from the examples in the previous section . Holland et al . ( 1993 ) answer their title question \\\" What are parsers good for ? \\\" on the basis of their own experience with BRIDGE , a parser - based CALL program for American military personnel learning German , and on the basis of some initial testing with a small group of experienced learners of German . They present the following points : . ICALL appears to be good for form - focused instruction offering learners the chance to work on their own linguistic errors by this method , not only to improve their performance in the foreign language but also to improve their language awareness . ICALL appears to be good for selected kinds of students . The authors list the following characteristics which might influence the degree of usefulness of ICALL for certain students : . i. intermediate proficiency . ii . analytical orientation . iii . tolerance of ambiguity . iv . confidence as learners . ICALL is good for research because the parser automatically tracks whole sentence responses and detects , classifies , and records errors . It might facilitate the assessment of the students grammatical competency and thus help us discover patterns of acquisition . ICALL [ ... ] can play a role in communicative practice . The authors argue for the embedding of parser - based CALL in \\\" graphics microworlds \\\" which help to capture some basic semantics . Given that we would like to harness the advantages of parser - based CALL , how do we take the limitations into consideration in the process of designing and implementing a parser - based CALL system ? What implications does the use of parsing technology have for human - computer interaction ? [ I]n discourse analytic terms ( Grice 1975 ) , the nature of the contract between student and CALL tutor is straightforward , respecting the traditional assumption that the teacher is right , whereas the ICALL contract is less well defined . ( Holland et al . 1993:33f . ) . The rigidity of traditional CALL in which the program controls the linguistic input by the learner to a very large extent has often given rise to a criticism of CALL which accuses CALL developers and practitioners of relying on behaviourist programmed instruction . If one wants to give learners full control over their linguistic input , for example , by relying on parsing technology , what are then the terms according to which the communicative interaction of computer ( program ) and learner can be defined ? The differences between humans and machines have obviously to be taken into consideration in order to understand the interaction of learners with CALL programs : . Machines are compiled out of individual parts for a very specific purpose ( totum fix et partibus ) ; whereas humans are holistic entities whose parts can be differentiated ( partes fiunt ex toto ) . Humans process all sorts of experiences and repeatedly and interactively create their own environment - something machines can not do . They \\\" calculate \\\" a problem on the basis of pre - wired rules . The main features of human thoughts are the inherent contradictions and the ability to cope with them , something that will not be calculable due to its complexity , variety and degree of detail ( Schmitz 1992:209f . ) . These differences between humans and machines can for our purposes , i.e. the theoretical description of human - computer interaction , be legitimately reduced to the distinction between actions and operations as is done in Activity Theory . The main point of this theory for our consideration here is that communicative activities can be divided into actions which are intentional , i.e. goal - driven ; and these can be sub - divided into operations which are condition - triggered . These operations are normally learnt as actions . In the example referred to in the quotation above , the gear - switching is learnt as an action . The learner - driver is asked by the driving instructor to change gear and this becomes the goal of the learner . Once the learner - driver has performed this action a sufficient number of times , this action becomes more and more automated and in the process loses more and more of its intentionality . A proficient driver might have the goal to accelerate the car which will necessitate switching into higher gear , but this is now triggered by a condition ( the difference between engine speed and speed of the car ) . It can thus be argued that humans learn to perform complex actions by learning to perform certain operations in a certain order . Machines , on the other hand , are only made to perform certain ( sometimes rather complex ) operations . This has some bearing on our understanding of the human - computer interaction that takes place when a learner uses language - learning software . When , for instance , the spell checker is started in a word - processing package , the software certainly does not have ' proof - read ' the learner 's document . The computer just responds to the clicking of the spellchecker menu item and performs the operation of checking the strings in the document against the entries in a machine dictionary . For the computer user ( in our case a learner ) , it might look like the computer is proof - reading the document . Normally , one only realises that no \\\" proper \\\" document checking is going on if a correctly spelled word is not found in the dictionary or nonsensical alternatives are given for a simple spelling error . Person X interacts with Person Y in that he observes Person Y 's action , reasons about the likely intention for that action and reacts according to this assumed intention . This , for example , explains why many learners get just as frustrated when an answer they believe to be right is rejected by the computer as they would get if it were rejected by their tutor . Of course , an ideal computer - assisted language learning system would avoid such pitfalls and not reject a correct response or overlook an incorrect one . Since any existing system can only approximate to this ideal , researchers and developers in parser - based CALL can only attempt to build systems that can perform complex structured sequences of ( linguistic ) operations so that learners can interact meaningfully and successfully with the computer . Grammatica is able to identify parts of speech in English and French with a fair degree of accuracy and show , for example , how verbs are conjugated in different tenses and how plurals of nouns are formed .

Abstract . Background . Information extraction ( IE ) efforts are widely acknowledged to be important in harnessing the rapid advance of biomedical knowledge , particularly in areas where important factual information is published in a diverse literature . Here we report on the design , implementation and several evaluations of OpenDMAP , an ontology - driven , integrated concept analysis system . It significantly advances the state of the art in information extraction by leveraging knowledge in ontological resources , integrating diverse text processing applications , and using an expanded pattern language that allows the mixing of syntactic and semantic elements and variable ordering . Results . OpenDMAP information extraction systems were produced for extracting protein transport assertions ( transport ) , protein - protein interaction assertions ( interaction ) and assertions that a gene is expressed in a cell type ( expression ) . Evaluations were performed on each system , resulting in F - scores ranging from .26 - .72 ( precision .39 - .85 , recall .16 - .85 ) . Additionally , each of these systems was run over all abstracts in MEDLINE , producing a total of 72,460 transport instances , 265,795 interaction instances and 176,153 expression instances . Conclusion . OpenDMAP advances the performance standards for extracting protein - protein interaction predications from the full texts of biomedical research articles . Furthermore , this level of performance appears to generalize to other information extraction tasks , including extracting information about predicates of more than two arguments . The output of the information extraction system is always constructed from elements of an ontology , ensuring that the knowledge representation is grounded with respect to a carefully constructed model of reality . The results of these efforts can be used to increase the efficiency of manual curation efforts and to provide additional features in systems that integrate multiple sources for information extraction .

Background . Conceptual analysis is the process of mapping from natural language texts to a formal representation of the objects and predicates ( together , the concepts ) meant by the text . The history of attempts to build programs to do conceptual analysis dates back to at least 1967 [ 1 ] . Recent advances in the availability of high quality ontologies , in the ability to accurately recognize named entities in texts , and in language processing methods generally have made possible a significant advance in concept analysis , arguably the most difficult and general natural language processing task . Here we report on the design , implementation and several evaluations of OpenDMAP , an ontology - driven , integrated concept analysis system that significantly advances the state of the art . We also discuss its application to three important information extraction tasks in molecular biology . Information extraction ( IE ) efforts are widely acknowledged to be important in harnessing the rapid advance of biomedical knowledge , particularly in areas where important factual information is published in a diverse literature . In a recent PLoS Biology essay Rebholz - Schuhmann [ 2 ] argued , \\\" It is only a matter of time and effort before we are able to extract facts [ from articles in the primary literature ] automatically . The consequences are likely to be profound . \\\" Existing examples include extraction of information about gene - gene interactions [ 3 ] , alternative splicing [ 4 ] , functional analysis of mutations [ 5 ] , phosphorylation sites [ 6 ] , and regulatory sites [ 7 ] . The primary significance of OpenDMAP to these efforts is that it leverages the large - scale efforts being made in biomedical ontology development , such as the Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry ( OBO Foundry ) [ 8 ] . Logical representations of reality , such as those built on the OBO Foundry , use a set of predicates that formally describe properties of , or relationships among , objects . Predicates are defined with a specific number and type of admissible arguments . For example , the predicate expresses might be specified to take two arguments , a gene and a cell type , meaning that the specified gene is expressed in all normal cells of the specified type . Such predicates can also be related to each other through abstraction ( \\\" is a \\\" ) and packaging ( \\\" part of \\\" ) hierarchies , as done in the OBO Foundry . The semantics defined by the predicates and hierarchies in such ontologies provide a powerful tool for natural language processing . Independently constructed ontologies have played at best a modest role in prior natural language processing systems . Other language processing systems have used either small , ad hoc conceptual representations developed specifically for the application , or structured linguistic resources , such as WordNet [ 11 ] , which do not meet the logical requirements for an ontology . While the implementation reported below exploits only a small portion of the OBO Foundry , and the crucial Relationship Ontology component of the Foundry is still in an early stage of development , the organizing principles of OpenDMAP generalize straightforwardly . These systems and their extensions have been used to extract semantic relationships relevant to pharmacogenomics [ 16 ] and to compare alternative sources of information [ 17 ] , among other applications . OpenDMAP is like MetaMap and its descendents in that it can only produce output drawn from a predefined semantic representation . The main difference is that MetaMap , SemRep and SemGen are structured as traditional NLP systems , with a lexicon that enumerates possible concepts that might be associated with a word or phrase . Multiple possible mappings are returned , with rankings . OpenDMAP provides an alternative method of organizing knowledge about language , so that each concept has associated with it a set of patterns that describe how that concept can be realized in language ; there is no explicit lexicon . To appreciate the differences between OpenDMAP and previous work in biomedical text mining , it is also useful to contrast its handling of syntactic structure and of semantic content with other systems . At one end of the spectrum are systems that employ essentially asyntactic representations . Early in the modern period of genomic natural language processing , some such systems were able to achieve significant ( and in some cases ground - breaking ) results using techniques based on text literals only . These include [ 18 - 20 ] . One line of subsequent work has attempted to increase the coverage of these early systems , which utilized manually - built patterns , by automatically acquiring considerably larger sets of patterns - see , for example , Huang et al . 2004 [ 21 ] . Another line of subsequent work has focused on adding a modest , but still useful , level of linguistic abstraction by explicitly including either lexical categories ( parts of speech ) , word stems , or both [ 22 , 23 ] . These systems were essentially agrammatical ; in contrast , OpenDMAP utilizes a classic form of \\\" semantic grammar , \\\" freely mixing text literals , semantically typed basal syntactic constituents , and semantically defined classes of entities . Although OpenDMAP is capable of utilizing full syntactic parses , the patterns for the three separate tasks discussed in this paper utilize primarily shallow syntactic parses ( the development phase of the transport project reports results using syntactic dependency information ) . It remains to be seen what depth of syntactic parsing is useful in biomedical text mining . All of the systems discussed thus far have in common the fact that they employ some notion of explicit patterns , be they agrammatical , syntactic , or semantic . In a separate line of work , patterns are entirely implicit - that is , they exist only to the extent that they are captured by orthogonal features . This work approaches relation extraction as a classification problem ; a classic example is the work of Craven and Kumlein 1999 [ 32 ] . Bunescu et al . 2005 [ 33 ] presents a detailed analysis of a number of classification - based approaches ; the state of the art is characterized by the participants in the recent BioCreative protein - protein interaction shared task [ 34 ] . OpenDMAP has been applied in three domains : protein transport , protein - protein interaction and the expression of a gene in a particular cell type . The three application domains are independently significant . Protein transport , the directed movement of proteins from one cellular compartment to another , is a broadly important biological phenomenon . Although protein subcellular localization information is centralized ( e.g. through ontological annotations at NCBI and in various model organism databases ) , information about transport is not . Protein transport information is published throughout the scientific literature , but no previous method was able to capture it systematically . Protein - protein interaction extraction has been the subject of dozens of systems ( see , e.g. a review in [ 35 ] ) . Widely used web resources such as IHOP [ 3 ] and Chilibot [ 36 ] are based entirely on automated extraction of protein - protein interactions from text . This task was used in the BioCreative community evaluation , described below . The protein transport task is illustrative of another distinguishing aspect of the OpenDMAP approach : it provides mechanisms for handling relationships involving more than two entities . Note that the protein transport predicate has at least three arguments : what protein is transported , from where , and to where ( our model also includes a fourth argument : the transporting protein ) . Although some linguistic expressions of the concept may elide an argument , the predicate itself inherently describes a greater than binary relationship . Wattarujeekrit et al . [ 38 ] and Cohen and Hunter [ 39 ] present evidence that many important predicates in biomedicine require more than two arguments . However , most previous efforts at extracting relationships from biomedical text have addressed exclusively binary relationships . Geneways [ 40 ] and RLMPS - P [ 41 ] are the only other biomedical IE systems of which we are aware that extracted greater than binary relationships , and neither is ontology - driven . Assessing the accuracy of an information extraction system is a very labor - intensive activity . In order to identify information that could have been extracted , but was not ( a \\\" false negative \\\" ) , a person must go through a large volume of text to determine all of the relevant assertions . To estimate the reliability of these manually derived assertions , at least two people must complete that task to assess inter - rater reliability . Once such data is used for one evaluation and system developers have seen it , further use of the data will generate upwardly biased accuracy estimates as system developers fit their systems to it . For these reasons , large - scale community evaluations of information extraction systems are particularly important . The second Critical Assessment of Information Extraction in Biology , ( BioCreative ) [ 34 , 42 ] , community evaluation included a test of systems designed to extract human protein - protein interaction information from the full texts of hundreds of journal articles , called the IPS task . Human curators from the IntAct database [ 43 ] manually extracted interaction assertions from these articles using the same curatorial standards as for the database . The results produced by human experts were compared to the results submitted from 45 systems developed by laboratories around the world , providing the best current assessment of the accuracy of protein interaction information extraction systems . The performance of OpenDMAP on the protein interaction task was evaluated as part of this shared task . More limited evaluations of the accuracy in the other applications are also reported in the results section . The accuracy of an information extraction system depends on the genre of texts on which it operates [ 44 ] . This report demonstrates the application of OpenDMAP to full texts of scientific journal articles , to Medline abstracts , and to GeneRIFs ( single sentences or sentence fragments that are selected by human curators for relevance to the function of a particular gene product ) . GeneRIFs are particularly attractive targets for information extraction , due to their roughly sentential length ( identified by [ 44 ] as the optimum ) , breadth of coverage , manual preselection for relevance , and association with at least one normalized gene reference . Despite these attractive features , this is the first report of an information extraction system targeting them . Results . OpenDMAP information extraction systems were produced for extracting protein transport assertions ( transport ) , protein - protein interaction assertions ( interaction ) and assertions that a gene is expressed in a cell type ( expression ) . Each of these systems was run over all abstracts in Medline as of June 18 , 2007 , producing a total of 72,460 transport instances , 265,795 interaction instances and 176,153 expression instances . These results are provided in RDF format in the Additional Files 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . One particularly striking result is the diversity of journals from which these assertions were mined . The transport relationships were extracted from 2,340 different journals ; the interaction relationships from 4,103 different journals ; and the expression relationships from 2,984 different journals . A total of 4,434 unique journals contributed to these results , nearly 40 % of the journals indexed in Medline each year ( see Figure 1 ) . OpenDMAP coverage of MEDLINE . The gray bars indicate the number of journals indexed by MEDLINE each year . The red bars indicate the number of journal abstracts from which OpenDMAP extracted at least one assertion regarding transport , interaction or expression . In recent years , more than 40 % of biomedical journals contain such information . 2007 is partial data ( through July 1 ) . For the BioCreative evaluation , the interaction system was run on the full texts of all of the 359 articles in the test set , producing 385 interaction assertions . Performance was averaged per article , since a few articles had a very large number of interactions and would have dominated a per assertion calculation . OpenDMAP 's average F - measure of 0.29 was 10 % higher than the next best scoring system , and more than three standard deviations above the mean performance . OpenDMAP 's recall was similar to the other high scoring systems ; its advantage arose from being substantially more precise ( fewer false positives ) , achieving an average precision of 0.39 , more than 20 % better than the next best system . Due to IntAct 's curation criteria , which require clear experimental evidence for an interaction in the text , these results are quite conservative . Many \\\" false positives \\\" were in fact assertions of interactions , but fell short of the evidential requirements for IntAct curation . A manual evaluation of the performance of the protein transport recognition system was based on all 570 GeneRIFs containing a form of the word \\\" translocate \\\" ( 382 of which were about protein transport , and 188 were about the transport of something else ) . Since transport is a greater than binary relationship , the extraction was only counted as correct if all of the components extracted matched the human annotation . For that strict criterion , OpenDMAP achieved precision of 0.75 and a recall of 0.49 ( F - score of 0.59 ) . If incomplete extractions are counted as correct , precision is unchanged at 0.75 and recall rises to 0.67 ( F - score of 0.71 ) . A substantial proportion of the errors were due to imperfect recognition of proteins ; if OpenDMAP is given correct protein identifications as inputs , precision is 0.77 , strict recall is 0.67 ( F - score of 0.72 ) and incomplete recall is 0.85 ( F - score of 0.81 ) . A manual evaluation of the performance of the expression recognition system was based on 324 GeneRIFs containing a form of the word \\\" express , \\\" ( these sentences contained 469 assertions about expression , 205 of which were about gene expression in 178 different cell types ) . Open DMAP had a precision of 0.64 , but missed many statements that annotators identified as expression assertions , achieving a recall of only 0.16 ( F - score of 0.26 ) . A substantial portion of these errors were due to imperfect recognition of gene names ; if OpenDMAP is given correct gene identifications as input , precision is 0.85 and recall is 0.36 ( F - score of 0.51 ) . Many other failures to identify expression assertions were related to coordination ; the test set had an average of more than two expression assertions per sentence , but the IE system extracted only about 1.3 assertions per sentence . Discussion . As demonstrated by its performance in the community evaluation , OpenDMAP advances the state of the art for extracting protein - protein interaction predications from the full texts of biomedical research articles . Furthermore , this level of performance appears to generalize to other information extraction tasks , including extracting information about predicates of more than two arguments . There are several reasons why OpenDMAP exhibits better performance than any other biomedical information extraction system to date . OpenDMAP is an extension of the Direct Memory Access Parsing ( DMAP ) paradigm described in [ 45 ] and [ 46 ] . Three innovations distinguish the present work from those prior efforts . First , the ontology component of OpenDMAP is independent of the rest of the system . The knowledge representation component is the well - established , open source Prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 ontology development system [ 47 , 48 ] , and OpenDMAP concept analyzers can be associated with any ontology compatible with Prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 , for example , the OBO Foundry . Second , OpenDMAP is fully integrated with the open source Unstructured Information Management Architecture , ( UIMA ) [ 49 - 51 ] , which allows the results of any text processing application interfaced to UIMA to be exploited by the OpenDMAP system . As demonstrated below , this mechanism facilitates the use of many external language processing systems , including tokenizers , sentence boundary detectors , entity recognition systems , and syntactic parsers . Since the inputs and outputs of each system are mapped by UIMA to a common annotation structure accessed by OpenDMAP , the use , comparison and combination of various approaches to language processing can all be fully integrated into OpenDMAP patterns . The third innovation in the OpenDMAP system is an expanded pattern language for specifying how concepts can be expressed in text . The intimate connection between the ontology and the natural language processing system provides two significant advantages over prior information extraction systems generally . First , the output of the information extraction system is always constructed from elements of the ontology , ensuring that the knowledge representation is grounded with respect to a carefully constructed model of reality . In contrast , the outputs of most natural language processing systems are grounded only in substrings of text , not normalized to any model at all . Progress in normalizing biological entities recognized in text to specific database identifiers [ 52 - 54 ] has made the output of text processing systems much more valuable . Mapping the properties and relationships extracted to a community ontology similarly provides a significant increment in the value of the output from text processing systems . The second advantage of the OpenDMAP approach is that all of the knowledge used by the system to recognize concepts is structured by the ontology . In contrast , the nearly universal alternative approach is to embody knowledge of language into a lexicon , which associates individual lexical items with their possible semantic interpretations . In the OpenDMAP approach , information about which concepts are potentially relevant to the analysis of a particular text passage straightforwardly places limits on the linguistic knowledge relevant to analyzing that passage . This approach finesses many difficult ambiguity resolution problems faced by lexicon - driven systems , since these limits on the knowledge applied to conceptual analysis prevent many multiple interpretation problems from arising at all . For example , the string \\\" hunk \\\" refers to a cell type ( human natural killer cells ) , a gene ( hormonally upregulated Neu - associated kinase ) , and the general English word meaning a large piece of something without definite shape . A traditional , lexicon - driven system would have an explicit method for assigning the correct word sense to any occurrence of the string \\\" hunk . \\\" The fact that there might be possible alternative interpretations of the matching string has no consequence , and no explicit ambiguity resolution step is necessary . Ambiguity is a leading cause of errors in text processing systems , and this approach is one of the contributing factors to OpenDMAP 's superior performance . Our top - down approach to restricting possible interpretations does not address all problems due to ambiguity in language ; for example , errors in preprocessing systems ( e.g. syntactic parsing , see below ) are not effected . The use of UIMA greatly facilitates the incorporation of various applications as input to OpenDMAP . The outputs of NLP tools integrated into the system are described by the extensible UIMA type system . In the case that a new type of information is produced by a preprocessor , OpenDMAP patterns would have to be modified to take advantage of the new type of information available . For example , the first time an external cell type tagging system is added , the UIMA type of the result of that processor must be linked to a cell - type concept in an OpenDMAP ontology in order for it to be used in patterns . However , if a new NLP tool produces a UIMA output type that has been used by OpenDMAP previously , then no changes in the ontology or patterns are needed . We believe that the outputs of information extraction systems are not likely to useful until the F - score ( or at least the precision ) is greater than about 0.85 [ 34 ] , so the various sources of error in these systems must be addressed . A significant cause of errors in the OpenDMAP system as evaluated is incorrect identification of gene and protein names . The UIMA architecture makes it trivial to adopt and exploit better gene / protein recognition systems as they are developed . Use of such a system should improve the performance of OpenDMAP . Error analysis of the false positives in the transport data set indicates that more than 80 % are due to errors in the syntactic analysis . For example , in the sentence \\\" Rho protein regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK through translocation from the nucleus to the membrane , \\\" the subject of the translocation was incorrectly identified as FAK ( rather than Rho ) by the Stanford parser . That parser was developed for general English rather than biomedical text , so using specialized syntactic analysis systems may improve the precision of OpenDMAP . Remaining problems in false positives are due to problematic tokenization , failures to properly resolve anaphoric reference , and , rarely , negation . False negatives are due to gaps in concept recognition patterns , more than half of which arise from a failure to properly handle coordinated clauses and conjunctions . Addressing these issues remains an open area of research . Another issue was that the Stanford parser was too slow to use in the application of the transport system to all of Medline , so it was n't run . OpenDMAP ignores aspects of patterns that require inputs that are n't present , so the patterns that contained syntactic dependencies did not have to be altered . These syntactic constraints are important for accuracy , however . Tested on the gold standard set for the system without the parser precision drops to 0.62 , while strict recall remains largely unchanged , rising to 0.51 . Conclusion . Despite OpenDMAP elevating the state of the art for biomedical information extraction significantly beyond previous levels , error rates remain high . In the most challenging BioCreative task , finding curatable assertions in full text documents , only about 29 % of the relevant assertions were found , and only about 39 % of the extracted assertions were completely correct . Such error rates mean that automatically generated databases can not replace manual curation efforts . However , the evidence is quite clear that manual curation can not keep up with the rate of data generation [ 56 ] . The surprisingly large number of journals that contained information relevant to these three IE tasks suggests that the temporal approach taken in [ 56 ] may actually underestimate the severity of the problem . Although the outputs produced by large - scale IE systems are not yet suitable for producing factual databases for direct use by biomedical researchers , the current level of performance provides two important facilities to the research community . First , the results of these efforts can be used to significantly increase the efficiency of manual curation efforts . Each extracted assertion is tied to a specific text , which can be used to direct the attention of manual curators both to relevant documents and to specific relevant passages within a document . Effective integration of IE results into curatorial workflows will require the development of new tools . OpenDMAP developers are working with curators at IntAct to address these issues . The open source availability of OpenDMAP will facilitate the work of others addressing this issue as well . The second important use of the sorts of results that IE systems are currently able to generate is in statistical integration with multiple sources of noisy data , such as those described in [ 57 ] and [ 58 ] . As demonstrated in the latter , the proper addition of even noisy data from the literature substantially improves the quality and coverage of protein - protein interaction networks for several species . Methods . OpenDMAP uses Prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 [ 47 ] to provide an object model for the possible concepts ( predicates and objects ) that might be found in a text . Prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 models concepts ( including actions ) as classes that participate in abstraction and packaging hierarchies , and relationships as class - specific slots . For example , protein transport is modeled as a class ( called PROTEIN - TRANSPORT ) and the relationship between a transport event and the protein transported in that event is represented as a slot in that class ( called [ TRANSPORTED - ENTITY ] ) . Slots can take on values , which can be constrained to be instances of other classes . For example , the [ TRANSPORTED - ENTITY ] slot of the PROTEIN - TRANSPORT class is constrained to be an instance of either of the classes PROTEIN or MOLECULAR - COMPLEX . Figure 2 shows a portion of the model used for the transport , which includes biological entities , such as molecular complexes and cellular components , and biological processes , particularly protein transport . This model is drawn almost entirely from the Gene Ontology ( GO ) [ 53 ] although the relationships that define the four slots shown in Figure 2 are from a provisional submission to the OBO Foundry Relationship Ontology and are not official . Preprocessing tools ( ABNER [ 55 ] and LingPipe [ 59 ] ) were applied to tag instances of proteins , genes , and cell types . Screenshot of the Prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 ontology for the protein transport task . The slots of the protein transport class are shown in the lower right panel of this screen shot . Note that the subclasses of Cellular Component and Protein Transport are not shown . For the transport task , patterns were produced for 30 ontology concepts ; eight directly related to transport and 22 others for cellular components that are the sources and destinations of transport . A large number of other concepts ( e.g. genes , proteins and cell types ) do not have explicit patterns associated with them , but are instead tagged as such by UIMA tools during preprocessing . The protein - protein interaction task involved producing patterns for nine concepts , and the cell expression task required patterns for six additional concepts . The UIMA architecture [ 49 ] manages the processing of document sets . Various combinations of these tools were used in the different applications . For example , the GeneRIFs used in the transport application did not require sentence segmentation , and the applications to all medline abstracts did not use syntactic elements in patterns because the Stanford Parser was too slow to run over all of Medline . The results of this preprocessing are stored in UIMA 's common annotation structure . In order to be able to recognize a concept in text , OpenDMAP associates one or more patterns with each concept . A pattern describes the words , phrases , parts of speech , syntactic structures or concepts that should cause an instance of the associated concept to be recognized . A simple pattern , such as the one shown in equation 1 , enumerates a disjunction of words that should trigger recognition of a concept . The patterns for all of the CELLULAR - COMPONENT concepts were derived from the GO term names and synonyms , supplemented with derivational variants , such as the adjectival \\\" nuclear \\\" in equation 1 . Twenty - two GO cellular component terms were used , along with 19 synonyms associated with the GO terms , and 78 additional derivational variants generated by inspection of the training corpus . More complex patterns can include references to non - terminals , particularly other concepts . Equation 2 is one of the patterns for recognizing instances of the PROTEIN - TRANSPORT concept . When a pattern that includes a slot name is matched , the instance created has its slots filled with the concepts that matched the slot names in the pattern . For example , the above pattern matches the GeneRIF that contains \\\" ... Bax translocation to mitochondia ... \\\" ( from Entrez GeneID 27113 ) . Since the entire pattern matches , an instance of PROTEIN - TRANSPORT is created , with the Bax protein concept in its [ TRANSPORTED - ENTITY ] slot and an instance of the mitochondria concept ( from GO 's cellular component hierarchy ) in its [ TRANSPORT - DESTINATION ] slot . OpenDMAP patterns can express variability in word and phrase order . Note , for example , that equation 2 would fail to match the phrase \\\" Bax translocation to mitochondria from the cytosol . \\\" The special pattern marker @ is used to identify a set of subpatterns that are both optional and can occur before or after a required phrase ; multiple @ marked phrases can occur in any order . For example , equation 2 can be modified with this marker to recognize the above text : . Many sentences in the literature express multiple concepts , making extraction of even simple assertions problematic . Consider the following GeneRIF from GeneID:29560 : \\\" ... HIF-1alpha which is present in glomus cells translocates to the nucleus .... \\\" The intervening phrase \\\" which is present in glomus cells \\\" prevents the pattern in equation 3 from matching that sentence . OpenDMAP does have a wildcard character ( underscore ) that could be added to the pattern in equation 3 , between the [ TRANSPORTED - ENTITY ] concept and the word \\\" translocation , \\\" allowing this sentence to be matched . However , using such a wild card would make any protein mentioned before the word \\\" translocation \\\" match the pattern , which is too promiscuous . To address this problem , OpenDMAP allows patterns to specify syntactic constraints on potential matches . Furthermore , the reliance on the exact word \\\" translocation \\\" can be relaxed to be any reference to a transport action word , including both verbal and nominal forms of multiple terms ( e.g. , transported , translocation ) . The PROTEIN - TRANSPORT class is extended to have an [ action ] slot that specifies the type of transportation action , to keep track of the term that was used . Equation 4 demonstrates the pattern language for specifying syntactic constraints : . The use of the variable \\\" x \\\" in the specification identifies a specific syntactic unit , linking the dependency to the head of a phrase . Multiple variables can be used to specify constraints on different syntactic units within a sentence . OpenDMAP patterns are very powerful . Only five such patterns , shown in equations 5 - 9 were required for the transport extraction system performance noted above . These patterns were devised manually , based on expert knowledge of the domain and on a small training set of sample GeneRIFs . The test data used in the transport and expression evaluations were marked up by domain experts trained in conceptual annotation , using the Knowtator annotation tool [ 62 ] .

Abstract . In this paper we provide the state - of - the - art of existing proprietary and free and open source software ( FOSS ) automatic speech recognition ( ASR ) , speech synthesizers , and Machine Translation ( MT ) tools . We also focus on the need for multimodal communication including gestures , furnishing some examples of 3D gesture recognition software . Our current experiment is based on interoperability between FOSS ASR , MT , and text - to - speech applications , while future experiments will include gesture recognition tools . Our application environment is an ambient assisted living lab at the University of Bremen , suitable for the elderly and/or people with impairments . In a nutshell , our goal is to provide a single uniform multimodal interface combining FOSS speech processing , MT , and gesture recognition tools for people in need . Full text / Texte int\\u00e9gral . 1 Today we are experiencing the aging population phenomenon . In 2002 United Nations stated that the number of older persons has tripled over the last 50 years and will more than triple again over the next 50 years . In 2010 the German Federal Statistical Office emphasized that in Germany in 2060 there will be as many 80 years old and older people as younger than 20 years old . Ambient assisted living ( AAL ) ' s initiative is to make the lifestyle of the elderly or people in need more autonomous in a domestic environment by means of advanced technology . Technology used by people in need should be easy - to - use , user - friendly , accessible , flexible , and interaction efficient . All these are advantages of multimodality ( see D ' Andrea et al . , 2009 ) , which is the seamless combination between different modes of interaction , such as haptics , speech , gesture , and vision . Besides multimodality , multilinguality facilitates not only human - human , but also human - computer interaction . 2 Multilinguality is enabled through translation . Translation , in general , facilitates communication between people in different locales . Using intelligent devices of AAL in crosslingual environments means not only that user interfaces are multilingual , but also that speech - to - speech translation systems should be implemented . 3 This paper is concerned with speech processing , specifically speech recognition and synthesis , machine translation , and gesture recognition . We provide definitions , history , and a survey on proprietary as well as free / open - source software ( FOSS ) . We cover initiatives and tools both from Academia and Industry . We also refer to speech - to - speech translation systems which combine speech recognition , machine translation , and text - to - speech . Dialog systems and their components will be also pointed out . Gesture will be defined , gesture recognition software will be furnished , and culture - specific gestures and their localization will be discussed . 4 Then we present related work about how speech and gestures are supported in assisted living environments . Our experiment with the goal of having a symbiotic relationship between multimodality and multilinguality , is the development of a unique platform combining FOSS speech - to - text , machine translation , and text - to - speech tools ; gesture recognition software will be a future component . 5 In this chapter we present definitions , the history , and state - of - the - art tools 1 of speech recognition and synthesis , and Machine Translation ( MT ) ; speech - to - speech translation , dialog systems , and gesture recognition and localization will also be discussed . 6 Speech processing is the study of speech signals and the processing methods . It is tied to natural language processing ( NLP ) , as its input can come from and/or the output can go to NLP applications . Speech recognition , speaker recognition , and speech synthesis are included inter alia under speech processing . A distinction between speaker recognition and speech recognition should be made here ; the former is about recognizing who is speaking and the latter what is being said . As for speaker recognition , there are three types of speaker models ( put in an ascending complexity order ) : speaker dependent , speaker independent , and speaker adaptive . The first recognizes the speech patterns of only one person , the second of a large group of people , while the third starts with a speaker independent model and continues with training by the speaker . 7 Jurafsky and Martin ( 2009 : 285 ) define the goal of Automatic Speech Recognition ( henceforth ASR ) as to build systems that map from an acoustic signal to a string of words . Automatic Speech Understanding ( ASU ) produces some sort of understanding of sentences , rather than just words . Some application areas of ASR , which appeal to those who need or want hands - free approach , are automated commercial phone systems , call - routing , and dictation . Specifically to translation , the ALPAC report ( Pierce et al . , 1966 ) mentioned that ' productivity of human translators might be as much as four times higher when dictating ' ( see ' ASR - MT Combination ' ) . 8 Speech models in ASR are categorized into language and acoustic models . Microsoft Research 2 characteristically describes a language model as the model that tries to make the right guess when two different sentences , such as It 's fun to recognize speech ? and It 's fun to wreck a nice beach ? , sound the same . A statistical language model assigns a probability to a sequence of words by means of a probability distribution . It should be pointed out that language modeling is not related only to speech recognition , but also MT , PoS - tagging and Information Retrieval ( IR ) . Both unigram and n - gram language models are used in IR to calculate the probability of recognizing one or more words in a corpus . The SRI Language Modeling Toolkit 3 is a toolkit for building and applying statistical language models . 9 On the other side , acoustic models ' compile ' audio speech recordings and their transcriptions into statistical representations of the sounds that make up each word . Thus in order to create an acoustic model , necessary resources are i ) audio recordings of speech , ii ) their text transcription , and iii ) a compiler to create statistical representations of sounds . Acoustic models are not related only with acoustics and phonetics , but also with gender and dialect difference among speakers . 10 As far as the history of speech recognition is concerned , in the early 1960s IBM developed and demonstrated Shoebox , a forerunner of today 's voice recognition systems . This innovative device recognized and responded to 16 spoken words , including the ten digits from \\\" 0 \\\" through \\\" 9 \\\" . Shoebox was operated by speaking into a microphone , which converted voice sounds into electrical impulses . Today IBM offers various products 4 to connect mobile and speech middleware . To give two examples , IBM Embedded ViaVoice 5 technology can be used for small mobile devices and automobile components . Some of its features are that it recognizes more than 200,000 spoken words across 14 languages . WebSphere Voice Server 6 includes ASR , text - to - speech ( TTS ) software and speaker verification , and can be integrated with other software and hardware telephony products . 11 In 1984 Apricot Portable Computer was the first PC with built - in speech recognition , licensed from Dragon Systems , Inc. The company Dragon Systems was founded in 1982 and its technology was acquired in 2005 by Nuance Communications . Dragon NaturallySpeeking 7 ASR system works today with most Windows applications , has Nuance Text - to - Speech ( TTS ) technology , and reaches up to 99 % ASR accuracy 8 . The latest features , as of version 11 , show more intuitive user interface ( elimination of distractions ) , improved accuracy ( 15 % greater than previous version ) , and faster performance . Another product from Nuance Communications is Dragon Dictate which is used currently byMacintosh . Earlier Macintosh recognizers were by MacSpeech , a company acquired by Nuance Communications in 2010 . 12 In the mid-1990s , Microsoft devoted resources to speech and language processing . Today Microsoft Tellme 9 speech technologies enable speech interaction with PC , phone , car , and TV . Microsoft Windows 's ASR system can be used in command and dictation . Its Speech Application Programming Interface ( SAPI ) allows the use of speech recognition and synthesis within Windows applications ; the latest version 5.4 ships in Windows 7 . 13 A supplier exclusively of speech technologies for the automotive and mobile industries is SVOX 10 . It is worth mentioning that Google uses SVOX to assist with pronunciation on its web services Google Translate and Google Dictionary 11 . LumenVox 12 is another provider of ASR software that allows users to control their telephony or computer application using their voice . Some FOSS ASR tools follow : . CMU Sphinx 13 : this tool is developed by the Carnegie Mellon University ( CMU ) . The Sphinx-4 framework includes three primary modules : FrontEnd , Decoder , and Linguist . The FrontEnd comprises one or more parallel chains of replaceable communicating signal processing modules , so that it takes one or more input signals and parameterizes them into a sequence of Features . The Linguist generates the SearchGraph that is used by the decoder during the search ; it translates any type of standard language model , along with pronunciation information from the dictionaryand structural information from one or more sets of acoustic models . The language model module of the Linguist provides word - level language structure , while the acoustic model module provides a mapping between a unit of speech and a hidden Markov models ( HMM ) that can be scored against incoming features provided by the FrontEnd . The SearchManager in the Decoder uses the Features from the FrontEnd and the SearchGraph from the Linguist to perform the actual decoding , generating Results ( Walker et al . , 2004 ) . Hidden Markov Toolkit 14 ( HTK ) : it is a portable toolkit for building and manipulating HMMs . HMMs are used in ASR and synthesis to aid , among others , in disambiguating homographs . The first version of HTK was in 1989 by Steve Young . Julius 15 ; Julius ( Lee & Kawahara , 2009 ) has been developed as a research software for Japanese large vocabulary continuous speech recognition ( LVCSR ) ; currently is developed by Nagoya Institute of Technology . It is a decoder based on word N - gram and context - dependent HMM . To run ASR with Julius one should prepare a language and an acoustic model . It offers , though free Japanese and English language and acoustic models . Simon 16 : it has been developed since 2007 by ' simon listens ' , a non - profit organization for research and apprenticeship . It does not ship with any speech models , but it provides an end - user interface to create them . HTK then compiles the speech model . S imon can be used with all languages and dialects and one can even mix languages . The current release can be used to set up command - and - control solutions especially suitable for disabled people . 14 Other FOSS of speech recognition can be found at other webpages as well 17 . 15 Last but not least , another research field of ASR regards the development of silent , subvocal speech recognition . As application areas they suggest spacesuits , noisy places like airport towers , or even traditional voice - recognition programs to increase accuracy . 16 The definition of Machine Translation ( MT ) is the automatic translation of text or speech from one natural language ( source language ) into another ( target language ) by means of computer software . In 1955 the first MT experiment between Georgetown University and IBM took place ; it translated 60 sentences from Russian into English . In 1966 the ALPAC report ( Pierce et al . , 1966 ) stated that \\\" there is no immediate or predictable prospect of useful MT \\\" . Although the report 's impact was that the USA government reduced its funding for MT , the research projects in the USA were extended . The MT systems SYSTRAN ( 1970-currently ) in the USA and EUROTRA ( 1978 - 1992 ) in Europe were some of the first MT successful initiatives . Rule - based MT ( RBMT ) approaches were the first approaches , whereas today the high availability of mono , bi- and multilingual corpora allow for statistical MT ( SMT ) and example - based MT ( Nagao , 1984 ) . Today MT systems typically combine RBMT with SMT . Through the years MT systems have been faster and with higher accuracy . Lately many FOSS MT tools have made their appearance . 17 There is a plethora of MT systems nowadays , both proprietary and open - source . A good distinction between these two can be found in Forcada ( 2006 : 2 ) . 18 As for FOSS MT tools , we distinguish between three categories of free MT : . 19 SMT is the approach of MT systems used in the ASR - MT combination , because SMT distributes probabilities and provides hints to the ASR system . Also , confusion network decoding has been the most successful approach in combining outputs from multiple MTs ( Rosti et al . 2008 ) . 20 The combination of ASR - SMT systems has two usages : i ) translation dictation and ii ) spoken language translation . One of the first efforts about ASR - SMT combination was by Brown et al . ( 1996 ) , while others like Paulik et al . ( 2005 ) , Khadivi et al . ( 2006 ) , Reddy et al . ( 2007 ) followed . We particularly look at three more recent approaches : . D\\u00e9silets et al . ( 2008 ) evaluated productivity gains of hybrid ASR - SMT systems for translation dictation . They conducted an experiment with eight professional translators dictating into French using Dragon NaturallySpeaking 8 . Although hypothesis combination ( i ) gave lowest error rates , the use of cross - adaptation was found to be a \\\" safer combination scheme for translation \\\" ( p.1280 ) . Rosti et al . ( 2008 ) described an incremental alignment method to build confusion networks based on the translation edit rate ( TER ) algorithm . They used a confusion network as the reference . The algorithm finds the minimum edit distance between the hypothesis and the reference by considering all word arcs between two consecutive nodes in the reference as possible matches for a hypothesis word at that position . In 2009 Rosti et al . proposed flexible matching using WordNet ( Fellbaum , 1998)to find all possible synonyms and words with identical stems in a set of hypotheses . 21 Speech synthesis or text - to - speech ( TTS ) is the production of speech ( acoustic waveforms ) from text ( Jurafsky & Martin : 2009 : 249 ) . Firstly , the input text is converted in a phonemic internal representation ( i.e. text analysis ) and then this internal representation is converted into a waveform ( i.e. waveform synthesis ) . Von Kempelen built between 1760 and 1790 the first full sentence speech synthesizer ( not the chess - playing hoax Mechanical Turk ) . Since the early 1980s many computer operating systems have included speech synthesizers . TTS applications are mainly used in hands and/or eyes - busy situations , such as automobile navigation . Apart from that , synthesized speech helps also people with visual or speech impairments . TTS is used , for example , by blind people through screen readers , software applications that interpret what is being displayed on the screen . In addition , TTS can be used in education to help foreign language learning . 22 TTS technology can be categorized into concatenative and formant . The former means that the synthesized speech can be created by concatenating pieces of recorded speech that are stored in a database . Formant synthesis does not use human speech samples at runtime , but uses additive synthesis and an acoustic model to create artificial speech . In the next paragraphs we refer exclusively to some speech TTS software ; for those tools who include both speech recognition and synthesis , look at previous chapter \\\" Automatic Speech Recognition - Current tools \\\" . Cepstral 36 : it offers synthetic voices ; in demo voices not only the rate ( fast / slow speech ) , but also the pitch ( high / low ) and the effect , like Split Personality or Spacetime Echo can be selected . SpokenText 38 : it offers a trial for 7 days and the supported download format is MP3 only , while in the paid versions it is Audio Book and Multiple MP3 as well . Talking Clipboard 39 : it uses natural sounding synthetic voices ( SAPI 5 compliant ) and can convert them to MP3 or WAV audio files ; it has 30-day free trial . 24 Apart from proprietary TTS software , many FOSS TTS tools exist and some of them follow below : . eSpeak 40 : it uses a \\\" formant synthesis \\\" method ; this allows many languages to be provided in a small size . Festival 41 : it is developed by the University of Edinburgh and offers a general framework for building speech synthesis systems as well as including examples of various modules . Festival currently supports British and American English and Spanish . Festvox 42 : this project is part of the work at CMU 's speech group ; it is firmly grounded within Festival and Flite ( see below ) . Flite 43 : Flite ( festival - lite ) is a small , run - time synthesis engine developed at CMU and primarily designed for small embedded machines and/or large servers . It is designed as an alternative synthesis engine to Festival for voices built using the FestVox 44 suite of voice building tools . FreeTTS 45 : it is based upon Flite . Some possible uses of FreeTTS are Java Speech API JSAPI 1.0 synthesizer , remote TTS Server that can work with a speech / telephony system , desktop TTS engine , or downloadable web application . FreeTTS provides support to import voice data directly from FestVox . Mary 46 : it was originally developed as a collaborative project of Language Technology lab from the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence ( DFKI ) and the Institute of Phonetics at Saarland University . Version 4.3 supports German , British and American English , Telugu , Turkish , and Russian . It comes with toolkits for quickly adding support for new languages and for building unit selection and HMM - based synthetic voices . YAKiToMe ! 47 : this is a web service where one can copy and paste text into a box , select a topic , and the text will be converted to audio . Then the Podcast Library page displays how long users have to wait before their audio file is ready for listening . YAKiToMe ! gives free access to AT&T Natural Voices(R ) and Windows voices . MT with Babelfish is also possible as a potential next step . 25 It should be pointed out that various companies sell different voices for different locales . Some examples are A&T Natural Voices , Nuance Real Speak and so on . Instead of buying voices , as aforementioned , building new voices is available through CMU 's FestVox project . Voices can also be personalized : in EMIME project Kurimo et al . ( 2010 ) used the voice of the speaker in the input language to utter the translated sentences in the output language ( see following \\\" Speech - to - Speech Translation \\\" ) . 26 The European Language Resources Association ( ELRA ) defines the goal of Speech - to - Speech Translation ( SST ) as follows : . The goal of the Speech - to - Speech Translation ( SST ) is to enable real - time , interpersonal communication via natural spoken language for people who do not share a common language . It aims at translating a speech signal in a source language into another speech signal in a target language . 27 Speech - to - speech translation ( SST ) systems have been developed mostly for small hand - held mobile devices to facilitate spoken communication between people speaking different languages . Some research projects which developed SST systems are TC - STAR ( 2004 - 2007 ) , LC - STAR ( 2002 - 2005 ) , NESPOLE ! ( 2000 - 2002 ) , TONGUES ( 2000 - 2002 ) , and Verbmobil ( 1996 - 2000 ) . In addition , the research system MATRIX ( 1998 ) and the commercial NEC ( 2005 ) in Japan , and Digital Olympics ( 2006 ) in China were successful speech translation systems . Also , the Speechlator ( part of BABYLON project , 2003)was a two - way system working with Arabic as TL on a consumer PDA . 28 More recently , some tools which offer SST systems are the following : . Google 's Conversation Mode 48 : in 2010 it was announced thatin Android operating systems there will be a conversation mode , where users speak , Google Translate translates their speech , and reads the translation out loud ( currently that is available for English - Spanish ) . Google states that because this technology is in alpha , factors like regional accents , background noise , or rapid speech might be possible limitations . Google develops software for translator phone 49 by analyzing chunks of speech , and translating them in their entirety . Jibbigo 50 : it is an SST application for mobile devices . Its available language pairs are Chinese - English , French - English , German - English , Iraqi Arabic - English , Japanese - English , Korean - English , Spanish - English , and Tagalog - English . Jibbigo licenses theTTS from the company SVOX ( see ' Automatic Speech Recognition ' ) . It was built on two decades of the scientific research in speech and language processing at Mobile Technologies . Mobile Technologies and Jibbigo maintain a strong research collaboration with InterACT , the International Center for Advanced Communication Technologies at Carnegie Mellon University and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology , Germany . Phraselator 51 : it is developed by Voxtec for use by the U.S. Military ; it has aided the needs of thousands of service personnel in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Southeast Asia . SpeechTrans : AppTek 's system is deployed on computers , wearable machines , and telephony servers 52 ; the input is recorded through a telephone channel or microphone , and recognized using different ASR systems and tuned to either microphone- or telephone - quality speech . The recognized utterances are normalized using SMT based on finite state automata . The output is then translated by a hybrid MT ( RBMT and SMT ) . Trippo VoiceMagix 53 : it uses speech technology by Nuance Communications ; Speech input is US English and supports 27 languages . 29 Dialog systems are widely used to decrease human workload in telephony applications , for example in call centres . The functionality provided by dialog systems is known as interactive voice response ( IVR ) . 30 A speech dialog system consists of three components : speech input , internal processing , and speech output . The input has two functions : ASR and language understanding . The internal processing includes dialog management , while the speech output includes rendering and response . More precisely , a typical 54 dialog system workflow contains the following stages : . Text analysis ( tagging and parsing ) by a Natural Language Understanding unit . Semantic analysis by the dialog manager , along with a task manager that has knowledge of the specific task domain . When the input is malformed or inaccurate , the manager has to decide if it is necessary to request a more specific user input or if it is possible to extract the missing accuracy from knowledge resources ( Will , 2010 ) . Output generation by the dialog manager ( language and/or gesture generation ) . Output rendering using an output renderer , which may include TTS engine . 31 As far as the quality of dialog systems is concerned , Will ( 2010 : 60 ) states that the main cause of failure in speech dialogs is the difficulty of recognizing context - sensitive information in full sentence utterances . Context - sensitive information is manageable by consulting knowledge sources which are divided into dialog history and task record . 32 As seen in the stages i. and iv . above , dialog systems have also employed other modes for communication for input and output , such as gestures , and we will examine that in the next chapter ' Gesture Recognition and Localization ' . 33 According to McNeil ( 1992 ) , gestures are the movements of the hands and arms that we see when people talk . The meanings of ' gesture ' as an action performed to convey a feeling or intention , oran action performed for show in the knowledge that it will have no effect are not considered here . However , for our purposes we do not focus only on hands and arms movements , but we include eye tracking as another part of gesture recognition as well . Gestures is a mode of communication in multimodal systems and they emphasize or express more accurately the content of the spoken language . Gestures are used , among others , when verbal communication is not possible or limited , i.e. in road works ( very noisy ) or airfield . Moreover , older people are not very familiar with interaction with mouse and keyboard or small buttons in the remote controller and that is why they prefer gesture interaction ( Burkhardt et al . 2011 ) . 34 McNeil 's ( 1992 ) categorization of gestures is the following : . Iconics : they bear a close formal relationship to the semantic content of speech . Metaphorics : they are pictorial like iconics but the pictorial content presents an abstract idea rather than a concrete object or event . Beats : they are so named because they look like beating musical time . They always have the same form regardless of the content . 35 As for speech - gesture combination , McNeil ( 1992 ) points out that speech and gesture must cooperate to express a person 's meaning . Although they are closely linked , he refers to some of their distinct differences . Gestures are global because the direction is from whole to part ; in language instead , the words are parts and when they are combined , they create a whole . Gestures are also synthetic because one gesture can combine many meanings , while in language the relationship of words to meaning is analytic , that means that distinct meanings are attached to distinct words . One interesting observation about the syntactic relationship between speech and co - speech gestures in multimodal grammar is explored by Fricke ( 2009 ) . She claims that co - speech gestures are able to instantiate the syntactic function of an attribute within verbal nominal phrases and can semantically modify the nucleus of the nominal phrase . Speech - gesture alignment is being researched currently , among others , by the University of Bielefeld ( project SFB 673-B1 55 ) . 36 Moving forward from a theoretical view of gestures to gesture - based software , we will refer to some gesture recognition software . Also facial gestures and eye tracking may control cursor motion or focus on elements of a display . Eye tracking particularly in the field of translation has been researched by O'Brien ( 2010 ) . 37 Some 3D gesture recognition software and their main functions are presented below : . Android Gesture Recognition Tool ( Ne\\u00dfelrath et al . 2011 ) : it allows recording hand movement gestures by exploiting the accelerometers of an Android smart phone . It makes it possible to create gesture training sets . CamSpace 56 : this platform can detect human gestures and turns everyday products ( like can , bottles , boxes , etc ) or objects into computer controllers that can operate new or existing games and applications . Use for educational games or advertizing lets advertisers and advertising agencies create motion games and experiences based around advertisers ' products and user hand gestures . GestureTek 57 : it is a custom 3D Depth Sensing Prototype System for Gesture Control . HandVu 58 : vision - based Hand Gesture Recognition and User Interface ( UI ) ; it detects the hand in a standard posture , then tracks it and recognizes key postures - all in real - time and without the need for camera or user calibration . IISU by SoftKinetic 59 : enabled with a depth sensing imager , it allows end - users to watch their video images or full - body 3D avatar while interacting in real time with computer - generated characters and devices . Compatible with all major 3D depth - sensing devices , IISU is available now to developers of interactive digital entertainment , serious games , interactive marketing solutions , and consumer electronics applications . Throw and Tilt ( Dachselt & Buchholz , 2009 ) combines sensor - enabled , gesture - based mobile phone interaction with large displays . More precisely , throwing gestures can be used to transfer personal media data such as music , pictures , and map locations to a large screen . An even more advanced way is to seamlessly transfer the whole UI between various devices . 38 A full list of gesture recognition software can be found at various webpages 60 . 39 We turn our attention now to gesture localization and how it is related to gesture recognition . In our opinion , even if gesture recognition is performed with high accuracy , the meaning might be not understood by some users , as this gesture is not used as such in a specific locale . In addition , users would prefer some gesture recognition software against some other for the reason that they want to do only gestures which are ' semantically allowed ' in their culture and hence are not offending in another locale . 40 Some examples of different gestures in different locales follow : the ' thumbs up ' 61 gesture means that everything is good in America and many European countries , whereas it is rude in Asian and Islamic countries . Men holding hands or kissing is considered normal in some Asian and Islamic countries , while it would possibly mean homosexuality in most westernized countries . Also , the curled finger gesture 62 means telling someone to come to you in America and England , but is considered rude in Japan and death in Singapore . Prolonged eye contacted is considered rude in Japan , Korea , and Thailand , while it is preferred in North America and Europe 63 . It is worth mentioning that some gestures are sex - dependent , i.e. men and women do a different gesture to express the same meaning . Examples of sex - dependent gestures are \\\" thank you \\\" and \\\" goodbye \\\" in Zimbabwe . The International Society for Gesture Studies ( ISGS ) investigates , among others , the roles and organization of gesture in face - to - face conversation , universal and cultural aspects of gesture , and gesture 's relationship to thought and language . For more information about gesture recognition for culture specific interactions see Rehm et al . ( 2008 ) . 41 After showing some culture - specific gestures , we define gesture localization as follows : . Gesture localization is the adaptation of gestures to a target locale in order to transfer the same meaning as in the original locale . 42 Gestures need localization , i.e. being interpreted and accordingly , recognized by software because different gestures exist in different locales and the same gesture might have a different meaning in different locales . Gesture localization should be always taken into consideration when gesture recognition software is developed , so that the software can be used by other locales at least to the same extent as in the original locale . The curled finger gesture , for instance , to tell a robot to navigate to the user , would have not found any acceptance by users in Singapore . 43 Co - speech spatial gestures appeal to our research particularly , as our application area is an ambient assisted living lab and a wheelchair which is navigated through speech interaction . These gestures usually make the navigational intention of the user more perspicuous . Breslow et al . ( 2010 ) distinguish spatial gestures into gestures used for thinking ( cognitive gestures ) and gestures used to help express predetermined ideas ( linguistic gestures ) . The former help to determine what to say in a spatially complex domain , while the latter what we have determined to say . 44 Nickel and Stiefelhagen ( 2006 ) recognized with their real - time vision system pointing gestures in human - robot interaction by visual tracking of head , hands , and head orientation . Based on hands ' motion , they decomposed a pointing gesture into three distinct phases and modeled each phase with a dedicated HMM . They followed a multi - hypotheses approach and achieved 60 % relative error reduction . 45 Burkhardt et al . ( 2011 ) described some intuitive and easy gestures for the elderly . They made an experiment where test subjects were asked to make gestures with the WiiMote controller to scroll ( right , left , up , down ) , zoom , renew , and navigate in a relational database . The results showed that the more complex the tasks are , the more ( in number ) and more intuitive the gestures became . This , in turn , means bigger effort in implementation or training . 46 In this chapter we focus on ambient assisted living ( AAL ) environments and related work regarding dialog and gesture - based systems in AAL . Then we refer specifically to the Bremen Ambient Assisted Living Lab ( BAALL 64 ) and its human - robot speech interaction . 47 AAL is concerned with intelligent assistant systems of assistance for a better , healthier and safer life in the preferred living environment through the use of Information and Communication Technologies ( ICT ) . Human - computer interaction ( HCI ) is indispensable part in ICT and speech recognition and synthesis are intuitive realizations of HCI . There have been many research initiatives and advances in AAL environment the last years , for example , AALIANCE project 65 , AAL Joint Programme 66 and so on . Goetze et al . ( 2010 ) mention characteristically : \\\" older persons targeted by AAL technologies especially need more easy - to - use methods to interact with inherently complex supporting technology \\\" . 48 One motivation for AAL initiatives is the demographic change due to the aging population phenomenon . According to the German Federal Statistical Office 67 , in 2060 14.2 % will be 80 years old or older . Also , almost double amount of people will be retired . The ever more increasing amount of older people who need care makes the need for a safer , healthier , and more independent lifestyle essential . The aging phenomenon is reality and technology should help increase the autonomy of the elderly and their active participation in society . 49 To start with , in 2002 Theobalt et al . stated that \\\" situations humans helping mobile robots to find their way or to complete tasks while engaging in a dialog are expected to become more widespread as robots begin to appear in domestic environment \\\" . We present following recent advances which prove this expectation true : . They made an experiment installing the entire system into real houses and asking the users to talk as they wish ( out of grammar ) . The results showed action accuracy 91.23 % , taken into account also that almost 30 % of utterances were spoken by a non - native speaker . Krieg - Br\\u00fcckner built at DFKI , University of Bremen , the BAALL which is an apartment suitable for the elderly and people with physical or cognitive impairments ( see Krieg - Br\\u00fcckner et al . , 2010 ) . A wheelchair called \\\" Rolland \\\" serves mobility assistance in the BAALL . Rolland is equipped with two laser range - sensors , wheel encoders , and an onboard computer . In BAALL natural interaction with the users is taken in serious consideration , and thus it is enabled through special devices for compensating special limitations . Goetze et al . ( 2010 ) described technologies for acoustic user interaction in AAL scenarios . They designed and evaluated a multi - media reminding and calendar system as a part of a personal activity and household assistant for acoustic sound pick - up , processing , enhancement , and analysis providing functionality for acoustic input and output of assistive systems . The authors examined whether users prefer a suggested structured dialog or a free input of speech . In the latter case , the participants were asked to provide input commands to the system without a structured dialog . The free input of appointments was preferred by 58 % , the structured by the rest . On the one side , some reasons for preferring free input are i ) input is more familiar , ii ) higher flexibility , iii ) more individual , and iv ) less complicated . On the other side , reasons preferring the structured dialog are that i ) nothing can be forgotten , ii ) higher concentration on the information , and iii ) easier communication with the technical system ( p.18 ) . Apart from that , the authors carried out an ASR performance study having as training set both male and female speakers of different age and hearing loss . The results showed that the ASR performance was lower for the older persons and for female ( p.25 ) . Becker et al . ( 2009 ) deployed sensors into an assistive environment . They state that \\\" the speech interface is the easiest way for the user to interact with the computer based service system \\\" . The dialog management system they implemented uses the ASR engine Sphinx combined with the Cepstral and Festival speech synthesis . The authors ' reason of selecting Sphinx was the requirement lack of the speaker to ' train ' the system . The problem they faced in their experiments was that the longer and more continuous the speech is , the more recognition errors there are . Thus they concluded that short and distinct phrases help to improve the precision of the speech recognition . D ' Andrea et al . ( 2009 ) described a multimodal pervasive framework based specifically at the grammar level and developed a methodology for defining a formal grammar and inductive mechanisms to generate rules for synthesizing grammars . They envisaged four architectural levels : acquisition , analysis , planning , and activation level . In the analysis level , there is a speech recognizer , gesture recognizer , and speech synthesizer . The multimodal input is parsed according to rules included in the Multimodal Grammar Repository . 50 Now we present some work on dialog with relation to robotics but not in assistive environments . Motallebipour & Bering ( 2003 ) developed a prototype to study integration of speech dialog into graphical interfaces . Their goal was to make a robot able to understand spoken language instructions and perform simple tasks . The instructions were used within a restricted domain and that had as benefits that the speech vocabulary and the number of natural sentences are limited and the prototype can be integrated into existing ( computer - aided design ) CAD software . They used ASR application , Action Logic application , TTS application , XEmacs application , and 3D Robot application . The ASR application they used is Microsoft SAPI 5.1 in command mode . The command node used Context Free Grammar ( CFG ) grammars to recognize single words and short phrases . The CFG format in SAPI 5 defines the structure of grammars and grammar rules using XML . The authors concluded that dialog sentences by three non - native English speakers were recognized with good accuracy using SAPI 5 and that although the grammar and set of used words were limited , the test subjects felt that the dialog came natural . Here it should be pointed out that Rosenfeld et al . ( 2001 ) also mentioned that constraining language is a plausible method of improving recognition accuracy . SAPI 5.1 was also used by Haage et al . ( 2002 ) to develop a speech system to design robot trajectories that would fit with CAD paradigms . Mubin et al . ( 2010 ) developed ROILA ( Robot Interaction Language ) in order to improve the accuracy of speech recognition and to make it learnable for a user . Initially based on Toki Pona , they conducted a i ) phonological and ii ) morphological overview of natural languages in order to create ROILA which consists of 16 letters , four parts - of - speech and four pronouns . Their results are higher accuracy compared to English for a relatively larger vocabulary , although the acoustic model of Sphinx is primarily designed for English . Theobalt et al . ( 2002 ) developed Godot , a mobile robot platform for the interface between a sophisticated low level robot navigation and symbolic high - level spoken dialog system . The dialog component used Discourse Representation Structures . They used the off - the - shelf Nuance 7.0 speech recognizer . The grammar they used is compiled from a linguistic unification grammar and includes semantic representation . They used the speech synthesizer Festival . 51 We draw some conclusions from some of the above related work : . Speech vocabulary and training set of words / sentences ( corpus ) are limited , but give less error rates ; . Long and continuous sentences are difficult to be recognized ; . Free input of speech rather than structured dialog is preferred by test subjects . 52 Now we present two studies showing how important is multilinguality in AAL . Undoubtedly , translating vital information can often save lives ( see Anastasiou & Sch\\u00e4ler , 2010 ) . Translation in medical domain is crucial and as telemedicine is one aspect of AAL , that shows that multilingual support in AAL environment is indispensable . Burda ( 2005 ) made an experiment with twenty native speakers of English , ages 62 to 91 , who listened to words and sentences produced by native speakers of English , Taiwanese , and Spanish . Participants transcribed the words and sentences and rated speakers ' comprehensibility and accentedness using separate 7-point Likert - type scales . Listeners performed the most poorly on items spoken by the native Spanish speaker . A report by Santo Pietro and Ostuni ( 1997 ) denoted that at least 30 - 40 % of direct care staff in health care settings are from backgrounds other than native English - speaking Euro - American , while 90 % of the residents are native English - speaking Euro - American . Lack of information in a local language or misinterpretation of care staff instructions can lead to a wrong dosage of medicine which can have dramatic impact . Hence translation plays , apart from a communicative and socioeconomic , also a life - saving role in AAL . 53 In Bremen Ambient Assisted Living Lab ( BAALL ) natural interaction with the users is enabled through spoken dialog with special devices . However , the dialog is currently performed only in German and English . Having this as motivation , we want to move from a monolingual setting to a multilingual one . BAALL is the environment and Rolland the implementation device of our designed platform . 54 The user can interact through speech with Rolland in BAALL to navigate through the living areas . Rolland 's navigation assistant and natural language interaction technology is integrated , as Krieg - Br\\u00fcckner et al . ( 2010 ) discussed in the following case scenario : Mario is sitting in his wheelchair at the desk of his home office . He says to Rolland ' I 'd like to eat a pizza ' . The wheelchair reaches the kitchen and replies to the user ' OK , I m going to take you to the kitchen ' . When Mario is in the kitchen , he asks ' Where is the pizza ? ' , Rolland replies ' The pizza is in the fridge . I am taking you to the fridge ' . A snippet of the grammar that enables ( part of ) the above scenario follows : . 56 At the moment the grammar is available in German and English and Rolland can speak back in German , English , and ( some ) Italian . 57 The advances of speech interaction with Rolland in BAALL are the following : . Users with physical impairments can speak instead of clicking on buttons ; . Users feel friendlier when speaking to Rolland ; . Rolland can intelligently make second steps ( connecting pizza with kitchen ) saving time and sparing tiresome single instructions . 58 The limitations we see in Rolland and BAALL are the following : . The ASR system used is proprietary . Grammar is in German and English only ; that means that users can speak only in these two languages . Grammar is minimal ; thus the instructions limited . Rolland is not intelligent enough to remember his original position so that he returns back or follow a sequence of events ( e.g. after Mario finishes his pizza he wants to wash his hands , so Rolland brings him to the bathroom ) . 59 We believe that when users express themselves in their preferred natural language / mother tongue and devices / robots act after recognizing this natural language is not only easy , but also intuitive , and natural method of HCI . Users feel more secure and friendlier towards intelligent machines . 60 In order to mitigate the limitation ii . we mentioned above , we develop a platform where ASR , MT , and TTS systems are combined . It is a distinct SST system , as the difference between our designed SST system and other traditional SST systems is that the output is in the source language ( usually mother tongue of the user ) and not in the target language . Grammar minimalism is another limitation ( iii ) and this can be mitigated through addition of more tasks , apart from navigational ones . Controlling devices , like turning the TV on , for example , is another application where the SST system can be used . Making the grammar lexically rich ( with morphological and syntactic extensions ) will lead to a wider spectrum of tasks Rolland can undertake . These tasks can then be well structured in activity - based ontologies , so that complex activities ( limitation iv . ) , but also their sequence can be well managed / tracked and controlled . In the next paragraphs we focus only on multilinguality provided by our platform ; the other two items are outside the scope of this paper . 61 Ourplatformcombines ASR , MT , and TTS tools . This unique platform is initially tested in the wheelchair Rolland and later can be implemented in intelligent devices in assisted living environments , such as beds , kitchen drawers , and electronic appliances . 62 The workflow of the HCI using the specific platform is the following : . User speaks and/or makes a co - speech gesture , and speech and gestures are converted into text ; . Language identification and MT technology to translate the existing grammar in the language of the user ; . Rolland and intelligent devices act based on the user 's input ; . Machine speaks back into the user 's language . 63 The advantage of multilingual support in BAALL is that users can speak in their own mother language ; that means that Rolland can be used in a crosslingual setting , not only by German or English native speakers or speakers who can speak German / English . Advantages related to sentiments like speech naturalness , freedom , and security are counted too . 64 In this paper we presented the state - of - the - art of automatic speech recognition and speech synthesis , dialog systems , and speech - to - speech translation . Gesture examples , recognition software , and meaning of gesture localization were also furnished . Then we referred to ambient assisted living environments and relevant related work considering speech and gesture support . 65 The elderly and people with physical or cognitive impairments is a group which needs special care and specific , easy - to - use technology should be developed to meet their needs . The elderly suffer often from hearing loss , speak with pauses or unclearly , and typically have impaired vision . All these factors limit the usage of the technology compared to other people . They can not read the text written under buttons in TV remote controllers , for instance . Although , there are remote controllers designed today for the elderly with bigger buttons and text in bigger font , speech recognition software would facilitate their interaction . They can say , for example , the command to the TV ' turn on the TV ' . The challenge for ASR systems here would be the prosody of the elderly . ASR software works usually with clear voice and short and distinct sentences which is often not the case with elderly 's speech . Thus in our future prospects belongs to train acoustic models with voices of older people ; we will use VoxForge project for this purpose . 66 In addition , gestures can be part of human - computer interaction . Making a gesture like showing with the hand to the right , Rolland will turn right ; also a ' tick in the air ' could turn the TV on . In controlling devices particularly , the limitation is that users have to learn specific gestures and software has to be trained to recognize them . We saw that the more complex the tasks become , the more intuitive the gestures . Moreover , the cultural background of gestures should be taken into account when developing or adapting recognition software . We plan to conduct a survey regarding how people in different locales make gestures for various purposes ( spatial or device controlling ) . 67 In this paper the current speech processing in BAALL was described together with its limitations which are lock - in propriety software , monolinguality , grammar minimalism , and activity simplicity . Our contributions to eliminate the limitations are usage of FOSS , a unique speech - to - speech translation system , lexical grammar enrichment , and activity - based ontologies . Against monolinguality specifically , we designed a unique platform combining FOSS ASR , MT , and TTS systems . Its distinction from a typical SST system is that the intelligent device does not speak in the language the input is translated into , but in the user 's language . MT is used only to translate the existing grammar in the user 's language . Our speech translation platform is an effort towards provision of multilingual support in intelligent environments . 68 Future prospects concerning our platform include testing various FOSS STT , MT , and TTS systems to select the best one which fits our needs . After that , we plan to follow the system combination of ASR systems to see whether they perform with higher accuracy than when used individually . We will follow the cross - adaptation approach , as Gales et al . ( 2008 ) found this more appropriate . 69 Multimodality and multilinguality are two different aspects in AAL which can be combined though to make not only human - human but also human - computer interaction efficient . In AAL devices should be reachable , navigation should happen without crashes , and all this at high speed and low cost . Ivanecky et al . ( 2011 ) stated that the current ASR systems in AAL are either reliable , but complex and very expensive , or inexpensive , but unreliable . As far as speed is concerned , turning the TV on through speech or gesture should not take longer than clicking on a button . 70 Multilingual support in human - computer / robot interaction in AAL facilitates not only independence , intuition , and user - friendliness , but is often necessary to avoid dramatic medical accidents in case of language misunderstanding between care staff and patients . 71 Navigation of people on a wheelchair through speech interaction , sensor - based frameworks , speaking calendars , showing a website in a large display by throwing gestures and so on are today reality and not research goals any longer . Technology is advancing , but it should be made affordable and applicable in many domains , including AAL . We hope for future research initiatives and projects developing multimodal and multilingual applications in assistive environments . We presented an initial contribution of a distinct speech - to - speech translation system with the goal of a language - independent dialog management tied with localized co - speech gestures initially applied on a wheelchair and later on other devices in ambient assisted living environments .

Figure 4 . The Role of Environmental Heterogeneity in Maintenance of Anuran Amphibian Diversity of the Brazilian Mesophytic Semideciduous Forest . Tiago Gomes dos Santos 1 , 2 , Tiago da Silveira Vasconcelos 1 and C\\u00e9lio Fernando Baptista Haddad 1 . [ 1 ] Universidade Estadual Paulista , , Brazil . Introduction . Since the 1950s , most ecologists have assumed that animal communities are not simply random assemblages of species ( Wells , 2007 ) . Therefore , deterministic factors were pointed out as being responsible for the variation in species diversity and composition along environmental and/or spatio - temporal gradients ( Chase & Leibold , 2003 ) . Therefore the Neutral Theory predicts that species abundance results solely from structured random walks , leaving unexplained the correlations between species traits and their abundances within habitats and/or along environmental gradients ( see references in Tilman , 2004 ) . Some studies highlighted that Neotropical assemblages show little or no structure ( Eterovick & Barros , 2003 , Afonso & Eterovick , 2007 for anurans and Fran\\u00e7a & Ara\\u00fajo , 2007 for snakes ) , corroborating the Neutral Theory . Several studies showed that similar habitats within relatively close distance often have slightly different amphibian assemblages since some species live in a variety of habitats , while others can have more specialized habitat requirements ( Snodgrass et al . , 2000 ; Wells , 2007 ) . Therefore , most anuran assemblages appear to be structured since differences in environmental conditions from site to site have explained differences in assemblage features such as richness and abundance of species ( Toft , 1982 ) . According to Paton & Crouch ( 2002 ) and Bosch & Mart\\u00ednez - Solano ( 2003 ) , local studies on breeding site preferences of amphibians can provide more accurate information for management purposes than studies on a wider scale , which can be affected by regional variations . This kind of forest was almost totally devastated because of their soil fertility , smooth relief and high availability of valuable hardwood and because of unscrupulous political interests ( Murphy & Lugo , 1986 ; Prado & Gibbs , 1993 ; Dean , 1998 ) . Besides , the Semideciduous Forests have been historically neglected as areas for conservation unit creation because of their low level of endemism when compared with the humid forests ( Jansen , 1997 ; Prado , 2000 ; Pennington et al . , 2006 ) . We also verified the existence of indicator anuran species of environmental heterogeneity on a local scale . Material and methods . Study area and sampling procedures . MDSP is covered by a mosaic of Mesophytic Semideciduous Forest in different stages of regeneration , some small patches of Cerrado sensu stricto ( savanna - like vegetation ) , and transitional forests ( Durigan & Franco , 2006 ) . Physicochemical water measurements were collected and based on a mean of three samples , using a Hach 2100PTurbidimeter ( for turbidity ) and an YSI 556Handheld Multiparameter ( for the remaining variables ) . Permanent dams were located within the borders of forests and presented great depth , low canopy cover , and a bed composed of clay and organic deposits . Dam waters showed low electric conductivity , intermediate oxygenation , and high richness in potential aquatic predators ( insects , crustaceans , and fish ) ( Table 1 ) . Figure 1 . Geographical localization of the studied area ( Morro do Diabo State Park : MDSP ) , located in the westernmost region of the state of S\\u00e3o Paulo , southeastern Brazil . Permanent streams were located inside the forests and presented a bed mainly composed of sand ( PS2 ) and gravel ( PS1 ) , and backwaters with deposits of mud and organic matter . Stream waters were well oxygenated with intermediate conductivity , had a lower temperature than permanent dams and temporary ponds , and high richness of potential aquatic predators ( Table 1 ) . Temporary ponds were shallow and presented a bed covered by leaf litter and other detritus of terrestrial vegetation ( such as decaying grasses in TP2 ) that grows in dry pond basins . Temporary pond water presented high conductivity , low dissolved oxygen , and lowrichness in potential aquatic predators ( Table 1 ) . In addition , temporary waters presented brownish coloration and high salinity , probably due to humic substances and evaporation respectively ( Williams , 2006 ) . However , the two temporary ponds differed regarding their canopy cover , since water surface of TP1 was covered by trees whereas TP2 was scarcely shadowed . We recordedthe monthly abundance of anuran species in each breeding site by performing the \\\" surveys at breeding sites \\\" methodology ( Scott & Woodward , 1994 ) during the nocturnal period ( from sunset to midnight , when most species had already reduced their calling activities ) . The search for anurans was made along the perimeters of breeding sites , by recording males engaged in calling activities . Habitat inspections were carried out using artificial light ( head lamps ) , a methodology widely performed and recommend in protocols of inventory and monitoring of amphibians ( Heyer et al . , 1994 ) , since males of anurans call even if under artificial light . The amount of time spent in each breeding site varied according to its size and complexity ( Scott & Woodward , 1994 ) . Additional information regarding MDSP characterization and sampling schedule is available in Santos et al . ( 2009 ) and Vasconcelos et al . ( 2009 ) . Table 1 . Localization and environmental characterization of six breeding sites monitored in Morro do Diabo State Park , S\\u00e3o Paulo state , southeastern Brazil . Statistical analyses . We carried out an environmental representation of the monitored breeding sites in MDSP by calculating the Euclidean Distance index ( Krebs , 1999 ) on abiotic and biotic quantitative measurements ( i.e. physicochemical water features , size , canopy cover , and richness in potential aquatic predators ) . We based Euclidean Distances on transformed ( square root ) and normalized ( by standard deviation ) environmental variables , due to deviations of normality of original data and no comparable measurement scales ( Clarke & Gorley , 2006 ) . In addition , we tested the existence of spatial patterns in the distribution of anuran assemblages among the six breeding sites monitored by computing similarity analysis ( Bray - Curtis index ) ( Krebs , 1999 ) . We based the similarity matrix on the total abundance of anuran species in each breeding site . Abundance of each species in each breeding site was considered as the highest number of calling males recorded during the monitored period . We adopted this procedure to avoid overestimation of species due to recounting individuals in a serial sampling schedule ( Gottsberger & Gruber , 2004 ; Vasconcelos & Rossa - Feres , 2005 ; Santos et al . , 2007 ) . We represented dissimilarity and similarity matrices by cluster analysis ( UPGMA ) ( Krebs , 1999 ) , and accessed statistical significance of genuine clusters performing the SIMPROF similarity profile test ( Clarke & Gorley , 2006 ) . SIMPROF is a series of permutation tests of the null hypothesis that assumes that the samples are a priori unstructured ( i.e. that the breeding sites are unstructured regarding environmental characteristics and/or anuran assemblages ) . This test is based on an expected profile shape of similarity / dissimilarity obtained by permuting the entries for each variable 1,000 times ( i.e. species and/or environmental variables ) across that subset of samples ; this produces a null condition in which samples have no group structure . The 1,000 permuted values are averaged to produce a mean profile which is statically compared ( 999 times ) with the real similarity profile by absolute distances ( Phi ) ( Clarke & Gorley , 2006 ) . According to Clarke & Gorley ( 2006 ) , whether environmental variables are responsible for structuring assemblages , it is expected that a plot , based on environmental information , groups the breeding sites in the same way as for a species composition plot . Therefore , we looked for concordance among cluster plots of environmental characteristics and anuran assemblages , in order to explain the spatial patterns of breeding sites used by anurans in MDSP . We also computed Principal Components Analysis ( PCA ) ( Legendre & Legendre , 1998 ) to represent together the monthly samples of breeding sites and the species . The purpose of this analysis was to capture as much as possible the variability of the original dataset in a low - dimensional solution , represented by orthogonal axes . Thus , most of the variance is accounted for on the first two or three axes ( Clarke & Warwick , 2001 ; Manly , 2008 ) . We based PCA on a variance / covariance matrix , since we measured all variables in the same unit ( i.e. abundance of anurans ) . Finally , we performed the Indicator Species Analysis ( ISA ) ( Dufr\\u00eane & Legendre , 1997 ) to test for the existence of indicator species of environmental heterogeneity . This method is based on a data matrix where there are data groups ( a priori established ) that can be indicated by some species . According to McCune & Mefford ( 1999 ) , each species receives an indicator value ( IV ) of each group , which varies from zero ( no indication ) to 100 ( perfect indication ) . The null hypothesis in ISA considers that the maximum IV is not greater than that expected by chance . The indicator value is calculated using relative abundance and relative frequency of species across the sample units ( considered herein as the monthly records of species abundance in each breeding site ) . Thus , a good indicator species of a determined group must be frequent and abundant across the samples in this group ( Dufr\\u00eane & Legendre , 1997 ) . Established groups for ISA were considered based on the clusters indicated by SIMPROF and PCA analyses . Statistical significances of the maximum value indicated for each group were performed using the Monte Carlo permutation test ( Manly , 1998 ) ( 5,000 times ) . We based all analyses on log - transformed ( log x+1 ) abundance of anuran species in order to down - weight the contributions of quantitatively dominant species in the similarity analysis , and to linearize relationships in PCA analysis . SIMPROF and ISA analyses were performed using Primer - E 6.1 ( Clarke & Gorley , 2006 ) and PC - ORD 4.0 ( McCune & Mefford , 1999 ) software respectively . PCA was performed using CANOCO 4.0 for Windows software ( ter Braak & Smilauer , 1998 ) . Results . We recorded a total of 23 anuran species in the six monitored breeding sites in MDSP and the number of anuran species in the breeding sites ranged from three ( PS2 ) to 17 species ( TP1 ) ( Table 2 ) . Anuran abundance ranged from 22 ( PS2 ) to 316 individuals ( TP1 ) ( Table 2 ) . The SIMPROF similarity profile test showed three consistent groups of breeding sites in relation to environmental characteristics : permanent dams , permanent streams , and temporary ponds ( Fig . 2A ) . The first node separated temporary ponds from permanent dams and permanent streams ( Fig . 2A ) . The second node separated permanent streams from permanent dams ( Fig . 2A ) . In addition , the SIMPROF test also showed that anuran species differed from a spatial distribution expected by chance and clustered three consistent groups of breeding sites in MDSP ( Fig . 2B ) . These groups correspond to the same groups previously evidenced by the environmental features ( Fig . 2A ) . The first node separated lotic ( permanent streams ) from lentic environments ( permanent dams and temporary ponds ) , whilst the second node separated lentic environments in permanent dams and temporary ponds ( Fig . 2B ) . The multivariate structure within the genuine clusters did not differ statistically ( Fig . 2 ) . Table 2 . PCA analysis showed congruent results with SIMPROF analysis whereas the two - dimensional solution of PCA accounted for 61.4 % of the total explained variance ( Fig . 3 ) . Third and fourth axes account for few of the total explained variance ( only 8.6 % and 6 % , respectively ) . Figure 2 . Figure 3 . PCA ordination for 23 anuran species recorded in the six breeding sites , monitored monthly from October 2005 to March 2007 in Morro do Diabo State Park , S\\u00e3o Paulo state , southeastern Brazil . Hypsiboas albopunctatus , H. lundii , and Rhinella ornata were indicator species of permanent streams . Dendropsophus nanus , Hypsiboas punctatus , Scinax fuscomarginatus , and S. fuscovarius indicated permanent dams . Chiasmocleis albopunctata , Dendropsophus minutus , Elachistocleis bicolor , Hypsiboas raniceps , Leptodactylus chaquensis , L. fuscus , L. mystacinus , L. podicipinus , Physalaemus cuvieri , Scinax berthae , S. similis , and Trachycephalus typhonius indicated temporary ponds . Four anuran species were not indicators of environmental heterogeneity : Leptodactylus labyrinthicus , L. mystaceus , Pseudis platensis , and Rhinella schneideri ( Table 3 ) . Table 3 .

Ourresults indicated that anuran assemblages of MDSP were structured and related to the environmental heterogeneity of breeding sites , disagreeing with Hubbell 's neutral model of communities ( Hubbell , 2001 ) . In fact , several studies around the world have shown that adult anurans can actively choose breeding sites according to habitat characteristics ( Collins & Wilbur , 1979 ; Eason & Fauth , 2001 ; Bosch & Mart\\u00ednez - Solano , 2003 ; Werner et al . , 2007 ) . We expected a spatial structure of the anuran assemblages , since the groups of monitored breeding sites in MDSP ( permanent dams , permanent streams , and temporary ponds ) differed widely in relation to environmental characteristics . We recorded by SIMPROF and PCA analyses , a primary segregation of stream anuran assemblages in MDSP . The anuran segregation of streams from the remaining breeding sites ( permanent and temporary lentic habitats ) differed from the pattern observed in the environmental context , where the external group was composed by temporary ponds , and streams were closely related to the dams . High structural similarity between streams and dams was naturally expected , since dams are originated from dammed streams . However , for anuran assemblages , temporary ponds and dams are more closely related , since both of them are lentic waters , while streams are lotic environments usually unsuitable to colonization . We recorded through ISA analysis three anuran species as stream indicators : Hypsiboas albopunctatus , H. lundii , and Rhinella ornata . H.albopunctatus occurred in backwaters of streams , very similar to swamps ( i.e. in wide stream sections with a mud bed , slow - flowing water , and under natural clearings ) . According to Cei ( 1980 ) , H. albopunctatus lives in open spaces of forests at the edges of standing waters . However , in most studies this species has been reported as being associated with streams ( Haddad et al . , 1988 ; Kwet et al . , 2002 ) and swamps ( Brasileiro et al . , 2005 ; Santos et al . , 2007 ) with little water flow . H. albopunctatus has a generalized reproductive mode ( mode 1 ; Haddad & Prado , 2005 ) and can be found in human settlements and in disturbed environments ( Vasconcelos & Rossa - Feres , 2005 ; Santos et al . , 2007 ) . Hypsiboas lundii is an anuran species typical from the Brazilian Cerrado ( Frost , 2011 ) , totally dependent on gallery forests ( Brasileiro et al . , 2005 ) . Reproduction of this species is associated with permanent streams of primary and secondary forests ( International Union for Conservation of Nature,2011 ) . Males usually construct basins in banks of streams where eggs are deposited and tadpoles are carried from the basins after flooding caused by heavy rains ( mode 4 ; Haddad & Prado , 2005 , Eterovick & Sazima , 2004 ) . Rhinella ornata is distributed within the Atlantic forest ( Frost , 2011 ) . It is a toad that deposits eggs in streams , with exotrophic tadpoles developing in stream backwaters ( mode 2 ; Haddad & Prado , 2005 ) . Our observations indicate that males of this species call in stillbackwaters and running waters of MDSP streams , highlighting that this toad species is dependent on forest habitats . In fact , a recent study has demonstrated that populations of R. ornata undergo genetic erosion due to habitat fragmentation of the Atlantic Coastal Forest ( Dixo et al . , 2009 ) . In the current study , we recorded segregation between assemblages of permanent dams and temporary ponds in MDSP . Anuran species richness in permanent dams ( PD1 and PD2 ) was intermediate in relation to permanent streams and temporary ponds ( i.e. higher than permanent streams but lower than temporary ponds ) . In fact , dams have intermediate features between lotic and lentic environments and these are harmful to the reproduction of many species due to changes in physical and chemical features of the water ( Esteves , 1998 ) . These statements were corroborated by Both et al . ( 2008 ) , since they recorded low diversity and high species dominance in the dam environment monitored in southern Brazil . In the present study , dams were dominated by two anuran species ( Dendropsophus nanus and Scinax fuscomarginatus ) that have wide distribution in South American biomes and are typically well adapted to anthropogenic disturbances ( Duellman , 1999 ; Frost , 2011 ; IUCN , 2011 ) . These anuran species have the generalized reproductive mode ( mode 1 ; Haddad & Prado , 2005 ) . In addition to Dendropsophus nanus and Scinax fuscomarginatus , two other anuran species were indicators of dams : Hypsiboas punctatus and Scinax fuscovarius . The former has a wide distribution comprising South and Central America ( Duellman , 1999 ; Vasconcelos et al . , 2006 ) , whilst S. fuscovarius present more southern distribution in South America ( Frost , 2011 ) . Both species have the generalized reproductive mode ( mode 1 ; Haddad & Prado , 2005 ) and occur in either preserved or disturbed areas ( Santos et al . , 2007 , 2008 ) . In fact , comparisons of community composition between permanent and temporary waterbodies reveal relatively little overlap regarding the biota ( review in Williams , 2006 ) . data ) . Amphibians that use different types of ponds along the permanence gradient tend to have different life - history characteristics ( Semlitsch et al . , 1996 ) , such as adaptations to deal with drying ponds . In addition , anuran species with a generalized reproductive mode have high reproductive investments ( large clutches ) , faster larval development , and can also show an evolutive response to explore unpredictable environments such as temporary ponds ( Basso , 1990 ) . The abundance and frequency of occurrence of four anuran species recorded in MDSP did not differ from the randomly expecteddistribution ( Leptodactylus labyrinthicus , L. mystaceus , Pseudis platensis , and Rhinella schneideri ) , and consequently did not indicate association with any breeding site . Three of these were rare at the monitored water bodies ( Leptodactylus labyrinthicus , Pseudis platensis , and Rhinella schneideri ) , which makes interpretations on spatial pattern distribution of these species unfeasible . On the other hand , Leptodactylus mystaceus was a ubiquitousanuran species in MDSP . We recorded males of this species calling within mud basins of stream banks and in temporary ponds , as previously reported by Toledo et al . ( 2003 ) . Reproduction of L. mystaceus takes place in sites seasonally flooded by heavy rains ( Duellman , 1978 ) and tadpoles are able to generate foam , probably as an adaptation to survive in places with unpredictable rainfall ( Caldwell & Lopez , 1989 ) . Therefore , we believe that the reproductive requirements of L. mystaceus seem to be more related to short hydroperiods of breeding sites ( such as seasonally flooded banks of permanent streams in MDSP ) , than to other environmental characteristics , such as lentic or lotic waters . Conclusion . We recordedthat anuran assemblages in MDSP were not a random set of species since they were structured according to distinct groups of breeding sites ( permanent dams , permanent streams , and temporary ponds ) . In addition , we also pointed out the existence of species indicators of environmental heterogeneity , i.e. anuran species typical of each group of breeding sites . Regarding indicator species analysis ( ISA ) , we observed lower ISA values associated with anuran indicators of temporary ponds than for those of permanent dams and streams . This result seems to be related to the reproductive patterns of anuran species , since ISA is based on relative abundance and relative frequency of species in the samples ( Dufr\\u00eane & Legendre , 1997 ) . Therefore , explosive breeding species that occupied temporary ponds for short periods contributed for few samples ( i.e. low frequency of occurrence ) in ISA analysis , decreasing the final indicator values . On the other hand , anuran species typical of permanent sites remained in streams and dams for longer periods , increasing indicator values . Despite this possible bias in indicator values , we believed in the robustness of ISA results since we recorded a higher number of anuran species as indicators of temporary ponds than of permanent dams and streams . Therefore , strategies of biodiversity conservation are urgently required for this forest type , and our results have significant implications for anuran conservation actions in remnants of Mesophytic Semideciduous Forest because the importance of heterogeneous breeding sites in the maintenance of high diversity in assemblages of anurans was highlighted . Therefore , the choice of areas for anuran conservation in this forest type must consider the presence of distinct breeding sites such as lotic and lentic environments , as well as sites with different hydroperiods . In this context , the Brazilian Forest Act revision , which hopes to expand agricultural frontiers by clear - cutting the vegetation in riparian zones and legal reserves of private lands , is a recent threat to anuran conservation ( Silva et al . , 2011 ) . This law proposal , which was approved in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies , will endanger the water quality and availability , modifying also the hydroperiod of waterbodies used to anuran breeding activity . Besides , the reduction and fragmentation of native vegetation can disconnect areas of shelters and/or foraging fromtheir breeding sites ( Becker et al . , 2007 ) , as well as promote genetic erosion of anuran species ( Dixo et al . , 2009 ) .

Abstract . Background . The coinfections HIV / HCV / HBV are an important health issue in penitentiary communities . The aim of the study was to examine HIV , HBV and HCV coinfections determinants amongst prisoners in the jails of Southern Lazio ( Central Italy ) , in the period 1995 - 2000 . Methods . Diagnosis of seropositivities for HIV , HBV and HCV was made using ELISA method . A multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to verify the influence of socio - demographic factors on the HIV / HBV / HCV coinfections . Results . HIV / HCV , HBV / HCV and HIV / HBV coinfections were detected in 42 ( 4 % ) , 203 ( 17.9 % ) and 31 ( 2.9 % ) inmates , respectively . Conclusion . The prevalence of HIV , HBV and HCV seropositivity in jails suggests that information and education programs for inmates could be useful to reduce the spread of such infections . Background . Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) and the hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) or hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) coinfections represent a public health problem of growing importance . Because of the similar modes of spread , many people are coinfected with HIV and HCV , HIV and HBV , and in some cases with all three viruses at the same time . In particular , HCV and HIV are called the \\\" twin epidemics \\\" : in fact , both are blood - born RNA viruses that replicate rapidly and direct blood - to - blood transmission - for example through needle sharing - is the most efficient means of transmitting both viruses [ 1 ] . Most studies show that HIV infection leads to more aggressive hepatitis C or hepatitis B and higher risk of liver damage [ 1 ] . Studies of how HCV and HBV affect HIV infection are less clear . Most research shows that HCV does not accelerate HIV disease progression , but HIV / HCV coinfection may impair immune system recovery after antiretroviral therapy has commenced [ 1 - 3 ] . Coinfection can complicate treatment . People with liver damage due to chronic hepatitis are more likely to experience hepatotoxicity related to anti - HIV drugs , and this represents a major concern for prison health officials dealing with infected prisoners who need treatment , for both health management and infections control . In the United States it is estimated that the 12 - 15 % of all Americans with chronic HBV infection , 39 % of those with chronic HCV and 20 - 26 % of those with HIV infection have a history of incarceration [ 32 ] . Among the population of injection drug users , the HIV / HCV coinfection rate may be as high as 90 % ( HIV coinfection ) and it remains high also among populations of prisoner [ 1 - 5 ] . A history of drug use is common in detainee populations in many countries : in the USA 73 - 83 % of prison inmates misuse drugs [ 33 ] while in the Republic of Ireland it is estimated that 40 % of prisoners use drugs . Furthermore , an Australian study determined that during their incarceration 25 - 44 % of inmates occasionally injected illegal drugs , 14 - 34 % engaged in occasional anal intercourse and 5 - 18 % did both [ 34 ] . With regards to the prisoners right to health , in Italy recent modifications of disposals on execution of punishment , safety and preventive measures towards prisoners suffering from HIV / AIDS have been performed [ 43 , 44 ] . Modifications of penitentiary health systems have the aim of rationalising the health interventions for prisoners ( preventive , curative and rehabilitative ) , which are guaranteed by the Constitution for health services [ 45 ] . Because of the seriousness of hepatitis B virus , hepatitis C virus , and HIV infections among inmates , it is important to know both the prevalence of these infections and the patterns of risk related behaviours in prison environments . We initiated a study concerning the spread of bloodborne viruses among the prison entrants of Southern Lazio ( Italy ) . The aim of this study was to investigate the association between HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses coinfections and socio - demographic determinants . Methods . Study design and Setting . A cross - sectional study was conducted in three jails of Southern Lazio ( Cassino , Frosinone and Latina ) . The study was authorized by the Ministry of Justice upon the presentation of a detailed research protocol ( n \\u00b0 43 , 23 - 6 - 2001 ) . A pilot study of 1 month was conducted in December 2000 , in order to validate the registration procedures and the assessment form [ 46 , 47 ] . The survey was carried out between January 2001- December 2002 and took into account all male prisoners detained in the above mentioned jails during the years 1995 - 2000 . The research was conducted according to the Helsinki Declaration . Data collection . As far as data collection , all the information ( including the testing ) in the study came from the patients ' chart , so a retrospective collection was realised . The medical charts of the prisoners were carefully examined by a public health doctor and by two social workers . Information regarding socio - demographic characteristics , life style habits and health status of prisoners was collected . In particular , the presence of HIV , HBV and HCV infection was ascertained testing the seropositivity against these viruses using the ELISA method . This was feasible because testing against these viruses is a standard procedure in this setting , including testing inmates that both referred or did not refer to the jail 's clinic for medical reason . In the present study we considered inmates for which HIV / HCV , HBV / HCV , HIV / HBV testing were simultaneously present . Since the prisoners are a vulnerable study population , their privacy was respected by ensuring that their names and surnames were not recorded . All of the pertinent data was transferred onto a specially prepared form and afterwards transferred into a database . Statistical analysis . The tables describe the distribution of infections among inmates according to several characteristics . The \\u03c7 2 test was performed in order to investigate the association between the presence of HIV / HBV / HCV coinfections and socio - demographic determinants as well as life style habits . The Fisher exact test was used where applicable . In order to identify risk factors associated to HIV / HCV , HBV / HCV and HIV / HBV coinfections , three multiple logistic regression analyses were performed , using the backward elimination procedure as described by Hosmer and Lemeshow [ 48 ] . The goodness of fit of the regression model was tested using the Hosmer and Lemeshow test . The statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS 12.0 for Windows . Results . HIV / HCV coinfection . With regards to HIV / HCV coinfection , information relative to 1047 prisoners of male gender ( 502 from Cassino , 485 from Frosinone and 60 from Latina ) were found . Table 1 shows the socio - demographic characteristics of the prisoners . Table 1 . Socio - demographic characteristics of prisoners , according to seropositivity against HIV / HCV , HBV / HCV and HIV / HBV . In relation to age , inmates ages were distributed as follow : 20.8 % of inmates were 18 - 24 years of age , 46.4 % were 25 - 34 years of age , 23.5 % were 35 - 44 years of age and 9.3 % were over 44 years of age . The majority of inmates ( 46.3 % ) had a junior high school education and only 1.2 % , had an educational level higher than secondary school . 773 prisoners ( 73.8 % ) were Italian and 274 ( 26.2 % ) were of a foreign nationality . 51.5 % , had never been married , 38.2 % were currently married or cohabiting and 10.3 % were separated or widower . In terms of the number of detentions , for 682 prisoners ( 68.8 % ) it was the first episode , while the other 309 persons ( 31.2 % ) had at least one other previous experience of detention . HIV / HCV coinfection was diagnosed in 42 individuals ( 4 % of tested prisoners ) : 11 in Cassino ( 2.2 % ) , 30 in Frosinone ( 6.2 % ) and 1 in Latina ( 1.7 % ) . Table 2 shows characteristics of the 1047 prisoners . With respect to drug use , 479 prisoners ( 45.7 % ) , were drug addicted at the time of incarceration and 52 ( 5 % ) were former addicted . Table 2 . Health status characteristics , according to seropositivity against HIV / HCV , HBV / HCV and HIV / HBV coinfection among inmates in Southern Lazio . With regards to the type of drugs used , 429 individuals ( 41.0 % ) were heroin dependent , 264 ( 25.2 % ) were cocaine addicts , while amongst the drug addicts 245 individuals ( 85.6 % ) were methadone consumers . Most individuals ( 54.7 % ) were polydrug abusers . Table 2 shows prisoners ' health characteristics with reference to their HIV and HCV coinfection status . The results of the multiple regression analyses are presented in Table 3 . Table 3 . Factors associated with HIV / HCV , HBV / HCV and HIV / HBV coinfections among inmates in Southern Lazio . HBV / HCV coinfection . As far as HBV / HCV coinfection was concerned , information relating to 1136 prisoners of male gender was distributed as follows : 510 in Cassino , 494 in Frosinone and 132 in Latina . With regards to nationality , 73.4 % were Italian and 26.6 % were foreign . Concerning civil status , 51.8 % had never been married , while 30.4 % were currently married , 8.1 % cohabitant and 9.5 % were separated or widower . In particular , most of the people ( 22.49 % ) were 25 - 34 years old and had junior high school degrees ( 24.08 % ) ( Table 1 ) . HIV / HBV coinfection . HIV / HBV coinfection was studied in 1076 prisoners and these numbers were distributed as follows : 505 in Cassino ( 46.9 % ) , 511 in Frosinone ( 47.5 % ) and 60 ( 5.6 % ) in Latina . The prevalence rate of this coinfection was found to be 2.9 % . 73.1 % of the inmates were Italian and 3.56 % of them had HIV / HBV coinfections . Most of them ( 51.8 % ) had never been married , 29.0 % were currently married , 8.7 % were cohabitant and 10.5 % were separated or widower . HBV / HCV coinfection was detected in 5.7 % of the prisoners with drug addictions , 8.89 % in methadone users and 3.8 % in those inmates who smoked . With regards to educational level , 667 prisoners had an elementary or junior high school degree and 17 of them had a HBV / HCV coinfection , furthermore , only 9 , of the inmates had a tertiary level degree and none of them had coinfections . ( Tables 1 and 2 ) . Discussion . This cross - sectional study carried out in the jails in Southern Lazio showed a prevalence of HIV / HCV , HBV / HCV and HIV / HBV coinfections of about 4 % , 18 % and 3 % in inmates , respectively . Data regarding these coinfections prevalence , even if remarkable , could however represent a biased estimation of the phenomenon , as screening for these infections are not mandatory for all prisoners . In our study the percentage of prisoners actually subjected to HIV testing was 47.37 % of all prisoners . This particular situation could be due to the fact that all of the penitentiaries examined in our study are jails where the prisoners are confined waiting for judgement or condemned to punishments less than 5 years . As depicted in other international studies , our study showed that HIV , HBV and HCV sero - positivities coinfections are strictly associated with the status of drug addiction , especially intravenous heroin addiction . Furthermore , HIV , HBV and HCV sero - positivities are influence by civil status , being a widower or cohabitant is significantly associated with these coinfections . Finally , it is possible to consider that even if health management of HBV , HCV and HIV sero - positivities in jails appears worrisome , there is paradoxically an opportunity for these patients of receiving good treatment inside the prison environment [ 55 ] . Our study has some limitations . One weakness is information bias . The study was based on the information gathered from the clinical charts , which may not have been complete in defining inmates ' health status and diagnostics . Moreover , for some variables , such as educational level , and civil status , gathered data were not complete . It is not known whether the study population is representative of the whole populations of participating prisons . It is possible that drug addicts were more likely to be given a HIV , HBV and HCV test , in which case an overestimation of the prevalence rates of infections could occur . In this case , if we hypothesize that all prisoners not given a test were seronegative , we would find a prevalence of 2.45 % , 10.9 % and 11.6 % , respectively . A fundamental role in the control of infection from HIV in prison environments may be found through prevention . As prisoner populations are at high risk for all of these infections , it is necessary for public health and institutions to collaborate to develop HBV , HCV , HIV prevention programs , including immunization , health education and substance abuse treatment . It is worrisome that not all prisoners are submitted to screening of these infections , while in other countries mandatory drug and blood tests exists [ 56 ] . In waiting for a positive evolution in the preparation of a sure and immunological vaccine , the application of direct and indirect prophylaxis measures represents the more convenient way to combat the AIDS problem in prisons . The second fundamental aspect of the preventive strategy against HIV / AIDS in the prison environment is the thorough observance of hygiene rules either general or specific ( i.e. , personal use of razors , teeth brush ) , which are often neglected , even the most elementary ones . The overcrowding of prisons and the consequent discomfort either among the warders or among the prisoners has become one of the most urgent problems to face . As reported by the WHO guideline to the essentials in prison health , the living conditions in most prisons of the world are unhealthy and rates of infection with HIV and hepatitis are much higher than in the general population [ 57 ] . Concerns exist that prisons could serve as a reservoir for the amplification of the transmission of infectious diseases in the wider community after the release of inmates who have became infected while incarcerated [ 2 ] . Of those identified as being infected in prison , 85 % of cases were associated with pre - incarceration behaviours [ 35 , 36 ] . The restrictive nature of the prison environment and the scarcity of clean syringes and condoms probably heighten the hazards associated with high risk activities , thus increasing the risk of transmission from infected to uninfected inmates [ 37 ] . The scientific literature shows a strong connection between infection from HIV , HBV , HCV and the group of drug - addicts in which some risk factors are surely present [ 38 , 39 ] . Conclusion . To control the diffusion of infectious diseases , and above all HIV , in prisons , implementation of operative guidelines and adequate funding are needed . It is therefore necessary to promote epidemiological studies and cost analyse of the economic impact relating to the public health of prisoners with coinfection management , in order to know the real burden of the problem .

[ 1 ] Lithospheric formation at slow spreading rates is heterogeneous with multiple modalities , favoring symmetric spreading where magmatism dominates or core complex and inside corner high formation where tectonics dominate . We report microseismicity from three deployments of seismic networks at the Mid - Atlantic Ridge ( MAR ) . Two networks surveyed the MAR near 7 \\u00b0 S in the vicinity of the Ascension transform fault . Three inside corner high settings were investigated . However , they remained seismically largely inactive and major seismic activity occurred along the center of the median valley . To the north and south of the massif , however , seismic activity occurred along the ridge axis , emphasizing the asymmetry of seismicity at the Logatchev segment . Focal mechanisms indicated a large number of reverse faulting events occurring in the vicinity of the vent field at 3 - 5 km depth , which we interpret to reflect volume expansion accompanying serpentinization . At shallower depth of 2 - 4 km , some earthquakes in the vicinity of the vent field showed normal faulting behavior , suggesting that normal faults facilitates hydrothermal circulation feeding the vent field . Further , a second set of cross - cutting faults occurred , indicating that the surface location of the field is controlled by local fault systems .

[ 2 ] A key tenet of plate tectonics is that magnetic spreading anomalies observed over mid - ocean ridges and the ocean basins arise because seafloor spreading records the episodic polarity reversals of the geomagnetic field [ Vine and Matthews , 1963 ] . Thus , seafloor magnetized at the ridge crest is rifted apart by seafloor spreading , transferring crust emplaced within the median valley to either side of the spreading axis , causing a roughly identical set of anomalies on both ridge flanks . [ 3 ] However , at slow - spreading ridges were magma supply is variable both in time and space spreading is accommodated by different modes . The first mode is dominated by magmatic processes with subsidiary high - angle normal faulting and the formation of abyssal hills on both flanks , resulting into the well - known symmetrical accretion of lithosphere [ e.g. , Escart\\u00edn et al . , 2008 ] as envisioned in early models of seafloor spreading . The second mode is related to the formation of detachment faults [ Cann et al . , 1997 ; Smith et al . , 2006 ; Escart\\u00edn et al . , 2008 ; Reston and Ranero , 2011 ] . The formation of oceanic detachment faults and associated oceanic core complexes ( OCC ) is well established from inactive , corrugated fault planes exposed on sea floor formed along slow and ultraslow spreading centers and can accommodate extension for up to 1 - 3 Myr [ e.g. , Tucholke et al . , 1998 ; Baines et al . , 2008 ] . This complex accretion process may give rise to poorly developed and sometimes discontinuous spreading anomalies when compared to fast - spreading ridges [ e.g. , Vogt , 1986 ] . [ 4 ] Detailed magnetic surveys of the Mid - Atlantic Ridge ( MAR ) [ e.g. , Tivey and Tucholke , 1998 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2003 ] suggested , however , that accretion is still confined to the median valley . Local seismicity surveys generally support this view , indicating that seismicity is generally concentrated along the ridge axis [ Kong et al . , 1992 ; Wolfe et al . , 1995 ; Barclay et al . , 2001 ] and hence roughly mimic the neovolcanic zone , though some activity occurs at the flanking rift mountains [ Toomey et al . , 1988 ; Kong et al . , 1992 ; Tilmann et al . , 2004 ; Collins et al . , 2012 ] . In addition , some of the local networks suggested that near - oceanic core complexes we may expect tectonic activity at and below OCCs [ Wolfe et al . , 1995 ; Barclay et al . , 2001 ; Collins et al . , 2012 ] . Monitoring the regional seismicity of the Mid - Atlantic Ridge using autonomous hydrophone arrays [ Smith et al . , 2003 ; Simao et al . , 2010 ] indicated that there is an excellent correlation between the mode of accretion and the seismicity along the ridge axis [ Escart\\u00edn et al . , 2008 ; Simao et al . , 2010 ] . The concentration of seismicity at segments shown to have active detachment faults , such as the Logachev massif south of the Fifteen - Twenty transform fault , is hence suggested to be a general feature [ Escart\\u00edn et al . , 2008 ] . , 2007 ] and the second survey at the Atlantis Massif [ Collins et al . , 2012 ] . At the TAG field , microseismicity indicates that the detachment fault is indeed seismically very active , and suggests that the fault is rooted in the neovolcanic zone near the center of the median valley . The survey at the Atlantis Massif supported the observation that seismicity occurred predominantly in the median valley , however , some minor activity was located below the core complex . Neither of the experiments revealed profound seismicity emerging at the core complex itself as detected in hydoacoustical catalogues [ Smith et al . , 2003 ; Escart\\u00edn et al . , 2008 ; Simao et al . , 2010 ] . The complexity of conversion of seismic energy into T wave energy and the rough topography of slow - spreading ridges make it difficult to directly estimate the earthquake source location [ Williams et al . , 2006 ] , although some activity observed by hydrophone arrays may suggest that seismic activity is indeed shifted away from the center of the median valley [ Simao et al . , 2010 ] , occurring at the flanking rift mountains . However , much tighter error bounds for event detection are needed to better understand the relationship between lithospheric formation , tectonism , and earthquake occurrence . All three survey areas included oceanic core complexes or inside corner highs identified in bathymetric data . Tectonic Setting . [ 8 ] The Ascension fracture zone at 7 \\u00b0 S to the northeast of Ascension Island consists of a double transform with an intervening 20 km long spreading segment ( Figure 1 ) ; we call this segment the Ascension intratransform segment . Dredging during R / V Meteor cruise M41 confirmed this idea by providing serpentinized peridotites and gabbroic rocks ( C. Devey , personal communication , 2004 ) . Immediately to the south of the Ascension fracture zone in segment A1 [ Bruguier et al . At the intersection between segment A1 and the transform fault , a blocky inside corner massif is present . Dredge samples provided gabbroic rocks from the flank of the inside corner high that faces the median valley ( C. Devey , personal communication , 2004 ) . Dredging further south along the median valley provided exclusively basaltic samples . Figure 1 . Deployments 1 and 2 : ( a ) Morphology at the Mid - Atlantic Ridge in the vicinity of the Ascension double transform fault [ Brozena and White , 1990 ; Minshull et al . The site is roughly 8 km off axis and 1000 m shallower then the median valley , occurring in the segment S2 named by Fujiwara et al . [ 2003 ] . Studies of vent fluids [ Bogdanov et al . , 1997 ] and alteration of rocks from the Logatchev massif [ Augustin et al . , 2012 ; Petersen et al . , 2009 ] indicated that the Logatchev vents are located in a serpentinite hosted setting . Bathymetric mapping and dredging supported the idea that the hydrothermal activity is related to core complex formation [ Escartin and Cannat , 1999 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2003 ] . Site 1270 drilled during the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program ( IODP ) leg 209 corroborated these facts by recovering gabbros and mantle rocks from the massif [ Shipboard Scientific Party , 2004 ] . Figure 2 . Logatchev high - temperature vent field is marked by white diamond . Two deployments were conducted in the area that overlapped in time . The first deployment had three broadband OBS ( labeled b1 , b2 , and b4 ) , the second 11 short - period OBS ( labeled 01 to 12 ) .

Labels and symbols as in Figure 2 . Seismological Data . Area-1 : Ascension Deployments . [ 10 ] Two of the deployments reported here were made in the vicinity of the Ascension transform fault . In the Ascension intratransform segment , deployment 1 had 11 ocean bottom hydrophones ( OBH ) and one three - component 4.5 Hz seismometer ( OBS ) . Instruments were deployed over a short time period of 13 days in October 2004 . Unfortunately , two stations near the northwestern rift valley bounding fault failed to record any data . [ 11 ] The deployment 2 was to the south of the Ascension transform fault and was primarily deployed for a wide - angle survey and then left on the seafloor to detect local seismicity . In total , 18 OBH and OBS were deployed over a time period of 6 weeks in October and November 2004 . The array consisted of two profiles running roughly along the western and eastern bounding faults of the median valley . The network suffered from three stations that failed to record any data and also the northwestern - most station failed after a few days . Further , instrument spacing was in the order of 10 km and hence station separation was about twice as large as chosen for deployment 1 ( Figure 1 c ) . Area-2 : Logatchev Deployment . [ 12 ] In the vicinity of the Logatchev hydrothermal vent field we had two deployments that overlapped in time ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . The first deployment was a small array of four broadband OBS that were operated between 16 December 2007 and 2 February 2009 . Each OBS operated a three - component Guralp CMG-40 T seismometer and a HighTech HTI-04-PCA / ULF hydrophone . Unfortunately , one of the OBS was lost . The second deployment consisted of 12 OBS deployed between 16 and 21 January 2009 and instruments were recovered on 25 and 26 March 2009 . The second deployment operated hydrophones and three - component short - period seismometers with a natural frequency of 4.5 Hz . One OBS failed to record any data . Here , we will report results from all OBS available at the seabed after 16 January 2009 . Data quality is excellent , providing clear P - and S -onsets on most stations ( Figure 4 ) . Figure 4 . Methods . Event Detection and Localization . [ 13 ] To detect automatically seismic events in the continuous records a short - term - average versus a long - term - average ( STA / LTA ) trigger algorithm was applied . We used a STA window of 0.5 s and a LTA window of 60 s. The trigger ratio was 4.0 and the detrigger ratio was 2.5 . The trigger parameters were applied to unfiltered vertical component data . For the deployments in the vicinity of the Ascension transform , where only a few OBS were available , we used instead good quality hydrophone channels . We consider a trigger to be an earthquake when it was detected on more than five stations for deployments 1 and 2 . For the Logatchev deployment , a trigger had to occur on at least eight OBS . For event detection , we extracted a 3 min long time window from the continuous data , starting 20 s prior to trigger time . Events were registered into a SEISAN database [ Havskov and Ottem\\u00f6ller , 2000 ] and P wave and S wave arrival times were hand - picked . [ 14 ] Earthquakes were located with the program HYPOCENTER , which employs an iterative solution to the nonlinear localization problem [ Lienert et al . , 1986 ; Lienert and Havskov , 1995 ] . To compensate effects caused by differences in elevation and shallow velocity structure station corrections were introduced . Travel times were calculated using a 1-D velocity model . Unfortunately , no seismic refraction work was conducted in the areas . We therefore based our model on constraints from work previously conducted along slow - spreading ridges [ e.g. , Canales et al . , 2000 ; Minshull et al . , 2006 ; Dannowski et al . , 2010 , 2011 ] . However , overall the velocity structure of zero - aged crust is reasonably similar , with a high - gradient upper crustal velocity structure and a low gradient lower crust . Velocities in the upper crust ( layer 2 ) increase rapidly from 2.5 - 3 km / s to 6.2 - 6.7 km / s at 1.5 - 2 km depth , while velocity in the lower crust ( layer 3 ) remains with 6.8 - 7.0 km / s almost constant . Major changes , however , may occur in the thickness of the lower crust . We therefore surveyed a number of models with crustal thickness varying from 3 to 7 km . Overall , changes in crustal thickness had only a small effect on both epicentral location and depth , indicating a trade - off between origin time and crustal thickness . Thus , using a thicker crust resulted in an earlier origin time , while a thinner crust caused later origin times . The depth of the earthquakes , however , changed very little and most earthquakes occurred at 3 - 6 km below seafloor , a feature that has been previously observed for most microearthquake surveys at the Mid - Atlantic Ridge [ e.g. , Toomey et al . , 1988 ; Kong et al . , 1992 ; Wolfe et al . , 1995 ; Barclay et al . , 2001 ] . Interpretation of the data , however , would be different ; thus , for the case of a thinner crust earthquakes would occur predominantly in the mantle and in thicker crust events would tend to occur in the crust . The crustal thickness of the preferred models was hence constrained by gravity data , indicating 6 km of crust for the segments in the vicinity of the Ascension fracture zone [ Minshull et al . , 2003 ] and 5 km for the crust in the vicinity of the Logatchev vent field [ Fujiwara et al . , 2003 ] . For interpretation , we used the gravity - based estimates of crustal thickness . [ 15 ] A shortcoming of using a 1-D velocity model is , of course , that 2-D and 3-D effects are not accounted for . Such structural variability has been reported for a number of core complexes [ e.g. , deMartin et al . , 2007 ; Dannowski et al . , 2010 ] . However , most detected events occurred in the median valley and below the flanking bounding fault . Thus , a 1-D model provides a reasonable approximation . [ 16 ] The S wave velocity structure of oceanic crust is much less well constrained than the P wave velocity . We tested a number of different Vp / Vs ratios ranging from 1.75 to 2.0 . For events located within the network , most changes were much smaller than the 95 % error estimates . For earthquakes outside of the network , however , smaller Vp / Vs ratios shifted the events farther and larger rations closer to the network . Changes , however , were generally smaller than 5 km . [ 17 ] To further constrain the Vp / Vs ratio , we reviewed previous surveys on the structure of crust formed at the Mid - Atlantic Ridge . Dannowski et al . [ 2011 ] provided the only seismic refraction and wide - angle survey that observed converted S waves in an active source seismic experiment at the Mid - Atlantic Ridge and report Vp / Vs ratios in the order of 1.7 - 1.9 . Geophysical measurements during Ocean Drilling Program ( ODP ) leg 102 at Deep Sea Drilling Project ( DSDP ) hole 418A yielded in the upper basaltic crust Vp / Vs ratios of 1.89 and 1.84 from downhole logging and laboratory measurements at 0.1 kbar , respectively [ Salisbury et al . , 1988 ] . Gabbros were drilled at the Atlantis Bank , South West Indian Ridge , and in the MARK area at the Mid - Atlantic Ridge . Laboratory studies at confining pressure yielded for gabbros from the Atlantic Bank in the hole 735B Vp / Vs ratios of 1.75 to 1.83 [ Iturrino et al . , 1991 ] , averaging 1.78 . For the MARK area , observed Vp / Vs ratios range from 1.76 to 1.87 , averaging 1.83 [ Miller and Christensen , 1997 ] . Drilling in the MARK area also provided serpentinized mantle with Vp / Vs ratios ranging from 1.8 to 2.2 [ Miller and Christensen , 1997 ] . Based on these estimates , we used an average Vp / Vs ratio of 1.84 for locating events outside of the network . For events within the network , we used Wadati diagrams ( S - P time versus P time ) and calculated an average Vp / Vs ratio [ Havskov and Ottem\\u00f6ller , 2000 ] . The resulting Vp / Vs ratio was 1.79 . Location Uncertainties and Errors . [ 18 ] The uncertainty of a hypocenter is related to a number of features , including picking uncertainty , number of stations , number of P and S wave onsets , and station spacing . For most onsets , picking uncertainty was in the order of 10 - 40 ms for P onsets and 20 - 60 ms for S onsets . In practice , however , errors for the well - located events were much smaller . The average error for event location depended on the network layout and performance and ranged for ERH from 7 to 2 km and for erz from 6 to 3 km . Table 1 indicates the characteristic values of all three networks . Table 1 . Performance and Statistical Errors for All Three Deployments a . Magnitudes . [ 19 ] We defined magnitudes based on the classical approach of Richter [ 1935 ] and used local magnitude or M L . In order to use the M L scale with other instruments than the Wood - Anderson seismometer , the common practice is to generate a displacement trace in the frequency band 1.25 - 20 Hz and measure the maximum amplitude . [ 20 ] Kanamori [ 1983 ] showed that for magnitudes of 4 - 6 M L and M W are in good agreement . This observation has been explained by the response of the Wood Anderson instrument . For small events , which have high frequencies , the signal measured is pure displacement and it is therefore expected to be linearly proportional to M 0 . For larger events with significant energy below 1.25 Hz , the maximum amplitude will be more proportional to velocity and therefore closer to the response of the traditional velocity sensors . Source Parameters . [ 21 ] First motion P wave polarities are commonly used to determine double - couple focal mechanisms for marine microearthquake studies . Fault plane solutions were derived using the HASH and FOCMEC algorithms [ Hardebeck and Shearer , 2002 ; Snoke et al . , 1984 ] . We report only those mechanisms where both approaches provided reasonable similar solutions . Results . Rate of Seismicity and Detection Threshold . The deployment in the vicinity of the Logatchev Massif provided with 1618 earthquakes , the largest number of events . Thus , for the 67 day period we could locate on average 24 earthquakes per day on 11 - 14 OBS deployed in a network of 18 km by 18 km in size . For the Logatchev deployment , OBS spacing was variable , ranging from 5 to 10 km . Individual OBS , however , provided much higher seismicity rates based on the STA / LTA triggers and visual inspection of stations with high rates . Thus , some OBS provided 100 or more triggers , suggesting that seismicity varies profoundly on a small spatial scale . Similar features were reported from previous deployments at the Mid - Atlantic Ridge [ e.g. , Kong et al . , 1992 ; Wolfe et al . , 1995 ] . [ 23 ] The detection threshold was quite variable between the different deployments , depending on stations ' spacing and local tectonics . For the two deployments in the vicinity of the Ascension transform fault , we used the spectra to assess magnitudes from hydrophone recordings . Fortunately , for the Logatchev deployment , we had short - period and broadband seismometers with known sensor responses and hence used local magnitude M L . Deployment 1 recorded much smaller earthquakes . We therefore had difficulties identifying corner frequencies in the 100 Hz data . This feature might be related to the ambient noise that increases at lower frequencies in the ocean . Thus , for small events the ambient ocean noise dominated the wavefield sampled with the CMG-40 T and the dynamic range of the recording unit was too small for obtaining high - quality recordings of weak P onsets . However , S wave energy was generally detected . Therefore , the restriction of the bandwidth for the short - period sensors nurtured sampling small magnitude events . Distribution of Microseismicity . [ 25 ] The two deployments in area-1 provided reasonable similar pattern . Deployment 1 in the Ascension intratransform segment indicated that seismicity was primarily focused along the center of the median valley and hence at the deepest portion of the rift ( Figure 1 b ) . At the northern end of the segment , however , a well - defined inside corner high occurred . Some of the well - located microearthquake clustered at the inside corner high next to the active transform fault . [ 26 ] To the south of the Ascension transform fault , most earthquakes occurred along the center of the valley . Perhaps suffering from instrument failure , we did not detect any seismicity at the inside corner high . Except for a single cluster of activity to the west of OBS64 near 7.875 \\u00b0 S , seismicity to the south of 7.8 \\u00b0 S coincided with the axial volcanic ridge ( Figure 1 c ) . To the north and south of the Logatchev Massif core complex seismicity showed the expected pattern and clustered along the center of the median valley . At the core complex between 14.7 \\u00b0 N and 14.8 \\u00b0 N , however , seismicity was clearly shifted away from the center of median valley and deepest portion of the rift valley and occurred westward of the Logatchev hydrothermal vent field at the walls of the inner valley . Figure 5 . Zero marks the location of the ridge axis . Events \\u00b15 km off of the profiles were projected . Blue inverted triangle marks the location of the high - temperature Logatchev vent field . [ 28 ] Side - scan sonar data can be used to assess recent magmatic activity at mid - ocean ridges [ e.g. , Mitchell , 1991 ] with high reflectivity regions representing seafloor that has experienced magmatism and low backscatter regions representing older seafloor covered with sediment . Backscatter images from swath - mapping bathymetric data can be used as first - order approximation of the backscatter intensity of the seabed . For the Logatchev area , backscatter data from the Kongsberg EM120 swath - mapping system operated during the cruise MSM10/3 of the R / V Maria S. Merian were available . High backscatter occurred within the median valley inward of the bounding faults ( Figure 3 ) . Basically , all earthquakes recorded with our network occurred within the area of high backscatter . Thus , major seismicity occurred within \\u00b18 km of the ridge axis and hence within an area of magmatic activity in the recent past . Distribution of Large Teleseismic Earthquakes . [ 29 ] During the time of operation of the network in the vicinity of the Logatchev Massif , we observed four earthquakes that were also detected by global seismic stations and reported by the International Seismological Centre ( ISC ) and the US Geological Survey ( USGS ) . Even though the events did not occur within the network , they ruptured the rift valley within 10 - 20 km off the network . At such small offsets , the network provided a good longitudinal coverage so that the location within the median valley could be well constrained . In north - south direction , as discussed above while surveying Vp / Vs ratios , we may bias the location by approximately 5 km . The first two earthquakes , which occurred on 30 December 2008 at 14:57 and on 16 January 2009 at 22:14 , respectively , were just recorded at the three broadband OBS . Two additional earthquakes were detected on 24 March 2009 at 11:56 and 12:34 and were recorded at 11 OBS just a day before recovering the network . To reduce the unknown parameters , we fixed the depth to 6 km for events occurring outside of the network . To further constrain the locations of the mainshocks , we identified a number of aftershocks following the mainshock within a few hours . All aftershocks occurred near the mainshock ( Figures 2 and 3 ) and hence support location estimates . The other earthquakes generally showed a similar shift in northeast direction , but the deviation was generally in the order of 5 - 7 km ( Figure 2 ) . Except for the 30 December earthquake , the USGS reported events occurred outside of the 95 % confidence error ellipsoid . [ 30 ] The 30 December 2008 earthquake occurred just 10 km to the north of the northernmost seismometer . After deployment of the second network in mid - January , we recorded a wealth of seismic activity from the epicentral region of the mainshock ( Figures 2 and 3 ) supporting an area of intense seismic activity . The other three globally detected events occurred to the south of the network , roughly 15 - 20 km from the northernmost OBS . Interestingly , all four earthquakes occurred in the deepest portion of the median valley . Frequency - Size Distribution of Earthquakes . [ 31 ] Previous deployments at the MAR indicated that the frequency - size distribution of earthquakes provided information on the mode of spreading and can be used to discriminate between settings dominated by amagmatic extension and more recent volcanic activity [ e.g. , Kong et al . , 1992 ] . Only the network in area-2 , and hence in the vicinity of the Logatchev Massif core complex , provided the required number of earthquakes to provide robust statistical estimates . With 10 - 30 events located per day ( Figure 6 ) , the network provided in the order of 1400 high - quality magnitude estimates . Figure 6 . Deployment 3-Logatchev Massif : cumulative number of earthquakes detected by the network in the vicinity of the Logatchev Massif . At Julian day 70 , activity dropped significantly . Figure 7 .

Figure 8 . Focal Mechanisms . [ 32 ] We report a number of well - constrained focal mechanisms using first motion polarities . Figure 9 . ( a ) Seismograms indicating first motions color coded by polarity ; ( b ) focal mechanism . [ 33 ] In the beginning of the deployment in January 2009 we observed 10 events per day and normal faulting dominated ( Figures 6 and 10 a ) . In the second week of February pattern changed and reverse faulting dominated ( Figure 10 b ) . In March , between Julian days 65 and 70 , both the number of reverse faulting earthquakes and the total number of event decreased ( Figures 6 and 10 c ) . Figure 10 .

[ 34 ] At the Ascension intratransform segment earthquakes occurred at 4 - 6 km below seafloor , with the majority of events occurring at 4.5 - 5.5 km depth . The averaging depth of the 95 well - located events was 5.05 km ( Table 1 ) . Based on mantle bouguer anomalies ( MBA ) , Minshull et al . [ 2003 ] found a crustal thickness of 6 km for the area to the south of the Ascension fracture zone . For the short segment itself crustal thickness might be lower . Considering a crustal thickness of 5 km earthquakes would occur in the lower crust and upper mantle . The majority of events would hence cluster at the crust / mantle boundary . [ 35 ] The segment to the south of the Ascension transform has a crustal thickness of approximately 6 km [ Minshull et al . , 2003 ] . Here , only 35 earthquakes were located well enough to provide reasonable good depth constraints . Most earthquakes are much shallower than at the segment to the north . Events occurred at 2 - 4 km depth below seafloor and hence within the crust . [ 36 ] At the Logatchev Massif gravity data constrained a crustal thickness in the order of 5 km [ Fujiwara et al . , 2003 ] . However , some earthquakes were located at mantle depth and there seems to be a tendency of earthquakes occurring at greater depth in the northern portion of the network ( Figure 11 ) . Figure 11 . Locations are indicated in Figure 2 . We projected events \\u00b13 km off of the profiles . Black dots indicate earthquakes with reverse faulting , green dots with normal faulting behavior . Red dots correspond to events with unresolved mechanism . Dotted blue line indicates the datum , solid blue line is the crust / mantle boundary from gravity [ Fujiwara et al . , 2003 ] . Black inverted triangle mark the location of the high - temperature Logatchev vent field . Pillow volcano was described by Petersen et al . [ 2009 ] . Time Evolution of Seismicity . [ 37 ] Microseismicity is generally highly variable in space and time and controlled by tectonic stresses caused by global plate motion , stresses caused by the emplacement of dykes and intrusions , and thermal cooling and contraction . The network deployed at the Logatchev Massif had the longest deployment period and is hence the only one that captured significant changes in time . Within the network , spatial pattern remained reasonable constant ( Figure 10 ) . In mid - February , the rate was with up to 30 events per day highest , dropping below 10 earthquakes per day in March between Julian day 65 to 70 ( Figure 6 ) . The pattern generally did not correlate with mainshock - aftershock sequences . In addition , seismicity occurred at faults bounding the inner valley . This pattern was most evident in January and March . At least in January , a third fault seemed to be active at the dome to the southeast of OBS05 . Thus , different faults seemed to be active at the same time . [ 39 ] Seismic activity to the south of the network mimicked the activity just discussed . Between 14.7 \\u00b0 N and 14.55 \\u00b0 N seismicity occurred predominantly along the central neovolcanic zone , roughly running along the 45 \\u00b0 W meridian . In addition , seismicity was observed to the west in the deepest portion of the median valley next to the western bounding fault ( Figure 10 ) . Seismicity further south had too large errors to be conclusive . However , on 24 March a major swarm of seismicity occurred just south to 14.5 \\u00b0 N , including two teleseismically detected earthquakes . This sequence provided clear mainshock - aftershock pattern . Aftershocks , however , are not well resolved as the network was recovered hours after the first shock hit at 11:56 UTC . Seismicity rapidly decayed after three days . Discussion . Distribution of Microseismicity . , 1988 ; Wolfe et al . , 1995 ; Barclay et al . , 2001 ; Tilmann et al . , 2004 ] , leaving the flanking rift mountains seismically inactive . For the network in the Ascension intratransform segment earthquakes tended to occur near the center of the rift valley ( Figure 1 b ) . Further , some events occurred at the northeastern inside corner of the spreading segment . A similar pattern was observed at the southern Mid - Atlantic Ridge near 5 \\u00b0 S [ Tilmann et al . , 2004 ] and at the Atlantis Massif [ Collins et al . , 2012 ] , suggesting that inside corner settings suffer from tectonic or flexural stresses off axis . However , the southwestern inside corner of the same spreading segment remained largely inactive . [ 41 ] At the segment to the south of the Ascension transform seismicity occurred mainly along the center of the median valley and hence zone of recent magmatic activity and thus may indicate either dyke emplacement or thermal cooling after a magmatic event . However , the lack of seismic swarms may suggest that events reflect spreading on axial valley faults rather than indicating magmatism . Interestingly , we observed a \\u00b115 km wide gap of seismicity centered at 7.8 \\u00b0 S. This gap occurred where the seabed was inflated and where the off - axis hotspot island Ascension occurs . It has been reported elsewhere that off - axis hotspots may channel material toward the ridge axis [ e.g. , Ito et al . , 2003 ; Grevemeyer , 1996 ] , causing excess magmatism at the adjacent ridge crest . At the Mid - Atlantic Ridge near 22 \\u00b0 N such an inflated and magmatically robust ridge segment showed a profound gap in the seismicity derived from autonomous hydrophones operated in the SOFAR channel [ Smith et al . , 2003 ; Escart\\u00edn et al . , 2008 ; Dannowski et al . , 2011 ] . The low level of seismicity along this segment has been confirmed by a microseismic study [ Kahle , 2007 ] , suggesting that segments of excessive magmatism are characterized by thick crust and thin lithosphere [ Cannat , 1996 ] . Such segments may behave like fast - spreading ridges and hence may not be able to generate large normal faulting events . [ 42 ] The most interesting distribution of seismicity was observed in the vicinity of the Logatchev Massif ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Geophysical and petrological data indicated that the massif , that hosts the Logatchev vent fields [ e.g. , Petersen et al . , 2009 ] , is related to core complex formation [ Escartin and Cannat , 1999 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2003 ] . Seismic activity in the vicinity of the massif is clearly shifted away from the inner median valley toward the eastern flanking rift mountains . In general , the location of the ridge axis at the deepest portion of the median valley is supported by magnetic data , providing a well - defined magnetic high [ Fujiwara et al . , 2003 ] . However , in the southern portion of the segment S2 next to the Logatchev vent field magnetic pattern are less well defined [ Fujiwara et al . , 2003 ] , though . Further away from the proposed core complex seismicity clustered again in the vicinity of the center of inner median valley ( Figures 3 and 5 ) , suggesting that the observed seismicity pattern at the OCC are a local phenomenon rather indicating an eastward deviation of the spreading axis . The Logatchev hydrothermal vent field occurs just eastward of the zone of major seismicity , suggesting a relationship between the occurrence of faulting , microearthquakes , and hydrothermal venting . , 2003 ] was asymmetric with a faster rate toward the east . The degree of asymmetry reported by Fujiwara et al . [ 2003 ] was rather small , with 12.2 \\u00b1 0.5 km / Ma toward the east and 12.8 \\u00b1 0.6 km / Ma toward the west . , 2008 ] . For the Atlantis Massif Collins et al . [ 2012 ] found that seismicity showed the tendency to occur near the western bounding fault , but still predominantly within the inner median valley . Seismicity for the Logatchev segment S2 , however , is clearly asymmetric , supporting the idea that the plate boundary fault is currently shifted eastward , suggesting that asymmetric spreading and asymmetric distribution of seismicity are not necessarily correlated with each other . [ 44 ] Monitoring of the seismicity at the Mid - Atlantic Ridge using autonomous hydrophone arrays suggested that core complexes and inside corner highs are seismically more active than segment centers [ Escart\\u00edn et al . , 2008 ] . , 1995 ] rather than at the center of the median valley . However , these earthquakes occurred outside of the networks and hence had large location errors . , 2007 ] , where most seismicity was rooted in the neovolcanic zone and hence in the inner median valley . A second survey was conducted at the Atlantis Massif ; major seismicity occurred within the median valley . However , some activity occurred within the core complex and focal mechanism suggested both normal faulting and strike - slip faulting [ Collins et al . , 2012 ] , indicating that the massif suffers from some tectonic stresses after it was rafted off axis . , 2006 ; Collins et al . , 2012 ] . For the area in the vicinity of the Logatchev vent field seismicity based on hydrophones moored in the SOFAR channel occurred predominantly at the massif to the east of the main vent site [ Escart\\u00edn et al . , 2008 ] . Thus , hydroacoustically detected seismicity was , with respect to the seismicity located with our local network , offset toward higher topography . We thus observed features similar to those reported by Collins et al . [ 2012 ] . This may either indicate that hydrophone - recorded data might be biased , indicating an offset between the epicenter and the T - wave entry point into the SOFAR channel , as suggested by Williams et al . [ 2006 ] , or different pattern might be related to time - space evolution of seismicity . In any case , the microearthquake survey at the Logatchev Massif is one of the first studies outlining that major tectonic activity and faulting is active at the flanking rift mountains in the vicinity of a core complex . Previously , deMartin et al . [ 2007 ] reported antithetic normal faulting to the east of the TAG vent field . Distribution of Large Teleseismic Earthquakes . [ 45 ] The four teleseismic earthquakes recorded at our network during operation all occurred within the inner median valley of the MAR . Similar features were observed before at other spreading segments . Kong et al . At the Mid - Atlantic Ridge near 30 \\u00b0 N , Collins et al . [ 2012 ] detected with their network two large mainshock - aftershock sequences that included five teleseismic earthquakes . The mainshock and aftershocks occurred on the western side of the median valley and close to the intersection of an adjacent transform fault . However , they occurred within the median valley and not under the flanking rift mountains . To constrain the epicentral region , water column reverberations occurring in the waveform data were used . To fit the reverberations these large earthquakes had to occur beneath the relatively deep inner floor of the median valley rather than beneath the shallower rift mountains [ e.g. , Huang et al . , 1986 ; Huang and Solomon , 1988 ] . Along with the microseismicity constrained by the networks it seems reasonable to suggest that all major seismicity at slow - spreading ridges occurs within the median valley and perhaps at the first bounding fault on either side of the rift valley . However , older faults seem to be largely inactive . Frequency - Size Distribution of Earthquakes . [ 47 ] An interesting feature of seismicity was the observation that the number of magnitude 2 - 3 earthquakes seem to increase away from the Logatchev Massif core complex ( Figure 7 ) . It might be reasonably to hypothesize that this feature is related to tectonics of the core complex . The Logatchev field vent fluids [ Bogdanov et al . , 1997 ] and alteration of rocks [ Augustin et al . , 2012 ] indicate that the Logatchev field occurs in a serpentinite hosted setting . Serpentinites provide low friction coefficients [ Escart\\u00edn et al . , 1997 ] and hence might support frequent and small earthquakes that release only small amounts of stress . In stronger rocks , larger stresses can be accumulated and larger earthquakes occur . The size distribution may therefore be used to discriminate between strong and weak faults . In the trench - outer rise area off Nicaragua bending - related faulting promoted mantle serpentinization [ Grevemeyer et al . , 2007 ; Ivandic et al . , 2008 ] . The b value for the area not yet affect by serpentinization was in the order of 0.7 while the area affected by serpentinization provided a b value of 2.7 [ Lefeldt et al . , 2009 ] . The asymmetric distributed seismicity in the vicinity of the Logatchev Massif indicated a b value of 0.9 ( Figure 8 ) , while the symmetric seismicity focusing at the center of the median valley provided and a b value of 1.2 . Thus , b values do not support serpentinization . In contrast , both estimates range within the values reported for the MAR [ e.g. , Kong et al . , 1992 ] . To survey the distribution of teleseismically recorded earthquakes we used EHB relocated earthquakes [ Engdahl et al . , 1998 ; International Seismological Centre , 2009 ] , providing relocations of globally recorded seismic events using corrections accounting for three - dimensional inhomogeneity 's of Earth 's structure . Thus , only one of the 27 events hitting the area occurred in the vicinity of the Logatchev core complex but most events clearly occurred to its south and north . This feature is consistent with the observation that mainshock - aftershock sequences reported in hydroacoustic catalogues yielded faster decay rates for asymmetric segments with detachment faults , while normal faulting mainshock - aftershock sequences at symmetric spreading segments yielded slower decay rates [ Simao et al . , 2010 ] . This dependence was suggested to be controlled by the weak rheology of detachment faults relative to the rheology found at segments supporting symmetric and more magmatic spreading [ Simao et al . , 2010 ] . On the other hand lithosphere might be rather thin . Observations indicated that high - temperature fluids of the Logatchev vents require some magma somewhere in the system , most probably directly below the vent field . The heat source may locally thin the brittle layer and restrict the earthquakes to the shallowest crust . [ 49 ] At the TAG segment near 26 \\u00b0 N Kong et al . [ 1992 ] found higher b values of 1.1 - 1.5 near the segment center and lower values of 0.6 - 0.9 near the tectonically dominated segment ends . Higher b values indicate a larger proportion of smaller earthquakes and are a characteristic feature of magmatically active regions where b as a function of M 0 often exceeds the global average of 0.7 by a factor of 2 [ e.g. , Wyss et al . , 1997 ] . Our b value of 0.9 therefore supports a setting governed by tectonics and cooling stresses rather than active magma injection . This conclusion is in agreement with results of Tilmann et al . [ 2004 ] at the MAR near 5 \\u00b0 S , where they reported a b value of 0.8 for a tectonically dominated setting . The b value of 1.2 occurring to the northwest of the Logatchev Massif agrees with values reported for segment centers elsewhere [ Kong et al . , 1992 ] . Rubin and Pollard [ 1988 ] suggested for Iceland and Afar that dyke emplacement within the median valley may trigger normal faulting at the adjacent bounding faults . Therefore , the observed pattern , including activity within the center of the median valley and at the adjacent off - axis bounding faults , may indicate dyke emplacement . For the clustered activity in the median valley we obtained a magnitude of completeness of 1.9 and a b value of 1.2 ( Figure 8 ) . However , based on b value mapping elsewhere , magmatically active setting are expected to be characterized by much larger b values [ e.g. , Wyss et al . , 1997 ] . We are therefore confident that the seismic activity is related to tectonic stresses rather than magmatism . , 1994 ] , causing activity at nearby faults following the mainshock . Focal Mechanisms . Normal faulting is a well - understood and described process and is clearly documented by teleseismic earthquakes [ e.g. , Huang et al . , 1986 ; Huang and Solomon , 1988 ] and local microseismicity surveys at the Mid - Atlantic Ridge [ e.g. , Kong et al . , 1992 ; Barclay et al . , 2001 ] . In addition , local seismicity surveys reported compressional earthquakes and hence reverse faulting unknown from the global record [ e.g. , Kong et al . , 1992 ; Wolfe et al . , 1995 ] . The compressional events were interpreted to be related to along axis variations of thermal stresses caused by cooling . For the Mid - Atlantic Ridge at 26 \\u00b0 N , Kong et al . Overall , features reported by Kong et al . [ 1992 ] are similar to our observations . [ 52 ] In addition to the thermal cooling stresses envisioned by Kong et al . [ 1992 ] and Wolfe et al . [ 1995 ] , dyke emplacement may cause reverse faulting . In Iceland , microearthquakes outlined a progressive melt intrusion of a dyke moving upward [ White et al . , 2011 ] . Moment tensors indicated double - couple failure , with fault mechanisms sometimes flipping between normal and reverse faulting . However , in our data we neither observed clear migration pattern in the well - located seismicity nor flipping of sense of faulting within minutes . [ 53 ] Subsidence after drainage of a magma reservoir is another mechanism that may cause reverse faulting . To explain compressional focal mechanisms from the Bardarbubga volcano in Iceland , Nettles and Ekstr\\u00f6m [ 1998 ] suggested that deflation of a magma chamber increased horizontal compression , so that the roof block above the magma chamber subsided with respect to the surrounding rock . [ 54 ] At the Juan de Fuca Ridge , a large number of thrust faulting earthquakes have been linked to the presence of a crustal magma chamber . Earthquake focal mechanisms , however , revealed a transition from normal faulting above the crustal magma reservoir to reverse faulting on either flank [ Wilcock et al . , 2009 ] . In contrast , at the Logatchev Massif we did not observe any pattern that may resemble the distribution of focal mechanisms caused by stresses related to emplacement of pressurized magma as modeled by Wilcock et al . [ 2009 ] . [ 55 ] Dredging of the Logatchev Massif and drilling results from IODP leg 209 at site 1270 support that the domal high is largely composed of mantle rocks [ Shipboard Scientific Party , 2004 ; Petersen et al . , 2009 ] . Thus , serpentinization might be an alternative mechanism causing reverse faulting , because it is an exothermic reaction that is accompanied by volume expansion . Consequently , serpentinization may cause compression and hence reverse faulting at the edge of the expanding zone . [ 56 ] In a cross section through the band of seismicity to the west of the Logatchev Massif ( Figure 11 ) , microearthquakes are rather randomly distributed and did not support clear fault structures . Random pattern of seismicity would support both cooling of an intrusive body by hydrothermal circulation in a highly fractured media and volume expansion by serpentinization . In addition to reverse faulting , Kong et al . [ 1992 ] reported a diversity of focal mechanisms favoring cooling , while our data basically showed two dominating mechanisms : shallow normal faulting and reverse faulting at greater depth . Thus , virtually all normal faulting events occurred at a depth of 1.5 - 4 km below datum , while all compressional events ruptured at 3.5 - 5.5 km below datum . Further , reverse faulting earthquakes are larger than the normal faulting event . Thus , shallow normal faulting might be a response to volume expansion at depth . We suggest that volume expansion rather than cooling controls the seismicity pattern of the Logatchev Massif . [ 57 ] In addition to the random pattern of seismicity , normal faulting earthquakes near the Logatchev hydrothermal vent field showed common features , including faults dipping at 50 - 60 \\u00b0 . Thus , focal mechanisms do not support any shallow dipping detachment . However , overall seismicity patterns have to be interpreted carefully as 95 % confidence intervals translate to errors of \\u00b10.5 - 2 km in profile direction and \\u00b11 - 2 km in depth . Depth Distribution of Microearthquakes . [ 58 ] Microearthquakes at the Mid - Atlantic Ridge generally do not occur right below the seabed but 2 - 3 km deeper . In most cases , earthquakes occurred at depth ranges of 2 - 7 km below the seafloor and the majority of earthquakes ruptured within the lower crust [ Toomey et al . , 1988 ; Wolfe et al . , 1995 ; Collins et al . , 2012 ] . These observations from previous studies are supported by our observations , revealing that most microearthquakes occur at 3 - 6 km depth . At magmatically robust settings , however , microearthquakes occurred at shallower depth . Barclay et al . [ 2001 ] reported results from an experiment at a dome - like high near 35 \\u00b0 N at the MAR and found that seismicity clustered at 3 - 4 km depth . Thus , it seems to be that morphology can be used as first - order approximation , constraining the thermal state of a ridge segment . [ 59 ] In contrast , Tilmann et al . [ 2004 ] found that seismicity at 5 \\u00b0 S of the MAR , where an inside corner high has been rifted apart [ Reston et al . , 2002 ] , occurred in the lower crust and predominantly within the uppermost mantle at a depth of 5 - 8 km below seafloor in lithosphere with a crustal thickness of 3 - 4 km . Faults associate with these earthquakes may act as conduits for seawater to serpentinize the mantle . [ 60 ] The depth distribution of microearthquakes can be an agent to approximate the temperature structure at depth . , 2002 ; Golden et al . , 2003 ] . This idea is further supported by the end - member compositions of the hydrothermal fluids , indicating very high concentrations of dissolved methane and hydrogen which are generally related to serpentinization [ Bogdanov et al . , 1997 ; Schmidt et al . , 2007 ] . Thus , the seismically active region just to the west of the Logatchev hydrothermal vent field may outline a crustal volume that is effectively ventilated by hydrothermal fluids . Hydrothermal circulation might be facilitated by the exothermic reaction of peridotite and water to serpentine . However , a number of studies indicated that energy from exothermic serpentinization is not enough to drive high - temperature venting [ e.g. , Allen and Seyfried , 2004 ] . Such results are corroborated by the fact that talc alteration indicated that Si metasomatism overprinted serpentinization and hence may indicate the presence of gabbroic intrusions at greater depth below the Logatchev vent field [ Augustin et al . , 2012 ] . Conceptual Model for Hydrothermal Venting at the Logatchev Massif . [ 61 ] The Logatchev hydrothermal vent field occurs just eastward of a major cluster of microearthquakes at 2 - 5 km depth . Hydrothermal activity is most prominent along a 800 m long zone striking roughly NW - SE [ Petersen et al . , 2009 ] and occurs approximately 8 km off the median valley defined by magnetic and swath - mapping [ Fujiwara et al . , 2003 ] . The main vent sites are located on a plateau right below a 350 m high cliff between 3060 and 2910 m water depth . There are abundant outcrops of serpentinite and gabbroic rocks at the eastern rift mountains ; upper crustal rocks are less abundant at the rift walls but dominate the median valley floor [ Petersen et al . , 2009 ] . Two distinctive types of vents with high - temperature hydrothermal discharge were described [ Petersen et al . , 2009 ] : ( i ) black smoker - type vents with fluid temperatures of up to 330 \\u00b0 C and ( ii ) so - called \\\" smoking craters \\\" with higher fluid temperatures of up to 360 \\u00b0 C , discharging from local depressions . Further , a number of diffuse hydrothermal sites were found , discharging fluids at much lower temperatures . End - member compositions of the hydrothermal fluids are characterized by very high concentrations of dissolved methane and hydrogen ( up to 3.5 and 19 m M , respectively ) , which relate to subsurface serpentinization processes [ Bogdanov et al . , 1997 ; Schmidt et al . , 2007 ] . , 2012 ] . However , the enrichment of serpentinite and lizardite separates in trace elements such as Sr , Rb , Ba , U , and Pb indicated a considerable degree of interaction with ambient seawater . Further , \\u03b4 18 O formation temperatures of secondary minerals are considerably lower than temperatures of black smoker fluids , supporting extensive fluid mixing and/or reequilibration of host rocks with ambient seawater [ Augustin et al . , 2012 ] . Interestingly , the occurrences of talc alteration showed that Si metasomatism overprinted serpentinization and hence may indicate the impact of gabbroic intrusions [ Augustin et al . , 2012 ] . However , in the vicinity of a gabbroic intrusion temperatures may have been too great for serpentinization as talc is stable at much higher temperatures . [ 63 ] Petersen et al . [ 2009 ] suggested that the vents are fed from a deeper magma source or intrusive body within the eastern portion of the median valley that is tapped by a listric normal fault . This fault is suggested to be steep at shallow depth , turning into a low - angle fault at depth . , 2007 ] , where the fault dips at 60 - 70 \\u00b0 at the median valley , rolling over and forming an inactive low - angle fault off axis [ e.g. , Reston and Ranero , 2011 ] . Microseismicity at the Logatchev vent field , however , supports a different scenario . We suggest that the major cluster of microearthquakes occurring nearly below the Logatchev vents may indicate volume expansion caused by serpentinization . However , the focused pattern of seismicity may suggest that a magmatic heat source occurs at the toe or below the cluster of major seismicity , similar to the features detected by Wilcock et al . [ 2009 ] at the Juan de Fuca Ridge where seismicity was triggered by stresses cause by intrusion of pressurized magma . It is interesting to notice that such a heat source would occur below a pillow volcano detected by Petersen et al . [ 2009 ] and thus might have fed the volcano recently ( Figure 11 ) . [ 64 ] The zone of proposed serpentinization occurred near the crust - mantle boundary as defined by gravity data [ Fujiwara et al . , 2003 ] , and hence microearthquakes tended to occur within a depth range generally attributed to the crust and uppermost mantle ; thus , the majority of events may represent crustal events . Earthquakes are generally restricted to the brittle lithosphere . For mid - ocean ridges , temperatures of approximately 600 \\u00b0 C define the highest temperature where earthquakes occur [ e.g. , Wilcock et al . , 2002 ; Golden et al . , 2003 ] . Thus , the seismicity patterns suggest that temperatures of 500 - 600 \\u00b0 C occur at 5 - 6 km below datum ( 9 - 10 km below sea surface ) , indicating that the entire crust supports brittle failure and hence faulting and perhaps seawater migration and hydrothermal recharge down to mantle depth . In the vicinity of the Logatchev vent field , we observed a number of normal faulting events . We suggest that normal faulting in the vicinity of the vents facilitates focused discharge of hydrothermal fluids and is controlling the surface location of venting . At such a shallow depth , a network of faults and fractures in the highly porous upper crust may just support very small seismic events that were below the detection threshold . Further , the highly porous and permeable uppermost crust may allow shallow seawater recharge , explaining \\u03b4 18 O formation and low - temperature alteration pattern [ Augustin et al . , 2012 ] . This scenario may control shallow seismicity at 2 - 3 km depth . , 2012 ] . Therefore , serpentinization , as indicated by fluid venting at the Logatchev field [ e.g. , Bogdanov et al . , 1997 ; Schmidt et al . , 2003 ] , but has to occur within the massif itself . Drilling results from IODP leg 209 at site 1270 support that the Logatchev Massif is largely composed of mantle rocks [ Shipboard Scientific Party , 2004 ] . This feature supports that reverse faulting is indeed caused by volume expansion within the massif . Further , energy released by serpentinization may facilitate hydrothermal circulation . However , to fuel a high - temperature circulation system like the Logatchev field , the energy provided by serpentinisation is not high enough [ e.g. , Allen and Seyfried , 2004 ] . Thus , some magmatic component is needed . Indeed , talc alteration indicated that Si metasomatism overprinted serpentinization and thus supports the presence of gabbroic intrusions in the vicinity of the Logatchev vent field [ Augustin et al . , 2012 ] . We suggest that the magmatic intrusion is located below the cluster of intense seismicity to the west of the Logatchev field ( Figure 11 ) . [ 66 ] Further , at the Logatchev Massif focal mechanisms indicate two sets of faults ( Figure 8 ) . Both can also be deduced from bathymetry . The first set represents the normal faults that form the flanking rift mountains . In addition , the massif is cut by a number of transfer or strike - slip faults . Two well - resolved strike - slip earthquakes occurred in January ( Figure 10 a ) . One of the events ruptured just to the west of the Logatchev vent field and the strike of the inferred NW - SE trending fault roughly approximates the strike of the vent field . A second strike - slip event occurred just south of the vent field . It might therefore be reasonable to suggest that the location of the vent field is controlled by two intersecting faults . Similar features have been observed at other nontransform offsets hosting core complexes and hydrothermal vent sites to the south of the Azores [ Gracia et al . , 2000 ] . Thus , the pervasive normal and localized strike - slip faulting taking place at segment ends and nontransform offsets may nurture enhanced fluid circulation and favor serpentinization and high - temperature hydrothermal venting . Conclusions . [ 67 ] Three microseismicity surveys were conducted at the Mid - Atlantic Ridge . The networks provided on the order of 210 and 120 located microearthquakes , respectively . Microearthquakes cluster along the median valley and focal depths of all events range between 2 and 7 km below the seafloor . Events tended to be deeper in the northern segment ( 3 - 6 km ) sandwiched between the double Ascension transform fault and shallow in the southern segment ( 2 - 4 km ) , which seems to be magmatically more robust . The deployments should have been able to detect seismicity from three inside corner massifs . Only the northernmost massif showed some minor seismicity . In general , however , the inside corner massifs were seismically quiet . [ 68 ] The third experiment was conducted at the massif that hosts the Logatchev hydrothermal site , a serpentinite hosted vent field [ Bogdanov et al . , 1997 ; Schmidt et al . In total , on the order of 1600 events were located . To the north and to the south of the massif , seismicity was concentrated along the median valley and the neovolcanic zone . At the massif , however , seismic activity was clearly shifted by 5 - 8 km away from the ridge axis and occurred under the flanking eastern rift mountains . The Logatchev high - temperature vent field occurs just to the east of the seismically active zone . Focal depths of the earthquakes ranged from 1.5 to 5.5 km . Some of the deeper events at 3.5 - 5.5 km depth showed reverse faulting . We believe that reverse faulting is related either to the injection of magma into a sill causing thermal stresses and fracturing in its vicinity or it is related to volume expansion caused by serpentinization . At shallower depths of 1.5 - 4 km , a number of earthquakes in the vicinity of the vent field showed normal faulting . Normal faulting may facilitate focused fluid flow and fluid discharge , feeding the vent field . Further , a second set of faults occurs , running roughly perpendicular to the normal faults . Cross - cutting faults may govern the surface location of the vent field . Acknowledgments .

D[e]nt Publishing is part of the specialist publishing group Oral Science & Business Media Inc. . What is the role of apoptosis in oral disease ? Apoptosis is widely involved in disease mechanisms of the oral cavity . Can microorganisms induce or inhibit apoptosis ? Bacterial proteases have been implicated as inducers of host cell apoptosis ( Wang et al . 1998 ) . Fusobacterium nucleatum induces apoptosis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and neutrophils ( Jewett et al . 2000 ) . This is significant because premature immune cell apoptosis may decrease host resistance and promote infection ( Geatch et al.1999 ) . Furthermore , apoptosis of both neutrophils and monocytes decreases in the presence of LPS ( Mangan et al . 1993 , Preshaw et al . 1999 , Tennenberg et al . 1999 ) , resulting in a heightened immune response ( Hiroi et al . 1998 ) . Generally , these interactions are complex and unpredictable as microorganisms may increase apoptosis in some host cells and decrease apoptosis in others . Whilst bacteria and their by - products can induce pulpal inflammation , they do not always lead to pulp necrosis ( Bergenholtz 2000 ) . Bacterial proteases have been implicated as inducers of host cell apoptosis ( Wang et al . 1998 ) . Although certain characteristics of apoptotic death are favourable to necrosis , apoptosis does not lead to pulpal regeneration ( Goldberg et al.1994 ) . How is apoptosis involved in periodontal disease ? There is a considerable amount of research on the role of apoptosis in periodontal disease . Apoptosis occurs in cells of the periodontium as part of normal turnover and remodelling ( Koulouri et al.1999 ) , and may be even more prevalent than necrosis in periodontal disease ( Sorkin & Niederman1998 ) . It seems to play a role in age regulation of some immune cells and may be involved in the maintenance of local immune homeostasis in inflamed gingival tissue ( Tonetti et al.1998 ) . There is also evidence that increased inflammation is associated with increased epithelial cell apoptosis in the periodontium of patients with periodontal disease ( Carro et al.1997 ) . Various microorganisms associated with periodontal diseases have been shown to generate different short chain carboxylic acids as metabolic by - products , which can promote inflammation by inhibiting normal apoptosis of certain inflammatory cells ( Niederman et al . 1997 ) . For example , lactic acid and propionic acid commonly produced by oral microorganisms in periodontal diseases have been shown to inhibit apoptosis of various inflammatory cells ( Niederman et al . 1997 , Yamamoto et al.1997 , Sorkin & Niederman1998 ) . The resultant presence of increased numbers of inflammatory cells results in an elevated inflammatory state . What is the relationship between gingival trauma , wound healing and apoptosis ? There is a strong evidence that trauma , including surgical trauma , inhibits immune cell apoptosis ( Ertel et al . 1999 , Fanning et al . 1999 , Ogura et al . 1999 , Nolan et al . 2000 ) . Apoptosis occurs in cells at the advancing epithelial edge in wound healing ( Brown et al . 1997 ) . There is speculation that the signal for apoptosis and down regulation of inflammation in a wound may in fact be derived from the epithelium because it appears concurrently with re - epithelialisation of the wound ( Brown et al . 1997 , Leonardi et al . 2001 ) . Granulation tissue fibroblasts ( myo fibroblasts ) play a role in wound contraction . When granulation tissue evolves into a scar , myo fibroblasts disappear , probably as a result of apoptosis . Myo fibroblasts persist in excessive scarring conditions ( Desmouliere1995 ) , possibly because of an inappropriate inhibition of apoptosis in these cells . Certain mediators may be potential stimulators of apoptosis in myo fibroblasts after re - epithelialization in the palatal wound healing process ( Funato et al.1999 ) . What is the role of apoptosis in pharmacotherapeutics ? The principle therapeutic goal of apoptosis research is the understanding of how to induce or inhibit apoptosis in specific cells . This is probably the best approach for altering rates of apoptosis in target cells whilst avoiding systemic toxic effects that may be otherwise associated . Aspirin , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDS ) , and selective cyclooxygenase 2 ( COX2 ) inhibitors induce apoptosis in certain cells viaacaspase activation mechanism . Certain drug combinations may induce apoptosis by a mechanism involving the disruption of the cell cycle ( Bamford et al . 2000 ) . The induction of osteoclast apoptosis for the treatment of bone resorption is another therapy that utilizes apoptotic mechanisms ( Hughes&Boyce1997 ) . Antiresorptive drugs such as the bisphosphonate family have been shown to inhibit bone resorption by inducing osteoclast ( Hughes et al.1995 , Rogers et al.1996 , Hiroi - Furuya et al . 1999 ) and macrophage apoptosis ( Rogers et al . 1996 ) . Bisphosphonates inhibit osteocyte and osteoblast apoptosis contributing to their antiresorptive effects ( Plotkin et al . 1999 ) . Tetracycline can also inhibit resorption by inducing osteoclast apoptosis ( Cillari et al.1998,Vernillo & Rifkin1998 ) . This is part of the process by which doxycycline down regulates the inflammatory process ( Liu et al.1999 ) . There is some thought that tetracycline uses a unique mechanism to induce this selective apoptosis ( Bettany & Wolowacz 1998 ) ; however , details of this mechanism have not been fully described . Which dental materials have apoptotic effects ? An understanding of the difference between necrotic and apoptotic forms of cell deat his important for understanding the pulp reaction to dental materials ( Goldberg et al.1994 ) . In some cases , dental materials may lead to uncontrolled development of apoptosis within central pulp cells , but may leave the odontoblasts more or less intact ( Goldberg et al.1994 ) . More specifically , and related to endodontic treatment , in vitro apoptotic changes are documented in human PDL cells exposed to calcium hydroxide ( Adams et al . 1995 ) . Calcium hydroxide has antibacterial properties and has shown predictable healing and hard tissue formation when used in cavity preparations ( Bergenholtz 2000 ) . Calciumions may also affect neutrophil apoptosis ( Onishi et al.1997 ) . Unfortunately , neither the apoptotic effects of composite resin on the dental pulp nor the potential apoptotic effects of extruded root canal sealers on the cells that make up the supporting periradicular tissues have been fully documented . Therefore , the long - term effects of these treatment variables may or may not influence the ultimate treatment outcome and should not be overlooked as potential aetiologic factors in failure . \"}",

Regional patterns of the temporal evolution of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil following the introduction of antiretroviral therapy . Ana Maria de Brito I , II ; Euclides Ayres de Castilho III ; C\\u00e9lia Landmann Szwarcwald IV . Since 1996 , the incidence rate of AIDS in adults in Brazil as a whole and in S\\u00e3o Paulo has been showing a trend towards stability , whereas in the Brazilian northeast the incidence rates of the disease continue to grow . In the northeast , sexual transmission is responsible for more than 80 % of cases , injectable drug users ( IDU ) comprising only a small percentage of cases . There is a greater incidence of AIDS among groups with lower educational levels throughout the country . The comparative analysis of cases of AIDS and of deaths from AIDS shows growth , both in the number of cases and in the number of deaths ; however , from 1996 onwards there has been a progressive reduction in the number of deaths in all regions analyzed . With respect to the incidence of cases of the disease acquired by vertical transmission , a significant growth trend can be seen in all regions for cases born in the period 1990 - 6 , but in 1997 temporal analysis showed evidence of a reduction in this growth . In conclusion , temporal changes have occurred in the AIDS epidemic in Brazil , which has been showing a trend towards stability since 1996 , when potent ARV therapy was introduced . However , this deceleration is not homogenous throughout all the regions . Key Words : AIDS , morbidity / mortality , temporal trend , antiretroviral therapy , Brazil , northeastern region . In recent years , the widespread use of highly effective and potent antiretroviral therapy has significantly increased the quality of life of AIDS victims and has caused a change in the profile of the epidemic . Up to the end of the 1980s , the therapeutic management of patients with AIDS was limited to the treatment of opportunistic infections . Nowadays , specific treatment has contributed towards a change in the morbidity / mortality profile , principally from 1996 onwards , when combined antiretroviral ( ARV ) therapy was introduced , made possible by the development of the non - nucleoside analogs and protease inhibitors [ 2 - 4]. In developed countries , the trend towards a reduction in AIDS - related mortality and morbidity had already been observed prior to the introduction of potent anti - HIV therapy , and it had been attributed to the prophylactic treatment of opportunistic infections . The arrival of the protease inhibitors accentuated these reductions [ 5]. The mean life expectancy of a person who became infected with HIV between 1996 and 1999 and who had access to ARV medication is estimated at 20 years [ 11]. In Brazil , strategies for the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS date from the 1980s , and there are records of the use of medications for opportunistic infections in the National Health Service in 1988 [ 12]. Antiretroviral therapy became available within the National Health Service in 1991 and in 1996 approximately 20,000 patients received treatment . From that year onwards , ARV therapy became more widespread . In 2001 , around 105,000 people were receiving treatment with 15 different ARV medications distributed by the National Health Service ( SUS ) [ 13]. It should be emphasized that Brazil was the first developing country to adopt a policy of distributing antiretroviral medication free of charge throughout the country . According to the Ministry of Health , these initiatives have created an impact similar to that seen in developed countries , in terms of the reduction in the deaths caused by AIDS , the occurrence of opportunistic infections and hospital admissions [ 14]. In the first period , median survival was 5.1 months following AIDS diagnosis , whereas in 1995 mean survival was 16 months , and those diagnosed in 1996 had an extremely significant increase in survival to 58 months [ 15]. Studies on the dynamics of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil show that the epidemic has been tending to stabilize from 1997 onwards [ 12]. However , this trend does not appear to be homogenic throughout all the regions of the country or in all subgroups of the population . In Brazil , studies predominantly refer to populations in the south and southeast of the country , justified by the size of the epidemic and by the diversity of the forms of HIV dissemination in these areas . Our objective was to characterize the AIDS epidemic in the northeastern region of Brazil and to compare it to the country as a whole and to the state of S\\u00e3o Paulo , particularly with respect to the temporal evolution of morbidity / mortality following the introduction of antiretroviral therapy . Material and Methods . For the purpose of this analysis , the last year of diagnosis considered was 1999 . This cut - off date was selected with the intention of reducing the bias introduced into the analysis by the temporal trend of delaying notification of cases . For the analysis of the temporal evolution of the epidemic according to the principal means of HIV transmission , we analyzed the proportions of cases according to the subcategories of exposure and according to the information registered on the clinical record of investigation / notification of AIDS . To permit comparison over time , rates were calculated for the years 1992 and 1999 . Two education levels were considered : the first level included illiterates and those with 8 years of primary schooling , and the second included individuals who had completed high school and/or university . Those cases for which there was no information available regarding education level were proportionally distributed between the two groups . Comparative analysis of the incidence of AIDS and the annual mortality was carried out using a study on the temporal evolution of patients aged 15 years or older and deaths from AIDS in the same age group , occurring in the year following diagnosis . In the mortality registers ( SIM ) , the cause of death is registered according to the 9 th and 10 th Revisions of the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD ) . All the registers of deaths of individuals of 15 years of age or more that occurred between 1991 and 2000 , and which had registered AIDS as the basic cause of death , were included . The code 279.1 of the 9 th Revision of the ICD was used for the years 1991 to 1995 , and the codes B20 to B24 in the 10 th Revision were used for the years from 1996 to 2000 . For the analysis of the temporal trend of cases resulting from vertical transmission , cases occurring during the period 1990 to 1997 were considered , according to year of birth . Results . The analysis of the incidence rates of cases of AIDS in adults showed distinct trends when data from the northeast of the country were compared with data from Brazil as a whole or from the state of S\\u00e3o Paulo ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ) . With respect to the total number of cases in Brazil , a relative increase in new cases was seen from 1990 onwards , with a tendency to stabilize from 1996 onwards and a reduction in the incidence in 1999 . In the northeast of the country , where rates are lower than those of S\\u00e3o Paulo , a trend towards growth has been seen over the entire period analyzed , with a discreet reduction in the incidence in the last year of the series . Figure 1 and Table 1 show the differences in the temporal behavior of incidence rates according to gender . When the variations in the years included in the analysis are compared , it can be seen that the greatest relative increases occurred among women in all regions considered in the study , although the most expressive was in the northeast of the country . With respect to males , the epidemic has already been showing signs of deceleration since 1996 in Brazil as a whole and in the state of S\\u00e3o Paulo . The same can not be said for the northeast of the country , where the epidemic also continues to grow among the male population , except for a slight deceleration in 1999 . The distribution of AIDS cases to the subcategories of exposure in the areas studied revealed distinct regional patterns ( Figure 2 ) . The northeast of the country was characterized by the predominance of sexual transmission , which corresponded to 80 % of the cases . Only a small proportion of cases were registered in the subcategory of IDU . On the other hand , in S\\u00e3o Paulo and in the country as a whole , the percentage of cases in the IDU subcategory was similar to the percentage of cases in the heterosexual subcategory , and this group played an important role in the dissemination of the epidemic . In these areas , the percentage of cases in the sexual subcategories of male homosexual / bisexual or heterosexual was less than 50 % in 1990 , and in the last year of the study it was around 60 % . For the analysis of temporal variation in education level , AIDS patients aged 20 - 69 , diagnosed between 1992 and 1999 , were included , according to area of residence and gender . The results presented in Table 1 show a similar growth trend in cases with low educational levels compared to the total number of cases in all regions . However , the growth observed in the northeast of the country is clearly greater than that of the other areas in the study , and the lowest trend of reduction in the coefficient in cases with higher education levels was also registered in this area . The differences between the southeast and the northeast of the country are the most striking when the distribution of cases is analyzed by gender . For males , results are similar to the total number of cases , with a clear growth trend in the incidence of cases with low education levels in all areas studied , and a greater increase in the northeast of the country . For females , the incidence rates of AIDS in populations with higher education levels were the lowest from the beginning of the epidemic , and almost no differences were observed in the incidence of cases of this education level in the different areas studied . From 1996 onwards , the increase in AIDS cases was not accompanied by an increase in deaths in any of the regions studied , and a progressive reduction in the number of deaths was observed ( Figure 3 ) . The pattern found in the state of S\\u00e3o Paulo , however , appears to show that from 1997 onwards , there was also a reduction in the number of cases . With respect to the analysis of the temporal trend of vertical transmission ( Table 2 ) , considering cases by year of birth during the period 1990 to 1996 , all regions showed a significant increase . The greatest annual growth rate was in the northeast part of the country , with an approximate rate of 17 % , while the lowest was registered in S\\u00e3o Paulo , with a rate below 5 % , showing clear signs of decrease . For Brazil as a whole , the annual growth rate was 12 % . It is worth noting , however , that according to the exponential regression models , in 1997 the expected number of cases of vertical transmission was consistently greater than the observed number of cases , principally in S\\u00e3o Paulo and in the country as a whole . It is important to emphasize that this deceleration of the epidemic did not occur homogeneously in all the regions studied . The trend towards stabilization and deceleration was seen principally in S\\u00e3o Paulo and in Brazil as a whole , while in the northeast of the country the data does not indicate stabilization . In an attempt to explain the current trend of the epidemic in the northeast of the country , some non - excluding hypotheses may be raised . This fact is explained by the different possibilities of access to material goods and services , resulting in unsatisfactory healthcare for a large percentage of patients and delayed or inadequate access to diagnostic and therapeutic measures , particularly to ARV therapy [ 18]. Similarly , with respect to preventive measures , male adolescents living in the north or northeast have the highest - risk sexual practices , compared to adolescents living in other regions of the country [ 19]. This finding was observed in all the regions studied , in both sexes , and corroborates the aforementioned hypothesis regarding the iniquities of access to health care . The fact that the risk to which women of greater educational level in all regions of the country are exposed has remained practically unchanged throughout the progression of the epidemic is noteworthy . On the other hand , the risk of AIDS is growing progressively among women of lower educational level , most markedly among women in the northeast of the country , indicating a clear tendency of the epidemic to \\\" pauperize \\\" , particularly among women . This finding is in agreement with previous studies carried out in the country [ 17 - 20]. The comparative analysis of the incidence of AIDS with the annual mortality shows changes in the morbidity / mortality of AIDS similar to those seen in other countries [ 10,21,22]. Data show a decrease in the incidence of cases and of deaths from AIDS that coincides with the introduction of potent ARV therapy in the country . In our study , during the period 1990 to 1996 , clear increases were seen in the number of cases of vertical transmission , particularly in the northeast , where the annual growth rate was 17 % . Results on the comparison of the number of observed cases and the number of expected cases in 1997 , following adjustment for the exponential regressions to the data in the period 1990 to 1996 , are more encouraging . On the other hand , the possibility can not be discarded that an increase in the number of cases observed in the northeast of the country may be a consequence of an improvement in the system of notification . The prevention policy for the vertical transmission of HIV in Brazil includes the introduction in 1995 of antiretroviral therapy for prophylaxis and/or treatment of the pregnant women infected with HIV or with AIDS , and their children [ 23]. With respect to the difficulty in obtaining data to monitor the various stages of implementing these interventions , our study has shown that the temporal trend analysis of notified cases of AIDS resulting from vertical transmission might help in the evaluation of the impact of these measures .

D[e]nt Publishing is part of the specialist publishing group Oral Science & Business Media Inc. . What role does apoptosis play in other oral tissues ? Apoptosis seems to be necessary formaintaining homeostasis within continually renewing tissues such as the oral mucosa and skin ( Funato et al.1999 ) . Gingival tissue has a high cell turnover , and apoptosis has been demonstrated to occur in this tissue in 90 % of the individuals tested ( Yoshioka et al . 1996 ) . Here , as in other parts of the body , apoptosis is essentially a counterbalance to mitosis . Unfortunately , the role of apoptosis in the differentiation of oral epithelial cells is not clear ( Harada et al . 1998 ) , and more work is required to fully describe the events associated with this process in normal oral tissues as a baseline to further study . What role does apoptosis play in bone ? In the process of bone remodelling , some osteoblasts die via apoptotic mechanisms , whilst those remaining become embedded as osteocytes ( Ihbe et al . 1998 , Jilka et al.1998 ) . Many osteoclasts that lose their attachment to bone die by the process of apoptosis ( Hughes & Boyce 1997 ) . In this regard , a third term in addition to necrosis and apoptosis is oncosis , which describes cell death associated withs low is chaemia and cell swelling . This occurs to some osteoblasts during transition to osteocytes ( Darzynkiewicz & Traganos1998 ) . TNF - a has been shown to enhance osteoblast apoptosis and may contribute to bone loss associated with inflammation ( Hill et al . 1997 , Jilka et al . 1998 , Tsuboi et al . 1999 ) . Neutrophils can also induce apoptosis of osteoblasts , demonstrating the relationship between inflammatory cells and bone resorption associated with inflammation ( Kawakami et al.1997 ) . On the other hand , growth factors , cytokines and other bone - stimulating hormones can reduce apoptosis of osteoblasts during periods of bone resorption ( Hill etal.1997 , Jilka et al.1998 ) . Apoptosis occurs in periradicular tissue during bone remodelling associated with orthodontic tooth movement ( Rana et al . 2001 ) . Certain mediators may limit the resorptive process and aid in bone formation during remodelling ( Hill et al.1997 ) . There is significant evidence that osteoblasts may be involved in the regulation of osteoclast apoptosis ( Fuller et al . 1993 ; 1998 , Green field et al.1999 ) . In fact , most of the mediators that stimulate osteoclast activity seem to act through osteoblasts ( Green field et al.1999 ) . In general , however , factors that stimulate bone resorption inhibit osteoclast apoptosis and factors that inhibit bone resorption promote osteoclast apoptosis ( Hughes & Boyce1997 ) . Furthermore , members of the TNF super - family inhibit osteoclast apoptosis ( Fuller et al . 1998 ) and induce precursor maturation to mature functioning osteoclasts ( Fuller et al.1998 ) , thereby contributing to bone loss . In the presence of high extracellular calcium concentrations as a result of ongoing resorptive processes , osteoclast apoptosis is induced ( Lorget et al.2000 ) . Similarly , oestrogen , glucocorticoids , bisphosphonates and TGF - b have been shown to stimulate apoptosis of osteoclasts ( Green field et al.1999 ) . What role does apoptosis play in immune cells ? Apoptosis is associated with the maintenance of immune cell homeostasis ( Usherwood et al . 1999 ) . Neutrophil production is balanced by apoptosis and clearance from tissues without inducing an inflammatory response ( Onishi et al.1997 ) . Apoptosis also plays a critical role in eliminating harmful or injured cells from tissues . This suggests its participation in inflammatory processes and in the resolution of inflammatory reactions ( Onishi et al.1997 ) . In periradicular lesions , apoptosis occurs predominantly in neutrophils ( Takahashi et al.1999 ) , a process that may be defective in abscess formation as a result of the acidic environment ( Onishi et al . 1997 ) . This lack of clearance of apoptotic cells can present a persistent antigen , inducing an autoimmune response ( Onishi et al . 1997 ) . Apoptosis of neutrophils is the major means of ending neutrophil - associated inflammation ( Marshall & Watson 1997 ) . Induction of this process therefore could be a way of minimizing inflammation that would occur as a result of neutrophil necrosis ( Onishi et al . 1997 ) , which is mediated and induced by certain environmental signals ( Marshall & Watson 1997 ) . There is also evidence that the failure of apoptotic mechanisms in neutrophils can contribute to pathogenesis of disease ( Marshall & Watson1997 ) . Neutrophils in exudate show delayed apoptosis and loss of TNF - a , which is necessary for neutrophil survival in the extravascular fluid ( Seely et al . 1998 ) . In addition , neutrophils in diabetics do not undergolipopolysaccharide ( LPS)-induced inhibition of apoptosis . This may contribute to the increased susceptibility to infection observed in diabetic patients ( Tennenberg et al . 1999 ) . Calciumions have been shown to affect neutrophil apoptosis ( Onishi et al.1997 ) . The signalling mechanisms for other immune cells have been studied less extensively than those for neutrophils . \"}",

File type : K3 and ProTaper . 05 were applied for all of the tests . For the multivariate analysis , in order to estimate the factors influencing file fracture a binary , nonconditional , logistic regression model was used with the fracture as dependent variable and file design , rotational speed , angle and radius of curvature as independent variables . Results . From a total of 240 root canals , instrumented using two different designs of files , 22 files fractured in a total of 22 canals : 12 ProTaper and 10 K3 . All fractures occurred in group B canals whose curvature was greater than 308 . There were no file fractures in the group A teeth , i. e. those specimens with slightly curved or relatively straight canals . At a rotational speed of 150 r. p. m. , five of the instrument fractured ( two K3 and three ProTaper ) . At 250 r. p. m. , seven instruments fractured ( four K3 and three ProTaper ) . At 350 r. p. m. , 10 instruments fractured ( four K3 and six ProTaper ) ( Tables 3 and 4 ) . All the fractures occurred in the apical third of the canal , a few millimeters from the tip of the instruments . The fractures occurred in mesial - buccal and distal - buccal canals in maxillary molars and mesial - buccal and mesial - lingual canals in the mandibular molars . The logistic regression model found fracture statistically associated with rotational speed and angle of curvature . The instruments , which were used at a speed of 350 r. p. m. , fractured more often than those used at 250 r. p. m. ( OR : 1113 . 88 ; 95 % CI : 2 . 05 ; P & lt ; 0 . 05 ) and more often than those used at 150 r. p. m. ( OR : 13531 . 33 ; 95 % CI : 5 . 00 ; P & lt ; 0 . A reduction in the angle of curvature produced a significant decrease in the incidence of fracture ( OR : 0 . 2083 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 6502 ; P & lt ; 0 . These relationships remained significant after their adjustment in order to assimilate the potential interactions between variables . No significant differences were found with respect to the file design or with respect to the radii ( Table 5 ) . Table 3 . K3 fractures and their relationship to rotational speed , and angle and radius of the curvature of the canal . Discussion . There are many factors that influence the fracture of nickel - titanium rotary files . Rotational speed is not generally considered to be a significant factor with respect to the fracture of nickel - titanium endodontic rotary instruments ( Glickman 1997 , Pruett et al . 1997 ) . Increased rotational speeds augment the rubbing of the file within the canal , and thus these files break more readily than those , which are used at lower speeds ( Gabel et al . 1999 , Sattapan et al . 2000a ) . In our study , the files which were used at150 and 250 r. p. m. fractured less frequently than those used at 350 r. p. m. The life expectancy of an instrument is related to a specific number of rotary cycles ( Yared et al . 1999 ) . A lower rotational speed , therefore , should mean that the life span of an instrument is prolonged , breaking only after reaching a specific number of rotations . Clinically , the fatigue of an instrument may be related to the degree of flexure that the instrument undergoes when placed in a curved root canal . When the curvature of canals is more pronounced , the cyclical fatigue that the instrument undergoes is greater , and thus its life expectancy is lower ( Pruett et al . 1997 ) . In this study , all instrument fractures occurred in canals with accentuated angles . The radius of curvature , however , was not a factor that influenced instrument fracture significantly , a fact which contradicts the findings of other studies in which both the angle and radius were found to be significant . In a study conducted by Sattapan et al . ( 2000a ) , it was observed that the files that broke due to excessive torsion exhibited signs of deterioration above the point of fracture . On the other hand , the files that broke due to fatigue through flexure did not exhibit defects linked to their subsequent fracture . It would appear that the resistance of files differs depending on whether the canals are relatively straight or slightly curved or , conversely , whether the curvature of the canals is pronounced and acute . In the first type of canal , it was possible to work using high rotational speeds whilst using each file at least 20 times without fear of fracture . The second type of canal , on the other hand , demands that files should be used at minimum speed . References . Cohen S , Burns RC ( 2000 ) Vas de la Pulpa , 7th edn .
