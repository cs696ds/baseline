Comments by Larry D. Sasich , Pharm . D. , M.P.H , FASHP Public Citizen &#39;s Health Research Group Before the FDA &#39;s Public Meeting on the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ( PDUFA ) . Public Citizen appreciates this opportunity to comment on the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ( PDUFA ) and what we hope will be its non re - authorization in September 2002 . When first put forth in 1992 , PDUFA appeared to be a reasonable attempt to improve a drug review process reeling under chronic , imprudent under - funding of the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) by Congress . PDUFA &#39;s re - authorization in 1997 opened the door for passage of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act ( FDAMA ) . This ill - advised law included such anti - consumer protection provisions as the off - label promotion of drugs and its dangerous pharmacy compounding provisions , neither of which remotely relate to the FDA &#39;s drug review process which is the subject of PDUFA . This highlights the dangers to the public of re - opening the Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act ( the Act ) every five - years giving the drug industry and its paid advocates in Congress the opportunity to play mischief with the Act . The toxic duo of PDUFA - FDAMA has weakened the FDA and for the first time rolled back consumer protection laws that had become progressively stronger during the last century . By law , PDUFA fees can only be used for drug review . However , PDUFA - FDAMA mandated additional unfunded burdens upon the agency such as those mentioned above . Moreover , PDUFA - FDAMA requires that the amount the FDA must spend from public appropriations on the drug review process is increased by an inflation factor every year . With flat appropriations , funds for other vital FDA functions must be funneled into the new drug review process to meet PDUFA - FDAMA requirements for drug review funding . Consequently , resources for programs such as postmarketing safety surveillance , monitoring of prescription drug advertising , and manufacturer and import inspections , have dwindled . [ 1 ] . This new Industry - FDA culture of collegiality is not necessarily in the interests of the public &#39;s health . During Public Citizen &#39;s 29 years of observing the FDA , the essential policy issues have remained largely unchanged . Primary among these is the relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and the FDA and the extent that the industry by itself , or through Congress , can influence drug regulation and the drug - approval process for its own gain . [ 3 ] Judge Loevinger &#39;s perspective is depressing , but we believe it is possible for the public , rather than the industry , to once again become the FDA &#39;s primary \\\&quot; customer . \\\&quot; When the President and Chief Executive Officer of the industry &#39;s major lobbying group , the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , gives the FDA \\\&quot; high marks \\\&quot; for the implementation of FDAMA , consumers should be concerned . [ 4 ] Consumers will not continue to have confidence in the credibility of an agency that has even the appearance of representing the interest of the industry over its own . The obvious solution is adequate public funding of what the FDA itself calls \\\&quot; The Nation &#39;s Foremost Consumer Protection Agency . \\\&quot; Keeping the FDA adequately funded and independent is a goal that is clearly possible in an era of a trillion - dollar budget surplus . I will now briefly respond to those aspects of the questions posed by the FDA not addressed in my opening remarks : . The FDA has implemented management improvements that have substantially decreased the time for new drug review and made new medications available to the public faster . Do you view this as a benefit of the user fee program that should be maintained in the future ? Public Citizen supports early access to experimental drugs for patients with serious or life - threatening illnesses or for those with rare disorders that have no effective treatments . Even prior to PDUFA , the FDA had a policy of expediting access to experimental drugs through a compassionate release program and the creation of treatment - Investigational New Drug Applications . For example , the FDA expedited the review and approval of the early AIDS drugs before the advent of user fees and these drugs came on the market in the U.S. before they did in any other country . Clearly , PDUFA was not necessary to hasten the approval of these important drugs . In contrast , the effect of PDUFA on the last two categories of drugs is very troubling . Our survey of the attitudes of FDA Medical Officers completed in December 1998 revealed disturbing opinions about both the pressure and speed to approve new drugs . Thirty - four Medical Officers stated that the pressure on them to approve new drugs was \\\&quot; somewhat greater \\\&quot; or \\\&quot; much greater \\\&quot; compared to the period prior to 1995 . [ 5 ] . Three recent examples from category 3 , where there was an apparent pressure to approve , are the heart drug Posicor , [ 6 ] Duract , [ 7 ] an anti - inflammatory painkiller , and the antibiotic Raxar . [ 8 ] These drugs were approved between June and November 1997 , just prior to the re - authorization of PDUFA . All had known safety problems prior to approval . All were redundant and there were multiple options available to patients and physicians for the indications for which these drugs were approved . All received standard reviews , and all killed and injured before they were withdrawn from the market between June 1998 and October 1999 . We do not believe that these drugs would have been approved in the pre - user fee era . With respect to the speed of drug approval , priority reviews are now being inappropriately granted for new drugs with , at best , modest effectiveness simply because they work by a new mechanism of action . Recent examples of drugs in category 4 are the type-2 diabetes agent Rezulin , [ 9 ] the flu drug Relenza , [ 10 ] and Lotronex , [ 11 ] approved for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in women with diarrhea as the main symptom . Rezulin has been banned and the other two drugs have required significant changes to their safety labeling . Should the FDA continue to have performance goals for the drug and biological review process ? PDUFA - FDAMA &#39;s performance goals are in fact legislated deadlines that leave the agency with little flexibility . Reviewing new drug research is not a \\\&quot; cookie - cutter \\\&quot; affair . It is a process that is too important to the health and safety of the public to be constrained by time lines dictated by industry and enforced by the possibility that these funds will be cut off . This places enormous pressure on FDA reviewers whose decisions may affect the safety of millions . Dr. Janet Woodcock the Director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research recently remarked that the intense PDUFA - FDAMA schedules \\\&quot; create a sweatshop environment that &#39;s causing high staffing turnover . \\\&quot; [ 12 ] . Companies can now \\\&quot; game \\\&quot; the system , knowing that reviewers are under a deadline , by procrastinating in producing information requested by the reviewers , this is a phenomenon we term \\\&quot; PDUFA compression . \\\&quot; Reviewers may not have adequate time to analyze important data before a final decision must be made to approve or not approve an application . One example of PDUFA compression was the priority review of tamoxifen ( Nolvadex ) to reduce the incidence of breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease . The application was submitted on April 30 , 1998 , creating a PDUFA deadline of October 31 , 1998 . The draft Medical Officer Review had to be completed on August 18 , 1998 for distribution to the advisory committee , a period of 3.5 months after submission . The Medical Officer review for this drug chronicles repeated requests for information from the company and reveals the medical officer &#39;s frustration in not receiving the information in a timely manner . The Medical Officer wrote : . The section [ Administrative correspondence ] documents the lack of a complete set of primary data for review until August 4 , 1998 , despite an initial agreement to provide the data and repeated requests for submission . Data submission was not complete until August 4 , 1998 , 1.5 weeks before the deadline for review submission to ODAC [ Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee]. Until July 16 , 1998 , response times to FDA Requests for Information ranged from 2 weeks to one month , representing significant delays in the highly compressed timeframe of the review of this application . [ 13 ] . Public Citizen believes that the drug review clock must be in the hands of an independent FDA . Performance goals are an important managerial tool as long as they serve the public &#39;s interest and are flexible enough to accommodate the requirements of the FDA &#39;s review staff . The PDUFA - FDAMA time lines lack flexibility placing additional pressure on reviewers . Should fees collected from industry be used to pay for other costs FDA incurs to ensure that drugs in the American marketplace are safe and effective ? Such additional costs might include monitoring adverse drug reactions , monitoring drug advertising , and routine surveillance , inspection and testing of drug manufacturers . We can only imagine what \\\&quot; strings \\\&quot; industry would have Congress attach to user fees for postmarketing adverse drug reaction surveillance . Would there be a legislated requirement for industry - FDA meetings to resolve disputes about drug safety before the agency could warn doctors about potential problems through professional product labeling changes ? Could the industry be granted deference in deciding whether or not an injury or death was drug - induced ? Might the FDA be required to allow the industry final editorial approval before any advisory statements about drug safety were released to the public ? All are possible with user fees . The solution is clear - to prevent further incursion into the FDA &#39;s ability to effectively regulate prescription drugs requires public funding of the FDA . PDUFA - FDAMA is an unmistakable warning that user fees collected to finance the review of new drugs are bad public policy and that this scheme for funding the FDA must be regarded as a failed experiment .

OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the relationship between prone and lateral positioning of preterm infants in Kangaroo Mother Care and early neuromotor development . METHODS : Eighty preterm infants born at Instituto Materno - Infantil de Pernambuco , Brazil , admitted to the Kangaroo Mother Care Unit between July and October 2004 were divided into two groups . Forty infants was placed in prone position ( PP ) , while the remaining 40 children were kept in lateral decubitus ( LD ) . On admission and at discharge from the Kangaroo Mother Care Unit , all infants underwent a biomechanical and a neurobehavioral assessment ( Dubowitz exam ) . RESULTS : The groups were homogeneous prior to the intervention . Infants placed in LD showed a more flexed posture , and also adopted a more twisted trunk posture . The LD group improved in 13 out of 16 items assessed by the Dubowitz exam , while the group assigned to PP improved in only five items . CONCLUSION : Placement of infants in LD had a favorable impact on early neuromotor development in our sample . However , additional longitudinal studies are needed to better clarify this relationship . Keywords : Premature , Kangaroo Mother Care , positioning , neuromotor development . Technological developments have improved neonatal care and reduced morbidity and mortality rates among premature newborns . Nevertheless , these children require special attention and additional support . 1 Newborns are considered preterm when delivered at less than 37 weeks ( 259 days ) of gestational age ( GA ) . Low birth weight - defined as a birth weight less than 2,500 g - is in itself one of the leading causes of childhood mortality . The KMC program aims at reducing incubator time for preterm infants by placing the child on the mother &#39;s chest in the kangaroo position ( skin - to - skin contact between mother and baby ) , promoting exclusive breastfeeding and establishing a follow - up program for the child . In addition , two body positions are described for KMC : prone position ( PP ) or lateral decubitus ( LD ) , the first one being most frequently adopted and promoted . Halpern et al . 4 state that preterm infants and children with birth weight under 2,000 g show a higher incidence of developmental delay . Not only do developmental outcomes for these children depend on the clinical signs they present , but also on the kind of medical assistance they receive . Information concerning the relationship between KMC and developmental delay is still scarce ; nevertheless , according to the technical handbook of the KMC program , premature newborns who undergo this process receive sensorial and vestibular stimulation , which in turn would help their neuropsychomotor development . In term infants , a flexor - dominant posture of the extremities is observed . This physiological flexor tone results from central nervous system maturation during fetal life . Conversely , preterm babies are relatively hypotonic since they have not yet attained the neurological maturity needed to develop a flexor posture , nor have they experienced the advantage of long - term positioning in the intrauterine environment . In search of postural stability or external support in the extrauterine environment , premature infants initially present a cervical hyperextension that will block the development of mobility and co - contraction in this area . This abnormal postural stabilization may sequentially affect the shoulder , pelvis and hips , leading to a developmental motor delay in preterm children . The premature transition to the extrauterine environment imposes a challenge to preterms , who need to maintain stability in a sensory - rich environment . Therefore , creating a stable atmosphere is a crucial step in promoting the normal development of these children . 6 According to Als et al . , 7 developmentally oriented caregiving during the neonatal period positively affects the child &#39;s neuromotor development . Thus , the early intervention proposed by KMC is extremely important for preterms ; however , there are few studies indicating the best body positioning for these children . The present study aims at identifying neurological and psychomotor implications associated with the placement of premature infants in PP and LD , and also at evaluating the posture adopted by children when placed in either position . Methods . The study sample was composed of preterm newborns delivered at Instituto Materno - Infantil de Pernambuco ( IMIP ) , Brazil . The study was carried out at the Kangaroo Mother Unit ( KMU ) of the same hospital . The study was carried out between July and October 2004 , and included all children admitted at the KMU who met the criteria described above . Infants admitted to the study were divided into two groups . In one , children were placed in prone position ( PP ) , while the other group was positioned in lateral decubitus ( LD ) , as shown in Figures 1 and 2 . The babies were placed in the position assigned to the group both in the kangaroo binder and in the crib . Children were randomly allocated to one of the two groups . On the day of admission to the KMU , children in both groups underwent a biomechanical evaluation and neurobehavioral assessment using the Dubowitz method . The biomechanical examination aimed at analyzing the posture adopted by the infant when placed in the kangaroo binder in PP or LD . In order to facilitate visualization , IMP - standard kangaroo binders were made with transparent cloth ( net cloth ) . Anteroposterior and lateral photographs were taken . A measurement of trunk twisting was performed in all infants , adapting a technique normally used to assess thoracolumbar flexion in adult patients . 9 This adaptation , developed by the authors , was named degree of twisting . The seventh cervical vertebra ( C7 ) and the disc between L4 and L5 were taken as reference points . Measurements were performed with a metric tape . The infant was initially placed in the supine position ( SP ) in the cradle , where the first measurement was taken . The child was then placed in the kangaroo binder in PP or LD , according to the group , and a second measurement was recorded . The first value , in SP , was subtracted from the second , in the kangaroo binder , providing the degree of twisting - that is , how much trunk twisting the child would get when placed in the kangaroo binder in PP or LD . Still on the first day of admission , Dubowitz neurobehavioral assessment was performed . The objective of this assessment was to ensure a fast and systematic evaluation of both full term and preterm newborns . One of the advantages of this instrument is that it requires minimal training or experience . 5 The test is composed of 32 items : two items cover habituation , 15 movement and tone , six reflex , and nine neurobehavioral traits . Only items in the movement and tone section were used , since they were more directly related to the goals of the study . At discharge , the assessment was once again performed . Investigated variables included posture when placed on PP or LD in the kangaroo binder ; degree of twisting ; GA ; weight ; Apgar at 1 and 5 minutes ; time spent in the KMU ; and results of Dubowitz movement and tone assessment . The materials employed included a metric tape , a digital camera , the biochemical evaluation spreadsheet and the Dubowitz neurobehavioral examination . Statistical analyses were performed using Epi - Info 6.4 ; 95 % confidence intervals were calculated . A preliminary draft of the protocol was sent to the Research Ethics Committee at IMIP on April 4 , 2004 , and was approved on May 10 . In accordance with resolution 196/96 of the National Health Council , during data collection , the goals and methods of the study were explained to all participating mothers , who then signed an informed consent authorizing the inclusion of their children in the study , as well as picture - taking . Results . A total of 92 infants were included in the study ; however , 12 did not meet the inclusion criteria or had undergone the Dubowitz exam at discharge . Thus , the final sample size was 80 infants , 40 allocated to group PP and 40 to group LD . Means for GA ( in days ) , weight ( in grams ) , Apgar at 1 and 5 minutes , and time spent at the KMU are summarized in Table 1 . The variables above were used to determine if there were any significant group differences before intervention , using Student &#39; t test . Results indicated no statistically significant differences between the two groups ( PP and LD ) , i.e. , they were homogeneous prior to the intervention . Biomechanical analysis . Biomechanical analysis of infants in the kangaroo binder revealed different postures adopted in each positioning , PP and LD . Infants placed in PP presented cervical extension and rotation ; shoulder extension and abduction ; scapular adduction ; and hip flexion and abduction . In LD , children showed cervical flexion ; shoulder flexion and adduction ; scapular abduction ; and hip flexion and adduction . Flexed elbows and knees were observed in both groups . In addition , infants in PP placed their hands at midline , which was not observed in LD . Concerning trunk flexion , the PP and LD groups were statistically different , with a mean degree of twisting of 0.584 cm in the PP group and 2.056 cm in the LD group . Dubowitz neonatal neurobehavioral assessment . Data obtained on the day of admission to the KMU were compared to those collected at discharge , for both groups . The items in which change was observed between admission and discharge are described in Table 2 . Discussion . Biomechanical analysis . Results of the biomechanical analysis demonstrate that children placed on LD present a more flexed posture and a higher degree of trunk twisting . These are two extremely important factors , especially in preterm newborns , in whom a physiological flexion - deficit is observed due to the reduced time spent in the intrauterine environment . 1 Placing infants in lateral decubitus seems to help them reassume their intrauterine position . The DL group showed a higher degree of trunk twisting . In trunk twisting , the body &#39;s major muscle groups are positioned so as to favor motor coordination . 10 B\\u00e9ziers also states that the quality of the upright position depends on the quality of trunk twisting , and that the act of twisting and untwisting guarantees harmony and anteroposterior balance for the child . The twisted trunk posture adopted by infants in LD matches the physiological aspect of the spinal cord observed in fetal and neonatal life - a single anterior concave curve resulting from the flexed posture assumed by the fetus . Cervical and lumbar lordoses will develop only when the child assumes full cervical extension and bipedalism , respectively . 11,12 Babies in PP showed a trend towards extension , contrary to the direction of the physiological curvature . This fact may have significant implications on the biomechanical development of these children , but other studies are needed to confirm this observation . According to Douret , 13 infants placed in PP present postural abnormalities such as scapular retraction , tendency towards an opisthotonos - like posture , flexed elbows , abducted shoulders and external rotation of the hips , in addition to orthopedic foot abnormalities . These findings correlate with the postural pattern adopted by children in the PP group in our work , as evidenced by the biomechanical evaluation . Therefore , posture could be influencing installation of the pattern described by Douret at a later time . Dubowitz neonatal neurobehavioral assessment . Results of the Dubowitz examination demonstrated a superior performance of the LD group , with better development of an overall flexor tone , as observed in newborns delivered at term . The posture adopted by children in LD while bound to the mother or lying in the cradle allowed for flexion of upper and lower limbs , as well as trunk twisting , as described in the results of the biomechanical evaluation . It is possible that PP did not contribute to the development of a flexor tone , which would be in accordance to the findings of Vaivre - Douret . 14 In that study , preterms were divided in two groups : a control group , in which neonates were placed only in PP , and a treatment group , including the prone and supine positions and lateral decubitus . When the groups were compared after the intervention , the main result was related to the postural evaluation : children in the control group showed an inability to position themselves in LD , due to extensor hypertonicity . Postural stability is an important factor in the development of motor planning and coordination , being determined by flexor tone , which acts to compensate the normal progression of the extensor tone . 1 This stability then facilitates mobility , promoting motor experiences and stimulating learning and development . In regard to head control , LD children showed significant progress in both anterior and posterior head control . The PP group , however , showed significant improvement in anterior head control only . The present results differ from those reported by Ratliff - Schaub et al . 16 Those authors divided a sample of newborns into three groups , each being assigned prone , supine or lateral positioning . Conversely , the results obtained in the present study demonstrate greater improvement in head control among children placed in LD compared to PP . This was probably due not only to practice , but mainly to the stretching of extensor muscles , which is made easier when the child is placed in LD . As Bly states , 17 flexed posture promotes the stretching of extensor muscles , later favoring their contraction and the development of active extension . Active extension , in turn , favors the stretching of flexor muscles , facilitating the subsequent development of active flexion . The present study suggests that placing preterm infants in LD results in significant benefits regarding neuromotor development . However , the absence of a long - term follow - up prevents a full judgment of the observed results . Therefore , other studies should be undertaken promoting a more extensive follow - up . Nevertheless , this study was important in the sense of enlarging the current options for positioning preterm infants in KMC . New studies should be performed to confirm whether these results are valid when children are monitored for a longer interval , as well as when positioning is switched between PP and LD . Additional studies are needed to deepen the knowledge regarding infant positioning in the kangaroo binder . This study was entirely based on information found on articles and books investigating the relationship between body positioning and motor development . However , none of these focused on the kangaroo position . This shows that additional work in necessary so ensure a more scientific basis for infant positioning in kangaroo care . Finally , this study highlights the role of physical therapists in promoting the health of preterm infants . These professionals are prepared to offer a comprehensive perspective on biomechanical and neuropsychomotor issues , and to act as facilitators , favoring the development of these children .

Zinc treatment is a simple , inexpensive , and critical new tool for treating diarrheal episodes among children in the developing world . This important micronutrient becomes depleted during diarrhea , but recent studies suggest that replenishing zinc with a10- to 14-day course of treatment can reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes and may also prevent future episodes for up to three months . It is important that the full - course of zinc is taken , and that follow - up and behavior change messages for caregivers are given to ensure full compliance . In 2004 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the United Nations Children &#39;s Fund ( UNICEF ) issued a joint statement regarding the clinical management of acute diarrhea . This statement recommended the use of zinc treatment , as well as a new formulation of oral rehydration solution ( ORS ) , as a two - pronged approach to treatment . Vitamin A supplementation is another important and low - cost intervention for controlling severe and potentially fatal diarrheal episodes . The relative risk of dying from diarrhea increases two - fold in children with vitamin A deficiency . In countries where under - five mortality rates are high , giving semi - annual vitamin A supplements to children six to 59 months old decreases overall mortality from all childhood diseases by 23 percent and mortality from diarrhea by 32 percent . A dose of vitamin A for newborns has been found to be effective in reducing early mortality , and may soon be widely recommended . Other micronutrients may be important to maintain the integrity of immune function and appetite during an episode of diarrhea . Iron deficiency , for example , depresses appetite and may increase the risk of malnutrition associated with diarrhea . PATH is working with country partners to implement a comprehensive approach to diarrheal disease control that incorporates new technologies like zinc with proven interventions . For more information , please visit the PATH website . UNICEF is helping countries with registration of zinc and collaborating with WHO to provide guidelines for its use in treating diarrhea .

Therapeutic effects of oral zinc in acute and persistent diarrhea in children in developing countries : Pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials . American Journal of Clinical Nutrition . Photo : PATH / Carib Nelson . Background and Aim : The World Health Organization recommends oral zinc ( tablets or syrups ) as adjunct therapy with oral rehydration solution ( ORS ) for acute childhood . Mixing zinc with ORS can be an attractive approach for simultaneous provision of these 2 effective interventions . This double - masked randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of ORS containing 40 mg / L elemental zinc per liter ( zinc - ORS ) in reducing stool weight and duration of diarrhea . The primary outcomes were total stool output and time to recovery . Conclusions : The World Health Organization - recommended daily dose of zinc for diarrhea was not achieved in most children beyond the first day of treatment . This is the likely explanation for the lack of improvement in outcomes from zinc - ORS when compared with ORS alone . Our findings do not support a change from using zinc syrup or dispersible tablets for treatment of acute diarrhea in children . Twelve studies examined the impact of zinc supplements on the management of acute diarrhoea . Eleven of these showed a reduction in the duration of the diarrhoeal episode ; in eight of these , the reduction was statistically significant . Five of the above studies also collected data on stool volume or frequency , and found that zinc supplements reduced stool output or frequency . Recent studies suggest that a 10- to 14-day therapy of zinc treatment can considerably reduce the duration and severity of diarrhoeal episodes , decrease stool output , and lessen the need for hospitalization . Zinc may also prevent future diarrhea episodes for up to three months . Diarrhea : The Great Zinc Breakthrough - 17 August , 2009 It is hard to grasp the impact diarrhea has on people &#39;s lives across Africa and Asia . Other studies evaluating the effect of zinc supplementation on diarrhoeal diseases found a preventive and long - lasting impact . These studies show that 10 mg to 20 mg of zinc per day for 10 - 14 days reduced the number of episodes of diarrhoea in the 2 - 3 months after the supplementation regimen . WHO and UNICEF therefore recommend daily 20 mg zinc supplements for 10 - 14 days for children with acute diarrhoea , and 10 mg per day for infants under six months old , to curtail the severity of the episode and prevent further occurrences in the ensuing 2 - 3 months . Zinc supplements reduce the duration of an episode of diarrhoea and protect against future bouts of diarrhoea for two to three months after the episode . Every year approximately 1.7 million children die as a result of diarrhea and dehydration . In the majority of cases , this is preventable through exclusive breastfeeding , improved hygiene and sanitation and access to clean water , yet diarrhea is still one of the leading causes of death among children under five . Dispersible zinc tablets , which dissolve easily in a tablespoon of clean water or breastmilk , can be used for zinc supplementation for children aged one to 59 months . WHO and UNICEF recommend 20 mg of zinc per day for ten -14 days for infants and children , ten mg for infants under six months of age . For more than 20 years researchers have been assessing the benefit of zinc supplementation during diarrhea episodes . Studies have shown that zinc supplementation results in a 25 % reduction in duration of acute diarrhea and 40 % reduction in treatment failure or death in persistent diarrhea . These studies also revealed that children receiving zinc experience a decrease in the severity of their diarrhea episodes . A ten day course has proven to provide a prophylactic protection against future bouts of diarrhea for two to three months after the episode . The combined recommendation of zinc and ORS is a safe , effective and inexpensive diarrhea treatment for children in the developing world . The only known side effect of zinc use is vomiting , which is rarely reported and is typically attributed to a metallic taste in the zinc . Use of high - quality zinc products easily avert this side effect . Zinc manufacture requires only simple technology and no expensive ingredients . Zinc can be produced in both syrup and tablet form . Efforts are already underway to transfer the technology from French developer and patent holder , Nutriset / Rodael , to local manufacturers in the developing world , who will be able to take over production , thus keeping costs affordable for the poorest of the poor . Pilot programs have begun in several countries , testing various approaches to training both health facility staff and community health workers , developing and delivering behavior change communication messages and consumer educational materials , and monitoring program progress . Private sector zinc programs are testing the feasibility of marketing zinc tablets and ORS as stand alone products or packaging them together as a Diarrhea Treatment Kit ( DTK ) .

A Methodological Approach to the Safeguard of the Wooden Door of Todi Cathedral . In : Macchia , A. , Borrelli , E. , Campanella , L. ( a cura di ) . Proceedings of the International Meeting YOCOCU : YOuth in COnservation of CUltural Heritage ( Roma , 24 - 25 novembre 2008 ) . Roma , 217 - 221 . Abstract : . The study for the central wooden door of the Todi Cathedral has been the subject of two theses of the Faculty of Conservation of Cultural Heritage of Tuscia University . The aim of the research was to characterize the state of conservation of the artefact in comparison with the environmental microclimate . A bibliographic study of documents available at the archive of Todi Cathedral has allowed to reconstruct the historical phases of realization and past restorations of the artefact . The wooden door of Todi Cathedral was realized in 1521 by the master Antonio Bencivegna da Mercatello da Massa . In 1623 it was seriously damaged by a lightning , so some years later , in 1639 , the door was partly reconstructed by the artist Carlo Lorenti . Instead the plinth was reconstructed in 1792 . Afterwards the door underwent several restoration interventions ; the last one was carried out between 1998 and 1999 . Nowadays the state of conservation of the door is seriously compromised because of both the last incorrect restoration interventions and the position that the wooden door takes up in the Cathedral fa\\u00e7ade . The deterioration of the surface above all was caused by the variations of temperature and relative humidity ( RH% ) and it is different in the various parts of the door . In fact , the inner surface shows a less deterioration due to both the more stable environmental conditions and the plain manufacturing typology . ... more . \&quot;}&quot;,</td>

Introduction : In 1997 a regression tree based patient classification system for all inpatients in Austria was introduced . Since this time the so - called \\\&quot; Austrian DRG - system \\\&quot; is regularly updated . Background : The classification rules are based on regression tree models which terminal nodes should be cost homogenous . However , the resultant regression tree often has to be adjusted manually to be medically reasonable . Despite the possibility of manually adapting the original tree , bootstrapping can be used to search systematically for alternatives . Material / Methods : The data base are the Austrian DRG - data of previous years ( approx . 2.500.500 admissions per year divided into approx . 900 groups according to the main diagnosis or procedures ) . The dependent variable is the length of stay of the cost of a patient . Bootstrap - based methods and different model evaluation criteria are used for searching through a space of models . Results : . The use of bootstrapping assisted in constructing a number of alternative trees which are at least as accurate as the tree constructed by the currently used semi - automatic procedure . In some of the datasets the bootstrap search for alternative models helped to overcome local minima and increased accuracy significantly . Conclusion : Bootstrapped regression trees are a powerful tool to assist in the development of patient classification systems . They can improve accuracy and offer several models to choose from . Moreover , by the use of bootstrapping often less complex trees can be found . The principles of this tree selection strategy can of course be used for many other applications . \&quot;}&quot;,</td>

Background : Opioid prescription rates , and related emergency visits , fractures , adverse effects and mortality rates have risen sharply in the US over the last 10 years . Many clinicians are now seeking guidance about the appropriate use and risk to benefit balance of opioid treatment for chronic non - cancer pain ( CNCP ) . Objective : To assess and compare systematic reviews and guideline recommendations on the relative effectiveness , risks and management of opioids for chronic pain . Methods : We searched major data bases for population studies , systematic reviews and guidelines on opioid use for CNCP . We identified four systematic reviews meeting inclusion criteria and six comprehensive guidelines which included systematic reviews . We compared methodologies , evidence syntheses and guidelines recommendations . We then identified areas for which guidance was insufficient . Retrospective cohort studies document high levels of psychiatric comorbidities and dose- and comorbidity - related adverse effects of opioids . Guidelines focused on containment of substance misuse but were not helpful regarding specific indications and use with psychiatric comorbidity . Discussion : The efficacy and safety of opioids for chronic pain have not been substantiated in available studies . There are significant personal and public health problems associated with the increasing use of chronic opioids . Guidelines do not provide clear guidance for indications , patients with comorbidities , and risks of adverse effects . Implications for guideline developers / users : More consistent , evidence - based prescribing patterns may improve effectiveness and patient safety . Research designs should be improved . \&quot;}&quot;,</td>

Objective : Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) related apoptosis - inducing ligand ( TRAIL / APO2L ) is a member of the TNF family that induces programmed cell death in a variety of neoplastic cell types , but only in a few non - neoplastic cells . In this study , we report on the tumor progression dependent expression of two novel alternative splice variants of TRAIL - identified by our group - in neoplastic and non - neoplastic human cells lacking either exon 3 ( TRAIL - b ) or exons 2 and 3 ( TRAIL - g ) . Moreover , we analyzed the expression of the TRAIL receptor DR5 ( TRICK2 ) and its alternative splice variants TRICK2a and TRICK2b during tumor progression of renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . Methods : Determination of tumour grading and staging by histopathological examination , total RNA - isolation , RT - PCR , statistical analysis by the Mann - Whitney and Wilcoxon test . Results : 1 . TRAIL - a,-b and -g were not regulated during tumor progression from pT1/2 to advanced pT3 stage.4 . The expression levels of the DR5 receptor variants TRICK2a and TRICK2b were not affected in normal vs. tumor cells . Conclusions : Our data suggest that all three TRAIL variants - mainly TRAIL - g - and TRICK2b are significantly decreased in tumor cells , indicating their potential role in RCCs . Alternative splicing of the immature TRAIL - RNA as well as the TRICK2-RNA might be involved in fine tuning of TRAIL - induced apoptosis and underlines the complexity of the TRAIL - system in renal cell carcinoma . \&quot;}&quot;,</td>

Background : TBI is an integral part of several conditioning protocols in stem cell transplan- tion . We report survival and toxicity data of TBI administered in cooperation with Transplant - Center of Deutsche Klinik f\\u00fcr Diagnostik ( DKD ) . Material and Methods : Between 1997 and 2005 280 patients underwent a TBI ( 40.1 % with AML , 19.2 % with ALL , 17.4 with CML , 15.6 with NHL and 7.8 with MDS ) in 856 fractions . 151 men and 129 women with a mean age of 42 years ( 16 to 63 years ) were treated . The TBI was applied in a sitting position with bilateral open radiation fields using 15-MV - photons of a linear accelerator . Modelling bags ( water - sacks ) compensate the irregular surface of patient body to homogenize the dose distribution . Anterior - posterior opposed X - ray portals with individual designed lung shields adjust the radiation dose in mediastinum and lateral chestwall . Results : After conditioning with radio- and chemotherapy in 166 cases ( 59.3 % ) allogenic unrelated , in 84 cases ( 30 % ) allogenic related and in 30 cases ( 10.7 % ) autologous stem cell transplantation followed . With a median follow up of 2.1 years 152 patients ( 54 % ) are alive , 125 ( 44 % ) died . 3 patients are lost of follow up . 134 living patients are in complete remission . Up to now irradiation induced late effects are rare ( cataract in 2 cases ) . Conclusion : The \\\&quot; Wiesbaden\\\&quot;-approach is established as a simple , reliable and feasible TBI - method with acceptable toxicity . \&quot;}&quot;,</td>

Bills Digest No . 124 2000 - 01 Migration Legislation Amendment ( Migration Agents ) Bill 2000 . WARNING : This Digest was prepared for debate . It reflects the legislation as introduced and does not canvass subsequent amendments . This Digest does not have any official legal status . Other sources should be consulted to determine the subsequent official status of the Bill . Commencement : The amendments outlined in this Digest commence on a day to be fixed by Proclamation . However , where those amendments are not proclaimed within six months of the Bill receiving the Royal Assent , they will be taken to have commenced on the first day immediately after that period . prevent an applicant for registration as a registered migration agent from being registered where the Migration Agents Registration Authority ( MARA ) has made a decision to bar him or her for a particular period and that period has not ended . provide MARA with the power to investigate , or complete an investigation of a complaint about a person at a time when he or she is no longer a registered agent . Regulation of the migration advice industry is not new . In May 1995 , the Joint Standing Committee on Migration produced a report on the then existing scheme for regulation of the migration advice industry ( MARS ) , entitled Protecting the Vulnerable ? In 1996 - 97 , as part of the Commonwealth Legislative Review Program and in response to the Committee &#39;s report , the Government conducted a further review of MARS . As a result of both of these review processes , the Government decided that the migration advice industry should move to voluntary self - regulation through a period of statutory self - regulation . Voluntary self - regulation is generally understood to mean that there is no legislative framework for the industry , apart from consumer protection mechanisms such as small claims tribunals and the potential for clients to take legal action against agents under the Trade Practices Act 1974 and/or civil action for damages . Complete self - regulation remains opposed by the Government and by interested parties , including consumers , the Migration Institute of Australia ( the MIA ) and various community organisations , on the following grounds : . There is considerable potential for abuse by agents and a history in the industry of exploitative conduct , affecting both : . consumers , who are often in a vulnerable position because they do not speak English and because the nature of the market is such that it is not easy to discern good service providers from unscrupulous ones , and . the national interest , since unethical conduct on the part of agents affects the integrity of the migration and humanitarian programs . At present , only 24 % of registered agents are members of the industry association ( the MIA ) , so complete self - regulation could potentially threaten the existence of the MIA , as well as lead to a decline in compliance with industry standards , and . The migration industry is not homogeneous , in that it comprises lawyers , non - lawyers and community sector workers . Some form of structured regulation is necessary to ensure uniformity in industry standards and practices . In view of these considerations , the Government has determined that it is necessary to retain some control of the regulatory scheme , which it does through a statutory framework . The existing statutory self - regulatory scheme was introduced by the Migration Legislation Amendment ( Migration Agents ) Act 1997 . The amendments effected by that Act ( contained in Part 3 of the Migration Act ) allow the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to appoint the MIA as the Migration Agents Registration Authority ( MARA ) . The functions of MARA are listed in section 316 of the Migration Act , and include : maintaining a register of migration agents , investigating complaints against agents and disciplining them , as well as overseeing agents &#39; professional development . The MIA is the main industry body , hence a scheme in which the MIA ( as MARA ) carries out regulatory functions under Part 3 of the Migration Act is a statutory self - regulatory one . The scheme became operational on 23 March 1998 when the Minister formally appointed the MIA as MARA . On 27 August 1999 , the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs announced that the existing arrangements for the migration advice industry will be extended until March 2003 . This Bill implements the decision to extend the existing arrangements . The decision to extend the existing arrangements was made after a review of their operation , carried out by DIMA under direction from an independent reference group . The powers of the MARA over migration agents are contained in Divisions 3 and 4 of Part 3 of the Migration Act . At the outset , it is important to recognise that currently the MARA only has jurisdiction over registered migration agents . The main - indeed in the majority of cases , the only - disciplinary sanction that MARA has against a registered migration agent is to cancel or suspend their registration . Once an agent is deregistered , he or she is no longer within the jurisdiction of MARA . The MARA does have power to refer the conduct of a registered agent who is also a lawyer to a body responsible for disciplining lawyers . Under regulation 7 of the Migration Agents Regulations 1998 , the notice is to be published in : . the Saturday edition of a gazetted national weekly newspaper , and . a weekday edition of a gazetted paper , or a gazetted ethnic press publication for an ethnic group that was a substantial part of the agent &#39;s practice , that circulates in the state or territory where the agent practised . At 30 June 2000 there were 2 180 registered migration agents . ( 1 ) In 1999 - 2000 MARA received 556 new applications for registration . During 1999 - 2000 , 600 agents allowed their registration to lapse and eight agents asked MARA to remove them from the Register . In its Annual Report for 2000 , MARA indicates that it refused repeat registration to six applicants , five of which failed to meet the continuing professional development requirements and one who failed on the basis that he was not a person of integrity . MARA also reported that there were seven refusals of initial registration , two applicants failing because they were considered not be persons of integrity , and five failing because they were considered to lack sound knowledge ( ie . a prescribed qualification or sound knowledge of migration procedure ) . During 1999 - 2000 MARA received 177 complaints concerning 120 registered migration agents ( 5.4 % of registered agents ) . The major amendment proposed by this Bill will allow MARA to start or complete investigations of complaints against migration agents even where they are no longer registered and to subsequently prevent them being a registered agent for a maximum of five years where a complaint is made out . In the Second Reading Speech to the Bill the rationale given for the proposed amendments is : . Under the Act as it stands the MARA is forced to abandon this kind of disciplinary action when a person who is the subject of a complaint deregisters . The consequence of this is that migration agents who have acted improperly can leave the industry with an apparently untarnished reputation . It is a condition of registration as a registered migration agent that a person gives immigration assistance . The term &#39; immigration assistance &#39; is defined in section 276 of the Migration Act 1958 ( the Principal Act ) to include : . preparing , or helping to prepare , the visa application or cancellation review application ; or . advising the visa applicant or cancellation review applicant about the visa application or cancellation review application ; or . representing the visa applicant or cancellation review applicant in proceedings before a court or review authority in relation to the visa application or cancellation review application . Subsection 276(3 ) sets out certain specific circumstances when a person will not be taken to give immigration assistance , including if he or she merely : . does clerical work to prepare ( or help prepare ) an application or other document . advises another person that the other person must apply for a visa , or . passes on to another person information produced by a third person , without giving substantial comment on or explanation of the information . A new subsection 276(4 ) is inserted in the Principal Act by item 1 of Schedule 1 of the Bill that provides that a person will not be taken to give immigration assistance in circumstances prescribed by regulation . Section 282 of the Principal Act makes it an offence punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years for a person who is not a registered agent to ask for or receive a fee or other reward for making immigration representations . The term &#39; makes immigration representations &#39; is defined by subsection 282(4 ) to mean where a person makes representations to , or otherwise communicates with , the Minister , a member of the Minister &#39;s staff or the Department : . on behalf of a visa applicant about the application for the visa . on behalf of a cancellation review applicant about the cancellation review application . on behalf of a person nominating ( or seeking to nominate ) a visa applicant for the purposes of the regulations , about the nomination , or . on behalf of a person sponsoring ( or seeking to sponsor ) a visa applicant for the purposes of the regulations , about the sponsorship . A new subsection 282(5 ) is inserted in the Principal Act by item 2 of Schedule 1 of the Bill that provides that a person will not be taken to make immigration representations in circumstances prescribed by regulation . Under the proposed section , the existing registration will be taken to have continued until MARA decides on the new application and will date from the expiry day . Where MARA has not decided a registration application within 10 months of the expiry date of a registration , the application will be taken to have been granted at the end of that period . New sections 311A-311F , dealing with disciplining former registered agents , are inserted in the Principal Act by item 8 of Schedule 1 of the Bill . Proposed subsection 311B(1 ) deals with notice of a decision to bar a former registered migration agent . Basically , where MARA decides to bar a former registered migration agent , it must give that person written notice of the decision specifying the reasons for the decision and the period in respect of which the bar operates . MARA will also be required under proposed subsection 311B(2 ) to publish , in a prescribed way , a statement about the decision ( including the reasons for the decision ) . Proposed section 311C allows MARA , where it bars a former registered migration agent from being a registered agent for a period under proposed section 311A , to prepare a statement about the decision and make that statement available to any or all of the following : . The statement may include any of the following : . the contents of a statement under proposed subsection 311B(2 ) . an extract from such a statement . MARA &#39;s reasons for the decision . MARA &#39;s findings on any material questions of fact , or . the evidence or any other material on which the findings of fact are based . The statement may be made available by being published in a newsletter , newspaper , periodical , on the internet , or in any other way ( proposed subsection 311C(4 ) ) . Under proposed section 311D MARA must give a former registered migration agent written notice that it proposed to make a decision to bar them from registration for a period and invite them to make a submission on the matter within 28 of the notice being given . Where a submission is made , MARA must consider it . Additionally , where a submission is made , MARA may decide the matter or give the former registered migration agent the opportunity to appear before it and then decide the matter . Proposed section 311F provides former registered migration agents who are bared from registration under proposed section 311A with a right of review of the decision to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal . Section 316 of the Principal Act sets out the functions of MARA , which include to deal with registration applications , to investigate complaints about registered migration agents and to take appropriate disciplinary action against registered agents . Item 18 of Schedule 1 of the Bill inserts a new subsection 316(1A ) in the Principal Act which provides : . that MARA may start , or complete an investigation of a complaint about a person at a time when they are no longer a registered agent .

Objective : This on - going study portrays clinical outcome of 17 patients implanted with Cerkinetic TDR for treatment of cervical mono segmental degenerative disc disease over two years . Methods : From June 2009 to June 2011 , 17 patients suffering from radiologically confirmed mono segmental herniated degenerated cervical disc ( DDD ) with no remission of symptoms after six weeks conservative treatment were implanted with Cerkinetic cervical TDR . Patients &#39; clinical status was assessed pre and postoperatively by neurological examination , Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) , neck and arm Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) , patient satisfaction survey , and radiological imaging . Ongoing postoperative assessment is performed at 1 week , 3 , 6 , 12 and 24 months respectively . Radiological evaluation in follow - up visits is performed at 1 week , 3 , 12 and 24 months , respectively . Results : Procedure was successfully performed in all patients ( 9 male , 8 female ) , mean age 46 years , ( range 33 - 53 ) . All patients attended follow up visits . Ongoing follow - up is based on individual procedure dates , until the period of 24 months follow - up is completed for all patients . Current mean follow up period is 11.25 months ( range 3 weeks-24 months ) . Patients preoperative mean NDI was 64 % ( crippled ) . Mean postoperative NDI is 17.5 % ( minimal ) . Preoperative mean neck pain VAS was 8.5 and this was decreased to 1.5 postoperatively . Mean preoperative arm pain VAS was 8 and decreased at postoperative follow - up to 1.3 . Neck range of motion ( ROM ) at follow - up was back to normal ( axial rotation 80 \\u00b0 , lateral bending 45 \\u00b0 and flexion 60 \\u00b0 /extension 75 \\u00b0 \\u00b1 10 % of these ROM values ) . Correlative radiologically assessment documented full functioning of implanted TDR in all subjects without signs of dislocation , subsidence or heterotopic ossification . Patients &#39; satisfaction was 10 out of 1 - 10 satisfaction scale . No device failure was observed . No adverse events had occurred . Conclusions : Based on these results of 17 patients implanted over a two years period , Cerkinetic is a safe and effective artificial TDR in treatment of single segmental cervical DDD . Results indicate maintenance of cervical disc height , motion stability and neck sagittal profile . Patients &#39; follow - up manifests pain relief and improved quality of life . Further study is recommended in order to establish a larger statistical database . \&quot;}&quot;,</td>
