      "User Reviews . This is a clever , entertaining video - game based movie . It 's also funny , touching , and I had a lot of fun with this film . What I would have liked to have seen more were characters based of from video games in reality . But other than that , this movie was just great . Best movie I saw in 2012 . As a game villain Ralph is tired of being treated poorly , so on a bet he make an attempt at getting a coveted hero 's medal . A story of trust and friendship , the video game landscape does n't hurt the movie at all . I did n't watch cartoons for a long time , but oh am I glad I got myself to watch this one . Mostly funny jokes , good soundtrack , LOTS of cameos and homages to different video game characters , and the absolutely adorable Vanellope all make up an extremely solid cartoon which you must not miss .

All I can say is what a missed opportunity . I thought there was going to be much more game hopping , and more characters featured . There is the whole history of computer gaming to draw from , and yet hardly any of them are featured . I suspect that they had licensing issues . The script was n't funny and there was nothing in this film for an adult viewer . The main feature little more than a merchandising opportunity with some crass product placement only just about redeems itself in the last five minutes . It failed to have the emotional weight of the second film in the toy story franchise , or that one with the fish that proves you can be affected by the digital image . There was more feeling in the opening 2D short than there was in this entire movie . Probably worth the entrance fee for that alone . Schweet . ... Expand .

Laughed all the way through . Possibly the best animated film since The Incredibles . My ten year - old son thought it was the best he had seen in over a year . Very heartwarming as well . Disney has a hit on it 's hands . A strong story with lovable characters as well as a hilarious look into the world of video games makes the movie original and fun . Easily the best animated film of the year . A must see for any gamer out there . Fantastic movie . I feel like this movie had a lil ' something for everybody .

All in all , Wreck - It - Ralph is a movie for people of all ages . Go see it today ! ... Expand . Very good movie . The voice acting was great , and the animation / art style was quite impressive . There are only two minor annoyances - the change in pacing made the second half of the movie take a little bit of time to get used to ( although you do eventually warm up to it ) , and I was n't too fond of the bathroom humor . Inspired writing elevates this ingenious and delightful toon high above many of the more recent anaemic offerings . The visuals and design aspect of the animation is truly innovative . Eye poppingly imaginative in its colour and beauty and there are some great gags and one liners that will appeal to adults whilst the kids get caught up in the technical wizardry of the computer game worlds .

John C Reilly provides a perfect fit for the voice of Ralph and Jane Lynch matches him all the way as the take no prisoners Sgt Calhoun . It is also refreshing to have a surprise villain hijack the picture at the end . In most animated films the villains are usually obviously presented or signposted well in advance . ... Expand . It 's great to see Disney release another quality film that is of their Toy Story standards , and this was definitley one of them ! It 's such a creative concept that not only kids will love but big kids at heart that grew up with arcade games . It 's such a creative concept that not only kids will love but big kids at heart that grew up with arcade games . They certainly knew how to hit their target audience and with likable characters like Ralph , Felix & Vanellope and a surprise villain this film pretty much had everything to be the success that it was . Overall a must - see for Disney fans out there ! ... Expand . If there 's one word to describe this , it 's original . Funny , sassy and incredibly clever . Best Disney movie in a long time , if not ever . In the beginning the concept is hard to grasp , but along the way , the characters explain it rather enjoyably . Wreck - it Ralph is a symbol of what it is in the arcade : here for a long time to come , even as other films come and go . Nostalgia is key in relation to the enjoyment of this film . If you do not care much for video games or despise them generally -- then this is NOT the film for you . The film has a decent amount of content in relation to retro video games , meaning that parents will take notice of how this film could be geared with an adult audience .

There was only ever one problem I had with the Wreck - It Ralph , and it was that there does n't happen to be all that much going on during the film . There are not as many video games outside of the retro introduction and once the introduction has been done -- there ends up being a complete lack of anything retro . The film does n't seem to keep consistent , though other than that ... Wreck - It Ralph is a great film and is rather enjoyable if you have at least a minimal knowledge of video games . ... Expand .

Though much the film 's praise comes from its use of copyrighted characters , the original characters really stand out on their own . For a kids ' movie , the narrative was top - notch . I predicted while walking out of the theater that people would complain about a perceived underutilization of the characters and worlds that Disney got the rights to use . The saying \" Give people an inch , and they 'll ask for a mile \" applies here . People who expected this movie to be a modern - day \" Cartoon All - Stars \" were bound to be disappointed , as this movie was always meant to be a Disney film starring original characters flavored by familiar faces and locales . Introducing any more worlds would have made the film seem too rushed ; as it is , I felt amazed that they were able to fit as much as they did within the film 's runtime . In all , it 's a great film for gamers of any age , especially those of us with fond memories of arcades and 8-bit games . ... Expand . This movie was an absolute blast .

I love video games , and I have played all the classics like Super Mario , Pac - Man , Sonic the Hedgehog , and even newer games like Call of Duty or Halo , and they all add up to what makes this new film so fantastic . It takes the world of arcade games and shows us the view of the bad guy , who may not be so bad after all . The creators of the game really know what makes Disney Animation the best in the business , because just like a Pixar film , they are able to touch the core in the kid in us and able to give even an adult like me a great time . My only complaint about this film is that although they have many video game characters and worlds , we mostly spend time in a game called Sugar Rush . It 's a candy world with a lot of characters that reminds me of Strawberry Shortcake or something , and I just felt like the movie could 've explored a lot more games than a candy world . But this is not a big problem , because the movie itself is a great and wonderful time for all ages , and I think this is without a doubt the best video game movie ever made . I loved the story and animation , but the characters are what make Wreck - It Ralph so incredible . I honestly loved every character in the film , even Vanellope von Schweetz who I thought I was going to hate . This movie has a lot of heart and a lot of fun , and you need to see to see it right away . ... Expand . A very good film that will entertain both the kids and adults . The many video game references are brilliant . It provides the usual vast number of emotions you would expect from a disney film . Although thoruoghly enjoyable and entertaining it does not quite rank up there with the greatest animated disney films . Still definitely worth a watch though . This was a pleasant surprise . Did n't expect much because I always found Disney - produced CGI films somewhere between ' okay ' and ' good ' . Wreck - It Ralph blew me away with its story and lively setting . It was heartwarming and fun , a combination I look for in these types of movies . I want to see this again . When I first saw a preview for this film , right away , I knew I wanted to see it . And I was not disappointed in the least . The acting with the characters was genuine because the VAs worked in the same room together as opposed to other animated films where each VA is in a different recording room .

The acting with the characters was genuine because the VAs worked in the same room together as opposed to other animated films where each VA is in a different recording room . I enjoyed how the focus was n't on mainstream video game characters and how they were only in the film for a maximum of 5 - 10 minutes . That keeps the attention on the main characters without forcing pop - culture references . The worlds were beautifully well done , even the Fix - It Felix world which was only a penthouse and garbage dump in front of a black backdrop . I wanted to know what would happen to each of the main characters , and each of them received a very fitting ending . The twist at the end was barely predictable ( at least for myself and the people I went to go see it with ) and , as it is Disney , I was left crying at the appropriate moments . Even the soundtrack was wonderful , I purchased it shortly after seeing the film . This is a rare movie for me in the case that I put in money and effort to see it multiple times . I will definitely be buying the DVD once it comes out and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Disney , video games or just a good story . ... Expand . Few movies deliver emotional notes on all levels . Even fewer accomplish that while delivering a story based on video game characters living in an arcade game machine . Wreck - It Ralph does all this while appealing to non - gamers and gamers alike . It 's a good movie . Go watch it . Are you big on video games ? Have you ever watched a movie about video games ?

I am looking forward to Wreck it Ralph 2 to see what they can come up with next . and this one deserved the Oscar for best animated film more than Brave by miles . Manichean characters are some typical things in Disney features but in \" Wreck - It Ralph \" tries to call into question this . Neither good people are so good neither bad people are so bad . \" Tangled \" is good , \" Wreck - It Ralph \" is better . I actually expected less , maybe 7/10 . But THIS movie is one of the best animated movies of 2013 ( in where I live ) and of all time . It 's so good , I am wondering why people HATE IT ? ! ? I tell you , it 's no mixed bag , it 's a Pick n Mix . I love a tremendous movie from disney that was n't a part of Pixar , yet like \" Tangled \" it captivates the heart just like most Pixar movies .

It 's about time a movie based off a video game ; or in this case video game based , and I 'm very glad that I spent the last of my allowance to see in it in theaters . I think just about everyone can make the connection that this movie is based off the Donkey Kong games from the early years ; at least gamers know probably , and I guess that they could n't get the rights to the characters so they improvised . I 'm not entirely sure though . First off , it 's about time , that we have a movie that 's about video games and does n't suck . I said it already , but it 's so exciting . Enough with the geekgasm , I should start talking about why I like this film . Some of things that stand out in this film are the visuals , they are a joy to look at and have a lot of imagination put into them . Varying from arcade classic theme , dark gritty , and childlike . The characters are good , the main character has reasonable reasons for doing what he 's done , the supporting cast are fun . Some have the cute brat charm , while others have the army general type . Story is great too , talking about how it feels to be the bad guy ; of course it 's circumstantial , but it does get the point across and the main character shows very good development . This is one of my favorite Disney films , and it surprises me in how this was n't a Pixar production . I guess there 's this giant plot hole near the end , but I do n't see it as a major problem . I believe this is one of the best Disney films out there , and is certainly a joy to watch . ... Collapse . A great animation of the Disney studios .

When \" Wreck - It Ralph \" spent a majority of the film in a game called \" Sugar Rush \" , and I felt that it somewhat weakened the premise of the universe , as after a few minutes you can easily get over the \" Sugar Rush \" game . The story on Vanellope is sad ( somewhat average ) , and Ralph 's bad guy story gives emotions too , but it 's climax is too kid friendly and I thought it could have dove into a much better and stronger conclusion involving the video game universe . Characters other than that are basically comic - relief , except for maybe the villain , but the villain is n't that well written and could have been stronger considering of the several menacing villains in the video game world . ...

Wreck - It Ralph firmly latches on to this sentiment , providing the older members of the audience with just as much to enjoy as the kids . Disney 's business practices are n't always seen in a positive light , but there can be no argument as to the consistency of the films they put out . They have a knack for producing stories that live long in the memory of both children and adults alike . This particular movie is no exception and , whilst the plot is far from original in terms of its themes and morals , it 's done with such heart that it really does n't matter . There are lazy genre flicks , but there are also good genre flicks , and this certainly falls into the latter category . The world itself is realised with great attention to detail . The bright colours and finely detailed environments giving a real sense of how much work has gone into the production . The sights and sounds of the arcade are also integrated into the action with great effect , the mindful application they receive giving the impression that it 's not just the audience that has been hit with a dose of nostalgia . As per usual for Disney , the voice acting is top notch , with stars as diverse as Jane Lynch and Dennis Haysbert lending their expertise to bring the world to life . The characters are also very well conceived , each with their own cross to bear as they live out their lives as jobbing sprites in the local arcade . The art of tempering cuteness with a degree of sadness is where the film really excels , never coming close to the point of being off - putting through being sickly sweetness . Rounding out the characters is a huge cast of extras taken from a variety of retro gaming sources . From a marketing perspective , it 's a masterstroke . The kids get their serving of fun , but the appeal extends to a whole different generation , drawn in by the promise of a trip down memory lane . ... Expand .

Wreck it Ralph is one of the greatest animated movies that is thrilling , hilarious , creative , and full of emotions . Audiences can understand Ralph 's perspective of feeling like a \" nobody . \" The story line flows very well and is great for children of all ages . The movie is about a game character who struggles to become a hero by obtaining a medal . Ralph strives to become a hero by surviving in another game called \" Hero 's Duty . \" Although he won the medal , he accidentally brings a \" cy - bug \" with him which can jeopardize the whole game system . Ralph and Vanellope have explored Candy Land adventures and met an enemy called \" King Candy \" which then gives a great twist to the story . In my perspective , Wreck it Ralph does not need any improvements since it effectively presents a successful story of Ralph finding his own true meaning of himself and is seen as a hero all along . I think the director of this movie did a wonderful job in creating each scene and making sure it flows smoothly until the very end . Overall , the movie is thrilling and did not fail to entertain the audience and myself . Literary : The spoken language is completely English and each of the main characters changes through out the film by further exploring their inner personality . The main issue of the movie is that Ralph fails to become a hero since he is always the \" bad guy . \" Ralph 's situation with the cy - bug caused more problems and have jeopardized the game system . The story was very interesting to me since the plot was well developed and characters had very unique personalities . Dramatic : The setting of this movie was very extraordinary . All the features in \" Candy Land \" were made out of candy and most of these candies were from Willy Wonka Company . The colorful backgrounds and scenery were very impressive and creative . Cinematic : In several scenes of the movie , the music flowed very well with the action of the characters . I believe the music is appropriate and fits well with the scenarios . The music is fun , playful , and great for children . ... Expand . This is one of the greatest animated movies that I have ever seen . I would say that it is amazing to a level par to Toy Story .

Let me tell you : I am not a fan of Disney movies at all , but this one right here , is one that just ca n't be ignored . Wreck It Ralph is one of the most cleverly written and created films ever made by Disney , possibly even further than just Disney . i love wreck it ralph its everything i seen in an animated film but not like this . there should be more violent but still loved it . but sugar rush is for gay girls and boys which i hated in this film . The concept and animation is just brilliant . Although the constant cameos and popular references , the occasional over - use of wordplay and a slight lack of emotional connection drag it down slightly , especially when compared to other recent Disney entries , it 's still a great family film .

Of course I understand that Disney could n't just pull references out in every nook in cranny probably due to the copyrighting section of their budget . But I love what this films offers , I think that anyone could enjoy this game even if you are not a gamer .

The fact the movie centres around 3 main game worlds shows how much they have thought about it .

' Wreck - It Ralph ' is one of those rare original movies from Walt Disney Animation Studios , in other words , it 's not based on fairy - tales , it 's not based on true stories or anything else for that matter .

It 's just an idea that came from a writer 's head and sold it to whatever studio is willing to accept it . Whenever the arcade closes , the video game characters go on to their daily lives of going to bars , or just hanging out at another game program . Ca n't blame him , when was the last time you played \" Super Mario \" and thought maybe you should give Bowser a break ? Why would you ? He keeps kidnapping the Princess . Ralph decides that enough is enough and must earn everybody 's respect the same way that the ever so popular Felix Jr. ( Jack McBrayer ) has earned everybody 's respect . In order for Ralph to prove himself , he needs to win a medal and it is there that he will get what he desires . He tries to do this by \" game - hopping \" , in other words , one video game character entering a different video game , kind of like seeing Sonic the Hedgehog appear out of nowhere in the game \" Luigi 's Mansion \" . Ralph enters a game called \" Hero 's Duty \" , a homage to the ever so popular \" Call of Duty \" . He meets a very ballsy female action hero called Sargent Calhoun ( Jane Lynch ) , who is a very funny character as she takes no nonsense and has more guts than most men , including Ralph . Ralph manages to receive the medal , but accidentally takes a ship and a harmful \" Hero 's Duty \" bug into another game called \" Sugar Rush \" which combines the visual aspect of \" Candy Crush \" and the gameplay style of \" Mario Kart \" . He meets a young girl named Vanellope Von Schweetz ( Sarah Silverman ) who takes his medal and uses it to enter the race that she can not be a part of . We also meet a mysterious leader named King Candy ( Alan Tudyk ) , who does not want Vanellope to compete in the game and tries to stop Ralph from letting her do so . The funniest parts in the movie include the surprising romance between Fix - It Felix Jr. and Sargent Calhoun , the way the writers pull that off with intentional cliches , but genuine chemistry is very well done .

Moriarty 's RUMBLINGS FROM THE LAB # 31 RE : MUMMY 2 , SPROCKETS , THE GIFT , OCEAN 'S 11 , RETURN OF THE JOKER , DR . DEMENTO ! ! ! Hey , Everyone . \" Moriarty \" here . Did I say Saturday ? You 'll have to excuse me for not getting that bonus RUMBLINGS up as promised before we left for Vegas . Things got really crazy really quick . I 'm finally sorting it all out , though . It 's been a blissfully long weekend here at The Moriarty Labs , quiet , with me free to focus on important sociological experiments like seeing if I can talk one of the dancers I met in Vegas into coming to Los Angeles . Purely in the name of science , of course . I 've also given Henchman Mongo some long - term projects that he 's now pursuing vigorously . It 's always nice to see just how hard someone will work when the threat of dissection without anesthetic is hanging over their head . I 'm guessing that you 've been submerged up to your neck in the madhouse that is South By Southwest , Harry , and I 'm also sure that , with your recent loss , family concerns are especially taxing at the moment . I 'm sure I speak for all the regular readers of AICN when I wish you well in these times . That goes out to Father Geek , Sister Satan , and the entire extended Knowles family . Over these past few years , I 've gotten fairly fond of you guys . Not fond enough to spare you when my Evil Master Plan To Rule The World goes into effect , but fond enough to hope that these days are eased in some way by the thoughts and prayers of everyone reading . A lot of these are scripts that I took to ShoWest or things that I just have n't had a chance to report on in all the madness of these last couple of weeks . NOT READY TO BE UNWRAPPED . Yo , man ... turns out Imhotep do n't have no shelf life . Who knew ? For those of you who do n't remember last summer , I was a pretty vocal proponent of THE MUMMY as a piece of light , fun summer popcorn , and I still feel that way . I love watching highlights from the film on my DVD player . I think ILM did some great , loony work on the movie , and I really like the spirit of the whole venture . I 'm not going to argue for it as one of the greats , but it 's the kind of film I like to see as my summer gets underway , filled with FX and dashing heroes and hissable villains and luscious lead ladies in peril . So it was with great relish that I picked up the latest revision of THE MUMMY 2 , written again by Stephen Sommers , who was the writer / director of the first film . I figured I was in for more of the same . Unfortunately , I did n't realize how closely Sommers was going to hold to that concept . I had heard that the new film had something to do with a Scorpion King and that parts of it were set in London . Besides that , I knew nothing about the story . Now , even after having finished the piece , I still do n't know anything about the story . Hell , I 'm not even convinced there is a story . Let me try to sum this story up to best of my abilities . Keep in mind , this is less than three days after reading the script . Twice . I had to , since none of it stuck the first time . We learn at the beginning of the film that it 's been eight years since the original . Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz have a kid now . He 's your standard issue wise - ass kid who knows everything and is always getting into wild and wacky trouble . They 're digging in a tomb in Egypt since they evidently did n't learn their lesson when they had to fight killer undead mummies in the first film . Turns out Weisz has been having crazy dreams about Egypt . They find some magic bracelet . Then we learn some stuff about a legendary bad guy called The Scorpion King that is all apocolypse , end of the world , do n't mess with his burial place type nonsense . Then some grave robbers fight with Brendan and his family . Then they go back to London . Then the naked chick from the beginning of the first film is reincarnated and goes to dig up Imhotep . Then he comes back to life . Then we have a lot of flashbacks to the first film , but they 've decided to add characters into scenes who were n't there the first time around and give the Pharaoh a vengeful daughter who just happens to be reincarnated as Rachel Weisz . Then the good guys go pick up John Hannah , who 's running an Egyptian casino in London . It turns out he kept this special magical item we never saw in the first film . Some guys come looking for it . His place burns down . Imhotep brings his killer mummies to London . There 's a lot of chase scenes . They go to Egypt . There 's more chase scenes . There 's an insane number of scenes where scarabs eat people . The Scorpion King comes back to life . There 's more special effects . The movie ends . The primary thing missing from any single page of this script is charm . There 's not one thing a character does or says that endears them to the reader in even the slightest way . This is a perfunctory exercise in how to overthink a sequel . Instead of trying to focus on that sense of B - movie fun that made the first film such a modest pleasure , Sommers has ladled on more effects than any film needs . It 's a shame . THE MUMMY was one of those beautiful cases of a film hitting screens at just the right time and being just the right kind of fun for audiences as they geared up for summer . The weight of expectation alone demands that this second film need to tell a better story , a tighter story , and that we genuinely care about these characters this time around . With Universal rushing to put this package together and get it in front of the camera , I ca n't imagine that this one is anything but cursed . TOUCH MY MONKEY ! ! LOVE HIM ! ! On the other hand , I am literally overjoyed at the way Mike Myers and Imagine Entertainment are putting together the upcoming SPROCKETS . Written by Myers , Mike McCullers , and Jack \" Deep Thoughts \" Handey , this is a laugh - so - hard - you - hurt script that never once pulls a punch . With Variety reporting that Bo Welch is onboard as director , there 's a chance that this is going to be a truly inspired piece of madness . I 'd always wondered how Welch would be when unleashed on a project that 's all his . As a production designer , he has done some truly world - class work on films like BEETLEJUICE and THE ADDAMS FAMILY and BATMAN RETURNS and MEN IN BLACK . As much as people have given credit to the directors of those films for the look , they also have to give credit to Welch . It 's his imagination that has had to figure out how to bring some of those wild flights of fancy to real , three - dimensional life , no easy task . He 's got a hard job ahead of him here , too . Myers and his co - writers have crafted a truly bizarre world for Dieter to live in . As with AUSTIN POWERS , this is n't a simple one - note sketch , but permission to run rampant with all sorts of wild surreal silliness . At the start of the film , Dieter is the host of Germany 's most successful television program , surpassing even BAYWATCH . He co - hosts with Klaus , his monkey . Of the two , Klaus is by far the more popular . People adore Klaus despite the fact that he is an abusive alcoholic sex freak who mistreats everyone . Dieter , who wanted a monkey his whole life , adores Klaus and will do anything for him . When the monkey goes missing , Dieter tries to keep the show alive , but the public will have no part of it . They turn their back on a Klaus - less SPROCKETS , and Dieter , who has been wrestling with his secret grief , has no choice but to fold the show and head to America , which is where he is sure Klaus has been taken . Once there , Myers and his co - writers are able to rip Hollywood viciously with a whole slew of jokes about Dieter making his way through various industry functions , looking for any clue as to who would want to take Klaus and why the kidnapping occurred . At the same time , there 's a great role in the film that the preposterously funny Wil Farrell will be playing , a distant American cousin to Dieter who lets Dieter stay with him and his family . This is one of those scripts where you ca n't really discuss the best moments without ruining them , and there are dozens of them . The identity of the bad guy is one of those really tricky things . I do n't actually know how they 'll keep him a secret during production , but they have to . Maybe they can use a fake name for the cast listings . It 's not like this is STAR WARS EPISODE II , but one of the elements of truly great comedy is surprise , and telling everyone this person is in the film would definitely keep that from occurring . Maybe it 's because Jack Handey is part of the writing team this time out , or maybe it 's just because Dieter lends himself to slightly darker material than Austin Powers and Wayne . Whatever the case , Myers has written his first truly filthy comedy here , a film that should embrace the \" R \" that this script would receive . Personally , I found myself shocked by many of the more outrageous comic moments , but it 's that great shock when you ca n't help but think , \" No ... they 're not really going to go for this laugh . They ca n't possibly make a joke about ... OH MY GOD , THEY DID ! ! ! \" I pray this film makes it to screen with the same savage , wicked wit this script exhibits . If so , Mike should earn every penny of that $ 20 million Imagine is paying him . RAIMI 'S GOT A PRESENT FOR US . ... and it 's a moody little Southern gothic called THE GIFT , written by Billy Bob Thorton and Tom Epperson . When we were first reporting about Raimi 's attachment to SPIDER - MAN , I was irritated that he was making some little picture first . I 'm familiar with the past screenwriting work that Thorton and Epperson have done together . I 'm a big fan of ONE FALSE MOVE , and I thought A FAMILY THING was deeply underrated . Still , all I wanted was Raimi and the superhero film . When I finally sat down to read THE GIFT , I could think of a million reasons why I did n't care . Now , I can think of a million reasons I ca n't wait . This is a film that has a distinct tone , a strange mixture of suspense and character work . The central character , a widowed mother named Annie played by Cate Blanchett , has had powerful psychic visions since childhood . Left with three children to raise on her own and no means of support , she opens her gift up to the community , serving to give advice and to steer people through difficult times . Annie keeps telling the woman to leave , which makes her a target for Donnie Ray 's rage . That rage begins to spill over to her kids , and Annie genuinely does n't know how she 's going to handle her problems . At the same time , she 's dealing with a sort of ongoing low grade flirtation between herself and the principal ( Greg Kinnear ) of her oldest son 's school . He 's engaged to a rich girl in town , though , so all their chemistry ultimately leads nowhere . Annie does n't even want to date , despite being needled on by her best friend . When she does make the effort to attend the local country club one night , she spies the rich girl having sex with someone other than her fiancÃ © . She keeps the info to herself , though . She does n't want to get involved . When the rich girl vanishes , though , Annie ends up deeply involved . The police have no leads , no way of knowing where she went or what happened to her , and have to turn to Swank to help . Even worse , the prosecutor of the case ( Gary Cole ) turns out to be the man that Annie saw the girl with the night of the murder . As I read the script , I could n't help but picture the way Sam Raimi will approach the material . In case you do n't remember , I named A SIMPLE PLAN the best film of 1998 , and I am rabid to see Raimi test himself with material that is different than anything he 's done in the past . As much as SPIDER - MAN represents a major commercial step forward , this could be another confident artistic step forward . Images from films like NIGHT OF THE HUNTER and CAPE FEAR flashed through my head , films soaked in atmosphere . That 's what this is , a movie that is thick with little details , the kinds of touches that make a town live and breathe on the page . Raimi 's got a lot of talented actors attached to his film , and even if I 'm not sure Keanu can play a hardcore Southern wife beatin ' good ol' boy , I 'm willing to give Sam the benefit of the doubt . If anyone can make this script work , it 's him , and I 'm dying to see him try . ROLLING THE DICE WITH SODERBERGH . Here 's a strange case . Ted ( RAVENOUS ) Griffin is currently listed as the screenwriter for OCEAN 'S 11 , the Soderbergh remake of the Rat Pack / Vegas heist film , and there 's a Ted Griffin draft of the script floating around that has gotten some fairly bad buzz attached to it . On the other hand , I just read a great draft of the project by Steve Carpenter , and I 'm curious to find out when this draft was generated and what led to Carpenter being replaced . Reading it , it was much like my recent experience with the script for TRAFFIC ( not TRAFFIK , like I keep seeing it spelled everywhere - that was the original , and they 've changed it ! ) That script read like it had been tailor - crafted to the sensibilities of Steven Soderbergh . There was a sophistication to the way it intercut its various stories . That 's present here , as well , although OCEAN 'S 11 is far more fun than that script . It reads like it was designed for Clooney , Julia Roberts , Don Cheadle , and many of the other big names being bounced around right now . It manages to not only be a kick - ass heist script , but it also makes some great pointed comments about the difference between Frank / Dino / Sammy era Vegas and the new amusement park atmosphere of today . Steve Wynn is an actual character in the film , even if he is referred to more than he 's seen . The whole point of the heist is to remind people that Vegas is n't safe , that you can lose everything in one hand . I 'm going to try to track down the history of this project and get a timeline on when this was written , when Griffin came on , and I 'm going to read the Griffin draft . It would be tragic if this draft was completely abandoned . I 'm hoping that Griffin is still working from this blueprint , and just working to shape the material as the cast comes aboard . If that 's not the case , then I want to strongly encourage Soderbergh to go back and read this earlier draft . DINI GOES BEYOND IN A BIG WAY . Speaking of sins , Warner Bros and the professional chickenheads who are in charge of the Batman property at the studio continue to demonstrate time and time again that they not only lack any understanding of the character whatsoever , but that they resent anyone who does get it . If you 're like me , eagerly awaiting the release of BATMAN BEYOND : THE RETURN OF THE JOKER at some point this year , then you understand what I 'm talking about . Warner Bros has treated their Batman programming on Saturday mornings so badly that I 'll admit , I got tired of tuning in . Slowly but surely , POKEMON has taken over the entire lineup , and it 's a shame . It was exciting to see smart , emotionally mature stories being told in animation week in and week out by the crew of BATMAN : THE ANIMATED SERIES . It 's gone through several incarnations , each of them offering a wealth of pleasures . BATMAN BEYOND was a show that was born out of the needs of merchandisers that somehow , impossibly , was really good . Paul Dini 's keen understanding of the Batman archetype allows for radical reinventions like the introduction of Terry McGinnis and the new technologically advanced Batsuit because he never loses sight of what makes the character function . His aged Bruce Wayne is at least as solid an interpretation as Frank Miller 's in THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS . The first time Dini wrote a BATMAN film , it was MASK OF THE PHANTASM , a very good film that highlights many of the show 's virtures . There 's an economy to the storytelling , ironic when you consider how much more liberating it is to tell a superhero story in animation than in live - action as with Schumacher 's painful BATMAN IN RUBBER . Dini did permanent things to Bruce Wayne in MOTP , things that had permanent results for the character . In the Gotham City that Dini imagines , these characters grow and age and build up scar tissue that makes them different people over time . It 's similar to what happened to James Bond in ON HER MAJESTY 'S SECRET SERVICE , except Dini 's never just shrugged off the history of the characters . He remembers , and the work is better for it . Now , with the first feature length BATMAN BEYOND story , Dini takes a major step forward as a storyteller . This is a brutal , sad story that I did n't expect at all . If you 've ever wondered what the real toll of being Batman is , this film shows it . There are answers given to us here that the series raised , like what happened to The Joker ? What happened to Tim Drake , the second Robin ? Just when exactly did Batman hang it up and why ? When the Joker reappears in Gotham , seemingly without having changed a bit , both Bruce Wayne and Terry McGinnis are pulled into a bizarre mystery that is not only genuinely disturbing , but also affecting . The climax of the piece is one of the single finest moments I 've ever read involving the characters , summing up so many thoughts about the entire idea of being a hero , of doing these remarkable things . It 's daring , and it 's not what I would call \" comic book \" on any level . Not many mainstream live action films have taken the time to lay the groundwork that 's present , the history that 's been established , and there 's a weight here that ca n't be denied because of all that . I know this is n't going to be released until October of 2000 , but I 'm hoping it will show at the San Diego ComiCon this year or some other similar event so that I can sneak an early peek . It 's been a long time since I was this excited about an upcoming Batman film . It 's been a long time since there 's been a major Batman story involving The Joker , simply my favorite character in comic history . I 'm just glad that even with all the heartbreaks that Batfans have had to withstand this decade , there 's been one team of people at work to consistently make sure that we did n't simply give up altogether . I sincerely believe that RETURN OF THE JOKER is a fitting cap to their spectacular run . GETTING A LITTLE DEMENTED IN THE LABS . As I work on the various experiments that are taking up the majority of my time right now , I 've been enjoying a brand - new CD from Rhino , the new 30th Anniversary collection by Dr. Demento , called DEMENTIA 2000 ! It 's got a few songs I could do without ever hearing again , but that 's not unexpected with over 40 tracks to choose from . What is good is so good that I can say it 's worth owning without hesitation . Hell , just hearing Mel Blanc 's performance of \" Daffy Duck 's Rhapsody \" is worth the full price . Seems that Warner Bros made a series of records that people could buy with the various Looney Tunes characters way back in the ' 40s and ' 50s . It 's three breathtaking moments of verbal gymnastics by the greatest cartoon character voice actor of all time , doing one of the very greatest cartoon character voices of all time . It 's a dizzying performance . I only wish they 'd put the other song on the collection that 's mentioned in the liner notes , \" I Tawt I Saw A Puddy Tat , \" with Blanc performing a duet with himself , courtesy of overdubbing . The insanely wicked \" Deteriorata \" from NATIONAL LAMPOON is a comic rant that will immediately remind modern listeners of Baz Luhrmann 's recent novelty hit \" Everybody 's Free ( To Wear Sunscreen ) , \" but the message here is a little bit more pessimistic . \" You are a fluke of the universe/ You have no right to be here \" is the chorus that 's sung beautifully by Melissa Manchester while Norman Rose intones some solid words of advice . \" Know what to kiss ... and when . Whenever possible , put people on hold . \" Then that chorus kicks in again , adding this time , \" Whether you can hear it or not , the universe is laughing behind your back . \" It 's that kind of savage wit that made the classic LAMPOON the comic force it was . I wish there was a humor magazine today with one - tenth the power . Tom Lehrer is one of those particular comic tastes that I happen to really enjoy . He 's never fall down funny , but there 's a nimble wit to his wordplay that I am a sucker for . \" The Elements \" is the piece included here , a Gilbert and Sullivan inspired ditty that lists the entire periodic table in just a few minutes . The Dead Alewives contribute a piece that just floored me when I heard it , \" Dungeons & Dragons . \" I 'm not going to ruin the joke here , but for anyone who has ever , EVER played the game , you owe it to yourself to hear this piece . If you do n't die of embarrassment , you will laugh yourself sick . I did . Corky & The Juice Pigs , a semi - regular presence on MADTV , does a really funny song here called \" Eskimo \" about the travails of being \" the only gay Eskimo / in my tribe \" . There 's not one but two Weird Al Yankovic songs ( \" Yoda \" and \" Another One Rides The Bus \" ) , which makes perfect sense . I 've heard both so many times over the years that the actual laugh value is diminished . Still , it 's amazing to hear the difference , musically speaking , between the early song and the later one . Say what you will ... Yankovic is a clever parodist who was blessed with a really gifted band of musical mimics . For sheer train crash / what the hell was he thinking ? value , \" The Ballad Of Bilbo Baggins \" by Leonard Nimoy ca n't be beat . As he sings about hobbits and Middle Earth , you will literally feel your brain try to claw its way out of your skull and run screaming from the room . It 's a miraculously wrongheaded recording , and it 's almost cruel to include it here where people can actually get their hands on it . If I were Nimoy , I would have bought the masters years ago and had a barbecue . Yikes . And then there 's Henry Phillips . Who ? That 's what I said . I had to go to the liner notes to get any bead on him at all . There 's not really much information there , either ... just that he 's a guy who performs in comedy clubs and has a couple of CDs . Never heard of him . I 'd say he wins for the song that knocked me down the hardest here . Hats off to this guy for having a strange title - \" On The Shoulders Of Freaks \" - that I expected nothing from , only to deliver with nuclear intensity . The song starts . It 's just simple , brilliant lyrics with a modest arrangment . How can you argue with that ? There 's more here , too . There 's a track that 's never been on CD before , \" How I Spent My Summer ( Or A Day at the Beach with Pedro and the Man ) \" by Cheech & Chong . It 's not the greatest thing they 've ever done , but there 's some very funny moments . There 's not one but two great sketches by Canadian troupe The Frantics . \" You Were Speeding \" is in the tradition of a Python sketch like \" Argument Clinic , \" fast and absurd , hung on the most extraordinary of conceits . On the other hand , \" Last Will & Testament \" is just plain crazed . I love it dearly , and have added the phrases , \" Boot to the head \" and \" And another for Jenny and the Wimp \" to my vocabulary . Awesome . I 'm equally impressed by \" Bulbous Bouffant \" by The Vestibules . I love words - I 'm a writer , so , like , duh - and I love the sounds of words . This piece is all about the odd musicality of words like \" galoshes , \" \" macadamia , \" \" gazebo , \" \" plethora , \" and \" blubber . \" It 's silly , but there 's something gloriously complex about it , too . In the end , I think I have to leave it to Henry Phillips to take the column home today . \" Is n't life pretty ? Next time this column appears , I 'm going to be looking in depth at the new video release of Kieslowski 's epic THE DECALOGUE . We 'll talk about George Lucas and Harry and I , and the nature of fanhood itself . I 'll have that long - promised report of my Saturday with The Festival Of Animation 's Spike in La Jolla . Also , we 're about to gear back up for further coverage of the Forrest J. Ackerman trial that 's starting in a few weeks here in Los Angeles . I 've had a chance to review all the actual court papers , and there 's some things we just HAVE to talk about . I 've also promised Harry and some other friends that I will finish the ' 90s list before the airing of the Academy Awards . Unfortunately , there is various nefariousness afoot that may keep me from finishing those columns for the next ten days or so . Blame that damned Holmes and his infernal interference into my plots and plans . It 's hard to write on the run . I will be back as soon as I 've shaken him . Until then ... . thanx moriatry for clearing up why the hell your continued rambling was not posted on saturday . i just thought i went insane or something . anyway i am always looking forward to anything batman animated but since i live in australia i guess i should wait until we get batman beyond down here , let alone the dang movie . ps Harry , where is your Fantasia 2000 review huh ? where is it ? has nt that ebert thing been on tv or something ? i dunno cause once again , your hemisphere is foreign to me , so this is just a reminder if you ve forgotten . by the way , i really like the joker but i do nt really like him as the head gotham villain . i think catwoman is the best by far . The relation between her and batman could be so much more intriguing than it is in the animated series or in batman returns . they both got really close to the perrrfect ( i am SO sorry ) catwoman / batman thing but for me did nt live up to the fullest potential . i also thought that the mummy was a great load of fun as a movie and got exactly wanted i wanted out of it . very satisfying indeed . ANYWAY , your not the ONLY one who can go on a mindless rant , moriatry . maybe harry can give me my own column were i can g .. aw forget it , ill put u out if your misery now . This has been a sentence were i pretend to be User ID Indeed ! ( i m actually baff though!shhhh ; ) . Over the last twenty - five years , I have read the scripts drunk , concussed , stoned , with a live stoat in my underpants and once on regional television with my trousers round my ankles and a Lithuanian prostitute under the news desk . Still these things make no sense to me . Hilary Swank is not in the lead role in THE GIFT . It 's the absolutely gorgeous Cate Blanchett . I know Swank is in the film , but she 's only one of the supporting characters . Supposedly so is Katie Holmes . I have n't read the script , but maybe you can re - read it ( or post it ! ) and give us the correct scoop . The Canadian sketch was always touted on Dr. Demento as \" Last Will and TEMPERAMENT , \" which makes a lot more sense . \" And I leave my entire vast fortune to the people of Calgary so they can move some place decent ! ! ! ! ! \" Moriarty - should you ever see a show called 4 ON THE FLOOR appear late night in some cable graveyard , tune it . That was the name of the Frantics short - lived , pre - KIDS IN THE HALL sketch comedy show that deserves a better fate than the obscurity to which is is condemned outside of Canada . And for all its visual pleasures and sense of B - Movie elan , THE MUMMY was poorly - written , so I 'm not surprised at all by your initial report on M2 . Madness ! Oh , and good rumblings , Moriarty . I especially enjoyed your review of Scott Frank 's MICRONAUTS script . Sounds like a winner ! Ca n't wait to see what Blake Edwards does with it . Years ago ( 1989 ) there was a tv show called the gift . It was about a young boy who inherited powers to read peoples minds . He eventully reads his fathers mind and sees a robbary will soon take place . He is also stalked by a man whom once lost the gift hundreds of years ago and the man has come back to claim it . It does exist its listed in the timeout film book . Maybe a remake would be good though . But for now I say Sam Raimi goes and does Spidey . I think he would do the film great ( Both films ) . Go Raimi . the Stan Lee Media party that you and Harry went to ( at least I do n't think you told us about it)before you left for ShoWest . I 'd really like to hear about that ! If you can give us a report , that 's be super - swell . BraveCapt . For some truly inspired hilarity - or inanity - you owe it to yourself to check out \" Spaced Out ! \" It 's a \" greatest hits \" compilation of the works of Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner . \" Bilbo Baggins \" is on there , as well as the Shatner gems \" Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds , \" \" Mister Tambourine Man , \" and \" King Henry V. \" One of the greatest comedy albums of all time . Please . Arching your eyebrows , shouting worn - out buzzwords into a microphone , and wrestling about with sweaty , mostly - naked men is not acting . Oh well . If ' The Mummy 2 ' does n't work out , The Rock can always join the XFL ; I 'm sure they can always use another Canadian Football League reject . That would just suck since the character has more potential and HE DOESN'T DIE IN THE COMICS ! THAT is Jason Todd , who they should have used if killing Robin was in the cards . And considering how great a Young Justice show would be with these writers(or Peter David ! ) , I pray they do n't paint themselves into a corner here . It would just suck . This is n't Se7en ! I really hope you 're wrong about the Mummy 2 . I 'm really looking forward to it but have always feared that it might just be a rehash of the first movie . Here 's hoping that it improves before it hits the screen . It may sound stupid after I write it out but what if Tim Drake turned into the Joker . I mean they said something about the Joker looking like he never aged . Then this would be a reason why Bruce hung up the bat suit . He 's sidekick turned on him . Yeah it does sound stupid out loud . This was just something that was running around my head after I read the section about Batman . I read that Steve Carpenter draft , too , and found nothing to fawn over in it . The characters were PAPER THIN and were trying too hard to be recall the Rat Pack for their own good . That Sammy Davis , Jr character is , well , too much like Sammy right down to saying \" baby \" and \" cat . \" It 's hokey like that . I liked Carpenter 's to a degree but it was basically HBO 's Rat Pack movie crossed with Con Air . I reviewed a comparison of these two O-11 drafts over at my site FlixBurg if you 're curious . Thanks for your time . At first , I thought that the spider - man flick would need someone who 's more fantasy oriented at the helm , ( Spielberg , Burton , Richard Donner , etc . ) but Raimi may be actually be more able to take the story to greater heights . When I thought of SPROCKETS , I used to think it was the durn - funniest thing on T.V. But a little while ago , I actually watched an SNL repeat in which SPROCKETS was on . Ugh ! Maybe it was just that sketch , but it was terrible ! The sketch was painful after two minutes ; now they 're turning it into a feature - length movie ? No ! Smack Lorne Micheals , if you must , but I will not have any more SNL movies ! He 's scraping the bottom of the barrel for his latest SNL movies ( \" Superstar \" , \" A Night at the Roxbury \" , \" It 's Pat \" ) . Following this trend , _ any _ sketch that was on SNL for at least three episodes will have a movie in the works ? What 's next ? ! ? Ninety minutes of \" Hey , Remember the 80s ? \" , \" The Ambigously Gay Duo \" , or those Spartan cheerleaders are movies I do n't want to see . Stop the flow of crap ! --Saulot-- . I read Michael Douglas is now the drug - czar in \" Traffic . \" Shame on Harrison Ford for missing out on what could have been a defining moment in his career rival to \" Star Wars \" and the Indiana Jones movies . It would have been a great turn - around from the self - righteous roles he 's been playing lately . ( See \" Airforce One \" ) I 'm not sure how I feel about Douglas as the czar , though , because to me he 'll have to work hard not to portray the slime - ball / jerk he usually plays in his movies . I 'm not saying that I ca n't distinguish character from actor , I 'm saying either he 's been typecast or else he brings an air of slimey - ness to those characters that was n't in the original script . I just ca n't see him as a man torn between being the \" good guy \" enforcer and the concerned parent of a drug - addicted child . First , I was totally against a remake . Then I heard the name Soderbergh and some of the possible cast and I said , \" Ok . I think this might be a good remake because it wo n't try to totally remake shot - for - shot and could have the chemistry of ' Out of Sight ' to boot ! It will be Soderbergh 's movie , not the Rat Pack poorly reincarnated . \" Now ... I'm apprehensive , but I think I 'll wait until you tell us more about the script changes , Moriarty , before making any judgements . . .. is a great production designer . Wonder how he 'll serve \" Sprockets \" as his debut . I could not believe they even made the last couple SNL movies ( A Night At the Roxbury , Superstar ) . Who the hell thinks those characters are SO funny that they 'd watch a 2 hour movie of it ! I thought making an \" It 's Pat ! \" movie was stretching it thin , but THIS is friggin ' crazy . [ BTW - Remember \" Coneheads \" ? ] Probably the only weird al song that was less funny than the original . Lola is flippin ' hilarious . A local cat from here in Charlotte who does some damn funny songs is Tim Wilson . Check out his CD 's , real cool stuff . The female movie going population rejoices that Keanu will be in the Gift . He will portray Redneck wifebeater Donnie w/ his own personal Keanuesqe touch . I ca n't wait for next year 's Academy awards . OH and we also have Driven and The Replacements to look forward to in the coming months . Boyfriends / husbands get ready to divvy up the cash for the tickets . Sprockets will kick ass . Mike Meyers has nt made an unfunny movie yet . I remember watching a sprockets sketch with a segment called Germany 's Most disturbing home videos . It was a fucking riot ! ! ! ! ! If anyone could pull this off its Mike Meyers , and by the sound of the script review it sounds like he does ! ! ! ! I always assumed that Bruce hung up his cape because he was forced to resort to using ( at the most , just pointing ) a gun to stop a criminal . ( Pilot of BM Beyond ) . Anyway , I always thought they should have given the second Robin the Jason Todd name to go with the origin . Perhaps Tim 's fate in BM Beyond is to be the one crippled by the Joker instead of Barbera ... BTW : Has there ever been a debut of Dick AS Robin story in the animated series ( Ala The Gauntlet one - shot ? ) for $ 100 dollars . I am a grunge heartthrob ! ! ! Now , seriously , maybe , whenever I think Keanu \" Whoa \" Reeves , I also think Joey \" Whoa \" Lawerence . When I first seen Keanu \" Whoa \" Reeves it was in one of my most beloved psychotic movies , River 's Edge , which also starred Ione Skye . However , most other people first view of Keanu \" Whoa \" Reeves , it was in BILL and TED 'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURES and BILL and TED 'S BOGUS JOURNEY . Do you remember the Saturday morning cartoon also called BILL and TED 'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURES ? In retrospect , THAT cartoon did n't receive the acclaim it should have . I hope the Cartoon Network acquires the series for broadcast . Whoa ! My first Keanu experience is also the one I think he actually put some acting talent behind : \" Parenthood . \" Ah , \" Parenthood , \" another good Steve Martin flick that has Keanu cast as a Keanu - esque young slacker with a heart of gold who spouts off some wisdom about growing up without even knowing it . Also , he gets it on with Martha Plimpton , who says one of the best insults ever : \" Well I thought someone should be having sex around here with something that does n't require batteries . \" Great line . Batman and all his incarnations will be sorely missed . I ca n't believe that one of the greatest animated programs in history is being rubbed out by a poorly drawn anime show about an electric rodent . Well , I 'm countin ' the days until ROTJ 's ( apologies to George Lucas)video ( and keep your fingers crossed , DVD ) release . Best wishes to Harry and his whole crew and a big FUCK YOU to the suits at WB . Peace out from SATX . Sorry people someone deleted my post . So here it is again . The gift was a tv film made years ago about a young boy who suddenly inherits a gift to read peoples minds . Then later he sees a robbary will take place and he finds out his father has some involement in it . It was very good and it is refrenced in the time out film guide later people . Okay . SNL movies are getting worse and worse . I have already commented about my feelings on Sprockets . Generally speaking I never want to see another SNL movie made , with one exception : CHURCH LADY THE MOVIE . Concept , the Church Lady dies and goes to heaven where she and St Peter , review her life . Simple concept to set up Dana Carveys comedy . Dana Carvey is quite possibly the funniest , most talented comedian without a steady gig right now . Its a shame . The fact that Adam Sandler get 20 million a film to crap out really bad movies and Dana Carvey has n't had any big projects lately is proof in and of itself that the we live in an unfair universe . Anyone know what Carvey has been up to lately ? Now , that commercial with Batman for the Onstar system REALLY gets on my nerves now , and let me tell you why : WHY THE FUCK IS HE FLYING IN AT THE BEGINNING ? ! ? ! ? ! I know he could be swinging in , but for the love of mike , it looks like he 's flying . It does strike me , though that Tim Burton 's Batman has easily become the most recognizable incarnation of the dark knight detective , and that 's a shame , as the animated stuff should have continued to carry the torch , and have more support from Warner Brothers . Paul Dini could easily gather a solid team and do a Batman film a year , and make it high quality entertainment , what a spectacular treatment of the franchise that would be . The animated Batman is never going to be recognized as superior so long as the heads of WB still do n't get animation for adults . Stupid people who are so out of touch its laughable . And to DIHistar , there 's never been an animated episode that shows Dick Grayson putting on the costume for the first time . But there was Robin 's Reckoning , which told all that really needed to be told about how Dick lost his parents and how he learned Bruce Wayne 's secret . Man , the more I think about it the angrier I get . Barbra Gordon was crippled , they should show that ! I know she 's walking around in the future , but a device to help her walk could easily explain that(they can do everything else in the future ) . I wish they would have incorporated more of the comics ' continuity , particularly since Batman seemed to have suffered a loss like Jason Todd by the time Tim Drake came around . But if they kill off Drake and cut short the present day continuity then I will cry . I mean , come on , it 's the equivalent of the animation people saying , \" It 's really over , and we 're never coming back . This incarnation is finished . \" Damn shame if they go that way . The stupid in - bred idiots of WB win . I heard about the prospect of the Sprockets movie , and at first I was n't too keen on it . But tend to agree with Moriarty . Plus Moriarty does n't usually GUSH so much about a script like this . So my only logical deduction is that this has some potential to be pretty diggety darn cool ... if they hold to the script . As far as other SNL movies go , they 're currently developing \" The Ladies Man \" movie . Now there 's one you could wipe yer ass with . Sprockets was by far my fave SNL skit series from that period . It was n't your typical mainstream comedy , so I was surprised to hear of a movie in the works . I 'm sure the script is as good as this article says , but I 'm also expecting it to go through rewrites and become more hollywood crap that resorts to fart jokes and gets a PG-13 . I thank the maker everyday that the miracle that is the Batman animated series and all its reincarnations managed to come to life in the corporate cess pool that is the WB . It inspires me everyday that miracles do happen and you can take comic material and transfer it to other mediums . Comics are the fairy tales , myths and dreams of our time . Please oh egocentric apes of the WB , give these geniuses there do turn at the live action movie . And to satisfy your egos , you will earn more money than you can dream of as they weave there magic over the greatest character of all time . Even Shakespeare himself would want to write Batman . Has Moriarty just totally brainwashed \" Harry Knowles ? \" , do you peeps remember the good old days ? , well where the hell is his review for them ? NMMM Outtie Entries in Animated ( 19 ) . It 's really hard to hate animated movies , even bad ones . If nothing else , animated movies are typically filled with lush visuals and virtuous messages that children need to hear , even if they are a little too simple for adults . Such is the case with the inappropriately titled \" Epic . \" The film starts with Mary Katherine , who prefers to go by M.K. ( Amanda Seyfried ) , a teenage girl whose father ( Jason Sudeikis ) has n't always been around for her . Despite this , she is making an attempt to connect with him and goes to visit him in his cabin in the woods . For years , he has been obsessed with a population of tiny creatures he believes to be living in the forest . Most people , including M.K. , think he 's crazy , but little do they know he 's actually right . He just has n't found the proof yet . As one might expect , the story is inconsequential and filled with messages about saving our forests and preserving the delicate ecosystem of life on our planet . It 's certainly a good message and it does n't beat you over the head with it like last year 's \" Dr. Seuss ' The Lorax , \" but the problem comes when the question is inevitably asked : why save the forest ? The answer boils down to an unconvincing \" because it 's pretty . \" The Boggans , as far as the movie explains , do n't want to destroy the forest because they hate the forest 's inhabitants , but rather because they enjoy living in rot . To them , it 's simply a matter of beauty vs. decay and they prefer decay . The battle to save the forest becomes one of aesthetic purposes rather than one of nobility . Although the decay of the forest would obviously lead to the destruction of its ecosystem , such a point is never made . There are plenty of reasons to save our forests and respect the life in it , but kids watching wo n't walk away with that understanding due to a narrow thematic focus . One must admit , however , that the visuals do indeed paint a forest that looks exquisite and feels alive , so perhaps the narrow focus will benefit those watching . Due to our advanced technology , it 's difficult to make a movie with a presumably large budget like this look bad , but that no less diminishes its beauty . The characters are also animated well and move gracefully through the forest , even during the surprisingly taut action scenes . Watching the film move is a real joy , even if where it 's moving to is n't particularly interesting . The story itself is emotionally distant and the characters are flatly written , usually succumbing to the archetypes modern moviegoers expect . Nod is the reckless free spirit with untapped potential while Ronin is the hardened general whose duties to the Queen and the forest are his only priorities . Naturally , Ronin cares for Nod and believes in him , despite his recklessness , and it 's a safe bet to assume that Nod will make him proud by the end of the movie . \" Epic \" is nothing but underdeveloped stories that are masked by high flying action and solid voice performances from a talented cast ( aside from Aziz Ansari as Mub the slug , who proves he can be just as annoying without having to look at him ) . It 's sure to delight children , though it wo n't leave a lasting impression and the chance to provide them with some meaning is unfortunately passed by for simplicity 's sake . For similar concepts told in vastly different ways , you 're better off checking out Studio Ghibli 's wonderful \" The Secret World of Arrietty , \" which is far more interesting , beautiful and profound than anything shown here . \" Epic \" is anything but . People watch movies , indulge in television and play video games to be transported to another world for a brief period of time . Video games , in particular , seem to come more alive due to the fact that they allow you to live in that world and control the characters in it . While movies and television are a passive viewing experience , video games are active and give the illusion that what you 're doing matters , that your actions have a ripple effect on the digital world you 've been placed in . But what if that was n't an illusion ? What if , when the games were shut off and the players were elsewhere , the characters lived their own lives and experiences ? That 's the premise of Wreck - It Ralph and it 's great , the first movie since Toy Story to truly tap into the imagination of what it 's like to be a kid , when everything you wanted to be real was if you believed it hard enough . Wreck - It Ralph strips away the cynicism of adulthood and it 's an utter delight , especially if you 're a gamer . Ralph ( John C. Reilly ) is the \" bad guy \" of his arcade game , Fix - It Felix , Jr. His job is to destroy the building onscreen and prevent the hero , Fix - It Felix himself ( Jack McBrayer ) , from fixing it and earning a medal . His code dictates his in - game actions and he is forced to be the bad guy , so he 's an outcast and sleeps at a nearby dump at night while the rest of the game characters live together in their cozy apartments . He 's tired of being the bad guy , though , and decides he wants to earn a medal himself , so he travels outside of his game to the central hub ( the surge protector where all the arcade machine power cords meet ) . Once there , he stumbles his way into a couple other games , including \" Sugar Rush , \" a cute racing game that takes place in a world made of sweets . Though vibrant , colorful and targeted at kids , Wreck - It Ralph is just as accessible to the older crowds ; more specifically , seasoned gamers . If you 're a child of the 80 's and grew up with Nintendo , you 'll adore the little touches that the filmmakers , who are all clearly avid gamers , threw in . Jumps are followed by a Super Mario - esque sound effect , 8-bit worlds are populated by trees that are little more than square blocks and the characters , at least the minor ones , are jaggedly animated due to their 8-bit limitations . These touches are brilliant and really bring these video game worlds to life . Expectedly , video game references , both subtle and obvious , are thrown in the film for gamers to spot . An early scene where all the bad guys have gathered together to discuss their evilness is ripe with them . Even Sonic 's there doing his usual do - gooder shtick , performing what can only be described as a PSA for the rest of the video game characters , informing them that if they die outside their game , they die for good . Eventually , Ralph makes his way to the bar to drown his sorrows . The bar , of course , is the classic arcade game Tapper and you get to watch as the bartender runs up and down sliding beverages to his quickly approaching patrons . On top of all this , you 'll see references to Mario Kart , Metal Gear Solid and even the famous Konami code , which is guaranteed to impress the gamers in the audience . These references disappointingly dissipate as the film goes on , though it is n't necessarily a bad thing . The story is imaginative and warm and the characters are lovable thanks to some top notch voice acting from the game cast , particularly Silverman who once again proves how spot on her comedic timing is . This is a good thing because it gives those who are n't gaming savvy something to latch onto . Not once will a viewer feel like they 're being neglected or left in the dark because of their lack of gaming knowledge . Even with all the clever nods to some of gaming 's most iconic franchises , the central story is the heart and soul of the movie and you 'll be surprised by how invested you 've become by the end . Whether you 've played zero video games or thousands , Wreck - It Ralph is worth your time . Animation is too often thought of as a children 's medium , which is an unfair classification . While it does tend to skew towards them , adults can be just as thrilled , delighted , scared and amused as any young kid . This week 's ParaNorman is evidence of that and it hits all of those emotions many times . This is the first film since 2009 's underrated gem 9 that feels more mature and more alive than most other conventional animated films . Despite its PG rating , it takes many risks in its sometimes unnerving tone , frightening visuals and boundary pushing jokes ( let 's just say some parents wo n't be pleased by a late movie character reveal ) and it 's absolutely wonderful . This is not animation for kids . This is animation for everyone . The film follows Norman ( Kodi Smit - McPhee ) , a young boy who has a special gift : he can see and talk to the dead . The people of Blithe Hollow think he 's a freak , as they watch him walk down the street seemingly talking to the air . What they do n't realize is that the afterlife is indeed a real thing and Norman gets to watch as people journey through it . Perhaps appropriately , he 's a horror fan and stays up most nights watching scary movies on television . The walls of his rooms are lined with zombie posters , his slippers are zombie heads and his alarm clock is a tombstone with an arm sticking out of it and a big \" RIP \" on the front . Naturally , his odd behavior has n't landed him many friends , but he soon learns he 's more important than even he realized . His crazy uncle , whom he was told not to talk to and who happens to share Norman 's powers , suddenly dies . His spirit tells Norman that he must now keep an evil witch at bay . It 's approaching the 300 year anniversary since her death and he must read a book at her resting place before sundown or the dead will spring to life . Unfortunately , Norman is unsuccessful , so he 's forced to set out and correct his blunder . ParaNorman feels like something \" The Simpsons \" writers would make if they went a bit darker and tried to tackle horror . It 's fearless , imaginative and incredibly clever . It has plenty of throwaway gags that are surprisingly effective if you catch them , including one billboard gag exclaiming that the local school would be hosting the \" Spelling Bee next Wensday . \" It 's moments like these that highlight how the filmmakers left no stone unturned . They packed as much as they could into a short 93 minute runtime and somehow pulled it off seamlessly . Gags like that are usually followed by a dramatic or scary scene , but the tone never falters . It never feels inconsistent , like they needed to pick one and stick to it . They take everything that 's great about laughing and crying and being scared and throw it together to form a magical piece of entertainment . The fact that the animation is smooth and pretty should go without saying ; it 's the film 's smarts that surprise the most . It references and spoofs a number of other horror movies , including Halloween , Friday the 13th and those classic Hammer horror films . The opening , in particular , is wonderfully reminiscent of a horror film double feature many would find playing at their local theaters back in the 70 's . It 's a love letter to the genre itself and the unique experience that genre delivers , and it continues this admiration throughout . It creates a voice of its own with a downright wonderful story that concludes in an incredible fashion that manages to be terrifying , sad and beautiful all in one sweep , but it never loses its respect for the genre it obviously endears . In the movie , the characters must face their fears , so it 's only appropriate it does n't shy away from the reality of death , everyone 's biggest fear . By the time the end rolls around and Norman faces an enemy that is far different than what many will expect , the film has taken on a whole new meaning . ParaNorman wears many faces , both thematically and narratively , but they all combine to create something truly special . If there 's one thing I 've learned from recent movies like Cars 2 and this week 's Dr. Seuss ' The Lorax , it 's that creating an environmentally friendly message is very hard to do without coming off as preachy . If Cars 2 shoved its message down your throat , The Lorax beats you over the head with it . While there 's certainly something to be said about industrialization and its negative effects on the environment , The Lorax fails to bring it forth with resonance . The film follows a young kid named Ted ( voiced by Zac Efron ) who lives in the town of Thneed - Ville . In his town , no living trees exist and to survive , air must be bought from business mogul and mayor , Mr. O'Hare ( voiced by Rob Riggle ) . Ted has a crush on a pretty girl named Audrey ( voiced by Taylor Swift ) who longs to get away from the artificiality of their town 's blow - up plants and see a real tree . Perhaps naively , Ted figures the only way he 'll get Audrey to reciprocate his feelings is to find one , so he ventures outside of his town , which has been closed off from the rest of the world . Dr. Seuss ' The Lorax has good intentions , as most kids movies do . It tries to entertain the young ones in the audience with songs and colorful visuals while also , in its own goofy way , opening their eyes to the beauty of nature and the dangers of deforestation . There 's nothing inherently wrong with that and while I certainly do n't feel adamant enough about it to tell you not to take your child to see it , The Lorax over - emotionalizes its message to an intense degree . In an early scene , for example , after the Once - ler cuts down his first tree , the animals of the forest place symbolic mourning rocks around the tree and hold hands while slow , somber music begins to bellow from the speakers . Though it still would have been too much later in the film , it would have fit more appropriately after the full destruction of the forest . Its placement at such an early stage and after one tree is cut down is more comical than it is sad . When not shamefully overstating the loss of a tree or laying on thick the destruction of a whole forest , The Lorax tries to be funny , but most of its humor consists of something or someone running into or hitting something or someone else . If you counted the number of times something like this happened to a character , be they human or animal , it would easily reach double digits by the halfway point , perhaps even sooner ( much sooner ) than that . Here is a movie that aims to tackle a real world problem , albeit in an emotionally over - the - top way , but then dumbs down everything surrounding the problem , essentially making a mockery of it . In simpler terms , the film 's message is too heavy while its humor is too light and those two extremes simply do n't work well together . What really hurts the film , more than its stupid humor and overwrought themes , is its surprising lack of imagination , especially considering the name attached to it . For example , in the forest that is eventually destroyed , exactly three species of animals exist : geese , bears and fish . That 's it . All the wonderful creativity from other Dr. Seuss stories is missing here . The movie 's world is n't vividly realized , the forest 's inhabitants are bland and the story , which consists mainly of flashback and little present day conflict , is n't good enough to make up for it . Dr. Seuss ' The Lorax is n't a terrible movie . It 's just an extremely bland one , which is sometimes worse . Some talent went into its making , for sure , but that same talent was put to better use in 2010 's Despicable Me . There 's no reason why that film should be more inventive than this ( because , after all , who 's more inventive than Dr. Seuss ? ) , but it lacks in all fields and its message , despite being the entire point of the movie , is misplaced . There 's nothing inappropriate about The Lorax , so if your child wants to see it , there 's no reason not to go . Just be prepared to sit through what it is rather than what it could ( and should ) be . Studio Ghibli is the Pixar of Japan . Like Pixar ( at least until Cars 2 ) , they never put out a bad movie . Everything they release is full of incredible imagination , wit and heart . From My Neighbor Totoro to Spirited Away to 2008 's wondrous Ponyo , Studio Ghibli produces some of the best animated feature films to ever be released . If you have n't seen any of their movies , there 's no better time to start then now with this week 's new release , The Secret World of Arrietty . While it does n't quite reach the brilliance of those aforementioned films , it lags not far behind . Young or old , The Secret World of Arrietty is magical and is not to be missed . The film follows a sick young boy named Shawn ( voiced by David Henrie ) who is spending a week in the house his mother grew up in to rest before his upcoming heart operation . Arrietty is what you would call a \" borrower \" and she , along with her father , Pod ( voiced by Will Arnett ) and mother , Homily ( voiced by Amy Poehler ) , lives off the resources of the human beings living above her . Their existence is secret and they only sneak up when the coast is clear so they can grab what is essential to live . Past incidents have shown them that human beings are n't to be trusted , but Shawn is different and Arrietty strikes up a friendship with him against her parents ' wishes . There 's a lot to be said for computer animation . Computers can create images that hand drawings ca n't . They can build realistic three dimensional worlds that are as detailed as if you went out with a camera and physically shot something yourself . But when every animated movie uses this format , it becomes stale . That 's one of the many reasons why Studio Ghibli is so great ; their movies are hand drawn . Sure , some things are spruced up a bit with three dimensional renderings ( most notably in Princess Mononoke ) , but their animation technique is one not seen much these days . The Secret World of Arrietty continues in the studio 's tradition of hand drawn animation and it 's arguably their most gorgeous one yet . With visuals reminiscent of a watercolor painting , it 's like watching an artist 's still canvas come to life . They 've crafted a world that feels real , defying your adult brain that should know it 's not , and that 's a testament to the many talented people who have lovingly put this together . It 's a vivid world that will capture your imagination even if the story does n't . Luckily , the chances of that happening are slim to none . It would be easy to brush The Secret World of Arrietty off as a children 's film , but nothing could be further from the truth . Although it 's accessible to children , it also takes a surprising look at mortality and the value of life , no matter how small . As previously mentioned , Shawn is deathly sick . His heart is not strong and he 's facing the harsh truth that , if his operation is n't successful , he may only have a few days left to live . While certainly not an emotionally weak child , his eventual companionship with Arrietty makes him stronger and gives him optimism that the world will go on after his operation and he 'll still be there to partake in its pleasures . Conversely , Shawn teaches Arrietty a thing or two . Because of her size and the impending danger that lurks around every corner , including a hungry bird and cat , Arrietty knows little about the outside world . She has never met another borrower , much less an actual full sized person , and she has been taught her entire life that humans are evil and to fear them . It 's all she knows , but when she meets Shawn , the kind and gentle soul he is , she learns that her fear is unwarranted . There may be some bad people out there , but Shawn is n't one of them and gives her a new perspective on life . It may seem crazy that a G - rated animated family film could be as deep and contemplative as this , but that 's the strength of Studio Ghibli ( and Pixar for that matter ) . Their movies always have a tremendous amount of heart and brains . The Secret World of Arrietty is bright and colorful , yes , but it 's also awe inspiring and spiritual . It 's a wonderful adventure . Post navigation . Dr. Seuss ' The Cat in the Hat . Directed by Bo Welch . After the success of Dr. Seuss ' How the Grinch Stole Christmas it made sense for producer Brian Grazer to try for a repeat . Take a beloved Dr. Seuss classic , stick an A - list comedian in the title role , and watch the bucks roll in . The trouble with Dr. Seuss ' Cat in the Hat is that instead of Ron Howard directing , it is Bo Welch making his big - screen directorial debut . And while this Cat looks slick ( Welch is a production designer ) , it lacks the heart that made the Grinch film so charming . Conrad ( Breslin ) and Sally ( Fanning ) are polar opposites . Conrad is constantly doing his own thing , breaking rules and finding new and unique pathways to trouble . Sally is a bossy , tightly wound control freak who is the perfect little angel to the adults around her , but a nightmare to her friends . Their mom , Joan ( Preston ) , works at a real estate agency whose hypochondriac boss ( Hayes ) has a phobia about germs , but insists his agents meet and greet clients at special monthly parties . It 's Joan 's turn to play the hostess , and the house must be absolutely immaculate or else , as the boss puts it , she 's \" FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII - UR - DUH . \" When her babysitter conks out , Joan rushes home , where her next - door neighbor and would - be paramour Quinn ( Baldwin ) hopes to marry the attractive single mom and ship off the troublesome Conrad to military school . With an admonishment to her children to keep the house spotless , Joan leaves them in the care of a new sitter ( Hill ) who turns out to be narcoleptic . And for the two bored siblings , the rain truly begins to fall outside ... which brings in a 6-foot tall Cat ( Myers ) . The Cat is all about having fun , and after some initial moments of \" scream and run , \" he befriends the two kids in an attempt to bring them into balance . Despite the protestations of a CGI fish ( voiced by Hayes ) , the Cat wreaks havoc on the house , especially after the appearance of Thing 1 and Thing 2 ( played by a phalanx of gymnasts ) . With the Things is a crate which - the Cat warns Conrad - must be left closed and locked , else the world from which the Cat in the Hat comes will encroach on this one . Naturally the rule - breaking Conrad opens the crate and gets the crab - like lock stuck on the family pooch 's collar . Said pooch promptly runs away , leading to a merry chase through town in which the suspicious Quinn follows , trying to get possession of the dog to finally bust Conrad permanently and give his mom a reason to ship the boy away . If you 've read the classic children 's book , you basically know the story and how it ends . There is a great deal more back story here , and a ton of gags , some of which are a bit more adult than Theodore Geisel might have used . Myers plays the cat as a demented cross between SNL character Linda \" Kawfee Tawk \" Richman and the Cowardly Lion ; he has moments where he is charming , but sometimes goes a bit more over - the - top than works . The kids are cute enough , but Conrad is such a jerk early on you kind of hope that he does get sent to military school - it might just do him some good . The star here is the production design - no surprise , since that 's how Welch has mostly made his living . The town of Anyville is a melding of the kitschy suburbia of Edward Scissorhands and the curved - line chaos of Whoville , with a bit of theme park architecture . Everything is in bright primary colors , not unlike the books . And while Myers is more of a Cheshire cat than the thin , angular drawing of the Seuss books , the vision is still very Seussian . But this Cat simply did n't have as much heart as it needed . These days , kid movies really need to play to adults as well , but The Cat in the Hat goes a bit overboard in that direction . Some of the jokes are inappropriate for younger children . Myers ' Cat is more of a smarmy game show host than the force of nature depicted in the book , and there is almost no charm to him . Jim Carrey brought charm to the Grinch , which helped that film work . This is a close call . It is a visually attractive movie , and there are some moments - particularly near the end - which are quite magical ; just not enough to sustain an entire movie . Given what the character has meant to children for fifty years - even the grown - up ones - that 's a shame . The kids in this movie probably could have used a good spanking - although they probably would get a time out in this day and age . The filmmakers should have gotten one as well . WHY RENT THIS : Terrific production design . A theme park come to life . WHY RENT SOMETHING ELSE : Tries too hard to appeal to all audiences . Myers does n't capture the essence of the character . A major disappointment . FAMILY MATTERS : There is a little bit of crude humor , as well as a few jokes that might raise the eyebrows of parents as being inappropriate . NOTABLE DVD FEATURES : There is a brief - very brief - featurette on Dr. Seuss , and also a feature on choosing which image to use on a U.S. Post Office Cat in the Hat stamp . For kids , there 's a dance along feature . BOX OFFICE PERFORMANCE : $ 134.0 M on a $ 109 M production budget ; the feature lost money during it 's theatrical run . Animation . Just as he was wishing for a blank slate , a mysterious new , red - haired girl moves into town . After falling hard for her , Charlie 's got to muster up the courage and do some crazy things in order to impress her and get her to notice him . While he 's doin all of that , his dog Snoopy ( thanks to Bill Melendez 's archived voice work ) finds a typewriter and begins writing about the WWI Flying Ace and his rivalry with the infamous Red Baron . First things first , Peanuts is absolutely stunning . I honestly have no idea how Blue Sky Studios managed to pull this off . Just like the film 's content , Peanuts ' visuals are both heartily nostalgic ( thanks to a few 2D flourishes like little hearts and backgrounds every now and then ) and groundbreaking in its effort . Characters move as smoothly as they would in 2D while avoiding CG 's blurring motions thanks to an adept use of choppy movement . I guess the closest thing I can compare it to is Blue Sky 's mascot Scrat ( from the Ice Age series ) . Just as his movement is broken , yet fluid so it captures the essence of old Looney Tunes shorts , Peanuts ' animation captures the essence of the TV specials . And then there are all the little details therein like Snoopy 's fur , the whiskers in Charlie 's lone curl of hair , and the Flying Ace sequences look pretty good in 3D. But once you get beyond how great it looks , you 'll soon realize that it may be too comfortable taking yet another trip down memory lane . Because it 's both a reinvention and a reintroduction to the Peanuts series , the film is almost required to make the necessary homages to its classic jokes and settings . Every classic Peanuts joke is here , quite literally , and you 'll be hard pressed to find them funny again in this new setting . These jokes have already been made available through the specials replayed through the holidays each year , so it 's really a matter of whether or not you 'll appreciate them again through this new filter . It 's a celebration unfortunately caught in the past , and while these jokes are definitely delightful and may mean more to new audiences , it 's just a shame that this new film did n't take the chance to create new memories for Charlie Brown . It 's even more glaring when the newer bits work very well . There 's this scene where Charlie is getting \" Psychiatric Help \" from Lucy that 's absolutely fabulous in how dark the writing duo of Bryan and Craig Schulz take it . At one point , she shoves a mirror in his face and asks Charlie what he sees , and all he can say in response is \" A loser . \" While it sounds wonky on paper , it 's a sequence that actually utilizes our knowledge of the characters in the past rather than be hindered by it . In fact , that 's one of the boldest choices The Peanuts Movie makes . While the humor and most of the content is stuck in the past ( thus making sequences featuring new pop music from Meghan Trainor feel even more out of place ) , Charlie Brown has actually become a mix of his many identities . The film only works because the writing , actor Noah Schnapp , and visuals have mastered this newest iteration of Charlie Brown . He 's a mix of many of his past incarnations : The outright loser from Schulz 's original comic strips . the awkward kid from the holiday specials , and the more positive Charlie from later direct to video specials . Yet with all of those influences , he 's still got his own new layer in the film . They 've added this crippling self - doubt that 's so current , it clashes with the rest of the film 's nostalgic tone . As the kids exist in a world with rotary phones , Charlie 's pondering existential crises in love . While the humor can be a bit clunky , and Charlie Brown is fantastic , the film does take some getting used to . Since it is so stuck in the past , it 's taking on a format we have n't seen in quite a while . Broken into vignettes fueling a central arc , each major sequence in Peanuts feels like it could be a stand - alone special of its own . Each major scene has a beginning middle and end , so it does n't really flow like a traditional film , per se . It 's an odd pacing that , while not entirely bad , does detract from the enjoyment overall . Going in you 've got to realize that you 're taking the good with the bad , but the \" bad \" is n't the worst thing in the world . The Peanuts Movie 's biggest flaw is that it 's too celebratory and nostalgic , but that 's also such a non - problem to have . I certainly have enjoyed myself , but I also do n't feel compelled to watch this over and over again like every other Peanuts thing I 've revisited in the past . It 's a delightful and breezy film , but I 'm not sure if everyone will have the same reaction to it that I did . It 's fun to walk down memory lane every once in a while , but you ca n't expect everyone to stick around . Good grief ? Thanks to my mom , I 've been following Charlie Brown and the Peanuts gang for as long as I can remember . Like Charlie , I too am a sad sack who 's life the universe sees fit to ruin at all cost . So when I first heard 20th Centur ... . Anomalisa may not be on your radar yet ( or if you pay attention to these things it may be ) , but it will be once award season starts coming up . Charlie Kaufman 's stop - motion animated feature has been universally praised n .. Homer 's Nightmare ( \" If I Only Had a Brain \" ) ( Treehouse of Horror II ) That 's right , the bad ones were actually off to an early start . In the same episode that brought us the great Lisa 's Nightmare and the so - so Bart 's Nightmare , we have the clunky Homer 's Nightmare . In this short , Mr. Burns is attempting to create a super worker but ends up putting Homer 's brain in that super worker so the end result is what you 'd expect . I 'll chalk this one 's badness to growing pains as it was the first true sequel in the series . The show was still trying to figure out what to do with their Halloween specials and I 'm sure every idea seemed viable . Terror at 5 1/2 Feet ( Treehouse of Horror IV ) As you 'll find out later in this list , The Simspsons does n't nail every spoof it tries . Taking on the Twilight Zone classic \" Terror at 20,000 Feet , \" this short gives Bart a little Gremlin problem . Sure there 's a good joke involving Hans Moleman , but the rest of the story is particularly rote . And in the same episode as The Devil and Homer Simpson and Bart Simpson 's Dracula , it 's egregious awfulness sticks out even more so . Maybe it 's just an average story caught in between two particularly great ones , but that 's just how the cookie crumbles . But at least it 's not as bad as everything else here . The Thing and I ( Treehouse of Horror VII ) Okay , now we 're getting into it . When Bart finds out he 's got a long lost , potentially evil twin named Hugo chained up in the basement , everything falls apart both literally and figuratively . I distinctly remember realizing these were n't going to be that great anymore . The short 's so haphazardly thrown together that it 's obvious no one involved really cares about what 's going on in it . The jokes are n't there , the premise is n't strong , and it screams laziness . Yet , it is n't the laziest story on this by far . In the Na'Vi ( Treehouse of Horror XXII ) You know how I mentioned that The Simpsons does n't nail all of its spoofs ? This is what I was referring to . Several years after Avatar hit theaters ( which made this short seem all the more depressing ) , Treehouse featured a terribly conceived Simpsons version with Bart in the lead role . Reading this list you 're probably thinking that Bart 's involvement has a lot to do with the poor quality of these stories and you 'd be right for the most part . The show never really knows what to do with him outside of his normal parameters . That 's why Bart 's always in the background of others ' stories or is paired with Lisa so the writers have someone to bounce him off of . Without that , you realize how poorly Bart 's been written in the post 20s . Master and Cadaver ( Treehouse of Horror XXI ) While the post-20 Treehouse stories have been pretty bad all around , they 're more average and bland than outright terrible . But one story manages to tip over that line into a story that 's so bad it brings the rest of the special down . In traditional Simpsons , but non - traditional Treehouse , fashion the man poised no real threat and it 's all a series of explainable coincidences . It 's just so darn boring . More so than season 20 era Simpsons , more so than weak Lisa episodes , I 'm glad this story 's so short . The reason it 's not higher on the list is because it 's thankfully over before it 's begun . Untitled Robot Parody ( Treehouse of Horror XIX ) So here we have the laziest Treehouse of Horror short in series history . It 's so lethargic , they did n't even think to give it a name . A terribly conceived Transformers spoof that 's neither funny ( complete with a rote sex toy transformer joke ) nor even has a reason to exist . This blurb is more attention that this short even deserves . You Got ta Know When to Golem ( Treehouse of Horror XVIII ) Introducing a little used movie monster to the Treehouse format seems fit for a good time but , like the 1915 film it 's based on , this story 's stuck entirely in the past . A story with jokes rooted in dated Jewish sterotypes ever further aggravated by casting Richard Lewis and Fran Drescher as caricatures of themselves , Golem is just a bad idea that somehow made it to air . I do n't even know who this short was for , but this kind of insular comedy is what deters fans from the series . Then again , thanks to bottom three stories , fans have walked away years ago . Frinkenstein ( Treehouse of Horror XIV ) Ugh . Hex and the City ( Treehouse of Horror XII ) It took me years to see this one all the way through because I hated this special so much . In fact , I never saw how XII ended until about six years ago when I decided to run through a good chunk of the Treehouse specials . In Hex and the City , Homer angers a gypsy and is cursed for life ( resulting in Marge 's beard , Bart 's long neck , and Lisa 's horse legs ) . His response is to sick a lepraechaun on her resulting in their wholly gross union . It 's entirely asinine and coupled with the episode 's other bland shorts like Wiz Kids and this seemed even worse overall . It has to be the worst opening story in Treehouse history . Starship Poopers ( Treehouse of Horror IX ) Okay , so I 've got quite the problem with Starship Poopers . First of all , it 's a terrible final story for a special that was n't bad so the nosedive is even more noticeable . Secondly , it was incredibly dated then ( yes even more so than Citizen Kang , which was rooted in 90s politics ) and even more so now . I mean , the short ends with an entirely too long Jerry Springer riff . By the time the short aired , Springer was already on his way out so it seemed even more desperate than I 'm sure was intended . There 's so much more I want to say , but I just ca n't do it anymore . It was the blurst of times You know , it 's always great to reminisce about The Simpsons in their heyday but in order to truly celebrate the Halloween holiday , we need to talk about some truly horrific things : The awful Treehouse of Horror specials . Sure ... . The Peanuts Movie is either going to destroy an American classic or revitalize it . I 'm not sure it really needed revitalizing as the holiday cartoons are still constantly watched every year , but maybe it does . The animat ... . The Day the Earth Looked Stupid ( Treehouse of Horror XVII ) \" Oh yeah ? Why do n't I punch you in the nose , bud ? \" \" ... Nosebud ... \" Folks may have counted out much of the later seasons , and while I 'd be inclined to agree for the most part , a few good episodes always manage to go unnoticed . XVII was one of the last good Treehouse specials before they took a dive in the 20s , and it went out on a high . The show 's film spoofs do n't always work , but I absolutely loved this one . Maurice LaMarche put on his best Orson Welles again as the classic play ended up duping Springfield into wallowing in the dirt like animals . It does n't make any sense , it looks great , and it 's so perfectly Simpsons . Mostly because it actually nails the ending , which is something these specials always struggle with , as the episode ends with the bleak and soft The Ink Spots ' \" I Do n't Want to Set the World on Fire . \" Send in the Clones ( Treehouse of Horror XIII ) \" Homer I must say , you 've had the energy of twenty men lately ! \" \" Twenty three ! \" I do n't what it is , but seeing a group of Homers play off each other is incredibly satisfying . A natural progression of Homer 's self - deprecating humor , laziness , and superiority complex creates an army of clones that only want donuts and for Lenny to pick up the tab at Moe 's ( \" Anything for Homers ! \" ) This segment 's also jam packed with jokes from the randomness of killing Flanders and \" Paul Newman 's gon na have my legs broke ! , \" sights gags like Season One Homer and Peter Griffin , to the fact it all started because of a magic hammock . It 's stupid Homer x 1000 and it turned out pretty well . Homer3 ( Treehouse of Horror VI ) \" It 's like something outta that twilighty show about that zone ... \" VI was fantastic all around . Attack of the 50 ft Eyesores and Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace were both pretty good , but I 've got to hand it to the segment that blew my mind as a kid . Of course it earns its place on the list because it holds up beyond its 3D gimmick because it 's pretty funny ( \" May I take your coat ? \" \" Uh , can I also take your coat ? \" ) , but it 's hard to gush about its visuals . CG pretty much unheard of in 1995 , so the show was able to mine the relatively new technology for comedy . It may not exactly be like Tron ( which no one has seen , apparently ) , but it 's close enough . Also , the bit where Homer shows up in our world still blows my mind . I do n't know how they pulled it off back then , but I 'm glad they spent all of that money on an erotic cake joke . Citizen Kang ( Treehouse of Horror VII ) \" Abortions for some , miniature American flags for all of us ! \" You would hope the political jokes in Citizen Kang would n't ring as true 19 years later , but like most things , the Simpsons predicted a lot of things . Although the candidates are dated , you can replace them with pretty much anyone and it 'll still work . So go ahead , throw your vote away ! The Homega Man ( Treehouse of Horror VIII ) \" I 'm the last man alive and I can do everything I 've always wanted ! \" Treehouse segments are full of movie parodies , but one of the stories that absolutely nails it is this one . Parodying 1971 's The Omega Man , which itself was adapted from Richard Matthenson 's novel I Am Legend , this short stars Homer as the last man alive in Springfield after the French ( \" Stupid frogs . \" ) bomb them for their remarks . After Homer enjoys the time alone , he realizes he 's not truly alone and every second is so funny . There 's a hidden joy in noting how long it takes Homer to realize everyone 's dead . In fact I love this segment so much , I 'm thinking of getting a tattoo on my arm of \" the rest . \" Night of the Dolphin ( Treehouse of Horror XI ) \" Snorky ... talk ... man ... \" What ? A segment from the double digits in the top five ? Absolutely ! On top of the great send ups to random monster horror films ( think films like Black Sheep ) , there are plenty of laughs . Especially when the end of the story sees the town in a big fight with the dolphins before their hilarious loss . It 's always in my annual rotation each year . The Devil and Homer Simpson ( Treehouse of Horror IV ) \" Mmm ... forbidden donut ... \" These next few stories definitely fall into the line of \" classic \" Simpsons episodes that folks like to reference over and over again . It 's for good reason as The Devil and Homer Simpsons absolutely holds up to this day . A tight story where Homer makes a deal with the devil that manages to squeeze in a lot within its short run time . Random John Wayne gags ( \" I 'm already up \" ) , a great showing from Lionel Hutz , Blackbeard in a high chair , and of course , \" But I 'm so sweet and tasty ! \" Dial ' Z ' for Zombies ( Treehouse of Horror III ) \" Dad , you killed the zombie Flanders ! \" \" He was a zombie ? \" I feel like the only way I can fully appreciate this is by quoting it endlessly : \" To the book depository ! \" \" Is this the end of zombie Shakespeare ? \" \" John Smith 1882 ? \" \" My mistake ! \" The zombies that plagued our town are now just corpses rotting in the streets . \" \" Yay ! \" So good . The Raven ( The Simpsons Halloween Special / Treehouse of Horror ) \" Quoth the Raven ... ' Nevermore . ' \" The Simpsons first began their Halloween special tradition back in season two , and it made sure to leave a lasting impression . Despite the many years gone by , this short sticks with me far more than anything else . Although it 's not the best one ( since it 's hard to give the episode total credit for its success ) , it 's definitely the most distinct . Putting visuals ( and Simpson personality thanks entirely through Dan Castellaneta 's performance ) to Poe 's famous poem vigorously read by the magnanimous James Earl Jones , this short was actually how I was introduced to Poe 's work . That 's something a lot of these better stories have done too . Inspired by how much I enjoyed the parody , I often sought out the original works . That 's especially true of the final entry on this list . Treehouse of Horror V \" This is indeed a disturbing universe . \" So this is a bit of a cheat considering I said that I 'd limit my choices to one story per episode , but after deciding on my favorite Treehouse of Horror I could n't really decide on my favorite of the three stories . As each special usually has a weak story or two , it 's incredibly rare to have three incredibly strong segments . Couple that with a running joke of Willie getting axed in the back and you 've even got a unified special to boot . From its highly quotable Shining parody , The Shinning \" No TV and no beer make Homer something something . \" \" Go crazy ? \" \" Do n't mind if I do ! , \" to the well written Time and Punishment ( \" Oh I wish I wish I had n't killed that fish . \" \" That 's right Mr. Peabody ! \" \" Quiet you ! \" \" What the hell are you smiling at ? , \" and the one story that managed to give me nightmares as a kid , Nightmare Cafeteria ( \" Now you march into that school , look your teacher straight in the eye and say ' Do n't eat me ! ' It 's definitely the best Halloween special Simpsons has to offer , and suffice to say , it 's also one of the best episodes of the series . Then again , regardless of which The Simpsons ' Treehouse of Horror specials you decide to revisit this Halloween you 'll have a good time ... unless you pick one of the blurst ones . It was the best of times ... I 've invested the greater part of my life into The Simpsons , and while there may have been more downs than ups lately , it 's still consistently bringing me laughs with each offering . Most of them happen to come with their annu ... . Oct 20 // John - Charles Holmes [ embed]220007:42656:0[/embed ] Rick and Morty 's debut season still stands as one of the biggest surprises out of Adult Swim to date . The channel is usually known for its one - note ideas ( Adult Johnny Quest ! The dog is also Satan ! This cop is a literal ass ! ) , but the new show from animator Justin Roiland and cancellation legend Dan Harmon rose far above its parody roots of an alcohol fueled Back to the Future . Not only did the show develop a wittingly self - aware voice for itself , but episodes occasionally dipped their toes into some pretty dark concepts like chaos theory , family abandonment , and even desensitization through the pursuit of knowledge - but only just a little at first . If season one is where Rick and Morty got audience acclimated to what strange ideas it had to offer , season two are those exact same ideas put into full practice with absolutely no restraint . Where season two holds up best is in how the show is actually structured a bit more like a typical show , but much to its benefit . Whereas the first season left all the fantastic adventures to the mostly drunk mad scientist Rick and his stammering grandson , Morty , the new season gets the entire Smith family involved in more of the weirdness . The biggest benefit being that Morty 's older sister , Summer , makes more appearances in every episode and even gets some great A - stories , making a more competent pairing with Rick than the idiotic Morty . At the same time , the new episodes also took their bizarre ideas even further . The season premiers with Rick , Morty , and Summer actually ripping the space - time continuum into multiple realities , displayed by slicing the screen right down the middle . This repeats until the episode actually climaxes into 64 different screens at once and staying that way until the anomaly gets resolved . In any other show , an idea this crazy would be enough to confuse and alienate an audience away for good , but Rick and Morty embraces this and draws us in even closer with just how ostentatiously crazy it 's willing to get . How crazy ? The season does run a little disappointingly short at just ten 22-minute episodes , but then again , leaving us wanting more is a sign that a show 's doing something right . Many fans may be disappointed that only a few one - off characters from the first season make returns , but this can be forgiven just for how many new characters from Rick 's varied past . The best of which is arguably an appearance from Stephen Colbert in the episode \" The Ricks Must Be Crazy . \" Colbert plays Zeep , a skeptical alien scientist who lives the world of a battery that Rick invents to fuel his ramshackle spaceship . When Zeep discovers that his entire world exists just to power a battery , he turns on Rick and Morty and tries to escape to wreck vengeance on their universe . For as much fun as the show has with itself this year , it does end many of the episodes with the same shockingly dark overtones as the infamous \" Rick Potion # 9 \" episode from the first season . Much of the ruthlessness and directionless suicidal depression of Rick is teased throughout the entire season as well as the effect that his self - destructive life has had on his daughter , Beth and the rest of the Smith family . This all leads up to a phenomenal finale where it finally comes to a head with an amazing emotional payoff . If the big question of season one was \" does Rick truly love Morty , \" season two asks if the family really needs Rick or if he 's the one dependent on them . The season does end on a massive cliffhanger , though , so it stands to beg if we even get a final answer by the end of the tenth episode . The stakes are raised , the world of the show has changed dramatically , and many sacrifices are made along the way . Rick and Mortyrivals another show for the most intense television wedding by the end of it all . So is Rick and Morty season two worth watching ? Most definitely , yes . A lot of the show is still pretty the same as before - the same unrestrained raunchiness , the same direct nods to obscure sci - fi productions , and the same disgustingly beautiful designs , it 's all there . Where it does improve though , is in the writing and in its use of characters . By the time the season had wrapped up this fall , the clunkiness of some of the first season 's episodes could be seen when compared to the stronger and more economical stories of the second . If you found the writing of the first season awkward or off - putting , the second may just have more of the meaningful stories you were looking for out of Rick and Morty . After all , this is the show that has Werner Herzog going on an entire monologue about how depressing the human race 's obsession with penises is , and honestly , where else on television or film are you going to find that ?

If you have played it and do n't understand how incredible it is , go play it again . Maybe read Brendan Keogh 's Killing Is Harmless while you do . The game is a triumph , and the bravest thing it did is to convince you it was generic before pulling the rug out from under you . ( Much like , you guess it , Bojack Horseman . ) Spec Ops : The Line was made with the Unreal Engine . It stars a military man voiced by Nolan North . He looks and sounds like every other Unreal Engine - based cover shooter out there . It feels ... fine . The gameplay is completely and totally acceptable . Stop and pop . You 're fighting generic foreign militants . The other . It 's easy to kill them , because that 's what you 're used to doing . That 's the role that these sorts of people play in video games . ( And in movies , as brilliantly profiled by GQ a couple weeks ago . ) In Bojack Horseman , you follow a generic former - Hollywoo[d ] superstar . He 's voiced by Will Arnett , and he 's a jackass . He lives in an amazing house overlooking the city , but he 's pretty much a worthless being . On his couch lives the \" comic relief , \" Todd , voiced by Aaron Paul . He 's dumb , but Bojack keeps him around , because ... whatever . Bojack wants to relive the Good Old Days . Perhaps it 's not quite your typical animated show , but it 's not an uncommon comedy . And for a while , the jokes are funny but the underlying narrative feels a little old . But , of course , that 's the point . Spec Ops hits you with big moments several times . First , you go from fighting generic \" terrorists \" to fighting US military . That 's , well , unexpected . And then there 's the scene where you have to do something horrible to progress that turns out to be something really horrible . It keeps going down ( literally ) , as we follow Captain Walker into the deep recesses of his mind . And it 's not a great place to be . Because Captain Walker is not a good person . He believes he is , or at least that he can be , but he is n't . And he leaves nothing but destruction in his wake . Throughout , the game taunts you , and it taunts hyper - violent games in general . ( And yes , it is effectively critiquing the genre by \" succumbing \" to its tropes . ) [ embed]219724:42537:0[/embed ] Bojack does n't have that moment in quite the same way , at least in its first season . It 's a gradual realization that what you 're watching is n't quite what you thought it was . You thought you were getting a comedy - of - sorts about a former star who wants to relive his glory days . What you get is something far darker , and far more interesting . Because Bojack Horseman is definitely not a good ... horse . ( I 'm going to call him a person from now on , because referring to him as a \" horse \" is weird . ) He wants to be good , I guess , but behind him lies only chaos . And in the second season especially , he does some very , very bad things . The Verge posted their review of the show 's second season a bit prematurely , I thought . Both the headline - \" In its second season , Bojack Horseman quits beating a depressed horse \" - and subtitle - \" More animal puns , less animal pathos \" - prove to be , um , false . Because the second season of Bojack Horseman tricks you again . Sure , watching the first few episodes ( which are great , by the way ) , you might think that the show had changed and become perhaps a bit more whimsical . Watching the episode where Todd creates his own , extremely dangerous Disneyland ( and wins a lawsuit allowing him to use that name on a technicality ) lulls you into a false sense of security . This is a show that has found its groove , or something like it . That groove may not be as interesting as the previous season , but it 's something . And the screeners that Netflix sent to critics beforehand would lend credence to that . The first six episodes , especially in comparison , are fun . They 're light and silly . And then there 's \" Hank After Dark . \" \" Hank After Dark \" is an incredible episode of television . And it 's incredible not just because of what it but how absolutely bleak its ending is . At this point , everyone knows about the downfall of Bill Cosby . And it all started because of a joke by comedian Hannibal Buress . He made a joke about public information , and suddenly everything came crashing down . The time since has been incredibly disturbing , and each new bit of evidence has only made it worse . Diane is on a book tour for Bojack , but she ca n't shut Pandora 's Box once she 's opened it . Mr. Peanutbutter asks her to hold off , and everyone else tells her she 's a horrible person for defaming a good man 's name . She keeps fighting , until she 's confronted by Hank Hippopopalous himself . And then she gives up . The season does n't get cheerier after that . Whether it 's the intense discussion on live TV between Mr. Peanutbutter and Bojack about the latter 's Diane come - on last season or the thing that happens in the penultimate episode , the back half of Bojack Horseman 's second season hits and hits hard . To be sure , the show continues to be very funny . There are more than a few good laughs per episode , but aside from a couple bits here and there , those are n't the things I 'll be thinking about in a year from now . Good TV makes you think , perhaps even obsess . But with Bojack Horseman , it 's not some communal obsession with unraveling mysteries . It 's an introspective sort of obsession . Do you see yourself in Bojack ? What about Todd or Mr. Peanutbutter or Diane or Princess Carolyn ? These characters are all fleshed out this season , and you learn fascinating things about all of them . ( Princess Carolyn has a particularly interesting arc , and I can not tell you how glad I was when they ended the Vincent Adultman subplot early on . ) But , of course , the focus is on Bojack , on his inability to change course . His drive to push forward towards certain doom . And that is truly where Bojack and Captain Walker 's journeys converge . Both of them set in motions series of events that can only end badly , but the decision to set them in motion was a choice . Maybe at the time it did n't feel like one , but it was . To point to what is perhaps the most obvious example , Bojack did not have to up and leave to see a girl he was sort of in love with decades ago . He did n't have to stay with her family when he found out she had one . He did n't have to ... ya know . He could have walked away . And ultimately , that 's what Spec Ops : The Line is about . It 's about walking away , or at least the need to walk away ( in a meta sense ) . Walker does n't do that . He never stops to think about what he 's doing or what he 's done . Unlike Bojack , he thinks he 's helping people ( at least at first ... by the end ? who knows ) . Of course , the road to hell is paved with good intentions . Bojack Horseman matters . It 's one of the best shows on television right now . Literally . And that 's significant not just because it is in and of itself a significant statement . It 's significant because it 's a show that , on the face of it , is so easy to dismiss . But once you get past all of that , you 're pulled along for a fascinating and often poignant journey through something truly great . It 's not the thing you expect , but you eventually realize that it 's exactly what you wanted . Subversion and sadness The first season of Bojack Horseman sort of came out of nowhere , at least as far as I was concerned . Back then , I was underemployed and watched pretty much anything that seemed vaguely interesting . I generally trust ... . I stand by blu - rays for two types of movies-- colorfully visual movies and animated productions . It goes without saying that the films of Studio Ghibli are some of the best looking to make the jump to HD since the films start ... . Our first peak at The Good Dinosaur did n't give us much to go on , but it definitely wet our whistle for something that looks drastically different from previous Pixar films . Now , with this new trailer , we know it looks d .. Attaching themselves to whatever evil creature they could find , they tried to serve as the best henchman they could until their boss ' inevitable end . Lost and listless , minions Kevin , Stuart , and Bob set out across the world in order to find a new boss . That search leads them to Scarlet and Herb Overkill ( Sandra Bullock and Jon Hamm ) the top of the villain food chain who want to steal the Queen of England 's crown . All of this , of course , leads to the same kind of yellow tinged shenanigans you know and possibly love . When this was first announced , I had a few hang ups . I really enjoyed the Despicable Me films , but the minions were always a side bit that I never quite attached to . Originally written into the films in order to make Gru more likable , they 're the epitome of easy kids ' jokes . And that 's kind of true here . Thankfully , there 's at least an attempt to give Minions the same amount of heart as the rest of the series . Once you get used to the long stretches of minion language - less dialogue , there 's some nice character development here ... but you 've got to figure it out for yourself . Kevin , Stuart , and Bob all have some unique personality traits ( Kevin is the responsible one , Stuart is the party one , and Bob is the young and cuddly one ) but do n't go further than the surface level . Geared more toward children than ever , this film is light in both plot and all - ages humor . Thankfully the film is just a breeze , and it 's over way before you start thinking about it . At the very least , the main trio is built well enough that you 'll emotionally invest in them long enough to follow through the film 's short stint . Though I 'm sure these minions are reaching a point of diminishing returns ( hopefully there 's no plan to keep these solo films going ) that their shenanigans wo n't be able to sustain a film on their own much longer . This one 's barely held together by the skin of its teeth . The human cast is fantastic , and they 're a breath of fresh air in between all of the shenanigans . Sandra Bullock and Jon Ham completely commit to the film 's nutty nature , and both of them need more roles where they 're allowed to chew the scenery as goofy bad guys . Bullock seems to enjoy her role the most , but close runner ups are folks like Michael Keaton and Alison Janney who 're criminally underutilized . Maybe casting such big names just to give them a bit part is part of the film 's slight meta humor . But that might be giving the film too much credit . At the end of the day , Minions is n't made for you or me , but for the kids . But as I 've argued every time I review one of these animated films , it 's time to expect better for your kids . Sure not every animated film can , or needs to be , like Pixar , but if we keep paying for things like this they 'll keep churning them out for an easy buck . It 's a flavor of the month film that 'll definitely be forgotten once the next big cute thing comes along . Minions is not as terrible as I expected , but it 's far from great . But whatever , your kids'll love how cute it is . Papaya banana blah blah Whether or not you 've seen the Despicable Me movies , you definitely know who these little twinkie looking guys are .

Jun 19 // Matthew Razak [ embed]219580:42445:0[/embed ] Inside OutDirectors : Pete Docter , Ronaldo Del Carmen Rated : PGRelease Date : June 19 , 2015 The plot of inside out is easy , and it 's been tackled before . The movie is the story of the emotions who reside inside a girl named Riley 's ( Kaitlyn Dias ) head . There 's Joy ( Amy Poheler ) , Sadness ( Phyllis Smith ) , Anger ( Lewis Black ) , Fear ( Bill Hader ) and Disgust ( Mindy Kaling ) . Everything is going pretty swimmingly for Riley and her emotions until one day the family has to move triggering a flood of sadness in what was a perpetually happy girl . Joy , panicking after a particularly sad moment becomes a key memory , gets herself and sadness sucked out of headquarters and into the nether regions of Riley 's brain . The two must find their way back with the help of Riley 's old imaginary friend , Bing Bong ( Richard Kind ) , as Anger , Fear and Disgust attempt to hold the fort down with disastrous consequences . If there is a limit to Pixar 's wonderful imagination they have n't found it yet . Just when you thought the studio was going to sit back and rest on its laurels an entirely original and creative movie like Inside Out gets made . They deliver a film that has the emotional impact of the beginning of Up and yet somehow still make it fun and enjoyable . They 've taken universal emotions and turned them into a children 's film that somehow delivers a commentary on sadness that 's more powerful than most overwrought dramas . The film is a lesson in how to address serious subjects while still having fun . The screenplay is brilliant and honed to a fine point . Inside Out 's story could be an overly complex and melodramatic mess , but it 's crafted to a fine point . Reigning in the chaos of two separate worlds , a plethora of characters and a bunch of complex ideas the film masterfully weaves its story . The juxtaposition of the comical Anger , Fear and Disgust at the helm of a young girl 's brain with the real world reactions to that is powerful . It delivers a film that tackles depression and loss in ways that never get melodramatic or cheesy . Somehow in a children 's film we find some true heart . That heart is going to make you cry . I do n't care how much of a tough guy you are Pixar is going to worm its way into your heart and then play those strings like a classical guitar . Part of this is because they 're just so damn good at it , but another aspect is the fact that Inside Out 's themes are so universal . We 've all been right where Riley is at some point in our life and Pixar has put that on the big screen in a way that is not only relatable , but enjoyable . Often films involving sadness only involve that , but the entire point of Inside Out is that our emotions are all mixed together . Sadness and happiness are n't competing forces , they lead to each other . For a film directed at children this is some of the most adult dealings with emotion I 've seen . The movie may also be Pixar 's most stunning visually . It 's definitely a departure from their usual style , though not entirely removed . It simply looks brilliant and is constantly getting more and more creative with its visuals throughout . Joy is especially well designed as her body constantly shines with happiness . Meanwhile Sadness somehow seems to drip with the emotion . At one point the characters are reduced to abstract thoughts in a brilliant and clever animation sequence that just highlights what Pixar can do . My only concern with the film is that it over simplifies things . Depression and emotional issues are immensely complex medical issues . Inside Out by its very nature does n't delve into that as much as it could and it may leave some who have been through these things shaking their heads . That being said it 's still an incredibly accessible doorway to talk about emotions and change . Humanity as a whole is often remiss in discussing what we 're feeling and Inside Out gives us a chance to say , \" Yea , I 've felt like that before . \" It does this not by being overbearing in its message , but by inviting you in to enjoy it . So there are some words on Inside Out . They 're OK . I still do n't think I got it right . I guess the only words I really need to write are : see this movie . Pixar 's best ?

When they knocked a third film out of the park when everyone ... . Just as he was wishing for a blank slate , a mysterious new , red - haired girl moves into town . After falling hard for her , Charlie 's got to muster up the courage and do some crazy things in order to impress her and get her to notice him . While he 's doin all of that , his dog Snoopy ( thanks to Bill Melendez 's archived voice work ) finds a typewriter and begins writing about the WWI Flying Ace and his rivalry with the infamous Red Baron . First things first , Peanuts is absolutely stunning . I honestly have no idea how Blue Sky Studios managed to pull this off . Just like the film 's content , Peanuts ' visuals are both heartily nostalgic ( thanks to a few 2D flourishes like little hearts and backgrounds every now and then ) and groundbreaking in its effort . Characters move as smoothly as they would in 2D while avoiding CG 's blurring motions thanks to an adept use of choppy movement . I guess the closest thing I can compare it to is Blue Sky 's mascot Scrat ( from the Ice Age series ) . Just as his movement is broken , yet fluid so it captures the essence of old Looney Tunes shorts , Peanuts ' animation captures the essence of the TV specials . And then there are all the little details therein like Snoopy 's fur , the whiskers in Charlie 's lone curl of hair , and the Flying Ace sequences look pretty good in 3D. But once you get beyond how great it looks , you 'll soon realize that it may be too comfortable taking yet another trip down memory lane . Because it 's both a reinvention and a reintroduction to the Peanuts series , the film is almost required to make the necessary homages to its classic jokes and settings . Every classic Peanuts joke is here , quite literally , and you 'll be hard pressed to find them funny again in this new setting . These jokes have already been made available through the specials replayed through the holidays each year , so it 's really a matter of whether or not you 'll appreciate them again through this new filter . It 's a celebration unfortunately caught in the past , and while these jokes are definitely delightful and may mean more to new audiences , it 's just a shame that this new film did n't take the chance to create new memories for Charlie Brown . It 's even more glaring when the newer bits work very well . There 's this scene where Charlie is getting \" Psychiatric Help \" from Lucy that 's absolutely fabulous in how dark the writing duo of Bryan and Craig Schulz take it . At one point , she shoves a mirror in his face and asks Charlie what he sees , and all he can say in response is \" A loser . \" While it sounds wonky on paper , it 's a sequence that actually utilizes our knowledge of the characters in the past rather than be hindered by it . In fact , that 's one of the boldest choices The Peanuts Movie makes . While the humor and most of the content is stuck in the past ( thus making sequences featuring new pop music from Meghan Trainor feel even more out of place ) , Charlie Brown has actually become a mix of his many identities . The film only works because the writing , actor Noah Schnapp , and visuals have mastered this newest iteration of Charlie Brown . He 's a mix of many of his past incarnations : The outright loser from Schulz 's original comic strips . the awkward kid from the holiday specials , and the more positive Charlie from later direct to video specials . Yet with all of those influences , he 's still got his own new layer in the film . They 've added this crippling self - doubt that 's so current , it clashes with the rest of the film 's nostalgic tone . As the kids exist in a world with rotary phones , Charlie 's pondering existential crises in love . While the humor can be a bit clunky , and Charlie Brown is fantastic , the film does take some getting used to . Since it is so stuck in the past , it 's taking on a format we have n't seen in quite a while . Broken into vignettes fueling a central arc , each major sequence in Peanuts feels like it could be a stand - alone special of its own . Each major scene has a beginning middle and end , so it does n't really flow like a traditional film , per se . It 's an odd pacing that , while not entirely bad , does detract from the enjoyment overall . Going in you 've got to realize that you 're taking the good with the bad , but the \" bad \" is n't the worst thing in the world . The Peanuts Movie 's biggest flaw is that it 's too celebratory and nostalgic , but that 's also such a non - problem to have . I certainly have enjoyed myself , but I also do n't feel compelled to watch this over and over again like every other Peanuts thing I 've revisited in the past . It 's a delightful and breezy film , but I 'm not sure if everyone will have the same reaction to it that I did . It 's fun to walk down memory lane every once in a while , but you ca n't expect everyone to stick around . Good grief ? Thanks to my mom , I 've been following Charlie Brown and the Peanuts gang for as long as I can remember . Like Charlie , I too am a sad sack who 's life the universe sees fit to ruin at all cost .

Homer 's Nightmare ( \" If I Only Had a Brain \" ) ( Treehouse of Horror II ) That 's right , the bad ones were actually off to an early start . In the same episode that brought us the great Lisa 's Nightmare and the so - so Bart 's Nightmare , we have the clunky Homer 's Nightmare . In this short , Mr. Burns is attempting to create a super worker but ends up putting Homer 's brain in that super worker so the end result is what you 'd expect . I 'll chalk this one 's badness to growing pains as it was the first true sequel in the series . The show was still trying to figure out what to do with their Halloween specials and I 'm sure every idea seemed viable . Terror at 5 1/2 Feet ( Treehouse of Horror IV ) As you 'll find out later in this list , The Simspsons does n't nail every spoof it tries . Taking on the Twilight Zone classic \" Terror at 20,000 Feet , \" this short gives Bart a little Gremlin problem . Sure there 's a good joke involving Hans Moleman , but the rest of the story is particularly rote . And in the same episode as The Devil and Homer Simpson and Bart Simpson 's Dracula , it 's egregious awfulness sticks out even more so . Maybe it 's just an average story caught in between two particularly great ones , but that 's just how the cookie crumbles . But at least it 's not as bad as everything else here . The Thing and I ( Treehouse of Horror VII ) Okay , now we 're getting into it . When Bart finds out he 's got a long lost , potentially evil twin named Hugo chained up in the basement , everything falls apart both literally and figuratively . I distinctly remember realizing these were n't going to be that great anymore . The short 's so haphazardly thrown together that it 's obvious no one involved really cares about what 's going on in it . The jokes are n't there , the premise is n't strong , and it screams laziness . Yet , it is n't the laziest story on this by far . In the Na'Vi ( Treehouse of Horror XXII ) You know how I mentioned that The Simpsons does n't nail all of its spoofs ? This is what I was referring to . Several years after Avatar hit theaters ( which made this short seem all the more depressing ) , Treehouse featured a terribly conceived Simpsons version with Bart in the lead role . Reading this list you 're probably thinking that Bart 's involvement has a lot to do with the poor quality of these stories and you 'd be right for the most part . The show never really knows what to do with him outside of his normal parameters . That 's why Bart 's always in the background of others ' stories or is paired with Lisa so the writers have someone to bounce him off of . Without that , you realize how poorly Bart 's been written in the post 20s . Master and Cadaver ( Treehouse of Horror XXI ) While the post-20 Treehouse stories have been pretty bad all around , they 're more average and bland than outright terrible . But one story manages to tip over that line into a story that 's so bad it brings the rest of the special down . In traditional Simpsons , but non - traditional Treehouse , fashion the man poised no real threat and it 's all a series of explainable coincidences . It 's just so darn boring . More so than season 20 era Simpsons , more so than weak Lisa episodes , I 'm glad this story 's so short . The reason it 's not higher on the list is because it 's thankfully over before it 's begun . Untitled Robot Parody ( Treehouse of Horror XIX ) So here we have the laziest Treehouse of Horror short in series history . It 's so lethargic , they did n't even think to give it a name . A terribly conceived Transformers spoof that 's neither funny ( complete with a rote sex toy transformer joke ) nor even has a reason to exist . This blurb is more attention that this short even deserves . You Got ta Know When to Golem ( Treehouse of Horror XVIII ) Introducing a little used movie monster to the Treehouse format seems fit for a good time but , like the 1915 film it 's based on , this story 's stuck entirely in the past . A story with jokes rooted in dated Jewish sterotypes ever further aggravated by casting Richard Lewis and Fran Drescher as caricatures of themselves , Golem is just a bad idea that somehow made it to air . I do n't even know who this short was for , but this kind of insular comedy is what deters fans from the series . Then again , thanks to bottom three stories , fans have walked away years ago . Frinkenstein ( Treehouse of Horror XIV ) Ugh . Hex and the City ( Treehouse of Horror XII ) It took me years to see this one all the way through because I hated this special so much . In fact , I never saw how XII ended until about six years ago when I decided to run through a good chunk of the Treehouse specials . In Hex and the City , Homer angers a gypsy and is cursed for life ( resulting in Marge 's beard , Bart 's long neck , and Lisa 's horse legs ) . His response is to sick a lepraechaun on her resulting in their wholly gross union . It 's entirely asinine and coupled with the episode 's other bland shorts like Wiz Kids and this seemed even worse overall . It has to be the worst opening story in Treehouse history . Starship Poopers ( Treehouse of Horror IX ) Okay , so I 've got quite the problem with Starship Poopers . First of all , it 's a terrible final story for a special that was n't bad so the nosedive is even more noticeable . Secondly , it was incredibly dated then ( yes even more so than Citizen Kang , which was rooted in 90s politics ) and even more so now . I mean , the short ends with an entirely too long Jerry Springer riff . By the time the short aired , Springer was already on his way out so it seemed even more desperate than I 'm sure was intended . There 's so much more I want to say , but I just ca n't do it anymore . It was the blurst of times You know , it 's always great to reminisce about The Simpsons in their heyday but in order to truly celebrate the Halloween holiday , we need to talk about some truly horrific things : The awful Treehouse of Horror specials . Sure ... . The Peanuts Movie is either going to destroy an American classic or revitalize it . I 'm not sure it really needed revitalizing as the holiday cartoons are still constantly watched every year , but maybe it does . The animat ... . The Day the Earth Looked Stupid ( Treehouse of Horror XVII ) \" Oh yeah ? Why do n't I punch you in the nose , bud ? \" \" ... Nosebud ... \" Folks may have counted out much of the later seasons , and while I 'd be inclined to agree for the most part , a few good episodes always manage to go unnoticed . XVII was one of the last good Treehouse specials before they took a dive in the 20s , and it went out on a high . The show 's film spoofs do n't always work , but I absolutely loved this one . Maurice LaMarche put on his best Orson Welles again as the classic play ended up duping Springfield into wallowing in the dirt like animals . It does n't make any sense , it looks great , and it 's so perfectly Simpsons . Mostly because it actually nails the ending , which is something these specials always struggle with , as the episode ends with the bleak and soft The Ink Spots ' \" I Do n't Want to Set the World on Fire . \" Send in the Clones ( Treehouse of Horror XIII ) \" Homer I must say , you 've had the energy of twenty men lately ! \" \" Twenty three ! \" I do n't what it is , but seeing a group of Homers play off each other is incredibly satisfying . A natural progression of Homer 's self - deprecating humor , laziness , and superiority complex creates an army of clones that only want donuts and for Lenny to pick up the tab at Moe 's ( \" Anything for Homers ! \" ) This segment 's also jam packed with jokes from the randomness of killing Flanders and \" Paul Newman 's gon na have my legs broke ! , \" sights gags like Season One Homer and Peter Griffin , to the fact it all started because of a magic hammock . It 's stupid Homer x 1000 and it turned out pretty well . Homer3 ( Treehouse of Horror VI ) \" It 's like something outta that twilighty show about that zone ... \" VI was fantastic all around . Attack of the 50 ft Eyesores and Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace were both pretty good , but I 've got to hand it to the segment that blew my mind as a kid . Of course it earns its place on the list because it holds up beyond its 3D gimmick because it 's pretty funny ( \" May I take your coat ? \" \" Uh , can I also take your coat ? \" ) , but it 's hard to gush about its visuals . CG pretty much unheard of in 1995 , so the show was able to mine the relatively new technology for comedy . It may not exactly be like Tron ( which no one has seen , apparently ) , but it 's close enough . Also , the bit where Homer shows up in our world still blows my mind . I do n't know how they pulled it off back then , but I 'm glad they spent all of that money on an erotic cake joke . Citizen Kang ( Treehouse of Horror VII ) \" Abortions for some , miniature American flags for all of us ! \" You would hope the political jokes in Citizen Kang would n't ring as true 19 years later , but like most things , the Simpsons predicted a lot of things . Although the candidates are dated , you can replace them with pretty much anyone and it 'll still work . So go ahead , throw your vote away ! The Homega Man ( Treehouse of Horror VIII ) \" I 'm the last man alive and I can do everything I 've always wanted ! \" Treehouse segments are full of movie parodies , but one of the stories that absolutely nails it is this one . Parodying 1971 's The Omega Man , which itself was adapted from Richard Matthenson 's novel I Am Legend , this short stars Homer as the last man alive in Springfield after the French ( \" Stupid frogs . \" ) bomb them for their remarks . After Homer enjoys the time alone , he realizes he 's not truly alone and every second is so funny . There 's a hidden joy in noting how long it takes Homer to realize everyone 's dead . In fact I love this segment so much , I 'm thinking of getting a tattoo on my arm of \" the rest . \" Night of the Dolphin ( Treehouse of Horror XI ) \" Snorky ... talk ... man ... \" What ? A segment from the double digits in the top five ? Absolutely ! On top of the great send ups to random monster horror films ( think films like Black Sheep ) , there are plenty of laughs . Especially when the end of the story sees the town in a big fight with the dolphins before their hilarious loss . It 's always in my annual rotation each year . The Devil and Homer Simpson ( Treehouse of Horror IV ) \" Mmm ... forbidden donut ... \" These next few stories definitely fall into the line of \" classic \" Simpsons episodes that folks like to reference over and over again . It 's for good reason as The Devil and Homer Simpsons absolutely holds up to this day . A tight story where Homer makes a deal with the devil that manages to squeeze in a lot within its short run time . Random John Wayne gags ( \" I 'm already up \" ) , a great showing from Lionel Hutz , Blackbeard in a high chair , and of course , \" But I 'm so sweet and tasty ! \" Dial ' Z ' for Zombies ( Treehouse of Horror III ) \" Dad , you killed the zombie Flanders ! \" \" He was a zombie ? \" I feel like the only way I can fully appreciate this is by quoting it endlessly : \" To the book depository ! \" \" Is this the end of zombie Shakespeare ? \" \" John Smith 1882 ? \" \" My mistake ! \" The zombies that plagued our town are now just corpses rotting in the streets . \" \" Yay ! \" So good . The Raven ( The Simpsons Halloween Special / Treehouse of Horror ) \" Quoth the Raven ... ' Nevermore . ' \" The Simpsons first began their Halloween special tradition back in season two , and it made sure to leave a lasting impression . Despite the many years gone by , this short sticks with me far more than anything else . Although it 's not the best one ( since it 's hard to give the episode total credit for its success ) , it 's definitely the most distinct . Putting visuals ( and Simpson personality thanks entirely through Dan Castellaneta 's performance ) to Poe 's famous poem vigorously read by the magnanimous James Earl Jones , this short was actually how I was introduced to Poe 's work . That 's something a lot of these better stories have done too . Inspired by how much I enjoyed the parody , I often sought out the original works . That 's especially true of the final entry on this list . Treehouse of Horror V \" This is indeed a disturbing universe . \" So this is a bit of a cheat considering I said that I 'd limit my choices to one story per episode , but after deciding on my favorite Treehouse of Horror I could n't really decide on my favorite of the three stories . As each special usually has a weak story or two , it 's incredibly rare to have three incredibly strong segments . Couple that with a running joke of Willie getting axed in the back and you 've even got a unified special to boot . From its highly quotable Shining parody , The Shinning \" No TV and no beer make Homer something something . \" \" Go crazy ? \" \" Do n't mind if I do ! , \" to the well written Time and Punishment ( \" Oh I wish I wish I had n't killed that fish . \" \" That 's right Mr. Peabody ! \" \" Quiet you ! \" \" What the hell are you smiling at ? , \" and the one story that managed to give me nightmares as a kid , Nightmare Cafeteria ( \" Now you march into that school , look your teacher straight in the eye and say ' Do n't eat me ! ' It 's definitely the best Halloween special Simpsons has to offer , and suffice to say , it 's also one of the best episodes of the series . Then again , regardless of which The Simpsons ' Treehouse of Horror specials you decide to revisit this Halloween you 'll have a good time ... unless you pick one of the blurst ones . It was the best of times ... I 've invested the greater part of my life into The Simpsons , and while there may have been more downs than ups lately , it 's still consistently bringing me laughs with each offering . Most of them happen to come with their annu ... . Oct 20 // John - Charles Holmes [ embed]220007:42656:0[/embed ] Rick and Morty 's debut season still stands as one of the biggest surprises out of Adult Swim to date . The channel is usually known for its one - note ideas ( Adult Johnny Quest ! The dog is also Satan ! This cop is a literal ass ! ) , but the new show from animator Justin Roiland and cancellation legend Dan Harmon rose far above its parody roots of an alcohol fueled Back to the Future . Not only did the show develop a wittingly self - aware voice for itself , but episodes occasionally dipped their toes into some pretty dark concepts like chaos theory , family abandonment , and even desensitization through the pursuit of knowledge - but only just a little at first . If season one is where Rick and Morty got audience acclimated to what strange ideas it had to offer , season two are those exact same ideas put into full practice with absolutely no restraint . Where season two holds up best is in how the show is actually structured a bit more like a typical show , but much to its benefit . Whereas the first season left all the fantastic adventures to the mostly drunk mad scientist Rick and his stammering grandson , Morty , the new season gets the entire Smith family involved in more of the weirdness . The biggest benefit being that Morty 's older sister , Summer , makes more appearances in every episode and even gets some great A - stories , making a more competent pairing with Rick than the idiotic Morty . At the same time , the new episodes also took their bizarre ideas even further . The season premiers with Rick , Morty , and Summer actually ripping the space - time continuum into multiple realities , displayed by slicing the screen right down the middle . This repeats until the episode actually climaxes into 64 different screens at once and staying that way until the anomaly gets resolved . In any other show , an idea this crazy would be enough to confuse and alienate an audience away for good , but Rick and Morty embraces this and draws us in even closer with just how ostentatiously crazy it 's willing to get . How crazy ? The season does run a little disappointingly short at just ten 22-minute episodes , but then again , leaving us wanting more is a sign that a show 's doing something right . Many fans may be disappointed that only a few one - off characters from the first season make returns , but this can be forgiven just for how many new characters from Rick 's varied past . The best of which is arguably an appearance from Stephen Colbert in the episode \" The Ricks Must Be Crazy . \" Colbert plays Zeep , a skeptical alien scientist who lives the world of a battery that Rick invents to fuel his ramshackle spaceship . When Zeep discovers that his entire world exists just to power a battery , he turns on Rick and Morty and tries to escape to wreck vengeance on their universe . For as much fun as the show has with itself this year , it does end many of the episodes with the same shockingly dark overtones as the infamous \" Rick Potion # 9 \" episode from the first season . Much of the ruthlessness and directionless suicidal depression of Rick is teased throughout the entire season as well as the effect that his self - destructive life has had on his daughter , Beth and the rest of the Smith family . This all leads up to a phenomenal finale where it finally comes to a head with an amazing emotional payoff . If the big question of season one was \" does Rick truly love Morty , \" season two asks if the family really needs Rick or if he 's the one dependent on them . The season does end on a massive cliffhanger , though , so it stands to beg if we even get a final answer by the end of the tenth episode . The stakes are raised , the world of the show has changed dramatically , and many sacrifices are made along the way . Rick and Mortyrivals another show for the most intense television wedding by the end of it all . So is Rick and Morty season two worth watching ? Most definitely , yes . A lot of the show is still pretty the same as before - the same unrestrained raunchiness , the same direct nods to obscure sci - fi productions , and the same disgustingly beautiful designs , it 's all there . Where it does improve though , is in the writing and in its use of characters . By the time the season had wrapped up this fall , the clunkiness of some of the first season 's episodes could be seen when compared to the stronger and more economical stories of the second . If you found the writing of the first season awkward or off - putting , the second may just have more of the meaningful stories you were looking for out of Rick and Morty . After all , this is the show that has Werner Herzog going on an entire monologue about how depressing the human race 's obsession with penises is , and honestly , where else on television or film are you going to find that ? Until season three debuts , I 'm going to have to say , nowhere else . Want to see more of our TV coverage ? Check out our TV Recaps and Reviews !

When they knocked a third film out of the park when everyone ... . Just as he was wishing for a blank slate , a mysterious new , red - haired girl moves into town . After falling hard for her , Charlie 's got to muster up the courage and do some crazy things in order to impress her and get her to notice him . While he 's doin all of that , his dog Snoopy ( thanks to Bill Melendez 's archived voice work ) finds a typewriter and begins writing about the WWI Flying Ace and his rivalry with the infamous Red Baron . First things first , Peanuts is absolutely stunning . I honestly have no idea how Blue Sky Studios managed to pull this off . Just like the film 's content , Peanuts ' visuals are both heartily nostalgic ( thanks to a few 2D flourishes like little hearts and backgrounds every now and then ) and groundbreaking in its effort . Characters move as smoothly as they would in 2D while avoiding CG 's blurring motions thanks to an adept use of choppy movement . I guess the closest thing I can compare it to is Blue Sky 's mascot Scrat ( from the Ice Age series ) . Just as his movement is broken , yet fluid so it captures the essence of old Looney Tunes shorts , Peanuts ' animation captures the essence of the TV specials . And then there are all the little details therein like Snoopy 's fur , the whiskers in Charlie 's lone curl of hair , and the Flying Ace sequences look pretty good in 3D. But once you get beyond how great it looks , you 'll soon realize that it may be too comfortable taking yet another trip down memory lane . Because it 's both a reinvention and a reintroduction to the Peanuts series , the film is almost required to make the necessary homages to its classic jokes and settings . Every classic Peanuts joke is here , quite literally , and you 'll be hard pressed to find them funny again in this new setting . These jokes have already been made available through the specials replayed through the holidays each year , so it 's really a matter of whether or not you 'll appreciate them again through this new filter . It 's a celebration unfortunately caught in the past , and while these jokes are definitely delightful and may mean more to new audiences , it 's just a shame that this new film did n't take the chance to create new memories for Charlie Brown . It 's even more glaring when the newer bits work very well . There 's this scene where Charlie is getting \" Psychiatric Help \" from Lucy that 's absolutely fabulous in how dark the writing duo of Bryan and Craig Schulz take it . At one point , she shoves a mirror in his face and asks Charlie what he sees , and all he can say in response is \" A loser . \" While it sounds wonky on paper , it 's a sequence that actually utilizes our knowledge of the characters in the past rather than be hindered by it . In fact , that 's one of the boldest choices The Peanuts Movie makes . While the humor and most of the content is stuck in the past ( thus making sequences featuring new pop music from Meghan Trainor feel even more out of place ) , Charlie Brown has actually become a mix of his many identities . The film only works because the writing , actor Noah Schnapp , and visuals have mastered this newest iteration of Charlie Brown . He 's a mix of many of his past incarnations : The outright loser from Schulz 's original comic strips . the awkward kid from the holiday specials , and the more positive Charlie from later direct to video specials . Yet with all of those influences , he 's still got his own new layer in the film . They 've added this crippling self - doubt that 's so current , it clashes with the rest of the film 's nostalgic tone . As the kids exist in a world with rotary phones , Charlie 's pondering existential crises in love . While the humor can be a bit clunky , and Charlie Brown is fantastic , the film does take some getting used to . Since it is so stuck in the past , it 's taking on a format we have n't seen in quite a while . Broken into vignettes fueling a central arc , each major sequence in Peanuts feels like it could be a stand - alone special of its own . Each major scene has a beginning middle and end , so it does n't really flow like a traditional film , per se . It 's an odd pacing that , while not entirely bad , does detract from the enjoyment overall . Going in you 've got to realize that you 're taking the good with the bad , but the \" bad \" is n't the worst thing in the world . The Peanuts Movie 's biggest flaw is that it 's too celebratory and nostalgic , but that 's also such a non - problem to have . I certainly have enjoyed myself , but I also do n't feel compelled to watch this over and over again like every other Peanuts thing I 've revisited in the past . It 's a delightful and breezy film , but I 'm not sure if everyone will have the same reaction to it that I did . It 's fun to walk down memory lane every once in a while , but you ca n't expect everyone to stick around . Good grief ? Thanks to my mom , I 've been following Charlie Brown and the Peanuts gang for as long as I can remember . Like Charlie , I too am a sad sack who 's life the universe sees fit to ruin at all cost .

Charlie Kaufman 's stop - motion animated feature has been universally praised n .. Homer 's Nightmare ( \" If I Only Had a Brain \" ) ( Treehouse of Horror II ) That 's right , the bad ones were actually off to an early start . In the same episode that brought us the great Lisa 's Nightmare and the so - so Bart 's Nightmare , we have the clunky Homer 's Nightmare . In this short , Mr. Burns is attempting to create a super worker but ends up putting Homer 's brain in that super worker so the end result is what you 'd expect . I 'll chalk this one 's badness to growing pains as it was the first true sequel in the series . The show was still trying to figure out what to do with their Halloween specials and I 'm sure every idea seemed viable . Terror at 5 1/2 Feet ( Treehouse of Horror IV ) As you 'll find out later in this list , The Simspsons does n't nail every spoof it tries . Taking on the Twilight Zone classic \" Terror at 20,000 Feet , \" this short gives Bart a little Gremlin problem . Sure there 's a good joke involving Hans Moleman , but the rest of the story is particularly rote . And in the same episode as The Devil and Homer Simpson and Bart Simpson 's Dracula , it 's egregious awfulness sticks out even more so . Maybe it 's just an average story caught in between two particularly great ones , but that 's just how the cookie crumbles . But at least it 's not as bad as everything else here . The Thing and I ( Treehouse of Horror VII ) Okay , now we 're getting into it . When Bart finds out he 's got a long lost , potentially evil twin named Hugo chained up in the basement , everything falls apart both literally and figuratively . I distinctly remember realizing these were n't going to be that great anymore . The short 's so haphazardly thrown together that it 's obvious no one involved really cares about what 's going on in it . The jokes are n't there , the premise is n't strong , and it screams laziness . Yet , it is n't the laziest story on this by far . In the Na'Vi ( Treehouse of Horror XXII ) You know how I mentioned that The Simpsons does n't nail all of its spoofs ? This is what I was referring to . Several years after Avatar hit theaters ( which made this short seem all the more depressing ) , Treehouse featured a terribly conceived Simpsons version with Bart in the lead role . Reading this list you 're probably thinking that Bart 's involvement has a lot to do with the poor quality of these stories and you 'd be right for the most part . The show never really knows what to do with him outside of his normal parameters . That 's why Bart 's always in the background of others ' stories or is paired with Lisa so the writers have someone to bounce him off of . Without that , you realize how poorly Bart 's been written in the post 20s . Master and Cadaver ( Treehouse of Horror XXI ) While the post-20 Treehouse stories have been pretty bad all around , they 're more average and bland than outright terrible . But one story manages to tip over that line into a story that 's so bad it brings the rest of the special down . In traditional Simpsons , but non - traditional Treehouse , fashion the man poised no real threat and it 's all a series of explainable coincidences . It 's just so darn boring . More so than season 20 era Simpsons , more so than weak Lisa episodes , I 'm glad this story 's so short . The reason it 's not higher on the list is because it 's thankfully over before it 's begun . Untitled Robot Parody ( Treehouse of Horror XIX ) So here we have the laziest Treehouse of Horror short in series history . It 's so lethargic , they did n't even think to give it a name . A terribly conceived Transformers spoof that 's neither funny ( complete with a rote sex toy transformer joke ) nor even has a reason to exist . This blurb is more attention that this short even deserves . You Got ta Know When to Golem ( Treehouse of Horror XVIII ) Introducing a little used movie monster to the Treehouse format seems fit for a good time but , like the 1915 film it 's based on , this story 's stuck entirely in the past . A story with jokes rooted in dated Jewish sterotypes ever further aggravated by casting Richard Lewis and Fran Drescher as caricatures of themselves , Golem is just a bad idea that somehow made it to air . I do n't even know who this short was for , but this kind of insular comedy is what deters fans from the series . Then again , thanks to bottom three stories , fans have walked away years ago . Frinkenstein ( Treehouse of Horror XIV ) Ugh . Hex and the City ( Treehouse of Horror XII ) It took me years to see this one all the way through because I hated this special so much . In fact , I never saw how XII ended until about six years ago when I decided to run through a good chunk of the Treehouse specials . In Hex and the City , Homer angers a gypsy and is cursed for life ( resulting in Marge 's beard , Bart 's long neck , and Lisa 's horse legs ) . His response is to sick a lepraechaun on her resulting in their wholly gross union . It 's entirely asinine and coupled with the episode 's other bland shorts like Wiz Kids and this seemed even worse overall . It has to be the worst opening story in Treehouse history . Starship Poopers ( Treehouse of Horror IX ) Okay , so I 've got quite the problem with Starship Poopers . First of all , it 's a terrible final story for a special that was n't bad so the nosedive is even more noticeable . Secondly , it was incredibly dated then ( yes even more so than Citizen Kang , which was rooted in 90s politics ) and even more so now . I mean , the short ends with an entirely too long Jerry Springer riff . By the time the short aired , Springer was already on his way out so it seemed even more desperate than I 'm sure was intended . There 's so much more I want to say , but I just ca n't do it anymore . It was the blurst of times You know , it 's always great to reminisce about The Simpsons in their heyday but in order to truly celebrate the Halloween holiday , we need to talk about some truly horrific things : The awful Treehouse of Horror specials . Sure ... . The Peanuts Movie is either going to destroy an American classic or revitalize it . I 'm not sure it really needed revitalizing as the holiday cartoons are still constantly watched every year , but maybe it does . The animat ... . The Day the Earth Looked Stupid ( Treehouse of Horror XVII ) \" Oh yeah ? Why do n't I punch you in the nose , bud ? \" \" ... Nosebud ... \" Folks may have counted out much of the later seasons , and while I 'd be inclined to agree for the most part , a few good episodes always manage to go unnoticed . XVII was one of the last good Treehouse specials before they took a dive in the 20s , and it went out on a high . The show 's film spoofs do n't always work , but I absolutely loved this one . Maurice LaMarche put on his best Orson Welles again as the classic play ended up duping Springfield into wallowing in the dirt like animals . It does n't make any sense , it looks great , and it 's so perfectly Simpsons . Mostly because it actually nails the ending , which is something these specials always struggle with , as the episode ends with the bleak and soft The Ink Spots ' \" I Do n't Want to Set the World on Fire . \" Send in the Clones ( Treehouse of Horror XIII ) \" Homer I must say , you 've had the energy of twenty men lately ! \" \" Twenty three ! \" I do n't what it is , but seeing a group of Homers play off each other is incredibly satisfying . A natural progression of Homer 's self - deprecating humor , laziness , and superiority complex creates an army of clones that only want donuts and for Lenny to pick up the tab at Moe 's ( \" Anything for Homers ! \" ) This segment 's also jam packed with jokes from the randomness of killing Flanders and \" Paul Newman 's gon na have my legs broke ! , \" sights gags like Season One Homer and Peter Griffin , to the fact it all started because of a magic hammock . It 's stupid Homer x 1000 and it turned out pretty well . Homer3 ( Treehouse of Horror VI ) \" It 's like something outta that twilighty show about that zone ... \" VI was fantastic all around . Attack of the 50 ft Eyesores and Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace were both pretty good , but I 've got to hand it to the segment that blew my mind as a kid . Of course it earns its place on the list because it holds up beyond its 3D gimmick because it 's pretty funny ( \" May I take your coat ? \" \" Uh , can I also take your coat ? \" ) , but it 's hard to gush about its visuals . CG pretty much unheard of in 1995 , so the show was able to mine the relatively new technology for comedy . It may not exactly be like Tron ( which no one has seen , apparently ) , but it 's close enough . Also , the bit where Homer shows up in our world still blows my mind . I do n't know how they pulled it off back then , but I 'm glad they spent all of that money on an erotic cake joke . Citizen Kang ( Treehouse of Horror VII ) \" Abortions for some , miniature American flags for all of us ! \" You would hope the political jokes in Citizen Kang would n't ring as true 19 years later , but like most things , the Simpsons predicted a lot of things . Although the candidates are dated , you can replace them with pretty much anyone and it 'll still work . So go ahead , throw your vote away ! The Homega Man ( Treehouse of Horror VIII ) \" I 'm the last man alive and I can do everything I 've always wanted ! \" Treehouse segments are full of movie parodies , but one of the stories that absolutely nails it is this one . Parodying 1971 's The Omega Man , which itself was adapted from Richard Matthenson 's novel I Am Legend , this short stars Homer as the last man alive in Springfield after the French ( \" Stupid frogs . \" ) bomb them for their remarks . After Homer enjoys the time alone , he realizes he 's not truly alone and every second is so funny . There 's a hidden joy in noting how long it takes Homer to realize everyone 's dead . In fact I love this segment so much , I 'm thinking of getting a tattoo on my arm of \" the rest . \" Night of the Dolphin ( Treehouse of Horror XI ) \" Snorky ... talk ... man ... \" What ? A segment from the double digits in the top five ? Absolutely ! On top of the great send ups to random monster horror films ( think films like Black Sheep ) , there are plenty of laughs . Especially when the end of the story sees the town in a big fight with the dolphins before their hilarious loss . It 's always in my annual rotation each year . The Devil and Homer Simpson ( Treehouse of Horror IV ) \" Mmm ... forbidden donut ... \" These next few stories definitely fall into the line of \" classic \" Simpsons episodes that folks like to reference over and over again . It 's for good reason as The Devil and Homer Simpsons absolutely holds up to this day . A tight story where Homer makes a deal with the devil that manages to squeeze in a lot within its short run time . Random John Wayne gags ( \" I 'm already up \" ) , a great showing from Lionel Hutz , Blackbeard in a high chair , and of course , \" But I 'm so sweet and tasty ! \" Dial ' Z ' for Zombies ( Treehouse of Horror III ) \" Dad , you killed the zombie Flanders ! \" \" He was a zombie ? \" I feel like the only way I can fully appreciate this is by quoting it endlessly : \" To the book depository ! \" \" Is this the end of zombie Shakespeare ? \" \" John Smith 1882 ? \" \" My mistake ! \" The zombies that plagued our town are now just corpses rotting in the streets . \" \" Yay ! \" So good . The Raven ( The Simpsons Halloween Special / Treehouse of Horror ) \" Quoth the Raven ... ' Nevermore . ' \" The Simpsons first began their Halloween special tradition back in season two , and it made sure to leave a lasting impression . Despite the many years gone by , this short sticks with me far more than anything else . Although it 's not the best one ( since it 's hard to give the episode total credit for its success ) , it 's definitely the most distinct . Putting visuals ( and Simpson personality thanks entirely through Dan Castellaneta 's performance ) to Poe 's famous poem vigorously read by the magnanimous James Earl Jones , this short was actually how I was introduced to Poe 's work . That 's something a lot of these better stories have done too . Inspired by how much I enjoyed the parody , I often sought out the original works . That 's especially true of the final entry on this list . Treehouse of Horror V \" This is indeed a disturbing universe . \" So this is a bit of a cheat considering I said that I 'd limit my choices to one story per episode , but after deciding on my favorite Treehouse of Horror I could n't really decide on my favorite of the three stories . As each special usually has a weak story or two , it 's incredibly rare to have three incredibly strong segments . Couple that with a running joke of Willie getting axed in the back and you 've even got a unified special to boot . From its highly quotable Shining parody , The Shinning \" No TV and no beer make Homer something something . \" \" Go crazy ? \" \" Do n't mind if I do ! , \" to the well written Time and Punishment ( \" Oh I wish I wish I had n't killed that fish . \" \" That 's right Mr. Peabody ! \" \" Quiet you ! \" \" What the hell are you smiling at ? , \" and the one story that managed to give me nightmares as a kid , Nightmare Cafeteria ( \" Now you march into that school , look your teacher straight in the eye and say ' Do n't eat me ! ' It 's definitely the best Halloween special Simpsons has to offer , and suffice to say , it 's also one of the best episodes of the series . Then again , regardless of which The Simpsons ' Treehouse of Horror specials you decide to revisit this Halloween you 'll have a good time ... unless you pick one of the blurst ones . It was the best of times ... I 've invested the greater part of my life into The Simpsons , and while there may have been more downs than ups lately , it 's still consistently bringing me laughs with each offering . Most of them happen to come with their annu ... . Oct 20 // John - Charles Holmes [ embed]220007:42656:0[/embed ] Rick and Morty 's debut season still stands as one of the biggest surprises out of Adult Swim to date . The channel is usually known for its one - note ideas ( Adult Johnny Quest ! The dog is also Satan ! This cop is a literal ass ! ) , but the new show from animator Justin Roiland and cancellation legend Dan Harmon rose far above its parody roots of an alcohol fueled Back to the Future . Not only did the show develop a wittingly self - aware voice for itself , but episodes occasionally dipped their toes into some pretty dark concepts like chaos theory , family abandonment , and even desensitization through the pursuit of knowledge - but only just a little at first . If season one is where Rick and Morty got audience acclimated to what strange ideas it had to offer , season two are those exact same ideas put into full practice with absolutely no restraint . Where season two holds up best is in how the show is actually structured a bit more like a typical show , but much to its benefit . Whereas the first season left all the fantastic adventures to the mostly drunk mad scientist Rick and his stammering grandson , Morty , the new season gets the entire Smith family involved in more of the weirdness . The biggest benefit being that Morty 's older sister , Summer , makes more appearances in every episode and even gets some great A - stories , making a more competent pairing with Rick than the idiotic Morty . At the same time , the new episodes also took their bizarre ideas even further . The season premiers with Rick , Morty , and Summer actually ripping the space - time continuum into multiple realities , displayed by slicing the screen right down the middle . This repeats until the episode actually climaxes into 64 different screens at once and staying that way until the anomaly gets resolved . In any other show , an idea this crazy would be enough to confuse and alienate an audience away for good , but Rick and Morty embraces this and draws us in even closer with just how ostentatiously crazy it 's willing to get . How crazy ? The season does run a little disappointingly short at just ten 22-minute episodes , but then again , leaving us wanting more is a sign that a show 's doing something right . Many fans may be disappointed that only a few one - off characters from the first season make returns , but this can be forgiven just for how many new characters from Rick 's varied past . The best of which is arguably an appearance from Stephen Colbert in the episode \" The Ricks Must Be Crazy . \" Colbert plays Zeep , a skeptical alien scientist who lives the world of a battery that Rick invents to fuel his ramshackle spaceship . When Zeep discovers that his entire world exists just to power a battery , he turns on Rick and Morty and tries to escape to wreck vengeance on their universe . For as much fun as the show has with itself this year , it does end many of the episodes with the same shockingly dark overtones as the infamous \" Rick Potion # 9 \" episode from the first season . Much of the ruthlessness and directionless suicidal depression of Rick is teased throughout the entire season as well as the effect that his self - destructive life has had on his daughter , Beth and the rest of the Smith family . This all leads up to a phenomenal finale where it finally comes to a head with an amazing emotional payoff . If the big question of season one was \" does Rick truly love Morty , \" season two asks if the family really needs Rick or if he 's the one dependent on them . The season does end on a massive cliffhanger , though , so it stands to beg if we even get a final answer by the end of the tenth episode . The stakes are raised , the world of the show has changed dramatically , and many sacrifices are made along the way . Rick and Mortyrivals another show for the most intense television wedding by the end of it all . So is Rick and Morty season two worth watching ? Most definitely , yes . A lot of the show is still pretty the same as before - the same unrestrained raunchiness , the same direct nods to obscure sci - fi productions , and the same disgustingly beautiful designs , it 's all there . Where it does improve though , is in the writing and in its use of characters . By the time the season had wrapped up this fall , the clunkiness of some of the first season 's episodes could be seen when compared to the stronger and more economical stories of the second . If you found the writing of the first season awkward or off - putting , the second may just have more of the meaningful stories you were looking for out of Rick and Morty . After all , this is the show that has Werner Herzog going on an entire monologue about how depressing the human race 's obsession with penises is , and honestly , where else on television or film are you going to find that ?

Aug 07 // Alec Kubas - Meyer [ embed]219724:42536:0[/embed ] Spec Ops : The Line is probably in my top five games ever . It 's incredible , and if you have n't played it , you need to do so . If you have played it and do n't understand how incredible it is , go play it again . Maybe read Brendan Keogh 's Killing Is Harmless while you do . The game is a triumph , and the bravest thing it did is to convince you it was generic before pulling the rug out from under you . ( Much like , you guess it , Bojack Horseman . ) Spec Ops : The Line was made with the Unreal Engine . It stars a military man voiced by Nolan North . He looks and sounds like every other Unreal Engine - based cover shooter out there . It feels ... fine . The gameplay is completely and totally acceptable . Stop and pop . You 're fighting generic foreign militants . The other . It 's easy to kill them , because that 's what you 're used to doing . That 's the role that these sorts of people play in video games . ( And in movies , as brilliantly profiled by GQ a couple weeks ago . ) In Bojack Horseman , you follow a generic former - Hollywoo[d ] superstar . He 's voiced by Will Arnett , and he 's a jackass . He lives in an amazing house overlooking the city , but he 's pretty much a worthless being . On his couch lives the \" comic relief , \" Todd , voiced by Aaron Paul . He 's dumb , but Bojack keeps him around , because ... whatever . Bojack wants to relive the Good Old Days . Perhaps it 's not quite your typical animated show , but it 's not an uncommon comedy . And for a while , the jokes are funny but the underlying narrative feels a little old . But , of course , that 's the point . Spec Ops hits you with big moments several times . First , you go from fighting generic \" terrorists \" to fighting US military . That 's , well , unexpected . And then there 's the scene where you have to do something horrible to progress that turns out to be something really horrible . It keeps going down ( literally ) , as we follow Captain Walker into the deep recesses of his mind . And it 's not a great place to be . Because Captain Walker is not a good person . He believes he is , or at least that he can be , but he is n't . And he leaves nothing but destruction in his wake . Throughout , the game taunts you , and it taunts hyper - violent games in general . ( And yes , it is effectively critiquing the genre by \" succumbing \" to its tropes . ) [ embed]219724:42537:0[/embed ] Bojack does n't have that moment in quite the same way , at least in its first season . It 's a gradual realization that what you 're watching is n't quite what you thought it was . You thought you were getting a comedy - of - sorts about a former star who wants to relive his glory days . What you get is something far darker , and far more interesting . Because Bojack Horseman is definitely not a good ... horse . ( I 'm going to call him a person from now on , because referring to him as a \" horse \" is weird . ) He wants to be good , I guess , but behind him lies only chaos . And in the second season especially , he does some very , very bad things . The Verge posted their review of the show 's second season a bit prematurely , I thought . Both the headline - \" In its second season , Bojack Horseman quits beating a depressed horse \" - and subtitle - \" More animal puns , less animal pathos \" - prove to be , um , false . Because the second season of Bojack Horseman tricks you again . Sure , watching the first few episodes ( which are great , by the way ) , you might think that the show had changed and become perhaps a bit more whimsical . Watching the episode where Todd creates his own , extremely dangerous Disneyland ( and wins a lawsuit allowing him to use that name on a technicality ) lulls you into a false sense of security . This is a show that has found its groove , or something like it . That groove may not be as interesting as the previous season , but it 's something . And the screeners that Netflix sent to critics beforehand would lend credence to that . The first six episodes , especially in comparison , are fun . They 're light and silly . And then there 's \" Hank After Dark . \" \" Hank After Dark \" is an incredible episode of television . And it 's incredible not just because of what it but how absolutely bleak its ending is . At this point , everyone knows about the downfall of Bill Cosby . And it all started because of a joke by comedian Hannibal Buress . He made a joke about public information , and suddenly everything came crashing down . The time since has been incredibly disturbing , and each new bit of evidence has only made it worse . Diane is on a book tour for Bojack , but she ca n't shut Pandora 's Box once she 's opened it . Mr. Peanutbutter asks her to hold off , and everyone else tells her she 's a horrible person for defaming a good man 's name . She keeps fighting , until she 's confronted by Hank Hippopopalous himself . And then she gives up . The season does n't get cheerier after that . Whether it 's the intense discussion on live TV between Mr. Peanutbutter and Bojack about the latter 's Diane come - on last season or the thing that happens in the penultimate episode , the back half of Bojack Horseman 's second season hits and hits hard . To be sure , the show continues to be very funny . There are more than a few good laughs per episode , but aside from a couple bits here and there , those are n't the things I 'll be thinking about in a year from now . Good TV makes you think , perhaps even obsess . But with Bojack Horseman , it 's not some communal obsession with unraveling mysteries . It 's an introspective sort of obsession . Do you see yourself in Bojack ? What about Todd or Mr. Peanutbutter or Diane or Princess Carolyn ? These characters are all fleshed out this season , and you learn fascinating things about all of them . ( Princess Carolyn has a particularly interesting arc , and I can not tell you how glad I was when they ended the Vincent Adultman subplot early on . ) But , of course , the focus is on Bojack , on his inability to change course . His drive to push forward towards certain doom . And that is truly where Bojack and Captain Walker 's journeys converge . Both of them set in motions series of events that can only end badly , but the decision to set them in motion was a choice . Maybe at the time it did n't feel like one , but it was . To point to what is perhaps the most obvious example , Bojack did not have to up and leave to see a girl he was sort of in love with decades ago . He did n't have to stay with her family when he found out she had one . He did n't have to ... ya know . He could have walked away . And ultimately , that 's what Spec Ops : The Line is about . It 's about walking away , or at least the need to walk away ( in a meta sense ) . Walker does n't do that . He never stops to think about what he 's doing or what he 's done . Unlike Bojack , he thinks he 's helping people ( at least at first ... by the end ? who knows ) . Of course , the road to hell is paved with good intentions . Bojack Horseman matters . It 's one of the best shows on television right now . Literally . And that 's significant not just because it is in and of itself a significant statement . It 's significant because it 's a show that , on the face of it , is so easy to dismiss . But once you get past all of that , you 're pulled along for a fascinating and often poignant journey through something truly great . It 's not the thing you expect , but you eventually realize that it 's exactly what you wanted . Subversion and sadness The first season of Bojack Horseman sort of came out of nowhere , at least as far as I was concerned . Back then , I was underemployed and watched pretty much anything that seemed vaguely interesting . I generally trust ... . I stand by blu - rays for two types of movies-- colorfully visual movies and animated productions . It goes without saying that the films of Studio Ghibli are some of the best looking to make the jump to HD since the films start ... . Our first peak at The Good Dinosaur did n't give us much to go on , but it definitely wet our whistle for something that looks drastically different from previous Pixar films . Now , with this new trailer , we know it looks d .. Attaching themselves to whatever evil creature they could find , they tried to serve as the best henchman they could until their boss ' inevitable end . Lost and listless , minions Kevin , Stuart , and Bob set out across the world in order to find a new boss . That search leads them to Scarlet and Herb Overkill ( Sandra Bullock and Jon Hamm ) the top of the villain food chain who want to steal the Queen of England 's crown . All of this , of course , leads to the same kind of yellow tinged shenanigans you know and possibly love . When this was first announced , I had a few hang ups . I really enjoyed the Despicable Me films , but the minions were always a side bit that I never quite attached to . Originally written into the films in order to make Gru more likable , they 're the epitome of easy kids ' jokes . And that 's kind of true here . Thankfully , there 's at least an attempt to give Minions the same amount of heart as the rest of the series . Once you get used to the long stretches of minion language - less dialogue , there 's some nice character development here ... but you 've got to figure it out for yourself . Kevin , Stuart , and Bob all have some unique personality traits ( Kevin is the responsible one , Stuart is the party one , and Bob is the young and cuddly one ) but do n't go further than the surface level . Geared more toward children than ever , this film is light in both plot and all - ages humor . Thankfully the film is just a breeze , and it 's over way before you start thinking about it . At the very least , the main trio is built well enough that you 'll emotionally invest in them long enough to follow through the film 's short stint . Though I 'm sure these minions are reaching a point of diminishing returns ( hopefully there 's no plan to keep these solo films going ) that their shenanigans wo n't be able to sustain a film on their own much longer . This one 's barely held together by the skin of its teeth . The human cast is fantastic , and they 're a breath of fresh air in between all of the shenanigans . Sandra Bullock and Jon Ham completely commit to the film 's nutty nature , and both of them need more roles where they 're allowed to chew the scenery as goofy bad guys . Bullock seems to enjoy her role the most , but close runner ups are folks like Michael Keaton and Alison Janney who 're criminally underutilized . Maybe casting such big names just to give them a bit part is part of the film 's slight meta humor . But that might be giving the film too much credit . At the end of the day , Minions is n't made for you or me , but for the kids . But as I 've argued every time I review one of these animated films , it 's time to expect better for your kids . Sure not every animated film can , or needs to be , like Pixar , but if we keep paying for things like this they 'll keep churning them out for an easy buck . It 's a flavor of the month film that 'll definitely be forgotten once the next big cute thing comes along . Minions is not as terrible as I expected , but it 's far from great . But whatever , your kids'll love how cute it is . Papaya banana blah blah Whether or not you 've seen the Despicable Me movies , you definitely know who these little twinkie looking guys are .

The first movie was quite interested me because of a new actor , new superhero character and the birth of the new franchise from Marvel studio . All together with a mythical Greek character in a modern world , it was something that hit me . Just a few months back , I praised Hemsworth for his best ever performance in the biographical picture ' Rush ' . Here he has fallen back to okay kinda performance . The movie was nothing special , but a decent entertainment . Technically , it was rich in visuals with good graphics , no one must dare to doubt it . My problem was the story which followed the usual fantasy movie protocol . One of the disappointment from 2013 , completely a commercial purpose behind its creation and production . Yeah , all the movie are but this one is very much visible . So in my opinion , it is one time watch movie . Thor 2 as second as Second hand . I hope this year is not over I will see probably action movie with an idea or sense ! They have shooting a movie which are soulless . begging your pardon , but I suggest not to see this movie unless you want waist your time . You will see nothing original . the jokes in it are not funny . The movie starts to get boring from the beginning . I heard the last few scenes are saved by the director of The Avengers , which are the only interesting parts in this movie . This review contains spoilers , click expand to view . The first half of the film was very boring and did NOTHING to engage the audience . The film only really picked up just before Loki was broken out of his cell by Thor . Special effects were special . What was with the weird colour scheme used and the blurry backgrounds ? It looked like something out of 300 . Asgard still looked nice . I enjoyed seeing Loki and Thor team - up but Thor 's action sequences on his own were n't that good . The final battle was a little too reminiscent of the IM3 final battle for my liking ; Thor jumping into different worlds / Tony jumping into different Iron Man suits . So , this film is only really good enough because of Loki . If it was n't for the character and his excellent portrayal by Tom Hiddleston , this film would most likely get a 3/10 . If you want to know what happens in the film because you want to catch up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe , just read the plot online and maybe watch a montage of the best Loki moments in the film . ...

I thought the way they executed Thor 's fish - out - of - water story was very well done , and Tom Hiddleston 's Loki was excellent as a villain . but this forced sequel had some enjoyable moments ( mainly from Loki , again ) , but also a slightly underdeveloped villain and a strange , confusing premise . It seem the movie is carried by gags and silly jokes . The final battle is literally mixed in with numerous gags . If that 's your thing , then you will surely enjoy it . But I wonder what this movie would 've been like if the plot and villain were to fleshed out better , with better motivation , and dramatic moments were left comedy free . Oh well . This movie was an improvement from the last Thor movie but not by much . Several hours after I saw it I did n't think about it . A good movie stays with you days after you see it if it 's real good , not this one . I saw Oblivion with Tom Cruise the following day on Blue Ray and thought about it for days after .

This review contains spoilers , click expand to view . This film fits into the MCU very nicely . If you were n't a fan of the Avengers collective already then this probably is n't the film that 's going to win you over but if like me you 're already well invested in the series then Thor 2 is a nice addition . It progresses Thor 's story pretty well , raises some questions about the next Avengers film , the characters are well developed and the action sequences are awesome to watch . Some of the dialogue can be a bit cheesey at times but you kind of have to forgive a bit of cheesiness in a film about a comic book hero based on norse mythology . Also Malekith is n't the most impressive villain . He has two fight sequences in the whole film . The first one he gets his arse handed to him by Thor 's mammy and the second one is his final fight with Thor himself which he inevitably loses . Against the previous bad guy , Loki ( who 's character development and eventual fate are extremely intriguing in this film ) , he does n't really measure up . Overall this film is worth seeing and certainly enjoyable if you are a fan of the Avengers films . But if not then it 's not going do much for you . ... Expand . It 's clear by the high scores that a lot of folks wanted a Thor movie high on action and special effects and sweeping vistas and low on calories . Before the beginning there was n't light . Yeah , got it , but the premise does n't satisfy the viewer as to what the \" Dark Elves \" are and why they 're flying in spacecraft that seem like rejected designs from a new Star Trek movie . Did you understand it , or how they derived their technology or why the gas that dentists used to give before they operated is somehow the most dangerous thing in the universe ? Besides the Tesseract ( or the Infinity Gauntlet , or the next thing that is the most dangerous thing ) ? No , I did n't like Thor 2 as much as the original because the original had some calories and had some restraint ... and a real story and a point . It was a well crafted story , directed by someone who understands stories ... and basically Thor 's story is right from King Lear where Gloster ( Odin ) banishes the good son Edgar ( Thor ) because he was deceived by the bad son Edmund ( Loki ) . Later , when Loki is found to be the villain Thor returns home to set things right best he can and Loki 's bid to be king is foiled . Yes , Thor is a fairly pedestrian THOR story , with little action , but with good acting , drama and a logic to what is going on . We have pathos and we have an Odin we can believe in . Odin is in control of the situation and see the story play out . The original Thor movie was weighted by the need to set up the character and his universe to join in with the rest of the Marvels to lead to the pay - off in Avengers . So it tip - toes its way to being a Thor movie that yes , can be a real yawner at times . And so Thor 2 shows no restraint when it comes to logic , characterization , the laws of physics or basically getting around to splaining itself . So yeah , the Dark Elves ( Borgs ? ) seek to destroy the universe because they need SPF 1000 to survive or something . They were there first , in the dark , then light and life and warmth appeared and they fought to get it back and created a mega - weapon but were defeated because the Asgardians have the Rainbow Bridge ( teleporters ) . Now where this all falls apart is ... a somewhat accurate portrayal of Odin from the comics ( or anywhere else ) , but a fantastic departure from characterization , simply to create set pieces for an actioner . Odin forbids Thor to do something . Thor and his friends ( and Loki ) do the very thing they 're not supposed to . Betraying the orders of Odin results in solving the problem . Loki seeks the throne by betrayal , only this time he wins , apparently . Sound familiar ? Odin could have clearly done the opposite and set Thor and Co on the same mission , but it would n't create enough tension , that this film clearly needed . Because ... if Odin simply tells Thor and Co to go to the Dark World , then ... yes folks , Loki stays in his Friggin cell and the movie is completely diff . And it 's contrived because of Odin 's sudden lack of wisdom and self - control . He 's simply an angry god making poor judgments , to merely serve a shoe - horned story whose aim is to blown stuff up reel good . Thud . Yeah . So yes ... it 's a good action film if you do n't care for story / plot / characterization or an original tale . It , like Iron Man III , dispenses with storytelling to get to the action . When I sat back watching this movie I was surprised how quickly the time passed . This movie was entertaining from start to finish . Asgard looks amazing .

Natalie Portman , who can be an amazing actor when she is n't phoning it in , could be replaced with a cardboard cutout for 90 % of this film and the movie would run through exactly the same . I am unfamiliar with the comic book upon which the movie is based but I highly doubt the female protagonist is supposed to be so one dimensional . Heck her sidekick Kat Dennings had a more interesting and dynamic story arc with the intern . Natalie Portman meantime looks pretty and gets rescued , until the last minute when she springs into action using tools her co - workers figured out and built without her input , to science / magic somehow help Thor in the big boss battle at the end . And even there her help is rivaled by her co - workers . Not exactly lead protagonist material . ... Expand .

Thor : The Dark World is a touch better than the first installment , but simply does n't focus enough on what I believe are the two film 's greatest strengths ( Tom Hiddleston 's Loki and the fish out of water humor ) . Loki stole the show . Tom Hiddleston really knows how to make his fandom proud and how to attract viewers to watch this sequel over and over again . However , like most movies , the first movie has a better storyline and is more exciting to watch . Compared to other superhero movie sequels , this movie is not too shabby . The plot is tied after the events of the Avengers , the protagonist Thor returns along with Loki to his father Odin ( Anthony Hopkins ) in Asgard . Odin Loki sent to prison .

Nature of the characters spelled bad . Loki is the best and the expected character . Christopher good actor , but he came out of the villain quite weak . ...

Thor ( Chris Hemsworth ) returns as a handsome mythological prince who wants to see his true love , Jane Foster ( Natalie Portman ) in England , and he 's trying to find a Nine Realms in the big bloated planet . The movie drags down with silly humor , corny dialogue , and some unpleasant scenes , where Dr. Erik Selvig ( Stellan Starsgard ) is running crazy with his naked body and he started to become a lunatic . I would say whatever happen to this scene ? Does the doctor goes insane while he left away from The Avengers that they did n't known about him ? Thor : The Dark World is an underwhelming superhero film with corny forgettable characters , a dull story , and some tiring moments . I would prefer \" The Avengers , \" or an okay version from Kenneth Branagh 's \" Thor . \" One of the main problems is that the film turns into corky uninteresting mess , when does the film turns so corky that does n't take to serious . Thor : The Dark World is not a memorable superhero like the other Marvel Universe series , even it 's more less convenience like \" Man of Steel \" or \" The Wolverine . \" So the search I still on until we get to next Avengers sequel or any spinoff characters in Marvel . ...

Simple good vs. evil battle but the pacing and unfolding of events kept me distracted enough . However , some of the secondary plots are quite head scratching . The romance \" triangle \" between Thor , Jane and that Asgardian female is mentioned , but not shown in great detail and is left as pointless tripe given that it fell apart by the second act . Although it is refreshing to see Loki once again seizing opportunity that passes by , and that is a secondary plot that has effected the movie entirely . The post credits scene ( a staple given that it will lead to Avengers 2 ) , does provide a few hints of how this movie 's McGuffin would be used in the coming Avengers film . The characters are very 2 dimensional and flat , with the exception of Loki . What I despise most of the characters however were the Earth humans with the exception of Natalie Portman , and even she is somewhat guilty of this . In the movie , she is clearly there are nothing but a traditional damsel - in - distress . Think of her time as Padme in Star Wars , but at least she has some function . In fact , anytime the movie transitions away from Asgard , the humans only fulfill a comic role . In this sense , it was suffering the Transformers disease ; superfluous characters that have nothing to do with the main plot providing comedy . Although it is n't done excessively , and they actually have some use in the climax , it is still very obvious that the writers have no idea what to do with them . Special effects was passable . Fight choreography and action was almost above average . Particularly memorable was Thor 's mother fighting , or the two brothers fighting side - by side . But CGI is quite possible the most horrible I 've seen this year . You will never believe any artifact produced actually existed in the real world . The alien ships look poorly rendered compared to those in Star Trek or Man of Steel . Thor 's hammer look comically plastic and unbelievable . The \" sandstorms \" are just clouds of opaque smoke without any resolution or clarity to define the finer details . It 's clear CG was not very well refined . Overall , this is a simple popcorn movie that is enjoyable as long as you do not expect anything above average from it . But even with low expectations , I do not have a strong impression of the movie once I left the theater . Leaves no lasting impressions , beyond possible future plot points for other Marvel crossovers . ... Expand .

Clearly he is there as a fan service and to draw in the ladies ( no idea what they see in him , but if that 's what they like . ) The villain is so generic and really gets little due . Clearly he is there as a plot device and more or less feels like something for Thor to do , than an actual threat . At least Loki had charm and was fun to watch in his scenes .

It 's not just the antagonist though , the plot is sometimes a muddle and the movie Marvel Cinematic Universe ( MCU ) Analysis : Thor : The Dark World ( 2013 ) . So ... Thor . It 's time for my review of this super - hero 's sequel . Frankly , it 's the weakest MCU movie up to now . It 's still enjoyable but there 's so much potential wasted in here , one of them being the villain , oh ... we 'll get to that LATER . It 's not just the antagonist though , the plot is sometimes a muddle and the movie itself suffers from too much exposition . It still brings comedy and action , however it 's really disappointing . But with all honesty , the filmmakers did try . They did try . Odin recalls when his father Bor and the warriors from Asgard vanquished the evil Dark Elves and their leader Malekith that wanted to send the universe into the darkness during the convergence of nine realms unleashing the powerful weapon Aether . Malekith escapes and Bor hides the Aether in - between two stone columns . In the present days , on Earth , the scientist Jane Foster that is waiting for the return of Thor , investigates a gravity phenomenon in an abandoned factory with her assistant and her intern . She finds the column where the Aether is hidden and the substance possesses her . In Asgard , Heimdall reports to Thor that Jane has disappeared . Thor returns to Earth and finds Jane ; but when he sees that he has a strange energy protecting her , he brings Jane to Asgard to be healed . However , Malekith also awakes and goes to Asgard to retrieve the Aether . After a bloody battle , Frigga is murdered by Malekith and Thor proposes treason to his warriors friends of Asgard and teams up with Loki to seek revenge for the murder of their mother and to vanquish Malekith before he destroys Asgard with his Dark Elves . Let 's start with the good elements : The action is great . Marvel does well with the action in their films , especially in \" The Avengers \" and this movie is not an exception . There are no shaky cams to be found here and the fights are well choreographed . Thor throwing the hammer is as exciting as seeing Captain America throwing his shield , it never gets old . One satisfying element that also returned is the comedy . Sense of humor works just like it did in the first movie , while it sometimes gets a little bit too cheesy , it surely provides some laughs from moviegoers . \" Guardians of the Galaxy \" still remains the funniest MCU movie to now , but we 'll get to that when I do my review of it . The story is solid ... I think . The villain is so bad . I swear to God that he 's the main reason as to why I almost lower my score to a 5 . When you get out of the theaters or you finish seeing the movie , you 'll realize how uselessly wasted was Malekith . For what I gleaned from the comics is that he 's very powerful , he 's very well - written and he is interesting at the least . Malekith is not intriguing in this movie ! So when a main villain does n't succeed , it almost ruins the movie for me . I do n't care if they decide to do a different take on the character , being completely different from the comics , no , I do n't care . It just has to be good . I do n't care who thought about the character , who wrote her or who even designed her . I do n't care , it just HAS to be good . Is the villain good ? Absolutely not . Is he badass ? No , he 's not . Is the character well - written ? No , not at all . Let 's see , what 's the best villain in Marvel Cinematic Universe ? Um ... let us see ... oh yeah ! Loki . Loki is the best villain in this whole freaking universe . There are good villains like Iron Monger , Killian , Winter Soldier ( he 's not really a villain , more like an antagonist ) , why is Malekith so bad ? The cast returns : Chris Hemsworth , Natalie Portman , Tom Hiddleston , Anthony Hopkins and Stellan Skarsgård , all of them return to reprise their roles , and they 're all just great . Unlike the amazing letdown that Malekith was , the actors ' performances are really nice and they all seem to put an effort in the film to make it good . Loki is in the movie , and once again , you do n't know what 's on his mind . I 'm so confused , what his purposes ? What does he want ? Whatever . Final Score to Thor : The Dark World : 6/10 . A passable super - hero sequel that , despite having some pretty nice battle sequences and a solid cast , it 's weighed down by a completely forgettable villain and an occasionally muddled plot .

Also , Christopher Meloni 's cook character has hair and is n't batshit crazy . None of the above is inherently funny , but that 's what makes it funny . So much of the humor in the Netflix show is contingent on knowing on the first day of camp what happens on the final day of camp . It makes me think that a prequel to Wet Hot American Summer is infinitely funnier than a sequel would have been , at least at a conceptual level . That 's the absurd way that movie - time / series - time works -- with prequels in particular , real - world chronology matters more than in - story chronology . In prequels , set - up is really punchline . To put it another way , what kind of mook watches the Star Wars prequels before they watch the original Star Wars trilogy ? Who pops in Temple of Doom before they watch Raiders of the Lost Ark ? I 'll tell you who : someone doing everything wrong in life . Since the Wet Hot prequel takes place 15-real - word years after the original film , there are a lot of unspoken gags built around the age of the cast . In Wet Hot , actors in their twenties played teenagers , which is common practice for lots of teen movies and coming - of - age films . In First Day of Camp , the teenage counselors are all roughly 40 years old , give or take , which is uncommon practice anywhere . The cast shows their age -- though some have aged better than others ( Rudd and Elizabeth Banks must have paintings rotting in rooms somewhere)--and the wigs / hairstyles look even more fake . It all adds to the show 's enjoyably off - kilter quality . Showalter looks especially schlubby as Coop . Compare Coop in First Day of Camp to Coop in Wet Hot American Summer and it 's a pretty startling before - and - after ( or after - and - before ) . I do n't mean that in a mean - spirited way since it 's part of the humor and all the performers are in on it . It 's actually a smart visual gag that 's used effectively as part of the storytelling . Seeing Showalter next to Lake Bell makes the doomed awkwardness of Coop and Donna 's relationship more apparent . In those 15 real - world years that separate the First Day of Camp from the last day of camp , some of the Wet Hot American Summer cast have become much more famous . For Banks and Poehler , that means more focus on their characters and what makes them each tick . The backstory they 've concocted for Banks ' character Lindsay is especially inspired . It 's a nod to Just One of the Guys and a wink to Cameron Crowe 's real - life adventures as a fake - teen that led to Fast Times at Ridgemont High . With Cooper , by comparison , writers Wain and Showalter have come up with a clever in - story way to accommodate the Academy Award - nominated actor 's busy real - world schedule . ( Cooper had to shoot all of his scenes in just one day . ) The expanded cult following behind Wet Hot American Summer means loads of guest appearances throughout First Day of Camp , including Jon Hamm , Kristen Wiig , Jordan Peele , Michael Cera , Jason Schwartzman , and H. Jon Benjamin . There 's another major cameo I wo n't ruin , though it seems like this particular actor , like Cooper , probably shot all of his scenes in one day . In addition to guest stars , the growing Wet Hot cult translated into a bigger budget ( probably to pay all the guest stars ) . Wet Hot American Summer was shot for $ 1.8 million , though Wain told people it was $ 5 million in the hopes it would help secure a better distribution deal . Judging by this 2013 article from Variety , Netflix probably shelled out $ 1.8 million per episode for First Day of Camp . The scope of the story is larger , and yet there 's still a scruffy , raggedy look to the whole thing that fits with the aesthetic of the film . It 's as if Wain and Showalter figured out how to make everything look chintzier even though the world of the film has grown . And that 's the thing . Part of me wonders if there 'll be a second day of camp . That same part hopes it happens about a decade from now . It would be funnier that way . The Wet Hot American Summer series seems to get better with age . Like the original film , First Day of Camp is rife with anarchic absurdity and chock full of movie ... . Jul 31 // Hubert Vigilla In a lot of ways , Wet Hot American Summer is a cult movie made by the generation that grew up watching cult movies and cult television . Picture this sign on the treehouse : \" The Wet Hot American Summer Cult Club -- No Boomers Allowed ... Unless You 've Seen Zapped with Scott Baio ... or Sledge Hammer ! \" The film takes place in one day at Camp Firewood , the final day at Camp Firewood , the only one that matters . So much happens so quickly that logical notions of time and space have no meaning . An hour - long trip seems to cover a weekend of events , a one - minute training montage seems to cover a week of exercise and self - discovery , a single day carries in it a month - long trajectory of emotions . And that 's the whole point . Wet Hot American Summer takes place in a film version of time and space since it 's a movie about the culminating plots of other movies . Beneath that meta - layer , there 's perhaps a wistful tinge of nostalgia as well -- as a kid , summer seems to go by so fast , like the entire summer is just a single day . Mostly it 's just funny if you think about it , but also if , in a smart and detached way , you really do n't think about it too much . Even though the movie is about the culminating stories of other camp movies , Wet Hot American Summer is n't constructed with a single narrative thrust that climaxes and wraps up neatly . The movie stops and starts as title cards note the passage of in - story meta - movie time . A potential Bad News Bears - style showdown in the middle of the film seems like the big set piece we 've been waiting for , and yet it 's self - consciously avoided . A camper says that the cliche of the big game is trite , and the counselors agree , because ultimately it is trite . Summers , whether a day or an entire season , rarely have that kind of shape with a solid conclusion . Instead , Wet Hot American Summer is more like a feature - length sketch show that just ends when camp ends . The final shot of the film is suitably unceremonious . [ embed]219652:42516:0[/embed ] I think Wet Hot American Summer is alive today because some Gen - Xers got the joke -- were in on the joke -- and are now in power at Netflix . From their streaming thrones , they 're able to dole out the filthy original - series lucre as they see fit . ( And good for them . ) I ca n't help but stress the whole Gen - X angle , which bleeds into a millennial attachment to the film . It may also explain why film critics of the time ( who were predominantly Baby Boomers ) just could n't get into it . The Boomers were n't really in on the joke ; some did n't even get the set - up or that the set - up and punchline were sometimes one in the same . Like other cult followings , there 's a sense of exclusivity . But it does n't stop there : WHAS is pitched specifically to Reagan - era latchkey kids who grew up watching these movies on television , and have a certain generalized nostalgia about the fashions , hairstyles , graphical elements , and other minutiae that seeped into their wood - paneled family rooms . Tobias , a Gen - Xer like that first - wave of classic AV Club writers , is a Wet Hot acolyte . ( Gooble gobble . ) The time - space weirdness of the movie seems to suggest that it 's impossible to make real life work like the movies ; further , if real life worked out that way , it would make reality trite . Wain and collaborators Michael Showalter , Michael Ian Black , Ken Marino , and Joe Lo Truglio were all members of MTV 's sketch show The State , which is one of the cultiest cult shows that ever did cult - show . A lot of the fondness for Wet Hot American Summer comes from an attachment that many had to The State and the projects that the cast embarked on following The State 's cancellation . ( Maybe a question to consider in all this : at what point does fondness become nostalgia ? ) Thinking about it , you really ca n't have sketch comedy without grounding that in the improv tradition . Think of places like Second City , The Upright Citizens Brigade , and The Groundlings . These were the places where SNL and SCTV found their players . Improv is often built on discrete scenes with a common theme , all of which abide by a \" yes and \" mentality between performers in order to keep a joke alive and to enhance it . The \" yes and \" at the heart of improv might be the adult collaborative equivalent of a child using \" and then \" as a conjunction while telling a story that they 're really excited about . It 's also why ( again , if you 're in on the joke ) a lot of the comedy hits . The characters at Camp Firewood are rendered broadly from a collection of tropes , as if hewn from a sketch team 's writing room or from an improv team 's regular house show . Each character is dropped into situations that play to their strengths as comic figures , and it just keeps going -- and then , and then , and then until the end . Beyond that , there 's the awkward interpersonal comedy , mostly having to do with flirting and attraction . There 's slapstick . There 's quotable non - sequiturs mostly from Christopher Meloni as the ' Nam - addled camp cook . The visual gags are there too ( e.g. , why are they wrestling behind the line for corn ? ) , and ditto some audio ones ( e.g. , Wilhelm scream ) . Wet Hot takes its lessons not just from improv and sketch , but also from Zucker , Abrahams , Zucker at their best : keep the jokes coming fast , from different angles , and do n't just rely on one type of humor . The Wet Hot American Summer series on Netflix is a prequel rather than a sequel . A sequel would have made logical sense since they tease a 10-year reunion in the film , a snippet of which is seen after the credits . And yet it 's a prequel show about the first day of camp rather than the last , and most of the cast looks their age ( i.e. , comfortably into their 40s ) . Come to think of it , they 're following up a 90-minute movie about the final day of camp with eight half - hour episodes about the first day of camp . But that 's the joke . Wet Hot American Summer continues its own tradition of operating in a pocket of movie - space and movie - time , and the set - up and punchline are one . Its driving comedy imperative of yes 's , and 's , and then 's hopefully still abides . [ embed]219652:42518:0[/embed ] Next Month ...

Mar 19 // Nick Valdez [ embed]219098:42280:0[/embed ] Ana Maria in Novela LandDirectors : Georgina RiedelRelease Date : February 27th , 2015 Ana Maria , in a nutshell , is like a better version of Freaky Friday . The film follows the titular Ana Maria ( Edy Ganem ) , a twenty something who ca n't hold a job and would rather spend her time live tweeting her favorite novela , Pasión Sin Límites ( or Passion Without Limits ) , than hanging out with her friends . As her favorite character Ariana Tomosa ( once again , Edy Ganem ) seems to have the best life with an upcoming wedding and a hot guy pining for her , Ana Maria wishes that was her life . After a storm , a tweet , and some shenanigans , Ana Maria becomes a part of her favorite telenovela . Now she must make it home before the series ends or she 'll be stuck forever . Ana Maria gently tows the line between homage and parody without ever falling too deep into one of those pitfalls . It 's all part of an effort to make the film a bit more digestible for a wider audience . The film already has a few esoteric barriers to entry ( the audience needs some kind of knowledge of novela culture , and the film has a cast of native Spanish speakers , for example ) , so the choices it makes are understandable but a bit disheartening . For example , while the film is a nice comedy , it never quite goes far enough with its premise . I 'm not sure if it 's a fear of offending anyone , or a lack of confidence in its Spanish flair , but there 's a major sense of holding back . For example , Ana Maria joins the show as a character , rather than switching places with the actress playing that character . So the jokes come from the surface level hokiness already apparent in telenovelas rather than trying to find something deeper . And while most of the film is indeed a fun parody of the tropes , there are a few jokes that are definitely derogatory . Like Luiz Guzman 's Licenciado Schmidt popping around the corner every couple of scenes is funny at first , but grows tired as the film relies on it . That lack of confidence also has an effect on the film 's outcome . Since Ana Maria joins this fantastical world , her decision to return home never quite feels real . Thanks to the show 's plot giving her a deadline , Ana Maria does n't come to her conclusions through character work but through ease of plot . It 's like she 'd rather live her boring life than die , and that 's not a great message to go out on . But there 's one major aspect I would like to touch on , and it 's the one thing that separates this film from most comedies : Ana Maria never loses her agency . It 's a refreshing skew of Latino culture . Latino culture ( whether they be Mexican , or from the Central and Southern American regions ) follows traditional beats . You know , grow up through church , get married and have kids at a certain age . While the film at first criticizes Ana Maria 's choice to be alone ( notably , it 's her choice ) , the film 's ending , while forced , makes that not seem so bad . Ana Maria 's sister may have a traditional marriage , but the film allows Ana Maria the freedom to go through the film 's journey in the first place . It 's a small , but powerful detail . Beyond its story , the film 's production is quite well done . It took me awhile to realize Ana Maria and Ariana Tomosa were played by the same actress , and I 'll give the film credit for managing the feat with just some makeup and hair tricks . And while I wish the film would 've sunk further into its telenovela world ( we only see one set piece , and it 's not used very well ) , every scene in the show is given a nice glaze . A bit foggy , a bit mystical . It definitely retains its fantastical appeal . Ana Maria in Novela Land is a nice first step into broadening Latino culture in film . It portrays a facet of that culture rarely seen with analytical eyes , but never quite has a statement one way or the other . It 's a nice comedy that pokes fun at the genre , and Edy Ganem is a great lead , but the film lacks bite . She livin ' a life just like a movie star It 's been a tough time for Latino representation in pop culture .

Aug 10 // Alec Kubas - Meyer Blood Feast 2 : All U Can Eat tells the story of Fuad Ramses III ( J.P. Delahoussaye ) , the grandson of Fuad Ramses I , the killer from Blood Feast . One day , Fuad III finds out that he is now in possession of his grandfather 's old catering building , so he shows up to claim what 's his . Immediately upon arriving , he is interrogated by Detective Michael Myers ( Mark McLachlan ) , whose father was on the police force during the Fuad Ramses murder case way back when . Fuad III , obviously , knows nothing about the exploits of his murderous grandfather , and continues on his way . Soon he gets his first ( and , as far as the film is concerned , only ) catering job : a wedding for Tiffani Lampley ( Toni Wynne ) , although all of the preparations are run through her horrible mother ( Melissa Morgan ) . It starts off simple enough , but Fuad III soon finds a statue of the Egyptian goddess Ishtar in a locked room in the back of the building and is brainwashed . It is time for him to complete the sacrificial Blood Feast for Ishtar that his grandfather never could . But the story 's not important . It 's all about the violence and nudity , the things that made exploitation films what they were . The films in The Blood Trilogy , while certainly violent , lacked any real nudity . There was some almost - nudity at times , but none of them were as explicit as many of his other films were . Blood Feast 2 , on the other hand , is very explicit indeed . Although there is no full frontal nudity , anyone expecting to see breasts will not walk away disappointed . They are there , and they come in all shapes and sizes . Some of them are horrifyingly still while in motion ( implants are really creepy looking ) while others are perfectly natural . Variety is the spice of life , as they say . And speaking of spices , this is a movie about a caterer , so there 's quite a lot of food . Detective Myers 's partner , Sam Loomis ( John McConnell ) , is constantly eating . Almost every shot that he 's in there is some kind of food in his hands or his mouth . It 's a running gag that as he 's finishing one snack / meal , he complains about hunger and asks Myers if he wants to go get something else . Realistically , he 's not fat enough for that to mirror his actual eating habits , but it 's not like he 's Christian Bale in The Machinist or anything . But Fuad III 's dishes are a bit more disturbed than donuts or tacos . Instead , he takes livers , eyes , or whatever else his cookbook ( entitled How to Serve Man , of course ) tells him he needs . The blood flows primarily from Tiffani 's bridal party , including such characters as Misty Morning and Candy Graham . But even though it 's dumb , and there are a lot of jokes that are silly for the sake of being silly , it 's not always so simple . Some of the jokes require at least a little bit of thought , and every once in a while the jokes stop being so juvenile . If you saw the original Blood Feast , there are some wonderful in - jokes for you . My personal favorite , and one that gets me to this day when I just think about it deals with the very nature of Ishtar . Beyond the joke itself ( which is pretty awesome ) , it 's very telling about the state of H. G. Lewis 's films in the early 1960s . I wo n't spoil it , but believe me when I say it 's a fantastic moment , and you will know it when you see it . As a piece of so - bad - it's - good cinema , Blood Feast 2 finds itself in an interesting position . Unlike Troll 2 , Birdemic , or other films of that sort , it is entirely self - aware , as Lewis 's films always were ( at least somewhat ) . Usually this leads to a film that is inherently broken . Making a film that you know is bad in the hopes of striking comedic gold is the easiest way to make a film that is legitimately bad and nothing more . It 's like anything Tommy Wiseau could do now . The House that Drips Blood on Alex had its moments , but it did n't compare to the beauty of The Room . But Tommy Wiseau is not H. G. Lewis . The only other director I can think of working today who could match his exploitation pedigree would be Roger Corman , and Corman has stayed away for the camera for even longer than Lewis has ; he 's just a producer now . So Lewis has a reputation for films that are so bad they 're good , and now he wants to take it to the next level . If The Gore Gore Girls and Blood Feast and all of his other films were horror with a tinge of comedy , Blood Feast 2 is comedy with a tinge of horror . At every moment it 's looking at the camera and telling you that it knows exactly what 's wrong with it , but it harkens back to a time when people did n't . When the scenes are shot day - for - night ( shot during the day but with a dark blue filter to simulate nighttime ) it 's ridiculous because that 's how it used to be . The occasionally awful audio dubbing ( e.g. in that first day - for - night shot ) serves the same purpose . These are some of the more cerebral jokes , but they 're more about the familiarity and nostalgia . If you know what things used to be like , seeing them used in a modern context is bizarre and wonderful . Yes , technology has made leaps and bounds , but staying firmly in the realm of the unbelievable and basking in it makes Blood Feast 2 unique . But even if the severed heads and cut bellies are clearly fake , the things inside are a bit more real . Back in the day ( I say as though I was alive then ) , H. G. Lewis would spend excruciatingly long periods of time with closeups ( or even extreme close ups ) of the gore in a given scene . A killer would remove an organ and then stroke it for ten , fifteen , twenty seconds . They would n't do anything else with it . It was all for the audience , always for the audience . I always felt it was a bit excessive , but who am I to judge ? Blood Feast 2 gets the right proportion of time . There 's plenty of intestine pulling and stroking ( not a euphemism ) , but it does n't get annoying in the way that it was . I should note that there are two versions of this film , one which runs about 93 minutes , and the other ( director 's cut ) version is 99 . Having never seen the cut version , I ca n't say what the differences are , but I ca n't imagine they did anything other than make the film less amazing . Regardless , I expect no matter what version you get , this film is not for anyone with a weak stomach . Long gone is the bright red paint of the original three in The Blood Trilogy . I have n't seen a liver , but I have no doubt that 's what it looks like . I have no doubt that all of those organs belonged to some kind of animal previously ( probably a pig , since that is the animal they popularized 4 decades ago ) . They look very real , and even if some of the important organs ( like the heart and lungs ) do n't seem to be anywhere in the meat - caverns that are Fuad III 's victims , does n't mean the illusion is n't effective . What really makes Blood Feast 2 : All U Can Eat so brilliant , though , is its complete dedication to its parody . This is again why having H. G. Lewis at the helm makes the film so unique . Exploitation and other intentionally - so - bad - they're - good films have been on the rise in recent years , but they 're mostly from filmmaking newcomers , frequently people who were born after the golden era of exploitation films ( 1960s and ' 70s , for those of you unaware ) . Maybe they grew up with drive - ins , but it was n't their stuff on screens . They parody those films from a very different mindset . They parody other peoples ' work . H. G. Lewis parodies his own . Admittedly , that could completely and utterly fall apart , but it does n't . It really does n't . Also , John Waters plays a pedophile priest . And , really , that should be enough for you .

Then it devolved into an hour and a half Family Guy or American Dad episode . Each joke less memorable than the one before it . Throughout the movie I could n't help but feel sorry for Mila Kunis . ( Maybe McFarlane has something on her and blackmailed her into starring ? ) And Mark Wahlberg played a completely unlikable loser . You do n't want him to get the girl . Teenagers and 10-year - old boys will enjoy this movie because they enjoy anything that is crass . It makes them feel older and more powerful . Maybe that 's what McFarlane 's motivation behind his work is ? ... Expand . Ted seemed to be a good movie , although the idea is very interesting and original , because nobody could possibly think in another use for a teddy bear than a toy for a little child . The director , Seth MacFarlane , obviously used his experience for creating this story in which a kid with no friends grows up with ted , entering both to a world of parties , sex and drugs .

The director , Seth MacFarlane , obviously used his experience for creating this story in which a kid with no friends grows up with ted , entering both to a world of parties , sex and drugs . The problem is that the protagonist is now an adult with a girlfriend ( asking for marriage ) and a job , but he still has ted , with the exception that now it is promiscuous and a very bad influence . The film consists in funny situations about this couple and how it breaks with the adult world . The problem with this picture is that the jokes and situations are very weakly constructed and with the simplicity of a child . At no time this movie made me laugh , even more , I got bored . The story is poor and predictable , the performances are disgusting and the direction is awful , however how you can not expect a complex humor from the guy who created Family Guy . Is shallow , is repetitive , is Ted - ious . ... Expand . So , was it worth my while investing 106 minutes of my life on this one ? I have to say , on balance ; not really . Yes there are some wonderfully comic moments and smart one - liners in there but I did find it drifted far too much from the sublime to the ridiculous . Also , one minute Ted is ' Brian ' for Family Guy and the next he turns into ' Peter Griffin ' from the same show ( despite his denials ) .

Also , one minute Ted is ' Brian ' for Family Guy and the next he turns into ' Peter Griffin ' from the same show ( despite his denials ) . I thought both Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis did a good job ; both of their characters were quite believable . Ultimately though I did find it lacked the one thing it so desperately needed ; heart . Still , I 'm sure the many devotees of ' Family Guy ' will love this one but for me , sadly , it 's a bit of a dud . SteelMonster 's verdict : NOT RECOMMENDED ( ... unless you 're a really big fan of Family Guy , in which case why have n't you seen it yet ! ) The only thing ' shocking ' about this movie is how lazy the writing is . Some good moments here , including a really funny bit part played by Joel McHale . Mila Kunis and Mark Wahlberg are good but they can not carry a poor movie with a boring plot and weak jokes . The humour was base , unoriginal and just lame . If you 're into racist stereotypes and fart jokes , this movie is for you . If you are a fan of Family or Judd Apatow films you will be entertained by this one . However , if you are looking for comedy gold , you should probably look elsewhere . Best enjoyed with a group of guys at least 3 - 4 drinks in when you turn it on . Ted was maybe the funniest movie I 've seen all year . Mark Wahlberg played a pretty good role but Mila Kunis and Seth MacFarlane ( as Ted ) steal the show . Mila is absolutely stunning as usual and MacFarlane 's sense of humor is so deranged that you ca n't help but find it hilarious . This definitely is n't a movie for everyone .

Ted is nothing more than a juvenile film with crude and mostly unfunny sex jokes . The movie is over the top punctuated by a few bright spots here and there . It seemed like Seth MacFarlane wrote down any stupid joke that came to mind and threw it all together .

Its not crude enough to be a great shock comedy and its too risque to be an enjoyable coming of age comedy and as such falls somewhere uncomfortable between . ... Expand . This movie started out well and was funny initially . It , however , dropped off 3/4 of the way through . Had to wade through the last 20 minutes . Mark Walberg did a fine job of being a bachelor that refuses to grow up with Mila Kunis being his faithful GF trying to make him face a reality of life . Had high hopes for it from the trailers but left disappointed in the result . This movie was HORRIBLE . There is nothing redeeming about it , Ted sounds like Peter of the Family Guy ( Macfarlane does the voice ) which is irritating enough since the same tripe comes out of the bear 's mouth as Peter 's .

The movie had me laugh all the way and the ending got a lot more serious . If you remotely like any of Seth MacFarlane 's earlier work then you will love this film . Firstly , I do n't think Ted could have been cast any better .

I do n't really have any negative criticism for the film , the only thing I can suggest to anyone thinking about going to watch the film - do n't go in expecting anything more than a comedy . It does what it says on the tin and it 's hilarious . ... Expand . All I heard from this movie was \" If you love Family Guy you 'll love this , \" Family Guy being one of my favorite shows , I thought I would have a riot with Ted ... but I was deeply disappointed .

The main problem with Ted is that it recycles a lot of its own jokes and it relies way too heavily on toilet humor . Seeing hooker excrement just is nt that funny . The jokes are n't all bad though , there are definitely a few instances of Seth McFarlane 's comedic genius with his pop culture references and parodies , but these were too few and too far apart . Another problem of the movie is its premise of a talking teddy bear . I was \" on board \" with it at first , but the finale of the movie reversed the mythos and just made it seem silly and not well - thought out at all . But to the movies strengths ; Mila Kunis and Mark Wahlberg were great together and a lot of the cameos did great . In the End : This feels like every other Seth McFarlane project that is n't Family Guy . It 's forgettable and stupid with barely any laughs and you wish you were just watching Family Guy instead . ... Expand . I 'd say \" Ted \" 's a OK movie . The teddy bear 's got the family - guy style humor going on , which is pretty hilarious , But except for Ted , the movie is n't really that exciting ; it 's the teddy bear that makes the movie . Seth MacFarlane 's big screen debut comes in the form of Ted . As a fan of his work I was definetly looking forward to this . And largely , it 's hilarious !

The film itself begins with a young John Bennett ( Mark Wahlberg ) , a lonely child who upon receiving a teddy bear for his Christmas wishes he could talk . The next morning , John 's wish comes true and Ted ( Seth MacFarlane ) can indeed talk and briefly becomes a celebrity . The film picks up in the modern day where John and Ted are living in Boston . Both , however are still childish , immature and spend most of the time smoking pot ! John is also in a four - year relationship with the stunning Lori ( Mila Kunis ) . During their anniversary Lori reveals that she wants more from their relationship but feels they ca n't move on with Ted around . This tests John 's friendship to maximum as he tries to maintain his relationship with Lori and keep his bromance intact with Ted . It results in a fantastically funny comedy . It may seem juvenile but believe me Ted has a lot on offer ! Wahlberg and MacFarlane nail the chemistry between their characters as they bounce of each other wonderfully well . Mila Kunis is n't just the eye candy as she fits in perfectly to MacFarlane 's witty world of comedy once again . Ted is often hilarious and at times very rated - R , however not all the time , it 's largely hit but does have a few misses along the way . What makes the film even more appealing is that at the heart of it is a tale of friendship , love and loyalty . Definetly the must see comedy of the summer and one that is throughly enjoyable throughout ! MacFarlane 's debut is hilariously impressive , if slightly drawn out but it all pays off in the end .

At a certain point in the movie ( maybe 30 mins in ) I realized this is as good as it gets .

Do n't waste ur money at the movies an unfortunate mistake I made . ... Expand . This \" romance versus bromance \" amalgam , is centrally premised around the wish one lonely boy makes one Christmas evening in hopes of transmuting his furry teddy bear into real - life companion ; sound familiar ? Pinocchio , perhaps ? So , as anticipated , the following morning sees once - friendless John Bennett , granted with the wish of his dreams , and the start of what will become a life of Peter - Pan syndrome ; only we 're talking about something more potent than pixie dust . It 's all so funny at first , seeing a stoner in the guise of what has long been considered the staple of puerile comfort and security . But , MacFarlane lives to obliterate long - standing conceptions , especially mores . Aside from some one - liners that do n't quite stick , seemingly procrastinate editing ( some scenes feel as if they were indecisively cut ) , and a slightly unbalanced script , the high - concept comedy is fitting , serving its purpose -- riotous Friday night laugh - out - louds -- and satisfying audiences . Ted , no longer possesses the same shocking affectation he laid onto audiences in the film 's first hour . And , after the relationship with Lori is halted , Ted is surely going to wind up in trouble , too , right ? You guessed it , enter Giovanni Ribisi . But , in a macro sense , \" Ted , \" is undoubtedly hilarious in parts , and with the combination of MacFarlane 's expressiveness of voice and the CG - animated , Ted is a character one can only root for , regardless of how ribald he really is . The soundtrack is charmingly , as well as deliberately cliché , but it successfully bolsters MacFarlane 's self - mockery and recurring hilarity with the far - from - kiddy - Ted . Moreover , Wahlberg ( feeling comfortable in his Boston hood ) and Kunis ( underused as usual ) do a fair job at delineating the on - the - edge couple ( albeit the real feat is in acting with a voided - CG - animated Ted ) . And , Patrick Warburton 's ( Guy ) impassive , basso - profundo - gruff - sounding - self is aptly humorous . As for the peculiar love triangle between Ted , John , and their hero Sam Jones , the vaguely remembered ' Gordon ' star wo n't pacify most of its intended audience , and feels patched together . Likewise , the film 's third act , which clumsily throws in some peril to regain some faltering sympathies , looks and feels forced . Ultimately , \" Ted \" is unduly and deliberately offensive , stuffed with taboo and sacrilege , a tinge of sentimental relish , clumps of aimless fluff , loose strings , and an irrelevance sewn with a real , bearing heart . ...

While it was funny to a point , I could have just watched a few episodes of Family Guy and got the same exact material . It was built up way too much and like a lot of movies , the previews showed just about all the funny parts . I would still recommend it though for anyone that enjoys McFarlene 's TV shows . Ted is not a kids movie , yet I saw tons of kids at the last evening performance . Bad parenting exists . Ted is very crude at times and consistently goes for race humor . But I still thought the movie was funny . Some people will be turned off by some of the more extreme comic moments and that 's ok . This movie is not for everybody , especially not kids . If you do not like Family guy then do not waste your time since this is just a long family guy episode . That said the story is nothing groundbreaking but it does flow well and make sense . Once again if you love family guy chances are you will enjoy this too . The movie is pretty good . It has the humor of later \" Family Guy \" episodes mainly filled with one - liners and using drugs and sex to make jokes ( which honestly is n't that funny ) .

So , obviously , I was n't the only one that felt the pace left something to be desired . The digital teddy bear was incredibly well executed , and all the actors performed their parts perfectly . But since we are in the year 2012 and we have all seen our fare share of believable digital characters , a movie needs more than a stuffed animal as a gimmick . My advice , if you got nothing better to do , are close to a movie theater , and you are not looking to fall off your chair laughing , then go see this one . It 'll suffice . But if you wanna cry your heart out , there are far better choices in any online film library . Either way , this movie wo n't disappoint you . ... Expand . In my honest opinion , I had expected more out of Seth . It just feels like he does more effort on family guy , than what he did on Ted . Would I pay again to see the movie ? More than likely not . Would I get it on DVD ? Yes , but I would only watch it if other friends have not seen it and we could all \" try \" to laugh together . Downright hilarious and offensive , with surprising heart , we 've come to suspect nothing less from Seth McFarlane . However , the film is heavy on exposition and low on plot , leading to an unnecessary dragging feeling in spots . Has a few funny sections , but overall lazy humor that depends on jokes about bodily functions and things a 12 year old boy might find funny . If you like that type of thing than check in out . Clever idea , and had a lot of potential , but ultimately was just a raunchier version of Family Guy , only not as good . Seth MacFarlane has done what no - one else has been able to do - put Mila Kunis in a lousy movie . Do n't get me wrong , there were some funny lines and bits , but overall a sloppy conglomeration of R rated Family Guy jokes surrounded by a needless \" sensitive \" plot and totally useless subplot . Save your money , wait for the dvd and watch the 15 minutes that were actually funny . Wow ! ! A movie about a teddy bear that comes to life . This movie is wrong in so many ways . A teddy bear with hookers come on when I think of a movie with a cute teddy bear i think of winnie the poo . a kids movie . Well not here this is not meant for kids and all . Yes it does have few funny moments but not worth watching . If this is where movies have gone its time to read a book . I was anticipating a roller - coaster of laugh out loud and cringe worthy in steady intervals . Instead Ted really just glides at average speeds . Nothing was absurd or unbearable but nothing was all that funny either . The trailers ruined a good amount of the better material . Great concept and visuals with the bear , itself . Mark Wahlberg was excellent . The problem with the film is Seth MacFarlen , himself . He does n't know when to pull back ! The flatulence jokes and I 'm gay / not gay references are overdone and the segment about the \" droppings \" on the floor goes beyond vulgar .

Although the movie is pretty funny , it just recycles all of the jokes that were used in Family Guy and uses a different protagonist and more vulgar comedy . The idea for the movie is good and I enjoyed it a lot , but if you are n't a Family Guy or Seth MacFarlane fan , you may want to avoid this . It 's not really a mature movie . Well , it 's not mature at all , but , if you 're a fan of Family Guy , you 'll love this . The same style of crude humour is still funny here . I was laughing through most of it , although it did slow down near the end . You want bear puns ? Look no further ! Thankfully , though , the humour in Ted is somewhat more refined . For most TV show creators , the opportunity to translate their talents to the big screen comes with a license to push boundaries in new and exciting ways not available through the medium of television .

For most TV show creators , the opportunity to translate their talents to the big screen comes with a license to push boundaries in new and exciting ways not available through the medium of television . For Seth MacFarlane , creator of the outrageously outrageous Family Guy and ridiculously underrated American Dad ! , it must have just felt like another day at the office . John Bennett ( Mark Wahlberg ) is the loneliest kid in Boston . While the other children engage in unique Christmas traditions , John spends his days inside , wishing for just one friend . On Christmas Day , that wish comes true in the form of Ted the stuffed bear ( MacFarlane ) , who is magically transformed into a living being , the miraculous story of which spreads like wildfire across the country . Fast - forward nearly thirty years and Ted 's fame has long - since vanished . He and John now spend their days getting high , watching bad movies and managing John 's relationship with Lori ( Mila Kunis ) . As if to state the painfully obvious , the amount of fun to be had with this film is heavily influenced by how familiar one is with MacFarlane 's comedic style . Each of his animated creations employ sharp one - liners , bizarre set pieces and a ton of pop culture references , all of which are prominent in Ted . Naturally , the humour is all sorts of politically incorrect , with jokes ranging from drugs to sex to September 11 . Highlights include Ted 's job interview at the local supermarket , Patrick Stewart 's narration and a house party with Sam Jones , star of Ted and John 's favourite film of all - time , Flash Gordon . It is made clear by the closing credits where the bulk of the effort went into making this film , as most jokes hit resulting in an array of instantly quotable material making it difficult to watch Ted without a perpetual smile on your face . With so many references to popular culture jam - packed within two hours , most international viewers are likely to misunderstand jokes about Tom Brady , Pepperidge Farm and those promiscuous ' Bahstan Gahls ' , but the film does more than enough to keep all viewers chuckling throughout . The film tends to cruise in areas not pertaining to straight - out comedy , which may be a direct side effect of MacFarlane 's first outing in the director 's chair . Regardless , the film refuses to take itself too seriously with plenty of tension - breaking jokes that , along with a multitude of A - list cameos , work a whole lot better than would appear on paper . Indifferent viewers will enjoy Ted without differentiating it from most other contemporary comedies , while fans of the director 's prior work are likely to draw a lot more enjoyment out of every scene . If you 're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication , I 'd also love to hear from you . Great film very funny loved all the cameo 's some risky gags well gag topics but all the same very entertaining I will be buying this one you can watch it over and over again and it will still be very funny a must see . This review contains spoilers , click expand to view . Ted is unapologetic , raunchiness to the extreme , and the best comedy of the year so far . And , it 's got a teddy bear behaving badly . In my youth , I enjoyed the company of my very own Winnie the Pooh bear . I can not remember if he ever had clothes , but he did have these sewed - on eyes that eventually fell off . I took that bear everywhere : it flew with me on vacations , helped to bag fruits at the grocery store , watched Star Trek : TOS , and basically kept me company through all those nights of being an only child . Pooh was always there for me , kinda like a brother I never had . But , what would happen if Pooh could have talked , becoming a live person with emotions and a personality to boot ? What if your favorite toy could talk , but unlike the dolls in Toy Story , yours cussed or misbehaved while you looked on and laughed ? That is the premise behind Ted , an absolute raunch - fest that 's adorable , yet incredibly anti - PC at the same time , and the best comedy so far of the year . As a result of his childhood wish , eight - year old Johnny Bennett gets the dream of a lifetime fulfilled : his teddy bear begins to talk and act with real human emotions . Ted becomes an overnight phenomenon , appearing on Johnny Carson and confusing Ed McMahon , who refers to him as the puppet alien Alf . Fast forward 27 years , and Ted ( Seth MacFarlane ) is a forgotten , jaded , foul - mouthed former 80s celebrity who is drinking ( yes , drinking ) and smoking bongs ( yes , it is true ) with the now older John ( Mark Wahlberg ) . And just like his Thunder Buddy , John is a manchild loser , working the counter at a Boston rental car company with no interest in moving up . But the two are content to hang out , quoting lines from Flash Gordon , with Ted inviting strippers to the apartment while Lori and John celebrate their four - year anniversary . When the party goes awry ( and I mean bad in a seriously stinky way ) , John kicks Ted out and makes him get a job . Viewed as a mere speed bump , Ted still drags John over to wild parties at his place , and encourages him to ditch work so they can watch the cast of Cheers on DVD talk crap about each other . Lori wants that kind of camaraderie with John , but instead must have jokes explained to her and ultimately learns that John has made her ringtone The Dark Vader Theme from The Empire Strikes Back . Eventually , the line is drawn : ditch the bear , or lose the girl . MacFarlanes feature debut is filled with sharp and terrific one - liners , as well as a teddy bear - human fight that might go down as one of the best throwdowns ever . Wahlberg and Kunis have great chemistry and believably carry off the relationship part of Ted . While too sleazy to be called a classic romantic comedy , our human actors do an excellent job of pouring on the schmaltz in the serious scenes , leaving audiences to wonder whether they should be laughing or crying . MacFarlane 's dialogue is so crisp and its execution so flawless that this 106-minute film could have succeeded whether Ted was a CGI bear or not . Ted is also filled with some terrific and well - placed cameos , including the appearance of Flash Gordons Sam Jones . But do not think this is just a romp through 80s raunch : Ted also shines in its ability to lend human traits to fuzzy childhood pals in a way few films can . John 's connection with his Thunder Buddy is real and flat out touching at times , especially near the film 's end . And while that ending feels rushed , the overall effect is none the worst for wear . Again , let me be clear : Ted is definitely not a heartwarming , feel - good film about children and their stuffed companions . It is way too perverse and definitely not for kids , and ( without giving it away ) the end will honestly be too traumatic for them . That should not keep anyone of age from skipping the most hilarious film I have seen since The Hangover . Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg , take note : this is how raunch is done right . Ted reminds us of the strange habits of our youth and the unswerving connection we had to our childhood toys . But , it also takes us back to a time when we took everything for granted , when our bears and dolls protected us during thunderstorms and laughed with us on the swing set . And while my Pooh Bear is still in a plastic bag in the garage , it might be time to dust him off , although I doubt I will catch him dry - humping a counter or doing cocaine in our bathroom . ...

Karen wants Andy to stop lying . Why did Maggie , the mother 's best friend , fall out of their seventh story apartment window ? She knows her son . He 's sweet . But whose footprints are those on the kitchen counter top ? She needs answers . Andy tells her mother that his belated birthday gift , a Good Guy doll , is actually Charles Lee Ray , an angel who was sent down from heaven by daddy to look over him . \" Chucky \" for short , the man otherwise known as \" The Lakeshore Strangler \" , is evil incarnate , and in the guise of a slightly effeminate doll , the possessed toy manipulates Andy into being his collaborator , in Tom Holland 's Child 's Play . What Andy really needs is a dog , but they 're city dwellers , Chicagoan urbanites , living in an apartment complex that 's probably not hospitable to animals . John Bennett(an only child just like Andy ) , on the other hand , resides in the suburbs , yet his cheap parents get him a teddy bear for Christmas , when they could easily accommodate a cute puppy for their lonely son . Lacking the wherewithal of imagination that can bring a stuffed animal to life through role - playing , John wishes for his bear to be instilled with life , just as a shooting star traverses across the dusky sky outside the Bennett household . To some , the shooting star , is a sign of good things to come , but for others , it can be representative of a fallen angel , or worse , Satan himself . The film assumes the former , and yet a case could be made for the alternative . No Hobbes , this Ted , since people can see and hear the bear , starting with John 's flummoxed parents , whose reaction towards the living breathing stuffed animal is not much different from Karen 's own horror when Chucky suddenly comes to life in her hands . Genres are fluid things . Mrs. Bennett compares Ted to the baby Jesus , a miracle , whereas the possession of the Good Guy doll constitutes a thaumaturgical event , the practitioning of voodoo , thereby animating the inanimate with diabolism , a curse . Similar to Chucky , the teddy bear has two voices : a canned one , devised by the toy company , and a real one , as if produced by actual vocal cords . While Chucky is a known quantity , we know next to nothing about Ted 's linguistical origins . Who is he , really ? In a sense , they 're hiding from God . Later , when John and Lori reconcile , they get married at a pagan church , a quasi - religious ceremony based on the teachings of Flash Gordon , with Sam J. Jones residing . Happy ending notwithstanding , Ted is the root cause of John 's extended adolescence ; his slacker lifestyle , an evocation of the idiom \" the devil finds work for idle hands \" . At 35 , John has a dead end job at a car rental agency , and spends most of his free time on the sofa , getting stoned and watching bad movies with Ted . But things could be worse . Like Hellboy , the star of the Gullimero del Toro films , Ted fell in the right hands , in which kindness helped nurture win the fight over nature , and tempered the inherent wickedness of the monster . The filmmaker , intentional or not , accentuates the bear 's position as a surrogate dog , when the short - lived celebrity , bristling over having to find menial work , says : \" This is how the cast of Different Strokes feel every hour . \" Julie Sawyer , a struggling actress in Samuel Fuller 's White Dog , loses a role to Laura Drummond , whose last name , of course , is the same as the father who adopts Willis and Arnold . Easily Ted could have taken to hate crimes , along the lines of Julie 's German shepherd , a \" white dog \" , or rather , an attack dog , specially trained to kill black people . Donny , the stalker who kidnaps Ted , has the potential of undoing the bear 's sound upbringing , thereby intensifying the racist disposition the stuffed animal has towards Latinos into action . At a drug - fueled party , the stoned pair talk about opening an Italian restaurant , an exclusive one , if Ted has his way . While the bear concedes to permitting Jews as patrons , he draws the line on Mexicans . A misogynist , too , Ted displays a particular hatred for the local women . In that aforementioned fight with John , the comic tone of their no holds barred brawl obscures Ted 's intent to kill John . His disrespect for the \" good book \" reveals the latent devil inside . Without the counterbalancing effect of love , Ted could have become a \" brown bear \" , or perhaps , \" The Boston Strangler \" . ... Expand .

However , I can say that I 'll never look at parsnips in the same way again . ... Expand . After going to so many movies where it seemed that graphic violence had substituted for plot and character development , it was a great change to go to a movie where rapid fire one liners substituted for everything . I needed this silly movie to pick up my mood . Yes the vehicles worn out but the jokes land more that they miss . I needed this silly movie to pick up my mood . Yes the vehicles worn out but the jokes land more that they miss . A night of rowdy comedy with hookers , bongs , getting stoned and a talking perverted bear were just what I needed .

      "Dr. Seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive. Cat in the Hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, big mistake! Myers proves he can't act in this film. He acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. The kids in this movie are all right, somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying. The story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never tweak with the original story! Bringing in the evil neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life.This movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it. The film sure does look tacky! Sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word, mildly funny. At least the Grinch had spunk, and the film was actually good! This film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting. Was Mike Myers even in this movie actually? And another thing, the fish. What is with that stupid fish! First time you see him, he's an actual fish. Next time you see him, he's all animated and talking. But he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough! This film is a total off target wreck. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke, that was good. So please if you have the choice, watch the Grinch instead of this mess.\n"

      "I ran across this several years ago while channel surfing on a Sunday afternoon. Though it was obviously a cheesy TV movie from the 70s, the direction and score were well done enough that it grabbed my attention, and indeed I was hooked and had to watch it through to the end. I recently got the opportunity to buy a foreign DVD of this film (oops, didn't notice a domestic one had finally come out a couple months prior), and was very pleased to be able to watch it again (and in its entirety).I don't wholly understand the phenomenon, but somehow the 70s seem to have a lock on horror movies that are actually scary. The decades prior to the 70s produced some beautifully shot films and the bulk of our enduring horror icons, but are they actually scary? No, not very. Likewise in the years since the 70s we've gotten horror movies that are cooler, more exciting, have much better production values and sophisticated special effects, are more fun, funnier, have effective \"jump\" moments, and some very creative uses of gore, but again... they aren't really scary! There's just something about the atmosphere of the 70s horror films. The grainy film quality. The spookily dark scenes unilluminated by vast high-tech lighting rigs. The \"edge of dreamland\" muted quality of the dialogue and the weird and stridently EQ'd scores. The odd sense of unease and ugliness permeating everything. Everything that works to undermine most movies of the 70s, in the case of horror, works in its favor.Specifically, in this film, the quiet, intense shots of the devil dog staring people down is fairly unnerving. So much more effective than if they had gone the more obvious route of having the dog be growling, slavering, and overtly hostile (\"Cujo\"?). The filmmakers wisely save that for when the dog appears in its full-on supernatural form. The effects when that occurs, while unsophisticated by today's standards, literally gave me chills. The bizarre, vaguely-defined, \"I'm not quite sure what I'm looking at\" look intuitively strikes me as more like how a real supernatural vision would be, rather than the hyper-real, crystal clear optical printer / digital compositor confections of latter-day horror films.While the human characters in this film are not as satisfyingly rendered as their nemesis or the world they inhabit, the actors all do a decent job. The pairing of the brother and sister from the \"Witch Mountain\" movies as, yes, brother and sister, is a rather cheesy bit of stunt casting, but they do fine. Yvette Mimieux always manages to be entertaining if unspectacular. Richard Crenna earns more and more empathy from the audience as the film progresses. His self-doubt as he wonders whether his family's alienness is truly due to a supernatural plot or whether he's merely succumbing to paranoid schizophrenia is pretty well handled, though his thought that getting a routine physical may provide an explanation for what he's been experiencing is absurd in its naïveté.The movie's The-End-Question-Mark type ending is one of the only ones I've seen that doesn't feel like a cheap gimmick, and actually made me think about the choices these characters would be faced with next and what they'd be likely to do and how they'd feel about it.Detractors of this film may say it's merely a feature-length vehicle for some neato glowing retina shots, but hey, you could say the same thing about \"Blade Runner\". :-)\n",
