      "University of Johannesburg professors rejected propsal , endorsed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu , to cut ties with Ben - Gurion University . University of Johannesburg professors rejected calls to sever ties with an Israeli university Wednesday , but called on Ben - Gurion University to work with its Palestinian counterparts . The South African university 's faculty senate met Wednesday to vote on the proposal , which had been endorsed by anti - apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu , but instead accepted a compromise without a vote . They asked Ben - Gurion University to work with Palestinian universities on research projects , and to start the collaborations within six months if it wants to maintain ties with the University of Johannesburg . UJ Vice Chancellor Adam Habib said the compromise reflected his institution 's values . \" We believe in reconciliation , \" Habib said . \" We 'd like to bring BGU and Palestinian universities together to produce a collective engagement that benefits everyone . \" The universities have joint research projects and academic exchanges on biotechnology and water purification . Relations between Ben - Gurion University and Rand Afrikaans University , a formerly all - white university under South Africa 's apartheid system , began in 1987 . The University of Johannesburg , created in 2005 , took over various campuses including Rand Afrikaans University and a university in the black township of Soweto as part of efforts to ensure higher education was transformed with the rest of South Africa after the end of apartheid . Israel officially opposed apartheid , but its ties with the white government were seen as close . South Africa 's post - apartheid government has been a sharp critic of Israel 's Palestinian policies . The late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was among the guests at Nelson Mandela 's 1994 inauguration as South Africa 's first black president . Tutu and more than 200 prominent South African academics had supported ending UJ 's links with the Israeli institution . Academic boycotts of Israeli universities have been inspired by boycotts of South African institutions during apartheid . Elvis has left the building . I have yet to make my mind up about the BDS ( Boycott - Divestment - Sanctions ) option against Israel . It seems like I have a different opinion about it every other day . What I do feel lately , though , is that it 's just not time yet for BDS , especially when no real effort to put political\\diplomatic pressure has ever taken place , neither by Europe and particularly the U.S. This route , in my opinion , should be exhausted first , and if and when this fails -- it may be time to think about BDS . As some of you may know , Elvis Costello recently cancelled his gig in Israel . I did n't buy a ticket for this one , but I can understand a lot of the anger out there . It 's not cool to book a concert , sell every ticket , and then cancel for political reasons . Then again , the occupation is n't too \" cool \" either . Nonetheless , Elvis -- next time do us a favor and nip it at the bud . Yali Sobol , an Israeli rocker who writes for the liberal local Tel Aviv weekly Ha'ir , had a good piece about Costello 's move , which I ca n't say I agree with totally- but definitely got me thinking . Here 's an excerpt I 've translated : . \" There are two main prerequisites for a boycott . The first -- that the side being boycotted is weaker than the side that is doing the boycotting . Nobody boycotts the class bully , nobody boycotts the Chinese over Tibet , the Russians over Chechnya or the Turks over the Kurds . In the spring of 2010 the singer Elvis Costello boycotted the State of Israel . He cancelled his show in Ceasarea to which he sold all the tickets . He explained the act by saying that the visit itself to Israel is a political act much more powerful than anything he could sing or say to his fans or to the Israeli media . As for the first prerequisite for a boycott , here it 's easy -- Israel , despite its megalomania , is still a tiny and hated country . I have no doubt Costello will happily perform in Turkey and Russia . We 're much easier to boycott . But the interesting question is about the second prerequisite -- what makes Costello feel so deeply threatened that he would boycott ? The answer can be found closer to home than what Costello would like to admit . If Mr. Costello , like all the moderate European left , would dare to look into this mirror , he would find out that he is n't actually a member of any kind of \" left \" whatsoever , but part of the elite of the world oppressors . In this situation he would n't be able to cross the threshold of his own home and even perform at the pub just around the corner . \" Another minister , another charge . Just a few days have passed since the police recommended indicting Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman for \" alleged breach of trust in a case involving Israel 's former ambassador to Belarus , Zeev Ben Aryeh . Police believe that in 2008 , while Ben Aryeh served as ambassador , he relayed to Lieberman secret details about an ongoing investigation against him , which the envoy had received as part of his official function . \" Today I could n't find a word about it . Ah , who cares . Just a case of the \" Been there , done that \" , right ? Hurray for Decent Debate ! Got a great comment on my \" About \" page a few days ago , after I published my op - ed in the Jerusalem Post . Nothing quite like starting your day with a nice , juicy death threat , I 'm tellin ' ya . Enemies intra portas . For me any of the 3 options could do , since disguised anti - Israeli extremists deserve no better , alas . The sooner the better Ami . Do n't be too shy to execute the 3rd method . It just suits you nicely . Traitors are shot dead like rats in every society you know . Gábor Fränkl Budapest , Hungary for the time being ... \" . Hurray for Decent Debate II ! Noam Sheizaf has a piece up today about an interesting back and forth on Facebook between an Arab MK and members of a Facebook group who want to burn him . Yes , burn him . And they put a pic of him with red eyes and red horns . 2 Responses to \" So Elvis , Avigdor , Gabor and Taleb go to this bar , see ? \" I do n't think the definition of that person is correct . It 's just an act of refusing interaction / consumption with the hope that it changes something . I boycott \" Nestle \" , even though I 'm far from more powerful . And yes , bullies at school get boycotted . I do n't buy the \" boycott everything or nothing \" ideology , people have their own choices of what hurts them most . Having said that , I 'm deeply against any academic or cultural boycott , firstly because it harms the most critical parts of the society . I think the problem I have with Yali and your examples are comparing boycotts on a personal level to those on a national one . States and individuals act so differently , I do n't know if a comparison is even possible ... What happened to L.A. 's boycott of Arizona ? A year after the City Council approved the sanction , little has changed . There 's not even an ordinance specifying how the boycott should work . Activists gather outside the federal building in downtown L.A. last spring , ... ( Jay L. Clendenin , Los Angeles ... ) . In May 2010 , Los Angeles was a part of wave of cities that voted to boycott Arizona after lawmakers in that state passed a controversial law targeting illegal immigrants . City Hall staffers were ordered to review contracts with Arizona companies for possible termination , and official travel to Arizona was supposed to be suspended . But a year later , little has changed in the way Los Angeles does business with the state next door . The city still buys street sweeper parts from one Arizona firm and has a contract for emergency sewer repairs with another , officials say . The Harbor Department alone has four contracts with Arizona companies that total nearly $ 26 million . A similar pattern can be seen across California . Boycotts in Oakland , San Francisco and Los Angeles County made headlines last year but have since delivered little punch . None of those jurisdictions has canceled a contract with an Arizona - based company because of the boycott - leading some immigrant - rights activists to dismiss the high - profile calls for economic sanctions as empty symbolism . The disappointment is especially felt in Los Angeles , where Latino elected leaders strongly backed the sanctions . \" This is a moment of hypocrisy if the city of Los Angeles says one thing and does another , \" said Rabbi Jonathan Klein , executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice . Klein was speaking to a crowd of protesters gathered at City Hall to demand follow - through on the business ban . Protesters have complained about several exemptions the City Council has granted in the last year , including approvals of contracts for made - in - Arizona Taser guns and red - light traffic cameras , as well as a contract with a Los Angeles International Airport shuttle provider that has offices in the state . Councilman Ed Reyes , who wrote the boycott , voted to approve those exceptions . He said the deals were in the best interest of the city . Reyes said he , too , was disappointed with the boycott 's slow progress , but he blamed City Atty . Carmen Trutanich 's office for taking more than a year to draw up an ordinance specifying the terms of the ban . A spokesman for Trutanich said an ordinance is still in the works . Despite the lack of clear guidelines , Reyes said there had been at least one boycott victory : Last year the Los Angeles Police Department opted not to send a team of helicopter pilots to a training conference in Phoenix . Reyes also pointed to a March letter sent to the president of the Arizona state Senate by several dozen leaders of companies with headquarters or major subsidiaries in Arizona . The letter urged rejection of five proposed anti - illegal - immigration laws , saying that when controversial laws are passed , \" unintended consequences inevitably occur . \" Dozens of local governments across the country imposed boycotts on Arizona after the state passed SB 1070 , which required police to check the status of those they suspected of being in the country illegally . Critics said the law would promote discrimination ; state officials disagreed . In their letter , the Arizona business leaders wrote that the boycotts cost the state jobs and hurt its economy , and that further anti - immigration legislation could do more harm . None of the five laws passed . Lawrence Glickman , a boycott expert at the University of South Carolina , said boycott organizers should count that as a success . Most boycotts end more ambiguously than the Montgomery , Ala. , bus boycott of the 1950s , which ended segregation on buses , or the grape campaign of the 1960s , which won fieldworkers contracts with growers , he said . In the case of the Arizona boycotts , he said the target - an entire state - is less clear than a company or industry . \" As an entity , a state is pretty amorphous , \" Glickman said . Los Angeles city officials have struggled to define what it means for a company to be \" headquartered in Arizona , \" the language used in the council 's boycott motion . The issue came up recently when the Board of Public Works considered a $ 100-million contract for a wastewater treatment plant with Honeywell , a multinational corporation that has divisions and employees based in Arizona . The board approved the contract . The boycott movement lost some urgency last year when one of the law 's most controversial provisions was struck down in federal court . That ruling , which halted the requirement that police check the status of suspected illegal immigrants , was upheld in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals . Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said she plans to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court . Several California entities , including San Francisco and Los Angeles County , voted to suspend their boycotts until the court case is decided . More than 20 Los Angeles County contracts were approved while the boycott was active because they met certain exemptions , records show . In one report to the Board of Supervisors , the county 's chief executive said a contract with an Arizona company that makes undershirts for jail inmates was exempted because \" additional cost , time and resources are required to resolicit the services or supplies . \" Ellen Sandt , an L.A. County deputy chief executive , said the boycott was important even if it had produced few tangible results in the way the county spends its money . For the supervisors who passed it , \" it was important for them to take a stand , \" she said . The boycott has been more than symbolic for at least one city . Last year , Santa Monica officials chose not to award a $ 3-million contract to an Arizona - based firm to replace 20 mobile homes in a city - owned park , according to Kate Vernez in the city manager 's office . Israel 's chilling relations with the US . Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was reported making harshly critical remarks about Israeli democracy provoked by legislation against foreign - funded human rights NGOs . Photograph : Abdel Magid Al - Fergany / AP . Tuesday 6 December 2011 11.09 EST Last modified on Thursday 31 December 2015 17.22 EST . T he Israeli government has come under criticism from both the Obama administration and American Jewish communities over the past week - the latter focused on a bizarre advertisement campaign aimed at the US diaspora . The current Israeli government 's insensitivity toward American Jews has gotten their attention , but whether forthcoming Knesset bills that are an affront to democratic values will cause similar alarm is yet to be seen . In one of the ads , a family split between the US and Israel shares a holiday rendezvous via Skype ; when the Israeli grandparents ask their American granddaughter what holiday it is , she says that it 's Christmas . \" They will remain Israelis ; their children wo n't , \" the ad 's narrator advises . The campaign has since been withdrawn , but it is just one example of bad taste . More troubling is a forthcoming Knesset bill which would give the Israeli government new powers to regulate - or , more accurately , police - Israeli NGOs that receive foreign funding . The draft law would \" revoke the right to income tax exemption \" on such non - profits , and place a 45 % tax rate on contributions from \" a foreign state entity \" , to Israeli organisations , among other parameters scarcely seen in liberal democracies . Secretary of State Clinton was said to have criticised this piece of legislation as a threat to Israel 's democratic institutions at last weekend 's closed forum . She also drew attention to restrictions on women singing in public , according to Israeli news outlets . As for gender segregation on Jerusalem buses , Clinton called it \" reminiscent of Rosa Parks \" . One Israeli headline described US Defense Secretary Panetta 's remarks at the same forum as \" a slap on the face \" to Netanyahu . Panetta warned against Israel 's military option with regards to the Iranian nuclear program and advised Tel Aviv to \" mend fences \" with Egypt and Turkey . Panetta said that taking risks for peace with the Palestinians is \" Israel 's long - term security interest \" , despite the fact that talks between the two parties remain mired . It is little surprise , perhaps , that a senior US official would be so forthcoming on security issues with Israel and the need to \" get to the damn table \" , as Panetta put it . \" The [ Obama ] administration has been making an ongoing strategic argument that Israel faces real , serious challenges , \" said Jeremy Ben - Ami , director of J Street , a group which has advocated that Washington take a bolder role in Middle East diplomacy . Panetta 's remarks do not indicate any sort of break ; rather , they mesh with what former national security adviser Jim Jones and former Centcom commander General David Petraeus have said . That Clinton rebuked Israel 's sequence of \" anti - democratic \" legislation , though , signals that Washington is taking note of the shrinking space for dissent in Israel . The past year has witnessed a variety of oppressive Knesset legislation , including laws targeting Israel 's Palestinian - Arab minority and banning organised boycotts against the state . Last week , an egregious Defamation Prohibition Law was passed , which \" raise[s ] the amount of punitive compensation for libel , without proof of actual damage \" , according to the Association for Civil Rights ( ACRI ) in Israel . If the NGO bill goes forward in Israel 's parliament , watchdog groups like ACRI would be taxed at a punitive rate . In fact , a wide range of NGOs , today fully compliant with Israeli law , would suddenly come under an Orwellian regime . \" By focusing on individual flare - ups like the fuss over a minor ad campaign , the Israeli government is missing the bigger picture strategically , \" Ben - Ami told me . \" American Jewish support for and connection to Israel will continue to erode over time if Israel is n't fully committed to the core values that bind the Jewish people together . \" STOKING FIRE : Anti - Choice Boycotts Continue , but Will Businesses Continue to Give In ? A little more than a year ago , the evangelical Christian group , Repent America , kicked off a campaign against Stericycle , a national medical waste disposal company . The goal ? To cripple abortion clinics by making it impossible for them to dispose of fetal remains , sharps , and other surgical throwaways . The organization calls Stericycle \" a modern - day Auschwitz \" and equates the company with German businesses that supported Hitler 's genocidal policies . \" Government entities , police forces , military troops , and even civilians from a number of countries aided the Nazis in the destruction of the Jewish people , \" their website begins . \" Some supplied construction materials and funds to the Nazi military . Some provided lists of names of Jewish people in their countries . Some helped to gather and deport Jews onto freight trains . \" Moving into the present , the site rails that \" today in America a diabolical silence and the mass annihilation of unwanted persons remains in our midst ... It is because of companies like Stericycle that abortionists are able to operate . \" This rhetorical flourish - and the concomitant ratcheting up references to the \" abortion holocaust\"-have played well for anti - choicers since no company wants to be publically likened to Nazi collaborators . Michael Marcavage , head of Repent America , obviously understood this when he launched the boycott . Not only that , since Stericycle rented trucks from Penske and Ryder , the campaign also zeroed in on them . Both quickly folded and in 2011 stopped allowing their trucks to service abortion facilities . The campaign is currently focused on AimNationaLease for the same reason . According to Repent America , Aim \" allows Stericycle to use its trucks to collect the remains of aborted babies and the items used in killing them . \" Boycotts , of course , are a tried - and - true progressive tactic and have successfully protested everything from unfair labor practices to homophobia . But what 's good for the goose has proved good for the gander and the Right - always eager to appropriate winning strategies -has gravitated to the boycott full throttle . This is n't wholly new . Indeed , on a local level anti - abortion activists have threatened landlords , rental agents , construction crews , and delivery services since shortly after the Roe decision . At the same time , it was n't until 2003-when Chris Danze , an Austin , Texas , concrete foundation contractor , organized Texas Contractors and Suppliers for Life - that the full muscle of anti - choice boycotting was exerted . At that time Planned Parenthood was in the throes of building a new $ 6.2 million clinic in Austin and had hired the Browning Construction Company as general contractor . Danze told The National Catholic Register that he and his group opposed the \" sexual mayhem and killing of unborn children \" that they believe Planned Parenthood represents . A well - publicized boycott of contractors affiliated with the health center paid off ; shortly after the groundbreaking , Browning pulled out of the project . \" The boycott did not stop Planned Parenthood in Austin from being erected but it delayed it , \" says Vicki Saporta , President and CEO of the National Abortion Federation . \" It made it more difficult and expensive for the clinic to be built . \" What 's more , anti - abortion boycotts have expanded into other arenas , targeting any - and - all businesses that interact with providers . \" The owner said that due to negative publicity Welsco could n't continue to work with us , \" she reports . \" He would not elaborate but said that I should go to the Internet and Google it . I did and found a photo of a Welsco truck at the clinic with commentary calling Welsco a business supporting abortion . Thom Huey , one of our regular protesters , had waged a one - man campaign to stop them from delivering to us . Apparently , he got a very quick reaction . \" Williams says that she was flabbergasted by Welsco 's capitulation and strenuously objected to the company 's demand that she immediately return the gas tanks . \" I said , ' No , you 're not going to do this . I paid for the gas and I 'll return the canisters when they 're empty or I have another supplier , ' \" she continues . An altercation with police , a lawsuit , and numerous attempts to secure a new supplier followed . \" There were five companies that flat - out said they would not be involved with abortion , but we eventually found a company and now have a one year contract with them , \" she adds . Amy Hagstrom Miller , Founder , President , and CEO of the Whole Woman 's Health Center chain , has also felt the sting of anti - abortion pressure . After she discovered that Stericycle had improperly disposed of fetal remains , she fired the firm and began searching for a replacement . Waste Management Inc. , a huge national company , was hired . \" They signed a contract with me to pick up at my five Texas clinics , but only took one shipment from Austin before they said they could n't continue . \" Although Hagstrom Miller has been working with a local vendor ever since , she describes what happened to Whole Woman as extremely troubling . What 's more , she acknowledges that when businesses submit to antiabortion browbeating , it forces clinicians to scramble to find new suppliers , diverts attention from the provision of care , and exacerbates tensions and anxieties . I 've never met Michael Muscavage or Chris Danze but I imagine these realities please both of them . In the end they know - as we do - that boycotts and the threat of bad publicity often work . \" Boycotts and harassment tactics have an impact , even if it 's not the impact the antis would like , \" NAF 's Vicki Saporta concludes . \" These actions do n't close clinics or stop new ones from being built , but they can still be very disruptive . This undoubtedly explains why they 're increasingly being used . \" Indeed , Life Decisions International has compiled The Boycott List , a roster of companies that they say aid - and - abet Planned Parenthood . Israeli institutions facing new boycotts - by Israelis . JERUSALEM ( JTA ) - By now it would seem that Israelis are accustomed to calls for boycotts of Israeli products and institutions . Many , however , may have been caught off guard this summer when those calls came from inside Israel . In two separate incidents over the past few weeks , Israelis issued a call for boycott or announced a boycott of an Israeli institution for political reasons . One protest came from the right , directed at an Israeli university with allegedly \" anti - Zionist \" professors on staff ; one came from the left , directed at an Israeli theater in the West Bank . The boycotts from within may mark a new front in Israel 's political battles . For the time being , mainstream Israeli figures are condemning both boycotts . \" Culture is a bridge in society , and political disputes should be left outside cultural life and art , \" Israel 's minister of culture and sport , Limor Livnat , said in response to the theater boycott . The latest boycott call came after several Israeli theater companies announced plans to stage productions at a new theater in Ariel , a Jewish city of 20,000 in the West Bank . The $ 10 million cultural center in Ariel , which was built partly with government funding , is scheduled to open Nov. 8 . It will be the first major theater in a Jewish settlement , most of which are smaller bedroom communities . As the theater schedule came to light , nearly 60 Israeli theater professionals signed a petition last weekend saying they would refuse to perform at the new venue or in any West Bank settlement . On Tuesday , about 150 academics and authors signed a letter supporting the petition . \" We will not take part in any kind of cultural activity beyond the Green Line , take part in discussions and seminars , or lecture in any kind of academic setting in these settlements , \" the letter said . \" My contract with the theater says explicitly that I am obligated to perform within the State of Israel - and Ariel is not part of the state , \" director and actor Oded Kotler , a boycott petition signer , told Army Radio . The Ariel boycott call follows on the heels of a call to boycott Ben - Gurion University issued by the campus group I m Tirtzu , which says that professors in the university 's department of politics and government harbor anti - Zionist biases and are silencing students ' Zionist viewpoints . Neve Gordon , the head of the university 's department of politics and government , has called for a \" social , economic and political boycott of Israel . \" University President Rivka Carmi condemned Gordon 's call but has not dismissed the department chief . \" The fact that I condemn his statements does n't mean I can fire him , \" she told the Jerusalem Post . \" You can not fire someone for their political opinions . \" University spokesman Amir Rozenblit said that the university complies with the quality and content requirements of the Israeli Council for Higher Education , and that it hires faculty members based solely on their professional and academic qualifications , not political opinions . I m Tirtzu 's threat to approach Ben - Gurion University donors for failing to dismiss its \" anti - Zionist \" staff prompted some I m Tirtzu supporters in the United States to rethink their support for the organization . Meanwhile , Ben - Gurion University condemned the boycott call by I m Tirtzu . \" Just as university president Prof. Rivka Carmi harshly condemned those who called for an international boycott of Israel , so too the university denounces any group that calls for a boycott of any Israeli university based on the opinions of its academic faculty members , \" Rozenblit said . This week , the Israeli media were buzzing with opinion - makers debating the Ariel affair . In Haaretz , columnist Akiva Eldar suggested that artists who oppose Israel 's presence in the West Bank use the opportunity to stage performances for settlers that would prompt them to think twice about the occupation . Another of the daily 's columnists , Gideon Levy , countered that Israeli theaters would be boycotted internationally if they forced actors to perform in the West Bank . Many voiced outrage that government funding goes to the theaters whose members are now calling for the boycott . \" The theaters that suck up the state 's money owe their dose of culture to the taxpayers , \" Eitan Haber wrote in Ynet . \" So , first get on stage and perform , and only later you can head to anti - settlement protests if you wish , even in Ariel . \" On Sunday , the Israeli prime minister weighed in . \" The last thing we need at this time is to be under such an attack - I mean this attempt at a boycott from within , \" Benjamin Netanyahu said . \" I do not want to deny the right of any person , of any artist , to hold to a political opinion . He or she can express this opinion . But we , as a government , do not need to fund boycotts . We do not have to support boycotts directed at Israeli citizens in any manner whatsoever . \" Netanyahu , Livnat and other government ministers have threatened to sanction theaters that refuse to perform in West Bank venues . The Habima , Khan , Beersheba and Cameri theaters are all scheduled to stage productions in Ariel . The theaters each received about $ 2.5 million to $ 3 million from the ministry of culture and sport , according to an official in Livnat 's office . The ministry was not involved in funding the theater in Ariel , which is located about 10 miles inside the West Bank and is the fifth - largest Jewish settlement in the territory . The theaters issued a collective statement saying that the scheduled Ariel productions will go on , but that they would \" respect the political opinions of their actors . \" The theaters are consulting with their legal advisers on how to proceed with artists who refuse to perform in the West Bank , a culture ministry official told JTA . It was 15 months ago that I received a frantic call from my brother , Ted , who was living in Paris , telling me that his newly adopted dog , a Lurcher ( Greyhound / Scottish Deerhound mix ) , had disappeared . Ted had gone to a market on a quiet street , and tied Ben to a magazine rack . Something frightened Ben , and he bolted , breaking his leash . He was last seen running along the Seine . I tried to give advice and reassurance , but day after day went by without a trace . After five days , I decided to make the journey and see if I could help . So , seven days after Ben disappeared , I arrived in Paris and began a lengthy and tiring search with my bro . By this time , he had put up more than 1,000 posters around the city , contacted 22 police precincts and dozens of vets , and been receiving advice and support from numerous online rescue groups . Fortunately , the day before my arrival , a sighting had been made .... we did n't know if it was real but , at least , we had something to work with . My brother spent nights on the street ; I got up and rode a bicycle around at 3 in the morning ( a most surreal experience in Paris ) . We canvassed homeless people , African trinket vendors , Romanian gypsies and anyone who would stop and speak with us . Amazingly , we had a huge contingency of very supportive \" lookers . \" But additional sightings proved to be fruitless , and we despaired that Ben might have been hit by a car . It was hard to believe he had n't been , as the traffic in Paris is truly crazy . Or he might have been sick or kidnapped . ( Rumors abounded that gypsies were selling dogs throughout the city . ) We rode bikes through the Bois de Boulogne ( a huge forest / park close to the city ) , and enlisted the aid of the former head of the Paris dog pound - to no avail . After six stressful days , it was time to return to the U.S. I hated having to give up , and encouraged my brother , not to , as there were stories of dogs finding their owners after many weeks and even months . But as I packed , the evening before departure , I thought the worst . And then , the phone rang . A police station , five miles away , called to say they had Ben ! ( They were sure it was Ben . We were n't ! ) We jumped into a taxi , and sure enough , we arrived to find Ben with a group of ten policemen and women who lined up to witness the reunion ; a truly elating and emotional experience in a big city that proved to be totally supportive . Ben was tired , but after 13-and - a - half days , amazingly fit . Turns out he had been \" hanging out \" in an embassy garden for two days before someone called the fire department , which delivered him to the police . ( See Ben after his rescue , below . ) And I flew home a happy camper ! Postscript : As the days passed after the reunion , Ted and Ben had a number of interesting encounters . Two ladies stopped them to say they had been on a bus one day and had seen Ben running alongside . They got off in an attempt to catch him , but he was gone . Others stopped , after recognizing Ben , to ask if he really was my brother 's dog . And two others stopped them , and produced the flyers that my brother had posted , which they had taken down to use to identify Ben . In the past year the two of them have continued to travel . They 've been to the States , Italy , England , Belgium , Germany , and are now back in Paris . Each day , they go to the Tuileries , where Ben plays , happily , with a Saluki and a Galgo ( Spanish Greyhound ) . And what a beautiful sight it is ! Toby Wolter is a realtor with Douglas Elliman in Florida . His special interests are animal rescue groups and the First Tee , a golf - mentoring program . \" Looking for Ben \" is a condensed version of the story , which appeared on his blog . The \" Not - Buying Power \" of the Black Community : Urban Boycotts and Equal Employment Opportunity , 1960 - 1964 . Protesters representing the NAACP shouted , \" Do n't stop , do n't shop , till the flag drops \" in 2002 , as they publicized a multiyear tourism boycott against South Carolina . These protesters demanded a modification of the state 's flag , which bears the Confederate emblem . It is an ongoing protest , one of several economic boycotts launched recently by the NAACP . Other national boycotts , including a five - month action against the Adam 's Mark Hotel chain , have been concluded , and a boycott against major television networks , which cast few African Americans in principal roles , was threatened but not initiated . Although they expressed concern for the African American - owned businesses in South Carolina , many newspaper editorials and columnists agreed that such boycotts were justified , necessary , and potentially very effective . ( 1 ) It is significant to recall that boycotts as a civil rights strategy did not always meet with such widespread approbation . The NAACP itself looked askance at some of the boycotts launched in the 1950s and 1960s that sought to expand employment opportunities for African Americans . The public support for economic demands was a gamble for an organization that preferred a legal or political approach to civil rights . But urban and economic realities , combined with a new assertiveness among activists , gave prominence to this strategy , particularly in matters involving employment opportunities . Boycotts have been one weapon long used by protesters seeking economic rights , and this strategy has been integral to 20th century civil rights protests in the urban North . Chicago , Detroit , and New York City all experienced consumer boycotts that aimed to win employment for African Americans , both before and after World War II . ( 2 ) These boycotts -- far from receiving media approval -- divided African American leaders and sparked competition among civil rights groups . Civil rights history has addressed rivalry in the movement , but it has been limited largely to the southern struggles or to individual personalities and leaders . Rivalry , furthermore , has been viewed as a sign of disintegration , not as a creative force . However , this emphasis does not fully consider the ways in which competition among activists and organizations transformed the strategies and shifted the goals of the movement itself . Boycotts in the 1960s reveal conflict among civil rights proponents because their actions began to command real potential in procuring jobs . The federal government and self - proclaimed progressive business leaders had demonstrated a rhetorical eagerness , if not a real commitment , to equal employment opportunity that civil rights leaders hoped would lead to more substantive racial integration in the workplace . Urban protesters began to use what some considered to be militant tactics : results - oriented strategies that called for affirmative action and racial proportionalism . The effect of this division caused activists to struggle with one another and against employers over the nature of quotas and goals , preferential treatment , and compensatory action . Indeed , remedies for employment discrimination can be seen , in part , as a product of this competition . In the early 1960s , activists were just beginning to develop a language of \" affirmative action . \" That phrase , first used in an Executive Order by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 , found currency among civil rights groups then engaged in street protests and negotiations with employers . ( 5 ) While the Kennedy administration declined to provide a specific definition of affirmative action in theory or practice , militant ministers and activists from the Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) did . Affirmative action was needed as compensation for past discrimination ; employers who refused to hire minority workers should give preference to nonwhite job seekers to remedy past discriminatory practices . Such a rationale gave their actions a radical cast that offended some liberal civil rights supporters . The rest of this article is only available to active members of Questia .

George Zimmerman Travesty : Why Florida Boycott Could Change Things There And Elsewhere . December 12 Movement 's Omowale Clay . Photo credit : The Black Star News . [ Black Star News Editorial ] . Boycotts are legitimate forms of fighting injustice , especially laws that discriminate against people based on their ethnic- , religious- , gender- , national background or sexual - orientation . Boycotts were very effective in breaking down oppression and segregation in the American South and in apartheid South Africa . Florida 's Stand - Your - Ground law is a form of discriminatory law . Studies show that more Whites who kill Black people and claim self - defense based on Stand - Your - Ground use the law successfully than any other ethnic group . In the case of the George Zimmerman travesty of justice acquittal following his second degree murder trial for the killing of Trayvon Martin Stand - Your - Ground was n't explicitly used by his defense . It was considered by the jurors and it certainly informed the jurors ' mindset . One juror , referred to as B29 said she felt her hands were tied but that George Zimmerman \" got away with murder . \" Millions of Americans feel the same way judging by the protests that followed his acquittal on July 13 . People who are outraged by the verdict can become more pro - active instead of feeling helpless . They could support the boycott campaign directed at Florida until the State deals with the Stand - Your - Ground law . Zimmerman had followed 17-year old Trayvon Martin because he saw a Black teenager and suspected he was a burglar . He complained to police that the \" fucking punks \" always got away ; one look at the Black teen and he lumped in with all the previous burglary suspects . Zimmerman was told not to follow Trayvon by the police dispatcher but the 28-year old Zimmerman followed anyway . He later shot the boy dead in the heart . He knew that Stand - Your - Ground would cover his murderous conduct . Hundreds of demonstrations were held across the country to protest the Zimmerman verdict . But protests come and go . Right here in New York when unarmed Black men have been killed by officers of the New York Police Department ( NYPD ) there are protests and people say \" never again . \" After each incident there is outrage and emotional protest marches all over the City . People declare \" never again . \" But it does always happen again . What can change all this ? How can people in the African American community make it abundantly clear that the lives of Black males have value even as many battle against the odds ? Enter Stevie Wonder and his vow to boycott Florida until the Stand - Your - Ground law is scrapped . He was roundly condemned by Right Wing talking heads . Right here in New York mayor Bloomberg 's and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly'sdiscriminatory Stop - and - Frisk has led to racial profiling of hundreds of thousands of African Americans . Clearly Diallo and Bell were both racially profiled before they were approached . Legislators and politicians will pay more attention when people in the African American community respond to outrageous unlawful killings by taking action with their wallets and their purses and directing their dollars elsewhere or even refraining from spending it . In Florida Harry Belafonte , a veteran of many marches , protests , and boycotts , including from the Civil Rights Movement and the anti - apartheid campaign in South Africa has now joined those promoting a boycott of Florida until something is done about Stand - Your - Ground . Other artists such as Chaka Khan , who says she cancelled a Florida concert , are backing the call . It would also be good to see young celebrities such as Jay - Z , patch up any misunderstanding with Belafonte that 's been the subject of recent media coverage and take a position on a critical issues that affects the lives of young Black males . Right here in New York City , the December 12 Movement has been leading Sunday rallies at 6PM in front of the State Office Building on 125th Street in Harlem where participants discuss and strategize on how they can support the boycott of Florida . Omowale Clay led one such gathering yesterday afternoon where more than 60 people showed up in the rain . Scores of participants took the microphone to express their outrage at the verdict and to offer suggestions on a path forward , including how to support the Florida boycott . All vowed to return with more people next week . The rally is to be held every Sunday at the same location . Here in New York , for example , organizers could target for boycotts , for example , businesses near the precincts where an officer or officers involved in the unlawful killing are based , could be one option . Of course boycotts are disruptive and they cause economic pain to many people ; but sometimes sacrifices are needed in order to counter and eliminate bigger evils , such as the systemic killings of unarmed Black men . Soldiers on foot and in armored carriers swarmed Tibet 's capital Saturday , enforcing a strict curfew a day after protesters burned shops and cars to vent their anger against Chinese rule . In another western city , police clashed with hundreds of Buddhist monks leading a sympathy demonstration . The violence erupted just two weeks before China 's Summer Olympic celebrations kick off with the start of the torch relay , which passes through Tibet . China is gambling that its crackdown will not draw an international outcry over human rights violations that could lead to boycotts of the Olympics . The latest unrest began Monday on the anniversary of a 1959 uprising against Chinese rule . Tibet was effectively independent for decades before communist troops entered in 1950 . Initially , the protests were led by Buddhist monks demanding the release of other detained monks . Their demands spiraled to include cries for Tibet 's independence and turned violent Friday when police tried to stop a group of protesting monks . Pent - up grievances against Chinese rule came to the fore , as Tibetans directed their anger against Chinese and their shops , hotels and other businesses . Of course , the Chinese are worried about potential boycotts of the Beijing Summer Olympics , and want to crush the protests before they become widespread . They have kept Tibet under their totalitarian boot for more than half a century now , and have no intention of letting the captive nation go - or even giving the ethnic Tibetans any degree of autonomy . Welcome to the last great bastion of communism on Earth , and have a nice day ! \n",

      "As seen on The Five Police Group Boycotts Ben &amp; Jerry's After Black Lives Matter Endorsement As more women come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against Donald Trump, the Republican nominee is lashing out at the mainstream media, which he claims is running with this \"total fiction\" to distract from Hillary Clinton's scandals. At a rally in Greensboro, N.C., Trump said these accusations are part of a conspiracy involving the Clinton campaign and what he called “the corrupt media.” Greg Gutfeld agreed with much of Trump's assessment on \"The Five\" today, saying, \"The media wants Hillary to win. There's no doubt about that.\" Judge Jeanine on Trump Accusers: 'All on One Day? It's a Little Too Convenient' Gutfeld explained that Trump has actually been \"set up,\" as he was given countless hours of coverage and \"billions of dollars of free media,\" only to have the rug pulled out from under him. \"The media ... [and] Hillary and Obama, they knew elevating Donald Trump - giving him an air of respectability in the press, as well - turned him into the Republican nominee. Then, out came the knives.\" Watch the co-hosts of \"The Five\" discuss above, and let us know what you think in the comments.

      "Surprisingly a lot of people are standing with Colin Kaepernick in his decision not to stand during the national anthem, \"calling the Star Spangled Banner \"weak\" and saying that he doesn't truly love the song. Here is what he had to say on twitter: For those defending the current anthem, do you really truly love that song? I don't and I'm very good at singing it. Like, one of the best He continued to add: My vote is for America the Beautiful. Star spangled banner is a weak song anyway. And then you read this... https://t.co/iAE62FAbxj John Legend linked to an article titled, \"Colin Kaepernick Is Righter Than You Know: The National Anthem Is A Celebration Of Slavery\" The article makes the arguement that an unsung verse of the Francis Scott Key poem is a moral \"atrocity.\" The author claims the end of the rarely sung third verse \"literally celebrated the murder of African-Americans.\" The verse reads: No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave, And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave. @johnlegend not sure why it's turned into a battle over the lyrics of our anthem. The lyrics were never Colin's argument in the first place All of John Legend's tweets were made in support of the 49ers quarterback who refused to stand while the national anthem was being played during a preseason game. Kaepernick said that his sitd own was for \"people that are being oppressed\" and he'll end the protest when \"I feel like that flag represents what it's supposed to represent.\"\n",
