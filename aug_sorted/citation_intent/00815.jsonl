{"text": "A key function of spectrin is in organising the submembraneous cytoskeleton .This is particularly evident in erythrocytes , in which complexes of spectrin and ankyrin provide essential mechanical support for the membrane bilayer ( Discher , 2000 ) .In other cells , spectrin distribution is not uniform around the membrane , and it has an additional role of establishing specialised membrane subdomains .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.41049"}
