{"text": "Multiple Mechanisms Regulate Subcellular Localization of Human CDC6 .CDC6 is a protein essential for DNA replication , the expression and abundance of which are cell cycle - regulated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae .We have demonstrated previously that the subcellular localization of the human CDC6 homolog , HsCDC6 , is cell cycle - dependent : nuclear during G(1 ) phase and cytoplasmic during S phase .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.97564"}
{"text": "This cytoplasmic localization depends upon the C - terminal NES .Together these results demonstrate that HsCDC6 is phosphorylated at the G(1)/S phase of the cell cycle and that the phosphorylation status determines the subcellular localization .Much of the soluble Cdc6 protein , however , is translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm when CDKs are activated in late G1 phase , thus preventing it from further interaction with replication origins [ # C , # C and # TC].", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.033"}
