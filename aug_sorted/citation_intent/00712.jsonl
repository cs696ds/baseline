{"text": "Especially , the effect of noise corruption at high frequency regions of the spectrogram is quite prominent at different time instances .The main reason behind such effect is the continuous feedback of echo corrupted speech sample to the input microphone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.932304"}
{"text": "Thus the estimation of state boundary information is required .This boundary information may be in error due to the nature of unclear state boundaries and the lack of a reliable estimation approach .Therefore , in the discriminative training process , \" do n't cares \" were used to account for this lack of precision in determining state boundaries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.50281"}
