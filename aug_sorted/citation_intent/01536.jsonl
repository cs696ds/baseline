{"text": "Origin and Spread .Hemlock woolly adelgid is native to Japan and possibly China where it is considered a common inhabitant of both forest and ornamental hemlock and spruce trees .It rarely achieves pest outbreak densities or inflicts significant damage to host trees in its native Asian habitat because natural enemies and host plant resistance help keep HWA populations in check .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.55975"}
{"text": "Hemlock woolly adelgid , Adelges tsugae , Tsuga canadensis , vegetative propagation , pest resistance .Introduction .The hemlock woolly adelgid ( HWA ) , Adelges tsugae Annand , has become a serious pest of the native North American eastern hemlock species Tsuga canadensis ( L. ) Carriere and T. caroliniana Engelm .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.64743"}
{"text": "In New York , there are no suitable spruce , thus the winged HWA are not successful .Each generation has six stages of development : egg , four juvenile ( nymph ) stages , and the adult .Overwintering adult females are black , oval , and soft - bodied ( approximately 2 mm long ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.0337"}

{"text": "Detection .Detecting new HWA infestations at the leading edge of its range is critically important for slowing the spread of HWA .Unfortunately , HWA is difficult to detect at low population levels .The first signs of HWA are the presence of the white , woolly ovisacs on the underside of twigs , most often on the newest growth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.3967"}
{"text": "The other portion of spring adults has wings and leaves the hemlock trees in June in search of spruce trees to complete the sexual phase of HWA reproduction .However , in North America , no spruce species ( Picea spp . ) are suitable hosts and any offspring produced die within a few days of feeding .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.438995"}

{"text": "The hemlock woolly adelgid has a complex life cycle , involving two different tree host species as well as asexual and sexual life stages .On eastern hemlock , HWA produces two generations a year , an overwintering generation ( sistens ) and a spring generation ( progrediens ) ; these two generations overlap in the spring .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.12595"}
{"text": "Crawlers search for suitable sites to settle , usually at the base of the hemlock needles , where they begin to feed and will remain attached to the tree with their specialized sucking mouthparts for the rest of their lives .Crawlers , an important dispersal phase of HWA on hemlocks , can be spread by wind , on the feet of birds , or in the fur of small mammals ( McClure 1990 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.47073"}
{"text": "From March through May , these females lay 50 to 300 eggs in the woolly masses .The eggs are brownish - orange and very small ( 0.25 mm long by 0.15 mm wide ) .Depending on spring temperatures , eggs hatch from April - June .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.930466"}

{"text": "It has reached its southern limit , but continues to expand its range to the west and north .HWA was first detected in New York State in the early 1980s ( Souto et al .1995 ) .Outbreaks have expanded from initial infestations on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley to the Rochester area , the Catskill Mountains , and recently into the Finger Lakes region .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.2366"}
{"text": "Introduction .The hemlock woolly adelgid ( HWA , Adelges tsugae ) is an aphid - like , invasive insect that poses a serious threat to forest and ornamental hemlock trees ( Tsuga spp . ) in eastern North America .HWA are most easily recognized by the white \" woolly \" masses of wax , about half the size of a cotton swab , produced by females in late winter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.21545"}
{"text": "Some of the adults of the spring generation ( progrediens ) are wingless and remain on the hemlock tree , feeding and producing eggs protected by woolly masses just like the overwintering generation , but during June - July .Their offspring hatch into crawlers , quickly settle onto hemlock branches , begin to feed and then enter a dormant period for several months until late October when feeding and development resumes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.19652"}

{"text": "This is particularly important considering the number of winged adults produced in the spring generation increases with the density of overwintering adelgids , likely a result of changes in nutritional quality in the hemlock host tree .Impacts .The hemlock woolly adelgid feeds deep within plant tissues by inserting its long sucking mouthparts ( stylets ) into the underside of the base of hemlock tree needles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.05704"}
