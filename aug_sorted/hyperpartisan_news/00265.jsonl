{"text": "This makes SMS unsuitable for any kind of sensitive communications .For details and alternative tools , see Mobile Surveillance : a Primer .SMS profit margins can be very , very high - up to 80 - 90 % according to multinational network operator Huawei .This is great for mobile network operators , and they may give quite large discounts for bulk purchase of outgoing message credits as a result .At the same time , systems targeting poorer groups should understand the implications of asking the end - user to pay for an SMS into the system .In Africa at least , we know that monthly mobile expenditure as a percentage of income is significantly higher for these groups .In addition to person - to - person SMS , there are various value - added SMS services that might be useful for some kinds of SMS campaigns .Here 's how they work : .Premium - rated SMS allows you to receive SMSes for which the sender is charged at higher than usual rates .You 'll need to work with a service provider to set this up , and the profit from the service is usually shared between you , the service provider and the mobile network operator .Premium - rated SMS has been successfully used in fundraising campaigns , where it 's a quick and easy way to allow people to make relatively small donations .Google and MTN have also implemented premium - rated information services for smallholder farmers in Uganda , arguing that a premium - rate message allows revenue to be earned and contributes to the sustainability of the service .Whether this holds for your campaign depends on both the audience ( ability to pay ) and the type of information you are providing - for example , a health information service targeting poorer groups would be unlikely to choose premium - rated SMS .SMS - to - email and email - to - SMS are available at no additional cost on many mobile networks .In particular , email - to - SMS can be useful for sending small numbers of free SMSes , using operator 's SMS gateways .The downside of this is that you 'll need to know the operator your recipients are using .Most operators also restrict the number of free SMSes that can be sent each day .Machine - to - Machine SMS and telemetry describes systems that are able to communicate by automatically sending or receiving SMSs .Vehicle tracking is a common application of this technology .This automated SMS fishing system , developed by a Kenyan student , is an interesting Machine - to - Machine SMS example !Cell broadcast is a service that gives mobile operators the ability to send an SMS - like message to all subscribers in a particular location .The government of Bangladesh recently announced that it was implementing a cell broadcast system for use in disasters and emergencies .While it would clearly be useful in a disaster setting , cell broadcast requires the co - operation of all operators in an area , and occupies tricky ground with regard to opt - in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.42058"}

{"text": "RapidAndroid is even simpler than a desktop client .An application for devices ( smartphones , netbooks coming soon ) that run Google 's Android platform , RapidAndroid turns your phone into a self - contained SMS system with no additional hardware required .Setting up an SMS server .For a scalable , customized system and the opportunity to explore non - standard functionality , the effort of setting up your own SMS server is probably well worth the reward .This is also the best approach if you intend to undertake integration with other systems .For example , you could set up an SMS information service to query an existing database , or solicit comments from supporters using a dedicated SMS number .FishSMS , a consumer service that provides information about fisheries sustainablilty in response to an SMS containing the fish species name , is a good example , as are Indymedia 's live SMS tickers .Both these systems would need to use an SMS gateway to send and receive SMSes , which you could set up yourself using a GSM modem and a software component such as Kannel .Alternatively , it may be more cost - effective to buy credits from a commercial provider and use their gateway .Behind the SMS gateway , a customised back - end would receive incoming messages and prepare a response - a return SMS in the case of FishSMS , or a post to a web server displaying the ticker in the Indymedia example .There is also a data storage requirement in both cases , either as a source for message data or a as store for incoming SMSs .As you may have guessed , an SMS server is a skittish animal !If you are n't able to source these skills in - house , you could consider using a contractor or a commercial software company .Either way , remember that after the initial development , you 'll probably still need occasional help with operations .A great SMS server is useless if no - one remembers how it works !Resources .Kannel is an SMS gateway that runs on linux .It 's stable , well - documented and fun to use if you do n't mind getting your hands dirty with the configuration .Tip : save a lot of frustration by getting hold of a phone or GSM modem that is known to work with Kannel .Gammu is similar , targeting Nokia phones .Gammu is actually several different projects , in different languages and with different licenses , all aiming to be an SMS library for Nokia phones .RapidSMS was originally a UNICEF project making use of various free software components ( including Kannel ) to deliver a scalable , reliable SMS server .The RapidSMS case studies page has some good examples of how this tool is being used , including collecting data on child malnutrition in Malawi , managing a food relief supply chain in Ethiopia and collecting emergency response monitoring data in Somalia .PlaySMS and WebSMS are quite basic web applications that use Kannel as an SMS gateway , and provide standard address book , grouping a bulk messaging functions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.797485"}

{"text": "Smart texting is an advanced form of keyword response in which an incoming text message triggers a complex interaction .This may include calling external programmes to process the message , or requesting further information from the user .It can also be used to run an SMS information service , in which the incoming SMS contains a query ( ' WEATHER cape town ' , ' CROP PRICES cofimvaba ' ) and the response is retrieved from a database or the web .Example : A basic citizen reporting system could work as follows : Someone texts the word \" REPORT \" and a description of the incident to a widely publicised mobile number .This could be something like ' REPORT robbery in progress corner shop Cala road ' .The system could respond with \" Thanks for reporting !Do you have a photo to add ?Send an MMS to this number \" .If the next message from this person is an MMS then the message details and the picture can be saved together .The report could also be forwarded to a reporter in the field , who might want to follow up the incident .Other kinds of SMS campaigns .There are many other ways to use SMS in social change work .Mobile data collection using fixed - format SMS is a kind of smart texting , with the incoming text triggering a response to extract and store the data contained in the message .Premium - rated SMS , which some providers will offer commission - free to non - profits , can be used to raise funds , enabling many small contributions to be effectively aggregated .Also remember that some of the most effective SMS campaigns have been peer - to - peer - people forwarding on a single message , with no involvement from a central campaign management system .In a peer - to - peer campaign , content is key .SMS jokes can work really well as peer - to - peer messages , as can calls to protest or other content that creates a sense of urgency about a cause or event .SMS basics .Did you know that SMS was a happy mobile technology accident ?Originally conceived as a way for operators to notify subscribers of network problems , messages are sent via a control channel that would otherwise be unused most of the time .Even though SMS is now a important and very profitable service in its own right , this legacy has some important consequences for its use as a communication channel .Consider the following : .To make sure that important control channel messages are not disrupted , SMSs may made to wait until usage is low .SMS is a best - effort service .This means that , although the system will attempt to deliver your message , there is no guarantee , and messages sometimes do get lost .Messages passing between operators , particularly internationally , are most prone to disappearing .Delivery reports , which can tell you whether the message has been received at the recipient 's handset , are sometimes available .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.47006"}
