Obama might actually become the next president of the United States .Wow , this country and its people really have come a long way and I thank God !Mrs. Obama said it 's time to stop doubting and time to start dreaming .She believes , like many Americans , including myself , that it 's time for Change - which has been and continues to be Sen. Obama 's campaign slogan .It makes sense .I applaud his efforts and highly respect Sen. Obama .For I believe he sincerely cares and loves this country and can lead us into the future .Now that he has chosen longtime Sen.
