{"text": "Let us know in the comments .An open letter to Washington from Artists and Creators .We , the undersigned , are musicians , actors , directors , authors , and producers .We make our livelihoods with the artistic works we create .We are also Internet users .We are writing to express our serious concerns regarding the PROTECT IP Act ( PIPA ) and the Stop Online Piracy Act ( SOPA ) .As creative professionals , we experience copyright infringement on a very personal level .Commercial piracy is deeply unfair and pervasive leaks of unreleased films and music regularly interfere with the integrity of our creations .We are grateful for the measures policymakers have enacted to protect our works .We , along with the rest of society , have benefited immensely from a free and open Internet .It allows us to connect with our fans and reach new audiences .Using social media services like Facebook , Twitter and YouTube , we can communicate directly with millions of fans and interact with them in ways that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago .We fear that the broad new enforcement powers provided under SOPA and PIPA could be easily abused against legitimate services like those upon which we depend .These bills would allow entire websites to be blocked without due process , causing collateral damage to the legitimate users of the same services - artists and creators like us who would be censored as a result .We are deeply concerned that PIPA and SOPA 's impact on piracy will be negligible compared to the potential damage that would be caused to legitimate Internet services .Online piracy is harmful and it needs to be addressed , but not at the expense of censoring creativity , stifling innovation or preventing the creation of new , lawful digital distribution methods .We urge Congress to exercise extreme caution and ensure that the free and open Internet , upon which so many artists rely to promote and distribute their work , does not become collateral damage in the process .SOPA And PIPA : A Timeline Of How We Got Here .May 12 : PIPA introduced .The PROTECT IP Act ( Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act of 2011 ) , better known as PIPA was introduced into the Senate by Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) .The act 's goals were described by its sponsors as protecting intellectual property and punishing foreign sites who post copyrighted material .If a site was discovered doing so , the U.S. attorney general could order U.S. based Internet service providers , search engines , payment systems and advertising networks to suspend doing business with the website . Nov. 15 : Tech Giants Weigh In .Twelve tech giants , including Google , Facebook and LinkedIn , delivered a letter of protest to the sponsors of the SOPA and PIPA legislation , calling the bill dangerous to American innovation and cybersecurity , but also acknowledged that digital piracy is a real problem .
