{"text": "Just as they shaped their own path then , we have shaped our own paths since , and must continue to do so now , guided by the Bible and the Holy Spirit .My major point , though , is that the flag and national anthem are symbols .With a few exceptions , symbols are , by their very nature , of mutable definition .It is the definition that one projects on the symbol that makes it either compatible with or contrary to a given institution 's mission .If , for example , Goshen is now embracing American militarism and imperialism , a meaning that some on the left and the right have ascribed to the national anthem , then this would be quite problematic to me .Given Brenneman 's statements on the matter , along with Goshen 's constituency and is heritage , this explanation is highly improbable .If one only sees American militarism and imperialism in the anthem , yet is playing it as a gesture of hospitality , then this , too , is problematic .This is slightly more likely from Brenneman 's remarks .It indicates a compromise of one 's own values to accommodate the comfort of others .While one ought to seek the comfort of others , compromising one 's own values to do so is wrong .So if one can see only militarism and imperialism in the national anthem , it makes sense to protest Goshen 's decision .However , Goshen could also be reframing the discussion .This is what I would suspect would be the most likely case , given Brenneman 's remarks .If Goshen is playing the anthem as a symbol of national solidarity and citizenship , then this would not be objectionable .As such , it would serve as a reminder , particularly to those outside the Goshen community , that ideals of peace and social justice - ideals driven by our faith in Christ - have a valid place among American ideals .If Goshen is truly reframing the discussion in such a way , then it would extend hospitality , but it would be claiming the symbol in such a way that would make it subject to the values of Goshen College , rather than in opposition to them . 1 ) You ca n't both discredit and then re - invoke the early Anabaptists to make your own points .For example : Post 31 \" Sorry to go off on the early Anabaptists , but their idealized , simplistic , mythologized form is invoked far too often in discussions \" and then the paragraph in post 29 \" Not all early Anabaptists were pacifist ..... \" .2 ) Symbols matter .The Flag is a symbol .Communion is also a symbol .Yes , symbols only carry the meaning that we choose to ascribe to them .And I am all for the whole re - defining - the - meaning - of - the - flag - and - anthem thing , but the dominant interpretation of the meaning of the U.S. Flag and anthem is one of exclusive loyalty , militarism , and imperialism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.77304"}

Jay Nixon .The protest demonstrations last night , which were the largest so far in Ferguson , went off completely peacefully .After four nights of heavy - handed military style policing , a relaxed atmosphere replaced the war zone atmosphere of the previous nights .Missouri Highway patrol Captain Ronald Johnson walked through the crowds , at one point apologizing for the behavior of police who had attacked and tear - gassed people the night before .He said the Highway Patrol police would continue a more respectful tone with protesters .On Friday a six - year veteran of the Ferguson police force , Darren Wilson , was identified as the policeman who killed the unarmed Black teenager , touching off the protests and the heavy - handed military style police response .The release today of the name of the policeman who did the shooting meets one of the major demands demonstrators were making last night , as they had for several days before .The police also said , when they made that announcement , that Brown was a suspect in a convenience store robbery .They allege that he took a box of candy swisher cigars .Police said that the officer who filled out an incident report when he saw Brown 's body in the street , four hours after he was shot , had compared what he saw there with video surveillance tape from the convenience store .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.68047"}

That means that there are 7.046 billion humans who are all extremely dependent and influenced by each other .Out of that 7.046 billion , 3.5 billion people , nearly half the world 's population , watch the Olympics .With that being said , it would be practically impossible for such largely debated issues , like homosexuality , not to snake their way into such a large event .There have been many times in the past in which certain countries came under the hands of some terrible power , such as Germany in the 1930 's , and most countries left them to their own accord , until it was too late .Had the world tried to speak out against it from the start , the holocaust might not have occurred .It would be good if different countries stopped other countries from bringing the unnecessary prejudice and destruction of people .Therefore I say that it should be perfectly allowed to have peaceful protests in the Olympics , both political and athletic .However , if at any time the protests turn violent , then there should be an intervention , in order to keep peace between countries .Jalen Lewis .I think the Olympics should not be a Stage for Political Dissent .This distracts both the athletes and the spectators away from the sports being playing .This also can cause for other events to be overlooked because a person speaks out in their certain event .Sports are sports and they should stay that way .Daniel K Period_2 Shuttle .I completely agree with you .It says that many people have been talking about the political problems .Doing this will make the contestants and the judges to stray away from the actual thing which is the competition .If this were to go on , what wold be left of the olympics ?Alice_B_4boydbence .Why are sports more important than human rights ?Political dissent during the Olympics is a perfect way to raise awareness of issues people might otherwise be oblivious to .Take , for example , the 1968 Olympics where Tommie Smith and John Carlos won their respective events .When the went to receive their medals , they raised their fists in the black power salute , effectively raising awareness to inequality and showing their refusal to be ashamed for who they were .Although they were immediately dispatched , it did n't matter - people had already seen it and the media was bound to turn it into a storm .If things like race or sexuality - basic components of who someone is - are made into an issue in a certain country where the Olympics are held , those affected by it are more than allowed to speak out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.28807"}

That means that there are 7.046 billion humans who are all extremely dependent and influenced by each other .Out of that 7.046 billion , 3.5 billion people , nearly half the world 's population , watch the Olympics .With that being said , it would be practically impossible for such largely debated issues , like homosexuality , not to snake their way into such a large event .There have been many times in the past in which certain countries came under the hands of some terrible power , such as Germany in the 1930 's , and most countries left them to their own accord , until it was too late .Had the world tried to speak out against it from the start , the holocaust might not have occurred .It would be good if different countries stopped other countries from bringing the unnecessary prejudice and destruction of people .Therefore I say that it should be perfectly allowed to have peaceful protests in the Olympics , both political and athletic .However , if at any time the protests turn violent , then there should be an intervention , in order to keep peace between countries .BellaP_3boydbence .I agree with you , this made me really think over my opinion .I realize that now if it is peaceful protesting I think that could maybe be a good thing but not everyone is up for that .More and more people just want to cut to the chase and I do n't think the Olympics is the place to do that .I really liked this link below because I also think it is very important we focus on our athletes .Melody_M_2 .i disagree , i think every type of issue should be forgotton during these games .weather the protests are violent or not they should nt be brought up until the games are over .the comment above points out that the olympics are not the place for political issues .Nicholas_M_Period1 .I completely agree !The Olympic 's can be a stage of political issues and can push for change in places ( in some cases the whole world ) that need it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.7424"}
