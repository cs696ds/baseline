{"text": "The Internet is gleefully happy to help that process along , as CNN Worldwide managing editor Mark Whitaker noted in an interview last month .Any error , he said , is instantly posted across several platforms .Mistakes - and often facts , because , well , people are crazy - bring instant online demands for corrections , apologies and firings .Two of those repercussions occurred in the case of ABC News reporter Brian Ross ' Tea Party mistake , when he noted that a man with the same name as the suspected Colorado shooter had a page on a Tea Party website .Ross apologized and has kept his job .One of the great frustrations of traditional journalists is that independent entities can share stories or mere speculation without going through any standards and practices .But so , sometimes , do TV journalists .That 's exactly what happened with Ross , who was speaking extemporaneously and apparently did n't vet his information through proper channels before sharing it live on the air .ABC News President Ben Sherwood said after another recent TCA panel that Ross did n't follow network procedures . \" In general , I think that what we do is we typically put on the air what we confirm and know to be true and that [ which ] is reportable , \" he said .\" This is an instance where clearly - just watch it - clearly Brian said we have something , we do n't know if it 's the same guy - but there is a connection between a guy of this name and this particular organization . \"He added : \" We do n't do that .\" Ross , in other words , did what millions of people do every day on Twitter : Post information without checking with an editor , a lawyer or anyone else .The faster the news breaks , the greater the risk of mistakes , as CNN and Fox News learned with their Obamacare fumbles .CNN , beset by recent ratings woes , prides itself on fast and accurate breaking news .Whitaker said last month that CNN was reviewing its entire process because of the error .As the Associated Press documented , CNN reported on the morning of the decision that the Supreme Court had struck down the health care law 's individual mandate , but expressed doubt five minutes later , and two minutes later corrected itself .Fox News also reported that the individual mandate had been found unconstitutional , but within two minutes corrected itself .Anchor Megyn Kelly asked for the removal of an inaccurate onscreen headline .Michael Clemente , Fox 's executive vice president of news and editorial , said in a statement that the network reported \" the news as it happened , \" noting that it had accurately reported that the mandate was found unconstitutional under the commerce clause .But both CNN and Fox initially missed the fact that it was found constitutional under Congress ' right to tax .CBS said it avoided the error by refusing to rush to judgment or listen to chatter from outside its newsroom - even from other networks . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.277946"}

{"text": "Would Journalists Testify ?In the leak investigation of the NSA intercepts , the FBI agent in charge of the probe , Jack Eckenrode , repeatedly complained to senior Justice Department officials that he was stymied because he could not compel interviews or grand jury testimony from the journalists who received the leak .Without obtaining such testimony , Eckenrode said , he stood little chance of identifying the culprit and bringing any charges .Two senior Justice Department officials at the time , Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson and Criminal Division head Michael Chertoff , refused to approve subpoenas for the journalists .They also argued that Eckenrode 's case was circumstantial , according to sources close to the investigation .It is unclear whether then - Attorney General John Ashcroft was involved in decisions on whether to subpoena journalists .Chertoff , now secretary of Homeland Security , declined to comment for this story .Thompson , who is no longer at Justice , did not return a phone call seeking comment .Eckenrode and other investigators kept pressing the argument that they could not know whether they had a good case unless they compelled the testimony of journalists .Some investigators voiced concerns that two GOP political appointees -- Thompson and Chertoff -- had turned them down on subpoenas for a probe whose chief suspect was a Republican senator .Later , when Eckenrode was placed in charge of the Plame investigation , he privately complained that once again he was coming close to cracking the case , only to have prosecutors fail to bring any charges because of their inability to question journalists .Eckenrode scored an early success in the Plame investigation by convincing NBC Washington bureau chief and Meet the Press moderator Tim Russert to speak to him .The FBI agent worked Russert the same way Russert might work a news source : Eckenrode mentioned that he had met Russert when his church group had taken a tour of NBC 's Washington studios , and he spoke about how both of them came from Irish - Catholic backgrounds .Russert responded that Libby was lying -- that , in fact , he and Libby had never discussed Plame at all .But when Fitzgerald attempted to take Russert 's testimony under oath , Russert initially refused and NBC sought to quash a subpoena from prosecutors .For Eckenrode , it was a replay of the NSA leak case , when a Fox News correspondent had identified Sen. Shelby as his source to the FBI , only to refuse to testify under oath .For several months in 2003 , the Justice Department oversaw the Plame leak investigation .( Rove had earlier served as a consultant to three of Ashcroft 's political campaigns . )Senate Democrats were also pressing for a special prosecutor .Because Cheney had personally pushed for a criminal investigation of senators and their staff over the NSA intercepts , the Democrats insisted that the White House endure similar scrutiny over the leak of Plame 's identity , according to several senior congressional staffers involved in the process .With Fitzgerald 's appointment as special prosecutor , Eckenrode found a sympathetic ear for his complaint that leak probes often went nowhere because suspects knew that reporters would never be forced to testify .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.74804"}
