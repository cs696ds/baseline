{"text": "When the case was heard before a jury , the only witnesses the prosecution could produce were Wagner and two fellow police officers - whose travel and subpoena fees were paid by Braun .The jury quite sensibly concluded that the officers - who are , let us not forget , trained liars -- were perjuring themselves in the service of the adulterer who commands them .Given the abysmal character of the chief who commands the Milwaukee PD , it should n't surprise us to learn that the department has been a haven for uniformed sexual predators .In July 2010 , a single mother in Milwaukee ( whose name has not been publicly disclosed ) was raped by Officer Ladmarald Cates .After someone vandalized the woman 's home , she made the common mistake of calling the police in the entirely unfounded belief that they would be of help .Cates was the first on the scene .Immediately after the assault , the woman -- barefoot and wearing tattered clothing -- ran screaming from the house .Cates stormed out of the building and grabbed the victim by the waist , causing her feet to strike his partner .This gave the officers an excuse to arrest the battered and traumatized woman for \" assaulting an officer .\" This was not Cates 's first assault -- but the department was n't willing to take disciplinary action of any kind until DNA evidence corroborated the rape victim 's account .Instead of prosecuting Cates , Flynn fired him for \" idling or loafing on duty . \"In January 2012 , Cates was convicted of federal civil rights charges and sentenced to 24 years in prison .Flynn would insist that Cates is n't representative of his officers .This is true , but not in the sense Flynn would have us believe .What makes Cates an anomaly is not the fact that he was a purulent thug , but rather that he was actually punished for his crimes : The Milwaukee Police Department holds down the number two spot in the national police brutality rankings .Its distinguished contributions in the field of state - sponsored crime include a lengthy and growing list of suspicious deaths of people in police custody .Last September , four of Flynn 's \" troops \" who had followed his orders with exceptional zeal were charged with felonies for assaulting and strip - searching citizens both in the street and in district stations .In one case , three officers restrained a victim - one of them putting him into a choke hold , while another held a gun to his head - while a third jammed a hand into his rectum .The ringleader of this rape gang , Officer Michael Vagnini , was charged with 25 counts of sexual assault and related crimes .In a press conference after charges were filed , Flynn professed to be \" disgusted \" by the conduct of his minions .\" Crime can not be fought with criminality , \" warbled the costumed functionary who had publicly abetted criminal violence against innocent citizens - and who has actually protected an undisguised street gang within his department .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.32852"}

{"text": "To reduce enforcement errors , MPD wants traffic division .The Metropolitan Police Department wants a dedicated traffic unit to fix enforcement problems , including stories about officers serving tickets to injured pedestrians or cyclists at the hospital .MPD believes inconsistent enforcement of traffic laws has created tension between officers and pedestrians or cyclists .Photo by Wayan Vota on Flickr .Officer Andrew Gamm from MPD 's 5th District , Lt .Nicholas Breul from the Special Operations District , and Lt .Mark Hodge from the 6th District spoke with DC 's Pedestrian Advisory Council Monday night to talk about these issues .One brought up a report about an officer ticketing an injured pedestrian in an ambulance , but said he was unable to verify if it was true .Similar incidents came up at a recent hearing and have been reported on blogs like Struck in DC and TBD On Foot .A sustained effort of education and enforcement can reduce this tension and improve pedestrian safety .However , the current budget crisis and low police staffing levels make this a difficult prospect .The commanders said MPD used to have a dedicated traffic unit but previous police chiefs decentralized that effort .Currently , each district has officers working on traffic enforcement but they are not a single city - wide unit .This means enforcement is inconsistent across the city .MPD currently targets \" hot spots \" for a set period and then moves its resources to other areas .However , problems often return after enforcement efforts end .Uneven enforcement also means some police districts enforce violations like jaywalking , while others do not .Some on the Pedestrian Advisory Council complained that MPD officers often do not follow up with pedestrians and bicyclists involved in accidents and that the officers can be rude when they do .The commanders admitted that MPD can do more to improve communication with sergeants and patrol officers , including reinforcing proper procedures for crash investigations .Having a dedicated traffic unit would allow MPD to give specialized training to traffic officers .These officers could also build stronger relationships with the communities they patrol because they would have sustained interactions around traffic enforcement .Some of the commanders admitted that interactions with pedestrians can be more confrontational than with motorists .This , they said , often happens because pedestrians are more likely to challenge the officer than drivers .They also said the nature of police work can make routine traffic enforcement tenser .For example , switching from chasing a gunman to writing a jaywalking ticket can be a rough transition .A dedicated traffic unit could help reduce these shifts .The human nature argument is certainly a fair one .I can imagine if an officer just chased a gunman , his adrenaline may be high , and he may be more likely to be short or rude to an angry pedestrian .But this argument also seems to excuse rude behavior because police work can be dangerous .One officer even went so far as to say he would n't tell someone else how to do his or her job .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.55679"}

{"text": "$ 12/month Recurring Donation .$ 6/month Recurring Donation .Categories .Archives .Site Credits .The number of U.S. police officers who died in the line of duty is up 43 percent so far this year , according to an organization that honors fallen law enforcement officials .The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund says that if the trend continues , 2010 could become one of the deadliest years for U.S. police agencies in two decades .The fund was to release preliminary data Wednesday showing that 87 officers died in the line of duty between Jan. 1 and June 30 .That 's up sharply from 61 officers killed during the first six months of last year .Last year , on - duty officer deaths hit a 50-year low .So what 's behind the increase ?Eugene O'Donnell , professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York , said the number of officer fatalities fluctuates from year to year .However , he said he has noticed an \" alarming frequency \" of people targeting police .\" There has been a spate of particularly brutal and senseless attacks on the police , \" said O'Donnell , a former police officer and prosecutor in New York .\" It seems to me , an unprecedented level of disrespect and willingness to challenge police officers all over the place . \"He said a rise in mental health problems and scathing criticism of police , such as the comments found on some blogs , could be fueling the brazenness and disregard for authority .That sounds like a huge leap .If you look at the National Law Enforcement Fund statistics , 42 of the 87 officer deaths so far this year were from automobile or motorcycle accidents , or from an officer struck by a vehicle .Thirty - one deaths were from gunfire , and 14 were from \" other .\" The 31 gunfire deaths so far this year are up from 22 in the first six months of last year .But I wonder what evidence O'Donnell has that would cause him to attribute an additional nine officer deaths among 900,000 active duty cops to an \" unprecedented level of disrespect \" and a sweeping trend of \" scathing criticism \" of cops on the Internet .I do n't know of a single case last year where there was evidence that an officer 's murder could be traced back to anger or resentment on a web forum .I obviously have n't looked into all 31 officer shootings , but if there was even a hint of a suggestion that the Internet motivated someone to kill a cop , it 's the sort of salacious detail the media would have lapped up and obsessed over for days .And we 'd need quite a few of those incidents to make a trend .Reporters always look for explanations for these sorts of numbers , even when there may not be one .The number of cops intentionally killed while on duty is small enough - especially when compared to the total number of cops working - that nine additional gunfire deaths over six months may well just be a statistical hiccup .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.84514"}

{"text": "THE prosecution 's case began falling apart almost from the start .As Judge Cooperman noted , its witnesses contradicted their own prior statements and made claims on the stand that ballistics evidence clearly disproved .In addition , many of the prosecutions ' witnesses corroborated the officers ' narrative of that night 's events : .Isnora had witnessed the threats about guns outside the club and believed that the Bell party was about to pursue the man they had just argued with for a drive - by shooting .When he and his colleagues opened fire on the Bell car , after it had twice hit them , they believed that Bell 's passenger Joseph Guzman was reaching for a weapon and was going to shoot them .In other words , the prosecution needed to come up with an alternative explanation for why the officers shot at the car .Nothing in the record supported such allegations .As Isnora testified to the grand jury : \" In my time as an undercover , . . .I had never fired my weapon before .I never had any intention in my career . . .of even thinking of doing that .[But ] I felt I had no choice [ that night]. \"Judge Cooperman rightly concluded that the prosecution failed to prove that the officers did not reasonably believe they were facing a deadly threat .MOST importantly , the judge has maintained a meaningful barrier between good - faith police action that proves in retrospect to be even horribly and tragically mistaken , and criminal conduct .To convict these defendants would have required an intolerable degree of second - guessing of police decisions taken under circumstances that few civilians have ever had to face .Tragically , innocent civilian as well as police lives hang in the balance of an officer 's split - second decision to use deadly force - but the urgency that Isnora felt that night is hardly fanciful .Seven months after the Sean Bell shooting , New York Officer Russel Timoshenko was fatally gunned down by the occupant of a car that he had just pulled over in Brooklyn - the 17th NYPD officer to be killed by criminals since 1999 .Had Isnora waited a moment longer and had Guzman in fact been reaching for a weapon , he could have met with Timoshenko 's fate .Yes , the Sean Bell shooting was a sickening tactical disaster - but that does n't make it a crime .Police mistakes that night included flawed supervision -a proper game plan was apparently lacking .And the tactics undertaken - especially letting Isnora come out of undercover status to make a stop - were needlessly risky .The NYPD 's urgent review of its supervisory and tactical training is well - justified and will be aided by the rigorous firearms - discharge - review - board analysis of the shooting .The officers themselves have escaped criminal liability , but they could face departmental discipline .Their supervisors should be even more closely scrutinized .But while the departmental investigation runs its course , Mayor Bloomberg must set the record straight about the NYPD 's role in the city .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.5716"}

{"text": "Training has likely deteriorated even more in the five years since thanks to budget cuts .In Sarasota , Florida , police have gotten one hour of firearms training per year for the last several years due to budget cuts , according to the Sarasota Herald - Tribune .That 's down from 64 hours a year in 1997 .Less money has forced many firearms instructors to do what school teachers with slim resources traditionally have , donating their own money and time to the cause .Harvey Hedden directs the International Law Enforcement Educators and Trainers Association , which holds an annual conference that offers advanced courses to firearms instructors .Since the recession , more than half of the 700 to 800 trainers who show up every year pay their own way , he says - their departments no longer foot the bill .The lack of national data on police training or officer - involved shootings makes it impossible to know whether budget cuts are causing more deaths of innocent people or changing police behavior .But one thing is obvious .Less training can cost police departments big .When they lose the civil suits that sometimes result from such shootings , the financial hit shows the penny - wise - pound - foolishness of cutting training .Payouts in some of those cases have ranged from $ 8 to $ 12 million , says Emanuel Kapelsohn , a lawyer and vice president of the International Association of Law Enforcement Firearms Instructors .The number of lawsuits against the NYPD has shot up more than 50 percent in the last five years , from about 6,300 in 2008 to more than 9,500 in 2012-in fiscal 2012 , those cost the city $ 152 million .In that same period , claims against all other city agencies have fallen .Lawsuits against the Department of Transportation , for example , dropped from about 5,500 to 4,700 in that period .Local governments could win more of those cases - or better , avoid them altogether - if their cops more often practiced realistic simulations of combat situations .Hedden would like to see more role - play training , in which other officers play armed bad guys .Police tell him that practicing armed standoffs best prepares them to make good decisions involving deadly force .But it also costs a lot .Technology could offer part of the solution as computer simulations of combat situations for police get better and cheaper .But in the absence of more money , we at least need better information , such as national data on the number of officer - involved shootings and the amount of firearms instruction that cops are getting , says Morrison .Without it , we 'll never learn what kind of training brings better results on the ground , he says - fewer casualties among police and those they 're supposed to protect .Advertisement .LATimes : Frequent Fire ( LAPD ) .The LAPD knows little about why a tiny number of officers have used deadly force much more often than their colleagues .Most Los Angeles police officers go through their entire careers without ever firing a shot in the line of duty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.463455"}

{"text": "It is argued that times have changed and more criminals and terrorists carry guns so the police should do so too .Now it is being argued that we can not afford to have highly trained firearms officers waiting around for a gun incident to happen .It is perverse to respond to that benign situation by arming more of them and thereby bringing more guns into our streets and communities .Not only that .It will not save money .Any extension of armed policing will cost millions to train a larger cohort of officers to the standard of the elite , who must re - qualify for their firearms authorisation twice a year .The standard of competence amongst this vital group of specialists is bound to go down as the financial and social costs escalate and criminals upgrade their weaponry to keep up with the police .There is extensive evidence from America that police carrying guns are more vulnerable to being ambushed , more likely to be killed and injured themselves , and more likely to kill and injure the public .Nothing erodes public trust and confidence in the police quicker than a police fatal shooting , as both Britain and America have recently found to their cost .Further arming of the police in this country is highly likely to result in more of these , and more damaging incidents such as that in Nottingham in October 2014 when a police automatic weapon was discharged with live ammunition at a public event , injuring a 7-year - old girl .Police with guns make mistakes now .They will make more mistakes if their numbers increase , the standard of training falls , or they are performing routine duties on the streets .Gill Marshall - Andrews , Chair of the Gun Control Network , says : .In the UK the public generally trust the police and are willing to provide information and intelligence .The police are respected and not feared , and they are not armed .If officers start attending routine incidents , or worse still patrolling the streets , with guns the public will feel they are in danger when they are not .Our police force becomes more of a paramilitary organisation which in turn attracts a different kind of recruit .So do we want our police to be enforcers as they are in America , or public servants as they are here ?Will we continue with our decent unarmed police force ?We will , emphatically , be safer if we do and we should fight for it .The Police Federation have recently called for the arming of all police officers with a Taser .This is said to be necessary in order to protect them from potential murder attempts by terrorists .They say they will be safer if they all carry a Taser .However , it is not clear that this would be so ; indeed there is some evidence that police who carry firearms might be in greater danger than those who do not .In the US , for example , police are frequently ambushed for their weapons .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.237816"}

{"text": "I 'm just saying that the law ( and by extension the legislatures that created it ) does n't see things that way .Most hostage takers are not terrorists but just ordinary criminals who panic at the thought of arrest and grab a hostage on impulse .Often the \" hostages \" are really just family members in the home with the criminal when he decides to barricaded himself inside when the police come to arrest him for something .Old - school hostage doctrine had been to conduct quick and aggressive raids in this situation .Sometimes this killed the hostage , sometimes it killed a cop , and often it killed the hostage taker .Given the realities of crime statistics , this meant that the cops were killing a lot of black people .That black community became outraged , and modern hostage negotiation rose up in response .If I remember right , the first time they tried it in New York , the NYPD spent something like 30 hours waiting for a black man with a gun to give himself up quietly .It worked , and the police earned some respect from the community .Maybe it will take something like that to start a revolution against drug raids .Maybe it will take some major city police department responding to pressure and switching tactics .I 'm not a troll , but here is the thought I 've struggled with : The officer was scared .Through his training , he was taught to be scared , that all druggies have guns and are violent , that all druggies will attack without provocation , and so forth .So , being a scared human , hearing gunshots caused him to fire , unfortunately killing Ms. Wilson .Is the officer here at fault as much as the policy and procedure that trains these officers , encourages a mentality of fear , and llows these raids ?If this is a result of a culture of violence / war within the police departments , should the individual officer have been convicted ?Probably not .It 's not like the jury could nullify the policy and exonerate the officer .He was firing blindly .There is no excuse for that .He should be guilty of manslaughter at a minimum with any sane informed jury .Scared or not shooting at random IS NOT a valid option ESPECIALLY for a supposedly \" trained professional \" .Maybe they should make the cops go into drug raids unarmed .That would rein in the macho factor , make them more thoughtful about strategy and tactics , and almost certainly reduce the injury and death rate .Of course , that all has to be balanced against the fact that taking their guns away would eliminate the fun side of it .A few years ago , a cop went into the next - city - over home of a guy who he thought had insulted him in traffic earlier .Stuck a gun in the guy 's mouth and slapped him around ; this was witnessed by neighbors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.56542"}
