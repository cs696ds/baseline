{"text": "I also read some books by leading Christian psychologists and counselors , concluding that masturbation is not a sin at all .While the Bible has something to say about fornication , adultery , homosexuality , bestiality , and incest , it is silent on the subject of masturbation .Therefore I feel perfectly comfortable masturbating occasionally , and recommend it for any male past the age of puberty .It is so much better than having sex with a partner , when one considers sexually transmitted diseases , unwanted pregnancies , and all the problems associated with sex outside of marriage .And for that husband who has to be separated from his wife for several days , masturbation provides a source of sexual release .I have also found masturbation to be a great stress - reliever .As an adult working late at the office , I have been almost overwhelmed with paperwork and figures ( I mean numbers ) , when the urge to masturbate would come upon me .I have found it nearly impossible to concentrate on my work .Then I would just get up , go into the restroom , and masturbate .It took little time and made it possible for me to get back to work and do the job effectively .My wife knows that I occasionally masturbate , and she seems to be comfortable with that - at least she allows me to do so .Sometimes I even masturbate while we are having sex , and she does n't openly object to that ; however , she prefers to be in control of the stimulation of my penis .I enjoy masturbating in her presence , but she has never become comfortable to masturbate herself in my presence .Whether she ever does it alone , I do n't know , but I try to encourage her to feel free to do it whenever she feels a need .Of course , she has never cared as much about sex of any kind as I. .There is a lot more that could be said on the subject , but I 'll quit by saying that I am extremely grateful to the Lord for my learning that masturbation is not sinful , that it is normal and legitimate behavior for men ( and women ) .And it continues to be , even at age 70 , a source of wonderful pleasure .Other than my wife , I have never masturbated with anyone else .I read a lot of accounts where men write of their experiences masturbating with other guys - usually when they were children or teenagers .Perhaps I might have done that , had I found someone with whom I could have discussed sex and masturbation .Or maybe it would have been with me just talking about it .Anyway , I regret to this day that I never had anyone with whom I could even mention masturbation in my teens and 20s .I am heterosexual and do n't agree with homosexual behavior .However , I would not say that a boy who masturbates with another boy is necessarily gay .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.91744"}

{"text": "Instead , the problem may be due in part or whole to worrying about not being able to perform .In such cases you may need a bit of old fashioned reason rather than a Viagra pill !So how can worrying about performing sexually actually prevent you from performing ?The first thing to note is that worrying about not performing sexually only distracts you from sexually interacting with your partner .Often , when worrisome people have sex , they do n't give due attention to the more erotic thoughts and responses that typically accompany successful sexual relating .So instead of thinking erotically , you may start thinking and ruminating about how awful it would be if you could n't perform , how this would reflect poorly on your masculinity or femininity , and what your partner might think of you .Such thinking produces performance anxiety .Anxiety is a future - oriented emotion in which you catastrophize about the consequences of a possible future event .In the case of sexual performance anxiety the event in question is failure to perform sexually and the perceived catastrophic consequences are loss of self - respect and fear of how you think others , especially your sex partner , would view you .So maybe you think that a man must have an erection , or that a woman must have an orgasm .And maybe you think this despite the obvious biological fact that having an erection or orgasm is not a necessary condition of being a man or woman .If you never had another erection or orgasm again , you still would not shed your gender ! \"Well maybe I 'm still a man if I fail to perform , but that 's not what I 'm supposed to do as a man .I 'm supposed to have an erection ; and if I do n't have one , then I 'm somehow defective , kind of like a clock that does n't keep time is still a clock .\" Now , a little existential advice might help to take the edge off this popular \" natural law \" perspective .You are not like a clock !A clock does not have free will .Its ticks and tocks are purely mechanical .A clock does not have subjectivity ; it is not self - conscious .But you are , and there lies the rub .Your \" malfunction \" is not in your mechanical part .It is not in your penis or your vagina ; it is not in a malfunction of your erogenous zone .It is rather a set of irrational thoughts that are creating performance anxiety which in turn lead to your lack of orgasm .A major part of your performance anxiety is fear of what others are going to think of you , especially your sex partner , if you fail to perform .You may fear that your partner will stop seeing you as sexy or as not being a \" real man \" or \" real woman . \"As such , you may tell yourself that your worth depends on whether or not you can reach a climax .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.9915"}

{"text": "Cervical cryotherapy is done by placing a small freeze - probe ( cryoprobe ) against the cervix that cools the cervix to sub - zero temperatures .The cells destroyed by freezing are shed afterwards in a heavy watery discharge .The main advantage of cryotherapy is that it is a simple procedure that requires inexpensive equipment .The cryogenic device consists of a gas tank containing a refrigerant and non - explosive , non - toxic gas ( usually nitrous oxide ) .The gas is delivered using flexible tubing through a gun - type attachment to the cryoprobe .Diagnosis / Preparation .Women who undergo cervical cryotherapy typically have had an abnormal Pap smear which has led to a diagnosis of cervical squamous dysplasia and usually confirmed by biopsy after an adequate colposcopic exam .Preparation for cervical cryotherapy involves scheduling the procedure when the patient is not experiencing heavy menstrual flow .Ibuprofen , ketoprofen , or naproxen sodium may be given before cryotherapy to decrease cramping .If there is any doubt about the pregnancy status , a pregnancy test is performed .Aftercare .Cervical cryotherapy is often followed by a heavy and often odorous discharge during the first month after the procedure .The discharge is due to the dead tissue cells leaving the treatment site , and Aminocerv cream may be prescribed .The patient should abstain from sexual intercourse and not use tampons for a period of three weeks after the procedure .Excessive exercise should also be avoided to lessen the occurrence of post - therapy bleeding .Risks .Uterine cramping .Often occurs during the cryotherapy but rapidly subsides after treatment .Bleeding and infection .Rare , but incidences have been reported .More difficult Pap smears .Future Pap smears and colposcopy may be more difficult after cryotherapy .Normal results .A normal result is no recurrence of the abnormal cervix cells .The first follow - up Pap smear is done within three to six months .If normal , Pap smears are repeated every six months for two years .If any , recurrences usually occur within two years of treatment .Another option is to replace the initial and each yearly Pap smear with a colposcopic examination .If a follow - up Pap smear is abnormal , a colposcopy with biopsy is usually performed .Other treatment methods , usually the loop electrocautery excision procedure ( LEEP ) are then used if persistent disease is discovered .Following the procedure , it is considered normal to experience the following : . slight cramping for two to three days .watery discharge requiring several pad changes daily . bloody discharge , especially 12 - 16 days after the procedure .Alternatives .Alternatives to cryotherapy include : .Laser treatment .A carbon dioxide laser focuses a beam of light to vaporize the abnormal cells .This technique can be used in the physician 's office with very little discomfort .Loop electrocautery excision procedure ( LEEP ) .This procedure uses a fine wire loop with an electric current flowing through it to remove the desired area of the cervix .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.21904"}
