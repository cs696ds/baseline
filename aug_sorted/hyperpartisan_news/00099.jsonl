{"text": "I submit that the answer to this extremely important question is \" No .\" This is simply because the values of Islam are fundamentally incompatible with the values of the United States of America which has been formed and shaped by Judeo - Christian values .First , America celebrates the free exercise of religion .Islam does not .The first fundamental liberty our Founders protected in the Bill of Rights is the freedom to worship God according to the dictates of our own conscience .In Islam , you are only allowed , under penalty of death , to worship Allah according to the dictates of Mohammed 's conscience .It is still a capital crime in virtually all Muslim countries to convert from Islam to Christianity .In many Muslim countries , such as our main Arab ally , Saudi Arabia , it is a capital crime to worship Christ with other believers , even in clandestine settings .Second , America reveres the God of the Bible , while Islam does not .Despite their differences , our Founders were united by a powerful and shared belief in the Creator revealed in the Judeo - Christian tradition .At the time of the founding , 99.8 % of the population of the colonies identified with the Christian religion ( the other 0.2 % followed Judaism ) .Still today the vast majority of Americans identify themselves as Christians .Islam does not share with us this unifying faith , and worships a different god altogether .America was founded on a reverence for the Judeo - Christian God , the source of all our inalienable rights .The Creator - God the Founders worshiped has an only - begotten Son .But devout Muslims worship a different god altogether , for , as banners all across the Muslim world declare , \" Allah has no son .\" The apostle Paul frequently refers to God in his letters as \" the father of our Lord Jesus Christ \" to distinguish him from the pagan gods .Those who lamely try to claim Christians and Muslims worship the same God are theologically illiterate .Simply put , the Founders worshiped the God of the Bible , and Muslims do not .Third , America , shaped by Christian thought , believes in the use of persuasion while Islam does not .This is true whether we are seeking to convince someone to share a religious or political point of view .But Islam teaches that its cause is to be advanced primarily at the point of the sword .Both Christianity and Islam have global aims .But the driving energy in Christianity is to win the world through love and persuasion while Islam seeks to subdue the world through force .The only choices given to Christians under Islam are to convert , submit , or die .Simply put , Christian America believes in persuasion , while Islam believes in raw power .Fourth , Christian America cherishes liberty as a fundamental value while Islam does not .One of the mottos of the Founders in our battle with Britain was , \" Where the Spirit of the Lord is , there is freedom 3:16 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.08629"}
