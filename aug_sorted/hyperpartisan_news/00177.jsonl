Habern , former executive director of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Project .\" They can write something in if they want to , but who do you think the board is going to believe ?Some inmate ? \" When Cole was up for parole in 1996 , Texas considered 1,024 cases classified as SB-45 , or \" Extraordinary Vote , \" which include certain types of sexual abuse and violent crimes , and require a vote by the full board .Among those 1,024 cases , not a single prisoner was granted parole and released .As the number of DNA exonerations rises , we confront the fact that the number of innocent people in prison is far higher than we realize .Until the advent of DNA technology , wrongful convictions were thought to be extremely rare .But as the number of DNA exonerations rises- at least 281 as of this writing - we confront the uncomfortable truth that the number of innocent people behind bars is far higher than we realize .The vast majority of DNA exonerations are in rape cases .In many felony cases - robberies , shootings , murders , drug - related crimes - there is no DNA to test .Even in rape cases , forensic evidence often is lost or destroyed .DNA testing provides false assurance , then , that there is recourse for people failed by the justice system .What it really does is underscore what a true solution would require : a system equipped to deal with the significant number of people locked up for crimes they did not commit .Experts say that number is nearly impossible to nail down .But a conservative estimate , extrapolating from research on eyewitness identification and DNA exonerations , ranges from at least a few thousand to more than 20,000 people wrongly imprisoned nationwide .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.702805"}

I 'm often the one saying these things !I 'm not actually surprised by this , after all martial arts of all styles were developed by men for men to fight other men .Traditionalists have ensured that ancient fighting techniques have been preserved and so most martial arts taught today seem more effective for the male body form than the female one .On top of that we have ' sex equality ' issues and ' political correctness ' to throw into the mix .It would probably take a brave instructor to treat male and female students differently because of their differences in body shape ; particularly if he were male , the risk of sounding sexist or patronising could be enormous .In the dojo that I train in men and women are treated exactly the same in all respects .On the whole this works well , after all I have two legs and two arms like a man so I can do most of the same things that a man can do , so I have no complaints about being treated the same .I will partner the men almost as often as I partner other women and I think this is a good idea as I can learn what it is like to throw or apply techniques to a much larger , heavier person .So , what is my problem ?Well , being a male orientated fighting system , karate teaches you how to deal predominantly with a male on male attack .If a man is attacked it is most likely to occur in the street by a random attacker or by a ' rival gang ' or in a pub brawl or somewhere like that .Statistics suggest that women are rarely attacked by strangers in the street .Eighty - five percent of women who are attacked are attacked in their own homes or in the home of someone they know by someone they know .There is often an emotional attachment between the woman and her attacker which the attacker plays on and manipulates ; or her attacker may have got her drunk or drugged prior to a physical attack .A woman is often already defeated before the first blow is struck .An effective self - defence system for women needs to help her deal with the events that go on between her and the attacker before the physical attack starts so that she can learn how to diffuse or prevent an attack from occurring .This requires quite a different approach than simply learning combative techniques .I 'm not saying that the self - defence techniques that I am learning are no good ; indeed if I am one of the few unfortunate women that are attacked by a stranger in the street then I feel confident that I may be able to help myself .However , my training does not adequately prepare me to deal with the more likely event of being attacked in my own home by someone I know or trust .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.53051"}
