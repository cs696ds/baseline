Jeff Sessions ( R. , Ala. ) said on the Senate floor this week .An announcement is expected soon after Labor Day , an administration official said .The White House said Tuesday that no decisions on new deportation policy had been made .The matter is being debated as the administration also responds to a surge in Central American children crossing the U.S. border .In that case , Mr. Obama has taken a tough stance , saying that everyone who does n't meet narrow legal criteria to stay will be deported .The border crisis does n't appear to be dissuading Mr. Obama from considering policy changes to offer a measure of safe harbor for at least some of the 11 million people already settled illegally in the U.S.After legislation died in Congress that would grant many of them a route to citizenship , he said he would \" fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own , without Congress . \" Last month , Mr. Obama told members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus he was prepared to take significant executive action , said Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( D. , Ill. ) .The lawmaker said Mr. Obama suggested he would offer safe harbor from deportation to certain illegal immigrants with roots in their communities and family ties to U.S. citizens .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "43.9563"}

Bowen et al . .To give a specific example of where admitting unauthorized migrants does not take away from U.S. citizens one need not look further than Massachusetts .The Student Immigrant Movement has been battling for in - state tuition for unauthorized migrant students in Massachusetts for a long time now .At first glance it would appear that offering in - state tuition to unauthorized migrant students would take away from Massachusetts residents , but the non - partisan Massachusetts Taxpayer Foundation has shown that in - state tuition would actually result in $ 2.5 million in additional revenue for state schools .In an earlier post on this I wrote , \" taxpayers actually benefit from giving migrant youth in - state tuition , because it would be added revenue that the State would n't receive otherwise , and it would be of negligible cost to the State to admit these students \" .Read the post I wrote on this to understand the full argument .Those are the best economic arguments I can muster for the support of the DREAM Act , but it is important to remember that these practical economic arguments should not outweigh the injustices that are being done to unauthorized migrant youth .I will end with a note to potential allies that might see a reason to oppose the DREAM Act .A Note To Potential Allies : Comprehensive Immigration Reform and the Military Provision .The media will likely cover any debate over the DREAM Act as a false debate between nativists and migrant advocates .It 's the fake objectivity of journalism that sees the portrayal of two opposite perspectives , regardless of their legitimacy , as balanced and free of bias .Nativists have shown themselves to be increasingly irrelevent from an electoral standpoint .As such , the real battle will not be between nativists and migrant advocates , but among migrant advocates themselves .The most dangerous argument that migrant advocates will advance is that the DREAM Act should not be passed by itself , and that it should part of comprehensive immigration reform .For some time , this has been the position of some of the most powerful migrant advocacy organizations in the U.S. Fortunately , I have faith that this will not be the case this time , but it 's important to remain vigilant in case this argument is made .Certain blocks of politicians have also been known to make this argument .In my estimation , what killed the DREAM Act in 2007 was not nativism , but politicians who voted against the DREAM Act by arguing that it should be part of comprehensive immigration reform .We should not be playing politics with unauthorized migrant youth .Just because the DREAM Act makes comprehensive immigration reform more attractive , does not mean that we should continue to make DREAMers wait for the right to exist in the U.S.More importantly , though , passing the DREAM Act will lay the foundation for comprehensive immigration reform .It will draw the lines in U.S. congress as to who is pro - migrant and anti - migrant , and if it is passed , tens of thousands of new advocates will be able to toss aside their fears and push for comprehensive immigration reform .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.43087"}
{"text": "The average credible fear denial rate nationally for Fiscal Year 2013 was about 8 % ( AILA InfoNet Doc .No .13081316 , p. 29 ) .However , nine of the 25 Dreamers interviewed for credible fear were denied by the asylum office , a denial rate of 36 % .The officers refused to acknowledge that the heightened risk of extortion , kidnapping , or murder by virtue of being a Dreamer warranted a full asylum hearing in front of an immigration judge .While the Houston asylum office is bound by the rulings of the conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals , even there , the law governing the specific claim of fear of persecution based on being a member of the class of Dreamers is not settled .The majority of immigrants interviewed for credible fear are unrepresented by counsel , do n't speak English , and often lack formal education .Often there are discrepancies between the initial border interview and the subsequent credible fear interview .For instance , an applicant might tell a border official she was coming to work in the U.S. and later disclose the additional motivation of fear of persecution to an asylum officer .My clients requesting credible fear had all been educated in the U.S. , were represented by counsel both prior to and during the interviews , and were fluent in English .There were no significant discrepancies between the border interviews and the credible fear interviews .I emphasized to my clients the importance of telling the truth , and I and the small team of lawyers and assistants working with us reviewed the case histories for consistency and accuracy .Anecdotally , it is rare for credible fear applicants represented by counsel to be denied by the asylum office .I would have expected the credible fear denial rate for the Dream 30 to be lower than the normal rate , not four and a half times higher .By comparison , all of the Dream 9 passed their credible fear interviews and were paroled into the U.S. , including the three who had returned to Mexico for the purpose of participating in the action .Little Help from \" Champions \" in Congress .Days stretched into weeks , and still ICE refused to release those of the Dream 30 with positive credible fear determinations .This was in violation of an ICE policy announced in 2009 to parole people found to have credible fear who do not pose a flight risk or danger to the community .I believed at the time that ICE 's intransigence was a form of retaliation for this unorthodox , highly - public action .Later , NIYA learned that ICE 's practice of holding asylum - seekers in violation of its own policy was more widespread than we had thought .The mothers of two of the participants with negative credible fear findings - Jonathan and Rocio - traveled to Senator Bob Menendez 's D.C. office on October 24 to ask for his help .Menendez is the only Senator in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus ( CHC ) and is a visible proponent of immigration reform in Congress .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.44823"}
{"text": "The DREAMer struggle has been articulated many times by people far more capable to do so than I am .Still , I will give it a try .65,000 unauthorized migrant youth graduate from U.S. high schools every year .Many were brought to the U.S. before they could remember much else , and most know no other home except for the U.S.The cruel irony of their situation is made all the more apparent by contrasting it with my story .I was born in Guatemala and spent most of my life there .I was given the privilege of U.S. citizenship simply because I was born of U.S. parents .Meanwhile , DREAMers have lived most of their lives in the U.S. , but are denied the privilege of U.S. citizenship because they had the misfortune of being born somewhere else .If I had to sum up the DREAMer struggle in one sentence it would be this : DREAMers do n't even have a right to exist in the only country they know as their home .DREAMers have n't even gotten to a point where they 're fighting against be considered equal humans , they 're fighting just to be recognized as humans .That 's a huge part of what inspires me about DREAMers .If any nation told me I did n't have the right to exist , I would hate it , much less want to live in it .I 've long joked that if I was a DREAMer , I would have started my own version of Marcus Garvey 's \" Back to Africa \" movement .The U.S. should be begging for talented youth like this , especially during this time of economic crisis .Astonishingly , DREAMers do n't hate the U.S. , they work to better it .Where I probably would have been tearing the U.S. down , DREAMers instead fight to make the U.S. a better and more just place .They embody the essence of what it means to do good in this world .In summary , the moral argument for passing the DREAM Act is the following : the unauthorized migrant youth that would benefit from the DREAM Act know no other home than the U.S.They were brought here through no fault of their own .Though nativists will argue that they should have come here legally , the fact of the matter is that there is currently no way for the beneficiaries of the DREAM Act to gain legal status .Unauthorized migrant youth should n't have to suffer because their parents , like so many migrants before them , chose to seek a better life in the U.S. Even more telling is that these youth want to contribute to the only country they know as their home .They want to make the U.S. a better place .To turn them away , to make them suffer daily from the fear that their lives can end at any moment , is unjust .If you 're still not convinced , I encourage you to read the stories of unauthorized migrant youth that DreamACTivist.org has compiled .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.61406"}
