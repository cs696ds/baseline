{"text": "Unfortunately the Democratic front runner holds essentially the same views , even if Clinton uses different rhetoric in appealing to Democratic as opposed to Republican primary voters .Bernie Sanders represents our best hope to both have a president who has not made the errors which destabilized the region , and who can inspire voters to turn out to defeat the Republicans in a general election .The above electoral map prediction from Western Illinois University has received a lot of attention , especially among supporters of Bernie Sanders , for showing Sanders winning in a landslide .Some argue that we should take this seriously because the mock election model has been right in every election it was used in since 1975 .The catch is that it was only used three times since 1975 .They deserve some credit for correctly predicting victories for Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford before many people had heard of Carter , and for predicting the election of Obama when many were ( as with Sanders now ) claiming he was unelectable .While I would love for this to be true , it is also very hard to accept the results in specific states , such as Sanders winning Mississippi and Georgia but losing in Hawaii and Maryland .Of course the claims of being right are limited to the final results and not accuracy of state by state predictions .A victory for Sanders , even if closer and involving a different set of states , would still be welcome .It is easy to dismiss this prediction , and I could not blame either Clinton or the Republicans for denying any meaning to it beyond the enthusiasm of college students for Sanders .The bigger question this year is whether we can believe the conventional polls , especially when they are being used to determine who qualifies for the debates , which can potentially influence the outcome .Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie have been eliminated from Tuesday 's main debate , along with George Pataki and Lindsay Graham being excluded from the undercard debate .Even some pollsters have argued that the polls should not be used in this manner .One problem is that the Republican candidates are too close together to use the polls to separate them .Then there is the question of whether the polls are all that accurate in predicting a primary election well before the vote .I 've followed the Democratic primaries far more closely , and have noted many times how little predictive value the polls have .This polling report from December 2007 described how Clinton had a huge lead over Obama .In December 2003 , Howard Dean was pulling away in the polls .Eventual winner John Kerry was in sixth place with only 4 percent , even trailing Al Sharpton .Among the problems with these polls , many voters in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire do not decide until the last minute .People are far more likely to switch between relatively similar members of their own party than they are to switch from a liberal Democrat to a conservative Republican in a general election .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.59494"}

{"text": "Now , on the east coast , deep - blue Maryland 's 2013 assault weapons ban is back in the legal crosshairs , with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that a stricter legal standard should have been applied to ascertain its constitutionality .It 's a tremendous decision , though the current ban remains in effect while the legal camps begin arming themselves for the fight ahead .This was applied to federal enclaves ; it was expanded to the states in the McDonald v. Chicago decision .Yet , the Court noted that this right was not unlimited , and that certain limitations on weapons considered \" dangerous and unusual \" could pass constitutional muster .Grenade launchers , rocket - propelled grenades , and atomic weapons fit this category , not AR-15 semiautomatic rifles .Yet , as Dahlia Lithwick wrote in Slate , it 's dubious whether the Supremes will get involved in Kolbe v. Hogan .It 's certainly a possibility , and it offers another legal avenue for Second Amendment supporters to make their case for a broader ruling over the entire country concerning the legality of assault weapons bans .On a side note , Ms. Lithwick , like most left - of - center publications , need to brush up on their firearms nomenclature ( of which I sometimes screw up ) right : .The 4th Circuit then argued that since handguns kill far more people than semi - automatic weapons , and that since Heller made handgun ownership constitutional , the less overall deadly semi - automatic assault weapons must not be dangerous and unusual either .Writing alone in dissent Judge Robert B. King is unequivocal : \" Let 's be real : The assault weapons banned by Maryland 's FSA are exceptionally lethal weapons of war .In fact , the most popular of the prohibited semiautomatic rifles , the AR-15 , functions almost identically to the military 's fully automatic M16 . \"He also notes that the Supreme Court specifically called out M16 rifles in Heller when defining \" dangerous and unusual .\" First , there are no weapons that are \" less deadly semiautomatic \" weapons , unless you 're referring to bolt - action rifles , commonly associated with hunting , or muzzle - loaders , of which no one has really used en masse since the 18 th and 19 th centuries .Second , most handguns in circulation are semiautomatic ( self - reloading ) .An AR-15 rifle is also a semiautomatic weapon , which is why this argument that the AR-15 and the M16 are pretty much the same is so silly .An M16 rifle , the ones used by our military , can fire multiple rounds per trigger pull .There are other firearms that will continue to fire as long as the trigger is pulled ( aka automatic ) as well .That makes these weapon systems wholly different from the AR-15 , not identical .And , yes , automatic firearms for civilians are legal if you are willing to undergo the long process overseen by the ATF , wherein you pay a tax and have your weapons catalogued in a database .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.895424"}

[ ... ] .Right now we have a decentralized system where students can take much of their student aid with them to the institution of their choosing .This enables a wide variety of organizations - public and private - to offer a range of different educational programs .In contrast , free public college would limit choice as many private institutions , now trying to compete with a highly - subsidized , free public option , would likely struggle to survive .In addition to reducing options , this would significantly reduce pressure on public institutions to serve students effectively .Many free college proponents would likely point out that by providing aid directly to institutions , the government can actually exert more direct control over how they operate .For example , Sanders ' bill would require institutions to reduce their reliance on adjunct professors .But are such top - down controls really likely to create the dynamic and innovative system that we need ?By trying to dictate innovation from Washington , such a proposal is more likely to create a system that is rigid , bureaucratic and unresponsive to the changing needs of students and the economy over time .[ ... ] . ...there are a remarkable number of regulatory barriers preventing new and innovative educational institutions from gaining a foothold .Thus , what occurs naturally in other industries - innovative market entrants shaking up the status quo - rarely occurs in higher education .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.04108"}

{"text": "Over at Hot Air , Jazz Shaw noted that it might be time for the high court to definitively rule on whether it was a constitutional right for Americans to own AR-15 rifles .Second Amendment enthusiasts were again hit with disappointment last December when the Court decided to take a pass on whether to hear oral arguments on an assault weapons ban implemented in the Chicago - area city of Highland Park .Now , on the east coast , deep - blue Maryland 's 2013 assault weapons ban is back in the legal crosshairs , with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that a stricter legal standard should have been applied to ascertain its constitutionality .It 's a tremendous decision , though the current ban remains in effect while the legal camps begin arming themselves for the fight ahead .This was applied to federal enclaves ; it was expanded to the states in the McDonald v. Chicago decision .Yet , the Court noted that this right was not unlimited , and that certain limitations on weapons considered \" dangerous and unusual \" could pass constitutional muster .Grenade launchers , rocket - propelled grenades , and atomic weapons fit this category , not AR-15 semiautomatic rifles .Yet , as Dahlia Lithwick wrote in Slate , it 's dubious whether the Supremes will get involved in Kolbe v. Hogan .It 's certainly a possibility , and it offers another legal avenue for Second Amendment supporters to make their case for a broader ruling over the entire country concerning the legality of assault weapons bans .On a side note , Ms. Lithwick , like most left - of - center publications , need to brush up on their firearms nomenclature ( of which I sometimes screw up ) right : .The 4th Circuit then argued that since handguns kill far more people than semi - automatic weapons , and that since Heller made handgun ownership constitutional , the less overall deadly semi - automatic assault weapons must not be dangerous and unusual either .Writing alone in dissent Judge Robert B.

{"text": "House Fights Over Banning Lithium - Ion Batteries on Planes .Politico reports that efforts to regulate the potentially deadly bulk shipment of lithium - ion batteries on passenger flights are stalled over a jurisdictional dispute in the House Transportation Committee .While Republican committee chairman Bill Shuster is pushing to defer authority to the United Nations ' International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) , Democrat Peter DeFazio wants the upcoming Federal Aviation Administration funding bill to include a ban to be issued by the Department of Transportation .DeFazio has said it 's \" only a matter of time \" until a major accident involving batteries in the air .Though it is rare for lithium - ion batteries to explode , the FAA has recorded 140 incidents involving them over the last 25 years , including a fatal explosion on a cargo plane in 2010 .Several passenger airlines have banned shipments of batteries as air cargo , but DeFazio believes a uniform ban is necessary to ensure passenger safety .Airline pilots are also in favor of the U.S. ban .No such ban is expected to impact batteries carried by passengers in laptops or cameras because the greatest risk comes from large numbers of batteries packed closely together .Last December , though , some airlines did ban the battery - powered scooters known as hoverboards from flights , citing particular concerns over lax safety standards in the devices ' manufacture .The most dramatic illustration of the risks of carrying batteries was the 2010 crash of a UPS cargo plane , which killed both crew members after a fire broke out in the hold .Lithium - ion batteries are also increasingly a part of planes ' own systems and caused of a series of fires in Boeing 787 Dreamliners ba , temporarily grounding those planes shortly after their debut .Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 , which disappeared mysteriously in 2014 , was also confirmed to be carrying lithium - ion batteries in its cargo hold , sparking speculation that they caused a fire that brought the plane down .Lithium - ion batteries , or Li - ions , are dangerous due to what 's known as \" thermal runaway .\" If one portion of the battery overheats due to a short circuit , physical damage , or external temperatures above about 60 degrees Celsius ( 140 degrees Fahrenheit ) , the batteries ' chemical properties begin to generate additional heat , in turn spreading the reaction .The resulting fires burn at more than 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit and are frequently explosive .Both hoverboards and a few Tesla tsla electric cars have melted down dramatically due to the phenomenon .The greatest risk is when multiple batteries are tightly packed with limited ventilation , as in the original Dreamliner design - or when they 're being shipped .In a study of the risks , the FAA determined that the ignition of as few as eight batteries could puncture a plane 's cargo hold , and the resulting fire could be too intense to be controlled by planes ' fire - extinguishing systems .The production of lithium - ion batteries has more than doubled over the last decade , with rising demand for power to personal electronics like laptops , phones , and tablets .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.908714"}

Limehouse said he was optimistic that the Senate would have enough time to pass the bill .In order for the bill to become law , it must now be passed by the South Carolina State Senate and signed by Governor Nikki Haley .Tea Party and conservative grassroots organizations are credited with initiating the movement to ban sharia rules through the state legislatures .Conservative leaders Newt Gingrich , Sarah Palin , and Michele Bachmann have publicly advocated for the need to enact nation - wide legislation against the threat of sharia .Underground sharia courts operate in Muslim communities throughout Europe and also in the United States .Last year , Breitbart Texas reported that a \" voluntary \" sharia court had already been established in Texas .Several countries in Europe , including the United Kingdom , France , and Germany , have many underground sharia courts within migrant communities .In the U.K , the government has formally deputized at least one sharia court to decide non - criminal issues among people who agree to use the court , even as public concerns rise that immigrant women are socially pressured to accept the courts ' authority .U.S. opponents of sharia courts point to Europe for evidence that western democracies can gradually cede more de - facto legal authority to self - segregating Muslim communities , so enabling the self - segregation of Muslim communities into no - go zones within cities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.41729"}
