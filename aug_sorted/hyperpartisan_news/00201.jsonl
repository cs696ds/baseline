{"text": "Things had changed over the course of 22 years , but certain patterns of prejudice remain discernable throughout .It is one of the many ironies of this series of events that it was in response to Lemay 's monument that M\u00e9tis leaders sought to publicly articulate their vision of their history and culture , though they now look to Joyal 's statue for a representation of it .As Helene Lemay asserted during my visit to the Lemay home , it was Marcien Lemay 's statue that kept Riel and the M\u00e9tis in the news for over twenty - five years .And it is one of the tragedies of the whole affair that Marcien Lemay , who so honestly sought to honour Riel in his rendering , was blamed for a series of events for which he was not wholly responsible .Miguel loyal believes that it was destiny that his statue of Riel should stand on the Manitoba Legislative Building grounds ; as Marcien Lemay gazes at his maquettes and pages through his records , no such benevolent force is detected .[40 ] .Among the quotations on the walls surrounding Lemay 's rendering of Riel is this most famous M\u00e9tis ' assertion that \" I hope after my death my spirit will bring practical results . \" As a fairly straightforward representation , Joyal 's rendering neither challenges nor extends the limited range of representational options that were acceptable to the M\u00e9tis .It is the range of interpretive options offered by Lemay 's statue - an interpretation of Riel that is inherently ambiguous but not inherently colonial - that made the work too great of a risk for the M\u00e9tis community .Given the social context of Winnipeg between 1969 and 1996 , M\u00e9tis leaders ' unwillingness to tolerate ambiguity seems only prudent .M\u00e9tis leaders chose to remember Riel in a manner appropriate to their needs .Despite the particular importance of his memory to the M\u00e9tis , it is certainly not the desire to animate their struggles with Riel 's spirit that distinguishes M\u00e9tis culture .As Douglas Owram , Donald Swainson , and G. F. G. Stanley have argued , diverse groups and individuals have been doing the same for over 115 years .Riel 's presence in the Canadian historical landscape has attracted as much attention as that of his statues on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislative Building .Though Joyal 's monument may portray both how the M\u00e9tis recall Riel and how they feel he should be remembered by all Canadians , the apparent simplicity of interpreting the statue belies the complexity of remembering the man .Whether Lemay 's statue was an effective illustration of the relentless tensions of Riel 's life , it certainly does seem appropriate as a memorial to the tensions that have persisted since his death .Notes .Douglas Owram , \" The Myth of Louis Riel , \" Canadian Historical Review 63/3( 1982 ) : 315 - 336 .Donald Swainson , \" Rieliana and the Structure of Canadian History , \" Journal of Popular Culture 14 ( Fall 1980 ) : 286 - 297 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.975525"}

{"text": "The Winnipeg Sun proved no more determined to provide articles that explained fully and fairly the concerns of M\u00e9tis leaders .In a particularly ignominious article published while Jean Allard was camped out at Lemay 's statue , The Winnipeg Sun wondered if Allard 's dedication to the monument was due to a distinct physical similarity between man and statue .[21 ] Neither of Winnipeg 's daily newspapers viewed the controversy as worthy of further investigation .Through manipulation of narrative tone and failure to provide sufficient information , the concerns of the M\u00e9tis were dismissed as trivial .It is thereby apparent that The Winnipeg Free Press and The Winnipeg Sun sought to minimize the subversive potential of individuals and organizations who opposed whatever appeared to be the current officially - sanctioned position regarding the commemoration of Riel on the Manitoba Legislative Building grounds .Donna Graves has penned an insightful article regarding the creation of a monument to Joe Louis in Detroit and the varied but overwhelmingly negative public reaction that it garnered .The controversy surrounding the large suspended fist intended to commemorate a hero born of a marginalized community parallels that surrounding Lemay 's statue .The similarity supports an understanding of these events that not only emphasizes the specific situation of the M\u00e9tis people in Winnipeg or the African - American people in Detroit , but also encourages the integration of their experiences into a broader context wherein similar colonial forces operate along various ethnic lines .[ 22 ] In Winnipeg as in Detroit , what may have been good will on behalf of most involved either politically or artistically in the creation and erection of the first Riel statue was invalidated through inattention to social context .An extended fist could indicate the animal nature of African - American men ; a contorted body might represent the fundamental weakness - or worse - M\u00e9tis people .[ 23 ] The M\u00e9tis leaders ' objections to Lemay 's statue should be understood as a rational and justified wariness on their part , as a persistent , if not articulated , understanding that any memorial has the potential to denigrate even as it preserves .Concern could only have been heightened by the fact that Lemay 's statue was sufficiently ambiguous to allow drastic misinterpretation .For instance , a caption in The Winnipeg Guide of 16 July 1975 lamented that \" After all the controversy during the centennial year in honour of Louis Riel , now he is left to rot and fall to pieces .Do n't we have any pride and respect .Pity poor Louis .\" [ 24 ] Marcien Lemay responded with a letter dated 23 July 1975 : .These statements are false and are obviously made by a person who knows absolutely nothing about the construction of this sculpture .The statue is not falling apart .The surface has not worn through to the steel metal supports .The mesh wire which shows through in certain areas was intentional and forms part of the surface texture .[ 25 ] .Lemay 's response clarifies the difficulty inherent to the interpretation of his work : the audience is not provided with sufficient information to ensure interpretations that correspond to the artist 's intentions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.799194"}

{"text": "In similar fashion , Lemay 's statue became naturalized over the twenty - year period between its erection and the public debate regarding its removal .This is evident in the comments written by members of the public in the notebooks Jean Allard made available during his two - week protest at the statue .The comments demonstrate a tendency on the part of many visitors to equate the statue and the man .In a plea typical of many , one supporter wrote \" Do n't remove this statue .It represents a history that can not be undone or erased .\" This comment embodied the foremost fear of the M\u00e9tis : that Lemay 's statue would legitimize an interpretation of Louis Riel that they condemned .[ 30 ] .It was not only the M\u00e9tis who condemned Lemay 's statue .Primarily in the years immediately before and after the statue was erected , there was limited but spirited debate from individuals who opposed any commemoration of Louis Riel for ethnic , national , or linguistic reasons .The files of Premier Edward Schreyer contain letters from people wanting to express their outrage at the erection of a statue dedicated to the memory of a man they still considered a traitor .A few went so far as to suggest that a statue to Thomas Scott should instead be erected .[ 31 ] One of the most virulent letters of opposition was sent to the editor of The Winnipeg Tribune .Stating that it was \" with anger , revulsion and sheer disbelief that I read in the newspaper that approval had been given for the erection of a statue of that madman Louis Riel on the grounds of the Legislative Building , \" the author threatens that .If this atrocity should be perpetrated , I hope someone will have a good supply of red or green paint handy .Should they require help , this former Manitoban will be delighted to come home for the \" paint - in \" ( preferably just before the opening ) .It will be my Centennial project .[ 32 ] .Such deliberate threats place the vandalism to which the statue was subject in a different light : it no longer seems possible to blame the singular nature of the monument for all such behaviour .On the copy of the letter that I extracted from the Executive Council files is a typed note that follows the main text of the letter .I find this additional passage highly significant in its insinuation of a hierarchy that the author of the letter wants desperately to protect : .Derek : Ca n't you do anything to stop them now ?We managed to ignore these people for 10 years but obviously the new government was willing to listen I am more than a little disturbed !For a historian , this brief note represents an interpretive challenge : it is unofficial , undated and unsigned .Yet perhaps it is the note 's very nature that is most revealing .The writer is obviously seeking to exploit personal connections , to perform the sort of machinations possible only for those secure in their positions of social privilege .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.31285"}

{"text": "Such ambiguity is not inherently a deficiency , but becomes problematic in light of the social context from which the statue can not be divorced .Unfortunately , not all the damage to Lemay 's statue was of the type invented by a reporter 's misinterpretation .The monument was subject to extensive physical abuse while it stood between the Manitoba Legislative Building and the Assiniboine River .The statue had its genitalia smashed on numerous occasions , litter was often strewn around its base , and a life preserver , presumably stolen from a nearby bridge , was once placed around the statue 's neck .Stephen Greenblatt , in Learning to Curse , asserts that he finds signs of vandalism and alteration to possess resonance , to provide an \" intimation of a larger community of voices and skills , an imagined ethnographic thickness .\" [ 26 ] While Greenblatt may find the idea of vandalism intriguing , the M\u00e9tis held quite a different view of the specific abuses to which Lemay 's statue was subject .In an article in the \" Le Metis \" of February 1977 , Michele Cormier wrote : . \" Let 's clean up Louis Riel \" should be ou[r ] motto .But then , since the name Riel has been surrounded by so much garbage from people who misunderstand what he and his life 's work stand for , that I wonder if this little bit of material trash really harms his ( white ) \" public \" image .Lemay 's statue was subjected to an inordinate amount of vandalism , a fact that various people have attributed to its singular physical appearance .[28 ] If Greenblatt 's assertion that vandalism becomes part of a memorial is tenable , the damaged statue may have become a monument to the colonial assumptions that girded Riel 's \" ( white ) \" public \" image \" .In response to Cormier 's pointed question , M\u00e9tis leaders came to believe that Lemay 's statue was beyond rescue .In the 1991 Winnipeg Free Press \" New Statue May Replace Defaced Riel \" , M\u00e9tis leader Yvon Dumont said that the vandalism \" is an insult , but the statue as a whole is also an insult .\" [ 29 ] Notably , Even as Cormier seems to be calling for the statue 's rescue , she makes observations akin to Dumont 's .By noting that the trash surrounding the statue was perhaps not the most pressing issue , she insinuates that it is the colonial assumptions animating Riel 's \" ( white ) ' public ' image \" that must be confronted .By this point , M\u00e9tis leaders would like to remove Lemay 's statue along with the trash .The salience of Greenblatt 's observations is demonstrated as , for prominent individuals within the M\u00e9tis community at least , the statue and the vandalism had become indistinguishable .Bust of Louis Rid located on the grounds of the Musee de St. Boniface .Source : Robert Coutts .While the statue and the vandalism had become indistinguishable for some , the distinction between Riel as historical figure and Riel as artistic rendering had become blurred for others .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.75512"}

Mattes in her examination of images of Riel .[5 ] While the existence of an incontrovertible link between Riel and the M\u00e9tis is argued vehemently by Kaye and Mattes , it is acknowledged tacitly by Winnipeg 's daily newspapers .From 1968 to 1996 , reporters for The Winnipeg Free Press and The Winnipeg Sun were always eager to secure comment from a M\u00e9tis person concerning the latest statue controversy .Also , individuals tended to add credence to their opinions , in cases of both requested comment and volunteered opinion , through assertions of their M\u00e9tis status .M\u00e9tis identity provides some people with a perceptual position of singular significance from which to evaluate representations of Riel .Though he may be used by many , Riel is intimately and irrevocably connected with some .Any statue of Louis Riel must be understood as a representation of the M\u00e9tis people .As I examine a series of events that took place in Winnipeg during a 30-year period , I am preoccupied with the M\u00e9tis who have lived and now live in this area .Jennifer Brown argues that a biological definition of Melds identity is insufficient , and asserts that M\u00e9tis \" refers to a distinctive sociocultural heritage , a means of ethnic self - identification , and sometimes a political and legal category , more or less narrowly defined .\" [ 6 ] .In Winnipeg between 1969 and 1996 , it was another definition of M\u00e9tis that prevailed in many quarters .As my paper will demonstrate , the ways many people perceived the M\u00e9tis community were situated within the parameters of colonial thought .[ 7 ] Despite temporal and geographic differences , the M\u00e9tis of late twentieth - century Canada embodied a similar challenge insofar as they refused to remain confined to the conceptual and geographic spaces accorded to them by colonialism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.96825"}
{"text": "On a single page , we see evidence of clandestine efforts to prevent erection of Lemay 's statue and we hear of plans - however rhetorical - for a public display of the loathing directed toward Riel .In such a climate , when people were still so fervently seeking to oppose Riel through methods including both criminality and cronyism , M\u00e9tis leaders were simply unable to tolerate a statue that offered a broad range of interpretive possibility .They desired a monument to Riel in the form of a visual statement that would directly contradict many of the readings that could be applied to Lemay 's statue .Yet in the early 1970s , M\u00e9tis leaders felt unable to staunchly and unwaveringly elucidate their desire .Angus Spence , President of the Manitoba Metis Federation , argued in a Winnipeg Tribune article of 12 January 1972 that the statue does credit \" neither to Louis Riel nor to the M\u00e9tis people of Manitoba . \"However , Spence reluctantly acknowledges that \" the government has at last done something to honor Riel 's contribution to Manitoba .\" [ 33 ] The conciliatory tendency exhibited by Spence in 1972 is simply absent from the rhetoric of Yvon Dumont in 1989 .Spence had been willing to accept what he could get ; Dumont was determined to get what he could accept .A letter sent to the Honourable Gerald Ducharme illustrates that M\u00e9tis leaders were no longer willing to tolerate a statue that they felt could potentially demean even as it commemorated .Dumont asserted that \" We would rather have no recognition than to have Louis Riel recognized by a 2.5 million dollar park surrounding that existing disrespectful and negative statue . \" In the same letter , Dumont threatens that .[34 ] .Dumont 's rhetoric leaves no room for moderation : the statue is not potentially disrespectful and negative , it is disrespectful and negative .As the ambiguity of Lemay 's statue has already been established , Dumont 's unwillingness to allow for the possibility that it could be interpreted in ways that would honour Riel 's memory is perhaps indicative of how the M\u00e9tis leadership understood their own situation at this point .M\u00e9tis leaders , aware of their tenuous social position , would no longer prevaricate and could not tolerate ambiguity .It may have seemed all too likely that allowing for multiple interpretations would inevitably turn up some that were derogatory to the M\u00e9tis .Miguel loyal , the artist responsible for the second Riel statue , claims that the M\u00e9tis leadership indeed sought in the second statue a clear and unmistakable rendering of their vision of Riel .Joyal 's Riel measures 8.74 meters , towering over Queen Victoria at the front of the building and even surpassing the Golden Boy in height .The Golden Boy is a symbolic rendering of Manitoba 's spirit and vitality that stands on top of the Manitoba Legislative Building .According to Joyal , the M\u00e9tis leadership made a conscious decision to make Riel taller , believing that the founder of Manitoba should stand tallest on the Legislative Grounds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.11143"}
