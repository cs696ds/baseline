Ted Cruz and Donald Trump .Good luck finding anything else on which they agree .The immediate cause of this debate is Syrian President Bashar al - Assad : Should the U.S. be trying to unseat him , so that everyone can then focus efforts on destroying the Islamic State , or ISIS , caliphate that 's been established on Syrian territory ?Or has recent history shown that throwing out thugs and dictators like him merely opens the doors for the kind of chaos that sucks in American troops and creates problems worse than the ones the U.S. was trying to solve ?But this is hardly an argument about Syria alone .This may sound like a repeat of the debate over the realpolitik approach that Henry Kissinger and others took in the 1970s .The essence of realpolitik was that the U.S. should live and even work with unsavory characters if doing so served America 's national interests .But the new debate over regime change is different in one important respect .The argument over realpolitik was in many ways a moral one : Did the U.S. have an obligation to try to force out , say , tin - pot dictators in Latin America who committed human - rights abuses yet served American interests by standing against the spread of communism ?The debate about regime change today is less about morality than about practical results .Those supporting regime change are arguing less that it 's the morally correct stand , but rather that getting rid of hated dictators who are feeding extremist anger through their brutality enhances stability and therefore American interests in the long run .The thugs , the argument goes , are merely sitting on kegs of dynamites that will explode with greater force the longer they stay there .Those who are against regime change argue that the stability those dictators provide is better for American interests than the leap into the unknown , and the resentment that arises within the local populace , when American force is used to expel them .To these skeptics , the chaos in Libya today and the bloody , decade - long occupation of Iraq illustrate that the dangers in regime change are real , while the rewards can be illusory .Better to keep the dictators in their box than to open Pandora 's box by ousting them .That argument was made forcefully in last week 's Republican debate by Sen. Ted Cruz : \" Assad is a bad man .Gadhafi was a bad man .Mubarak had a terrible human - rights record .But they were assisting us - at least Gadhafi and Mubarak - in fighting radical Islamic terrorists .And if we topple Assad , the result will be ISIS will take over Syria , and it will worsen U.S. national - security interests .Mr. Trump declared that \" we ca n't be fighting Assad .And when you 're fighting Assad , you are fighting Russia , you 're fighting a lot of different groups .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.87189"}

Barack Obama does not share their values , only seven percent cast their ballots in his favor .Basically , more people who do n't relate to Clinton are , for one reason or another , still voting for her .These are not likely to be loyal supporters .On a broader level , among the 17 percent of primary goers who said they would choose Sen. John McCain over Hillary Clinton in a hypothetical general election match - up , 41 percent of that group came from Clinton 's own camp .In essence , roughly seven percent of Clinton support in Indiana ( 40 percent of 17 percent ) said they would defect to the Republican should she end up the nominee .That would be a difficult punch to stomach in November .In 2004 , nearly 1 million Indianans voted for John Kerry .A seven percent defection rate would have meant 70,000 less votes .By contrast , if the general election is between Obama and McCain , 19 percent of the Indiana Democratic primary goers said they would support the Republican .But only 12 percent of that group ( 2.28 percent ) would come from Obama 's camp .Shellshocked House Republicans got warnings from leaders past and present Tuesday : Your party 's message is n't good enough to prevent disaster in November , and neither is the NRCC 's money .There is an attitude that , ' I better watch out for myself , because nobody else is going to do it , ' \" the member said .\" There are all these different factions out there , everyone is sniping at each other , and we have no real plan .We have a lot of people fighting to be the captain of the lifeboat instead of everybody pulling together .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.108"}

John Kasich - lag well behind .The hole in the moderate middle is wide enough that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has begun pondering whether the conditions are right for a presidential run as an independent , centrist candidate , though history suggests such efforts are difficult at best .To some extent , it 's normal for primary elections to draw candidates toward the ideologically charged activists in their parties ' bases , who are the most energized players early in any campaign season .But the trend seems especially acute in the 2016 cycle .Here 's one big reason for that : More Americans actually are severing their ties to the two main parties , which they see as ineffective .In doing so , they are leaving the presidential primary process to be dominated by the more ideological activists of the left and right .A study of voter registration in the most politically competitive states by Third Way , a think tank of moderate Democrats , found that between the 2008 and 2014 election cycles , the share of Americans registered as independents grew by 17.4 % .Meanwhile , Democratic registration decreased by 4.8 % while Republican registration grew by just 3.3 % .Similarly , a new Gallup study released this month finds that 42 % of Americans now identify themselves as political independents , dwarfing the shares who call themselves Democrats ( 29 % ) or Republicans ( 26 % ) .We have two phenomena : a growth of independents and a growth of partisanship , \" says Lee Miringoff , who directs the Marist Poll . \" The Democrats and Republicans who remain identified with the parties are really baked into their positions . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.09439"}

Bush .Gore lost because Bush won a majority of the electoral votes , which are allocated to the winner of the popular vote in each state .Gore took the national vote because he received an excess of support in California , New York and other large , heavily Democratic states .NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd said this type of \" split result \" is unlikely this year , but he observed that the McCain camp may be banking on it anyway . \" The McCain folks realize their only path now is an Electoral College path , \" Todd said .\" It 's very hard for him to win the popular vote . \"And RealClearPolitics gives the Democratic candidate a 7.3 point lead in its recent average of national polls .According to Todd , McCain may not be able to overcome this gap because Obama is saturating the airwaves with ads .These television spots should help Obama run up decent vote numbers - even in states he is likely to lose .The Democratic candidate is also is likely to win big in populous states like California and Illinois , padding his vote total even further .At the same time , Todd said , McCain could still win the presidency by squeaking by in just enough states to get the 270 votes needed to snag an Electoral College victory .\" You throw all that together and it is conceivable that Obama wins the popular vote by three or four million and he loses the Electoral College , \" Todd said , adding : \" I do n't think it is a big chance . \" Not the first time If there is a split result this year , it would be just the fifth time in U.S. history that the candidate receiving a plurality of the popular vote did not become president .Previous instances include the elections of 1824 , 1876 , 1888 , and of course 2000 .The 2004 presidential election almost had a similar outcome .Bush defeated John Kerry by more than three million votes in that contest , and he won the Electoral College , 286 - 252 .But if just 100,000 Bush voters in Ohio had chosen Kerry instead , then the Democrat would have won the state and the election despite losing the popular vote .Silver actually projects that McCain , not Obama , has a better chance of winning the popular vote but losing the Electoral College .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.6187"}
