{"text": "When John Podesta became President Clinton 's Chief of Staff in 1998 , it was well known that he was a fanatical fan of The X Files .Podesta was fascinated with the UFO subject .One White House Staffer said he would sometimes get on the phone and call places like Area 51 to ask the Air Force what was really going on out there .Given John Podesta 's passion for seeking the truth about UFOs , it would be hard to believe that the Clintons were not given every opportunity to find out what the government really knew about UFOs .Thanks to a Presidential Executive Order ( # 12958 ) signed by Bill Clinton , over 80 million secret documents were made available for declassification .Many of these documents had to do with UFOs .In fact , the Sci - Fi Channel became the direct beneficiary of some of that information using it as a springboard to call for the government to release more information about UFOs and to produce subsequent programming about various high - profile UFO events including the Roswell and Kecksburg UFO crashes .A second briefing given to President Clinton ( and Vice President Gore ) is one that I have known about , but not publicized up to this point .That briefing was given over a secure phone connection by former U.S. Government Scientist and Air Force Officer , Dr. Michael Wolf .Among those present on the phone was my friend and fellow UFO Researcher , Dick Criswell .Dick was a member of Wolf 's AlphaCom Team .Unlike the Rockefeller briefing , this one was official and provided very detailed and extremely sensitive information to President Clinton and Vice President Gore .Former President Clinton is a very intelligent man .Although he likes to play the part of the good ole boy that happened to get lucky and end up in the White House , he is a force to be reckoned with and not simply the Hilary puppet that many pundits claim .Clinton knows the value of information and how to use it to get what he wants .It surprises me that he has n't been more open about his own quest for UFO information and what he has officially learned about the subject from sources like Dr Wolf and the AlphaCom Team .I do not know what lead up to the Wolf Briefing , but I know that politicians often find themselves up against a brick wall when it comes to getting information about UFOs from conventional government and military sources .And they are not alone .I have had many people serving in the military or working with them complain about the secrecy surrounding the subject .In 1993 , I received a call from an Instructor that was teaching a course at the Air Force Academy .I was presenting a series of seminars in Colorado Springs and he heard me talking about the subject on a local radio station .During our phone conversation , the Instructor stated that he and others at the Academy were always directed to the old Project Bluebook materials any time they had questions about UFOs or tried to get materials on the subject for their students .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "46.693077"}

Kennedy , Bill Clinton may have learned from what some feel was Kennedy 's fatal error .Still careful and deliberately vague whenever he comments about UFOs , Bill Clinton seems to understand the code of silence set in place for high - ranking ex - government officials and retired members of the military .Clinton probably believes that there is just no safe political currency to be gained in exposing the secrets about UFOs and Aliens and he may well be right .Those that sought to ignore that code have been murdered , died early deaths or been killed under suspicious circumstances .New Mexico Congressman Steven Schiff died of cancer at age 51 after making many inquiries into the Roswell UFO Crash and raising public awareness on the matter .Former Navy Officer William Milton Cooper ( Bill Cooper ) was shot to death by law enforcement officers that claimed he charged after and shot at them ( with his one good leg ) .Cooper spent years exposing the secret government in place to deal with Aliens .Former government geologist Phil Schneider was found dead with piano wire tied around his neck after years of speaking out about secret underground bases and hostile encounters between aliens and members of the military .Schneider had been shot several times and on other occasions before his death .It 's sad to think that the best the American Public can hope for is some occasional deathbed statement or confession from those involved with the cover - up to provide any reliable information about what the government knows about UFOs and Aliens .Part of the blame lies at the door of our news media as they chuckle about or make light of any and all stories of UFO sightings , alien encounters or the government cover - up of related information .One can only hope that some fearless politicians and reporters eventually appear who are willing to expand their reality boxes to include more than just what happens on this small planet and tell the truth to a public hungry for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.582375"}

'Instead they left it in the hands of people like Luckman .The gossip columnist never cared about the contents of the document .The big new item to them was the fact that Rockefeller was a believer in flying saucers .That was the angle that Luckman was pushing , because he was a publicist and he knows what sells and what does n't sell . 'When the report was finished a further uncoordinated effort to distribute the report led to further set - backs .Each member of the committee was allowed to distribute their copies to whomever they wanted to .There was no overall plan as to who should receive the important document , and there was no follow - up after the documents were sent .

{"text": "He set up a series of briefing to be given to the president - elect that would have him ready to govern when sworn in .This is a practice that continues up to the present .Truman helped brief Eisenhower on many subjects he would need to govern .One of those briefings is the rumored UFO briefing given to Ike in November 1952 .This briefing has become famous because of the MJ-12 document mailed to Jamie Shandera in 1984 .As my time is limited and others are talking about this document I will not deal with it .I will discuss later other examples which show the importance of such briefings .Now to perhaps the most well known of the presidential UFO stories .This story is the visit of Eisenhower to Palm Springs in February 1954 .It was during that visit that the press discovered Ike had disappeared .Panic broke out and one reporter almost got a story on the wire stating that Ike had died of a heart attack .Ike reappeared the next morning at church and all was forgotten .All of the 1950s stories state that Ike had gone to nearby Edwards Air Force Base , and there met with aliens who landed at the base .Ike met with the aliens , heard their message , and thereby decided the world was not ready for this type of information .The story further states it was at this point Ike ordered the real cover - up to start .Although no 1950 story mentions dead aliens there is actually some evidence to indicate that he may in fact have gone to Edwards to see alien bodies .A month before Ike made his trip to Palm Springs , the APRO Bulletin published a headline story which stated \" A.F. Men Examine UFO : Object Found Near California Oregon Border . \"Prominent radio commentator Frank Edwards , who broke the story , stated that the object had been moved to a \" West Coast US airfield . \"An interesting sidelight to this story is the fact that one of the air force men reported to be going to the airfield to investigate the object was none other than J. Allen Hynek .Finally , related to Eisenhower , is the testimony of Brigadier General Steven Lovekin who stated that he had been shown small UFO wreckage pieces , and that Ike was fully aware of the facts .Lovekin had served with the White House Army Signal Corps .In a conversation with me Lovekin stated that Eisenhower knew what was going on and that Lovekin himself had witnessed Eisenhower talking about UFOs while at Camp David .Lyndon B. Johnson .During a recent visit to the Lyndon Johnson library in Austin Texas , I spent a week looking at the UFO connection to the 1965 power blackout in the northeast , and the role of the Johnson White House in the crash of an object in Kecksburg , Pennsylvania .At the time of Kecksburg crash President Johnson was at his White House ranch in Austin , Texas .A careful review of the evidence showed some interesting parallels to what Gordon had discovered about groups reported at the crash scene .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.012314"}

{"text": "Indeed , not to put too fine a point on it , the Rockefeller Briefing Document has basically sunk without a trace .Yet this is not done .Why ?Several factors occur to me .The first of these factors relates to the rather unwarranted aura of mystery that initially surrounded the Rockefeller Briefing Document .For example , in one press report Don Berliner was reported as saying that the report was only to be given to \" really top people \" and \" I guess the only reason I have a copy is I wrote the thing \" ( see Footnote 11.20 ) .Mrs Galbraith reportedly stated \" We just want the right people to know ...It 's like your children are going to announce their engagement and they have n't even told their mommies and daddies , and then their mommies and daddies read about it in the newspaper .They would be upset , would n't they ? \"( see Footnote 11.18 ) , leading one commentator to comment \" Ahem .Yes .The briefing document is frankly not that exciting , content - wise \" ( see Footnote 11.18 ) .The aura of mystery which first surrounded the Rockefeller Briefing Document inflated its intended role ( which , in effect , was one of advocacy - not original research ) and led to conspiracy theories .For example , the author Jim Marrs discussed the Rockefeller Briefing Document in his book \" Alien Agenda \" ( 1997 ) in terms which implied it was a major study by a shadowy group .Jim Marrs relied upon the \" multidisciplinary and multinational \" study funded by Laurance S Rockefeller as evidence that \" certain members of the world 's wealthy elite have expressed a more than casual interest in UFOs and their occupants \" .Marrs implied that Rockefeller was not merely a member of \" the world 's wealthy elite \" , but was somehow acting on their behalf .Such a group would desire to be foremost in any alien contact so as to gain control of or suppress any alien technology that might unbalance the status quo \" ( see Footnote 11.26 ) .( In comments on a draft of this article , Don Berliner made the following comments on this quotation from Jim Marrs ' book : \" Why not include the International Olympic Committee and the Federation Aeronautique Internationale ?Why is it that some people insist on dragging everyone and everything into one grand , unsupported conspiracy , and thus losing whatever credibility they ever had ? \" - see Footnote 11.34 ) .Nothing in the contents of the report could legitimately be described as \" secret \" - all the relevant information had been published already .A representative of the UFORC has acknowledged the \" frustration \" that existed when the Rockefeller Briefing Document was circulated , stating that \" many in ufology felt slighted that it had n't been released to the general public \" ( see Footnote 11.28 ) .With the benefit of hindsight , Don Berliner has commented that \" I suppose our refusal to give a copy of the BAE to every self - styled ' world 's most important Ufologist ' was bound to lead to accusations of conspiracy \" ( see Footnote 11.34 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.0876"}

N. Davis , had also been diverted to investigate the radar returns while flying a Venom from RAF Coltishall .As the interception would have occurred at the same time as that described by Wimbledon and Perkins , it has been suggested that Davis and another pilot were the two described in their accounts .No , Nemo , all of that is untrue and complete nonsense .As I 've repeatedly said , \" real ' UFO ' of any kind , \" and that means exactly what it says , any kind of ambiguous thing that 's real .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.47415"}
