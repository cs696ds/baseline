'He is now fighting for money from the Jackson 's estate and asking a probate court to allow him to file a late creditor 's claim against the estate , even though the deadline has passed for creditors to file such claims .The estate 's lawyer , Howard Weitzman , has dismissed Robson 's claims .In a statement to Today , Weitzman said : ' This is a young man who has testified at least twice under oath over the past 20 years and said in numerous interviews that Michael Jackson never did anything inappropriate to him or with him .Seven years of alleged abuse : Robson , pictured right with Jackson as a kid , said from the age of seven to around 14 Jackson ' performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him ' . 'Now , nearly four years after Michael has passed , this sad and less - than - credible claim has been made . 'But Robson told Today that his speaking out about the alleged abuse is not for fame or fortune .This is not a case of repressed memory , ' Robson told Today . 'I have never forgotten one moment of what Michael did to me , but I was psychologically and emotionally completely unable and unwilling to understand that it was sexual abuse . 'He said having his own child two years ago made him face up to the truth , as he said he could n't help thinking about how he 'd feel if a stranger molested his little boy .I 'm a father and I became a father two and a half years ago to this beautiful baby boy and during the first 18 months of his life I collapsed into two nervous breakdowns , terrifying nervous breakdowns , ' he told Lauer .At that point , I had no idea what was going on .And for the first time in my life , I began to realize that my completely numb and unexplored feelings about what Michael did to me might be a problem and maybe I need to speak to somebody about it . 'Why now ?Robson , pictured left and right , says he is speaking out not for the money but to heal and help others .In the past eight years , Robson has made a name for himself in the entertainment world , becoming one of the most sought - after choreographers .He has worked with Usher , Britney Spears , and NSYNC .His name hit the gossip columns in 2002 when Britney Spears ' relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after she allegedly cheated on the NSYNC star with the choreographer .Since then , Robson has worked on the show So You Think You Can Dance , and is currently in charge of Demi Lovato 's choreography .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.231155"}

'The DCFS investigation could also affect any custody disputes between the late star 's mother Katherine - who was named legal guardian of the children - and Debbie Rowe , mother to the two eldest children .The source added to Britain 's The Sun newspaper : ' The DCFS has 27 days to investigate the case and close it .They will check everyone involved in the children 's lives for a criminal background .If they are satisfied the kids have been raised in a decent environment , then no further action will be taken .But if they 're not satisfied , that 's when they take it to court . 'Legal experts believe Katherine will be granted custody , but she is also likely to be assessed .Attorney and family law expert Michael Dave said : ' The DCFS investigate areas such as neglect and abuse .They are likely to give Katherine an evaluation , carried out by a neutral expert , to determine how suitable the potential guardian is to take custody of the children full - time . 'And later they returned to see whether the children were in danger because of the stun gun incident in their home .In short with so much attention to Michael 's children we can not doubt that they are in really good hands : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.583923"}

Arceneaux .In 2005 she wrote the following which was in the comments on the main article : .After reading many of the pleadings and the witness list for the defense and prosecution I can say without hesitation that the 2005 trial was nothing short of an abuse of power .Sneddon continues to say that he believed in the Arvizos and his case simply because to do differently would be admitting that he knowingly prosecuted an innocent man .He did it for political gain and no other reason .He said that he was going to retire in 2006 and not run for DA again .He never said what his retirement plans were .He saw a prosecution of a high profile case as a stepping stone to a higher office .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.95073"}

{"text": "Under cross examination the boy severely undermined the prosecution 's conspiracy charge by claiming he 'd never felt afraid at Neverland and he 'd never wanted to leave .His accounts of the alleged molestation also differed from his brother 's .Unfortunately for Jackson , Gavin Arvizo 's cross examination was all but ignored as newspapers giggled and gossiped about what became known as ' pajama day ' .On the first day of the boy 's direct examination Jackson slipped in his shower , bruised his lung and was rushed to hospital .When Judge Rodney Melville ordered a bench warrant for Jackson 's arrest unless he arrived within an hour , the singer sped to the courthouse in the pajama trousers he 'd been wearing when he was rushed to hospital .The photographs of Jackson in his pajamas went all over the word , often with no mention of Jackson 's injury or the reason he was wearing them .Many journalists accused Jackson of faking the entire event in order to gain sympathy , although sympathetic is the last word you 'd use to describe the media 's reaction .The incident did n't stop the media from sending Gavin Arvizo 's lurid allegations around the world the following day .Some outlets even ran the boy 's testimony as fact rather than conjecture . \"He Said If Boys Do n't Do It They Might Turn Into Rapists - Cancer Boy Gavin Tells Court of Jacko Sex , \" wrote The Mirror .But the boy 's cross examination was another story .It went almost completely unreported .Instead of stories about Gavin Arvizo 's lies and the two brothers ' contradictory allegations , newspaper pages were filled with snarky opinion pieces about Jackson 's pajamas , even though ' pajama day ' had been days previously .Thousands of words were dedicated to whether or not Jackson wore a wig and the Sun even ran an article attacking Jackson for the accessories he pinned to his waistcoats every day .It seemed like the press would write anything to avoid discussing the boy 's cross examination , which severely undermined the prosecution 's case .This habit of reporting lurid allegations but ignoring the cross examination which discredited them became a distinct trend throughout Jackson 's trial .In an April 2005 interview with Matt Drudge , Fox columnist Roger Friedman explained , \" What 's not reported is that the cross examination of these witnesses is usually fatal to them . \"He added that whenever anybody said anything salacious or dramatic about Jackson , the media ' went running outside to report on it ' and missed the subsequent cross examination .Drudge agreed , adding , \" You 're not hearing how witness after witness is disintegrating on the stand .There is not one witness , at least lately , that has n't admitted to perjuring themselves in previous proceedings either in this case or in some other case .\" This alarming trend of ignoring cross examination was perhaps most apparent in the media 's coverage of Kiki Fournier 's testimony .Under direct examination by the prosecution , Fournier - a Neverland housekeeper - testified that when at Neverland children often became unruly and she had sometimes seen children so hyperactive that they could , feasibly , have been intoxicated .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.7831"}

{"text": "As far as Tatiana 's story , I read her book on Jetzi and to me it sounded like an obsessed fan in my opinion and I 'm sure that 's how she came across to Michael Jackson .She sure showed up at his funeral service though so it sounds as though she was another bitter person that could n't accept that there was no relationship with Michael Jackson .Feldman felt like Jackson did n't care if Feldman was killed or something to that overly dramatic effect .However , Jackson secured a bus for his entire family and they left NYC with Feldman complaining the entire trip about it .Once they dropped him off at his destination , Jackson just ended the friendship .I 'm glad you 've made a transcript of Bashir 's filth ( it should be used as evidence of his lies ) but it is so abominable a text that I could n't make it to the end .The number of lies here is suffocating which makes it almost impossible to read .At least I could n't and after the initial looking had to get out to breathe in some fresh air - and so went over to your analysis instead .The reason why this documentary is so outrageous is because it was probably made in cooperation with Victor Gutierrez .When I am home today I'lll look for an article saying that Bashir made his second documentary about Michael together with Gutierrez .He was one of his three or four assistants paid for by ABC , however the end result turned out so filthy and tabloid - looking that even ABC had to sweep it under the rug , as you said .While I am looking for that article could you check the titles please to see whether Gutierrez is mentioned there ?Another piece I want to contribute to your post is an answer to your question to Adrian McManus : \" Have you no shame , Adrian ?How low can you go ?The answer is that Adrian McManus not only appropriated a drawing made by Michael Jackson but she could go as low as robbing of money two small children placed in her custody !This incredible fact is often overlooked but it was raised by Thomas Mesereau during her cross - examination where she had to admit that she and her husband had indeed stolen money from the two children whom she was supposed to take care of .This , in my opinion , is even more damaging than the drawing which she claims she found in a wastepaper basket - if this woman was capable of stealing from children she was capable of anything ...I suggest you include this fact into your post .Excerpt from her cross - examination by Thomas Mesereau : . 3 Q.

{"text": "It should be noted that this interviewer know that previous investigation had been done for the possibility of sexual abuse .The attempt of this interview was to possibly establish a pattern of what would typically seen in an adult sexual offender who would manipulate children into sexualized situations .This evaluator does work consistently with sexual offenders and does attempt to establish , through interview , the actual patterning of a sexual offender known as a motive for operation .Consultation / Extended Interview .There were only very slight differences between the interviews .If one pays special attention to Jerry 's reported behavior , it will be found that Jerry engaged in behavior that can be considered indicative of most people termed as \" ( male ) coach \" .It appears that Mr. Sandusky engaged in a routine of behavior that has been repeated countless times over his history as a coach .This immediately caused appropriate concern about whether or not a sexual victimization occurred which then puts all of the other activities into a framework which could have been used to groom a child for sexual behavior .The reported wrestling was more indicative of horseplay , consistent with the developmental behavior of a young adolescent .What usually happens in these events is that the adult watches the child disrobe and uses that to elicit sexual arousal within themselves .It was explicitly related in all three interviews that Mr. Sandusky did not evident sexual arousal in any way through various situations .If Mr. Sandusky was going to use the situation for his own sexual gratification would be expected to have engaged in such activity .Through previous interviews it was apparent that there had been another coach present within the locker room / shower facility .An adult sexual offender , at all costs , attempt to do such activities within private areas .The behavior exhibited by Mr. Sandusky is directly consistent with what can be seen as an expected daily routine of being a football coach .This evaluator spoke to various coaches from high school and college football teams and asked about their locker room behavior .Through verbal reports from these coaches it is not uncommon for them to shower with players .This appears to be a widespread acceptable situation , and it appears that Mr. Sandusky followed through with patterning that he has probably done without thought for many years .I believe the mistake that was made was that Mr. Sandusky did not take into account the pre - adolescent age of this boy and the level of sexual development that he was at .There is usually ongoing touches that do not necessarily have to be reciprocated .Prolonged touches are what are usually used to elicit some sort of sexual arousal sequence .Again , if Mr. Sandusky was using this child for sexual arousal , direct visual stimulation is what some adult sexual offenders utilize , again this is not consistent .There are several other inconsistencies that follow throughout the report but at the present time , this evaluator does not feel that it is necessary to go into line by line statements .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.796974"}

Tom Corbett uttered a final thought .It was the last thing the board members heard before being asked if anyone objected to relieving Paterno of a coaching job he 'd held for 61 years .With that , Paterno was fired Nov. 9 in a late - night move that led to student riots in State College and boiling animosity toward the board by alumni .What motivated Corbett to make such a strong statement in the final moment before the Board of Trustees voted to terminate Paterno after 61 years at Penn State ?Keep reading .Current Pennslyvania Governor Tom Corbett officially learned of allegations of child sexual abuse against Jerry Sandusky in March 2009 .As Attorney General of the state at the time , Corbett assigned a single state trooper to investigate the allegations - though that law officer was not authorized to bring charges against Sandusky because Corbett decided not to assign an agent from his office to directly supervise the investigation .When Corbett became governor two years later the children 's charity Sandusky had founded in 1977 , The Second Mile , had not officially been notified by Corbett or anyone in law enforcement that its founder was being investigated on multiple allegations of child rape .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.225006"}
