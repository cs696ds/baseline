{"text": "\" Facebook is broken , on purpose , in order to extract more money from users , \" wrote Ryan Holiday , a PR strategist , in that post .Holiday thinks that the broken - ness is meant to drive brands to use promoted posts , which were introduced in May.To promote a post , page owners pay a dollar amount ( anywhere from five dollars to thousands of dollars ) to increase the reach of a post beyond the number of people who might see it organically .And there 's value in this ; if your news feed was an equal - opportunity space , it would be at this point nothing but offers for FarmVille produce and a thousand status updates on everyone 's new babies .Should that happen , your interest in checking the service might wane .Facebook does n't show you everything every person or brand you subscribe to says , and it 's always been that way .The lower traffic for posts from fan pages are just part of keeping the feed balanced and interesting ( \" engaging , \" in marketing - speak ) , Facebook says .In a statement sent to Ars , Facebook says that \" all content should be as engaging as the posts you see from friends and family .\" But how does the company square that with the sly offering of the opportunity to override the irrelevance or poor quality of a post with dollar bills ?Poor posts will cost you .Philip Zigoris , a Facebook ads engineer , addressed some of these questions in a blog post last Thursday , but he did n't touch on the sudden drop in traffic from fan pages - the aspect of this story that makes post promotion look the most like a money grab .He did make the point that promoting posts does n't automatically blast them to everyone 's news feed .\" We constantly monitor signals from people in news feed , \" wrote Zigoris .Signals include likes or comments as well as \" hide this post \" clicks or reports of spam .\" For posts that you see are getting a lot of responses , you can promote them to extend your reach to more news feeds , \" Zigoris added .A popular post that gets paid promotion can score a huge reach because its quality has been proven , somewhat , by natural selection .The goal is to make sure that even promoted posts feel relevant and interesting to read .Until recently , brand pages have been governed only by the same newsfeed - grooming rules that are applied to one 's Facebook friends .Facebook would n't answer our specific questions about brands and traffic , but it does seem clear that posts from brands have grown significantly in the last couple of years and might be in need of some pruning .While the number of brand \" likes \" by a single user may not outweigh their number of friends , brands have become far more regular posters than individuals , and they have a much broader reach .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.091515"}

{"text": "Contact .PR must abide by and overcome search restrictions on native advertising .Developments in the still inchoate world of native advertising have rendered Google 's policies problematic .Initially well - intentioned , Google 's heels - dug - in position could result in keeping people from finding the relevant , valuable content they 're looking for .Google 's position has been clear for years : Content that has been paid for needs to be nofollowed to keep it from passing PageRank .Articles and posts that violate the policy could lead Google to penalize the site .Google reinforced the policy just last month , though , updating its official policy document to include native advertising ( along with guest - posting campaigns ) .Google 's intentions are certainly noble .In a video posted in May , Google 's anti - webspam point man Matt Cutts points out that a lot of online advertorials are n't adequately disclosed , tricking readers into thinking they 've found original content produced by the site 's writers .( In the video , Cutts simply defines native advertising this way : \" Someone gave you some money rather than you writing about this naturally because you thought it was interesting or because you wanted to . \" ) Beyond disclosure , though , native advertising containing links are also violations simply because they were paid for .The idea , Cutts says , is that links in editorial content are votes for the linked material .Paying for those links makes the playing field uneven .Therefore , if links are paid for , those links should not flow PageRank .That makes sense for the kinds of advertorials that link back to the brand .But the evolving nature of native advertising ( aka \" sponsored content \" ) has made it clear that the mere act of paying to have an article placed does inherently diminish its value .Edelman threw down the gauntlet earlier this month with the release of its native advertising manifesto .Written by chief content strategist Steve Rubel , the document outlines the ethical rules under which Edelman will play .In his keynote speech at IABC 's World Conference in New York last month , CEO Richard Edelman said the PR industry had an obligation to ensure native advertising 's potential was n't spoiled by advertisers trying to sell stuff .He elaborated in his July 16 blog post introducing the report : .The PR industry will have journalistic sensibility on what makes a good story and how it fits into the earned stream , then to decide whether it merits further promotion .PR professionals have deep roots in social conversations , understanding the needs of communities .PR folks appreciate the need for unique angles for each publication , with speed and agility to fit into bigger stories .The Edelman manifesto also requires sponsored content primarily to \" amplify that which is owned and/or earned media - not to replace it . \"In other words , a discussion that has been started through traditional means can be enhanced or expanded with paid content .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.10476"}

{"text": "The social media giant announced the new feature for advertisers on Monday in an \" Introducing Sponsored Stories \" video posted on its website .Facebook did not say in the video when the Sponsored Stories ability for companies would go into effect , but it is highly likely that advertisers will take this feature .Facebook has been testing the ad unit for a few months and says it has resulted in brand lift and increased engagement , ad recall , and likeliness to be recommended to friends for the organizations that tried it .HOW DOES IT WORK : When a user checks in to a claimed Place , Likes a Page , or shares content to the news feed from an application that has paid for Sponsored Stories , that activity may appear as an advertisement to their friends .Similar to social context ads and Ads for Applications that Facebook launched this year , Sponsored Stories increases the relevance of advertisements to users by displaying a recommendation from one of their friends .Seeing that a friend has checked in at Starbucks is a much more compelling reason to visit than a standard advertisement telling a user to go get a coffee .Jim Squires of Facebook Product Marketing says , \" all privacy settings are honored , \" so the ads will only be visible to those who can see the original post they draw from .This means users will only see Sponsored Stories by their friends who have n't restricted them from viewing their shared content .Advertisers can overlay any of Facebook 's standard demographic targeting parameters to further refine who sees a Sponsored Story .Normal privacy settings apply , so a friend who does not receive your updates will not get ads with your information , and a friend not included in your news feed will not appear in your Sponsored Stories .Sponsored stories will include the original users ' comment attached with the activity , so others will be able to flag negative brand references - for example , if someone re - posts an article with the comment , \" This is the dumbest thing I 've ever read .\" Page post Sponsored Stories are more straightforward .Pages can buy greater distribution for their latest news feed update , ensuring an audience for a particularly important link or announcement .Users who Like the Page will see the post in Sponsored Stories without having to Like it or take any other action .Sponsored Stories co - opt a user 's actions , voice , and identity to create ads that resonate with their friends .While Twitter has diluted its content stream with promoted tweets in order to make money , Facebook may have found a significant new revenue stream without selling out the beloved news feed .( Twitter is projecting $ 150 Million in ad revenues for 2011 ) .According to the video from Facebook , initial case studies showed improvements in brand lift , ad recall , and likeliness to recommend to a friend . \" Anything that lets brands amplify social action or word - of - mouth is a great thing , \" BuddyMedia CEO Mike Lazerow commented .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.355217"}
{"text": "One of these major issues that they 're dealing with right now ( thus this blog post ) is the subject of advertorials .Certainly I do n't have access to how they actually identify advertorials , but let 's examine the likelihood of how they do it .What we know is that Google has to work in identifying advertorials into their algorithm - or one of the \" checks \" or \" processes \" that they run from time to time to deal with what I would call \" advertorial spam \" .It just simply is not \" scaleable \" to identify advertorials solely based on spam reports that they receive from users or manually review websites .So , what Google does is identify the typical \" footprint \" of advertorials across the board , and then narrow them down to a specific list of URLs that are most likely advertorials .At that point , how they deal with them is anyone 's guess .Whether or not Google has someone actually manually review those URLs and then decide to give the site that 's benefiting from the advertorial a manual link warning is also anyone 's guess .But my suspicion is that Google 's filter first identifies the sites and then someone works off a list of some sort .So how could Google identify the footprint of advertorials ?Luckily , I have personally dealt with manual link warnings by Google ( this is something I specialize in ) , and have seen the actual URLs that Google has given us as examples : which were advertorials .So I know exactly what Google is identifying as an advertorial because they have given me specific URLs as examples .Keep in mind that Google has absolutely NO WAY to determine whether or not the website owner was paid or compensated in any way for the advertorial .But , nonetheless , Google hands out manual link warnings and manual penalties for these advertorials .Based on my experience , these are tell - tale signs of advertorials : the kind of web pages that will get your website penalized in the Google search results , even if no money or compensation changed hands for the link on the page .Typically several of these signs indicate that it 's an advertorial : . - The web page contains an article , typically several paragraphs of text .- The page has one outgoing link , towards the bottom of the page .If an article contains several paragraphs , it is not \" natural \" to only have one outgoing link at the bottom of the page .What IS natural is to link out a few times to trusted sites in the middle of the article , where the link is in the middle of a sentence .- That one outgoing link is close to , or at the end of a promotional - type sentence .This is where it gets interesting .I believe that Google has the ability to identify copy that 's promotional in nature .Certainly phrases like \" sponsored by \" or \" provided by \" would be good candidates here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.69877"}

{"text": "The two main areas that I would suggest you review when it comes to thinking about socialising of your blog 's content are : . which social networks ?developing a rhythm of sharing .Which Social Networks ?The choice before us as bloggers as to which social networks to engage in can feel a little overwhelming .As a result I see bloggers falling into numerous traps .Some feel so overwhelmed that they opt out altogether and do n't engage in any social media .Others feel the need to engage in every social network and end up either burning themselves out or engaging so much on social that their blogging suffers .Others still engage widely on lots of social media sites but spread themselves so thin that they do n't do it very well .There 's no blueprint or formula for choosing which social media to engage in but a few questions come to mind to help you make this decision : .How much Time do you Have ?If you 're time - poor , choose one network to focus on primarily , but secure accounts for other networks so that if / when you do want to engage on them you 're ready to go .If you do choose one network to engage on primarily you might also want to consider more automated sharing of your content on the other networks .For example if you choose Facebook as your primary social network , you could set up an RSS to Twitter tool that automatically tweets links to new posts on your Twitter account any time you publish .While these automated tools do n't help you build relationships with Twitter followers , they at least get your content out there and you will find some followers appreciate them .Example : Seth Godin 's Twitter Account is perhaps the best example of this .He follows nobody and every tweet he does is simply an update from his blog .While not engaging , every update is retweeted many times and his account is followed by over 376,000 people .Seth 's Facebook page does the same thing .This is exactly what I did on the dPS Twitter account for more than two years before I started using that Twitter account in a more strategic way .While I knew I could use the account better , by doing the automated Tweets I did drive traffic and actually saw our Twitter numbers increase so that when I stated to use the account more intentionally , we already had a network .If you have more time on your hands , you can of course choose to engage in more social networks .Just do n't overcommit and end up spreading yourself too thin !What Social Networks are Relevant to Your Readers ?Get 10 successful bloggers from different niches in a room and ask them which social networks are best for driving traffic to their blogs , and you 'll get a different answer from each one as to where their readers hang out in greatest numbers .My own two blogs are quite different .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.193634"}
{"text": "For example , when organic reach is very close to fan reach , it usually means that people can not be exposed to your content if they are not already fans .This could be the consequence of a lack of proper communication about your Fan Page on your other marketing channels .If you have a website , a blog and a newsletter and there is very little difference between your organic and fan reach results , it probably means that you are not attracting a new non - fan audience to your content .If this is your case , try to better promote your Page on other channels and you should see your organic reach going up .# 3 : Engagement .This includes liking , commenting and sharing and people who 've viewed your video or clicked on your links and photos .And it also includes people who 've clicked on a commenter 's name , liked a comment , clicked on your Page name and even gave negative feedback by reporting your post .Engaged users are people who have clicked on this content from anywhere .It 's the most important metric to know after your reach metric .Reach tells you how many people have potentially seen your content ; engagement is the number of people who have interacted with your content .Where to find your engagement metrics .To see the engagement metric for each post , go to your Insights at the same place where you looked at your organic reach .The number of people who engaged with your content is right there in the \" Engaged Users \" column .The Engaged Users metric is easy to see on your Facebook Insights page .Why your engagement metrics are important to know .It 's not enough for your updates to be viewed by a lot of people .You need to make sure that the content you offer your audience triggers some kind of interest .And engagement is the only measurable sign of interest .When measuring engagement , do not focus on the raw number you see in your Insights .The only way to really understand that metric and compare posts is to look at the number of engaged people and the number of people reached for the post in question .The only way to compare a post engagement metric with your other posts is to create a percentage .This gives you a number that you can use to benchmark the performance of each of your posts .Use this formula for each post to compare the performance of one post against another .This formula helps you understand your results .If you rely solely on the number of engaged users , you 'll never know if good engagement on a specific post is due to the quality of your content , or if it was simply shown to more people .This gives you a percentage that takes the exposure of the post into account and allows the comparison between posts .When you click on the \" People Talking About This \" number for each post , you see a breakdown of the type of action made on each post .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.466934"}

{"text": "Consider that the Internet Advertising Bureau ( IAB ) reported that UK online advertising spending in 2011 was 14 % higher than in 2010 .In the U.S. , eMarketer says online spending will grow by a staggering 23 % in 2012 , far outstripping the total media ad spending forecast of 6.7 % in 2012 .To a large extent , brands are investing in digital advertising based on the results of research showing that online ad campaigns can increase both online and retail sales in a very cost - effective manner .Let 's take , for example , the results of almost 100 comScore studies that measured the impact of FMCG online ad campaigns on retail ( i.e. in - store ) sales .These show that five out of every six FMCG online campaign generated a positive offline sales lift , with a median in - store sales lift of 21 % among households exposed to the digital advertising campaigns compared to households not exposed to the campaigns .As the industry continues to study digital advertising and we learn more about how online advertising works , there 's been an increasing focus on what I believe to be an essential and foundational part of effective digital media , and one that can generate even stronger sales results .That is , the measurement and validation of the accurate delivery of digital campaigns .I find this aspect of digital advertising to be critical because , if executed correctly , it can allow for even more precise and efficient targeting of ads than is possible with traditional media .Let 's take a closer look at why this is true .During the early days of digital advertising , it was assumed that display campaigns were generally delivered on target .After all , this was part of the great promise of the Internet as an advertising channel .As branding dollars began to move online , however , advertisers sought third - party validation of their campaign delivery .They wanted answers to critical campaign delivery questions , such as : Are my ads reaching the intended demographic and geographic segments ?Are my R / F levels in line with my buying guidelines ?Many advertisers were surprised to learn that , because of the way targeted ads are delivered online , their campaigns were often not reaching their target to the extent they believed .There is one main culprit for this , and that is , the cookie .The cookie is a piece of computer code that is placed on a computer 's browser when the user visits a particular website or performs a certain online activity ( e.g. configuring a new car or providing demographic information , etc . ) .Cookies are also deposited each time a computer receives an ad as part of a specific campaign .The cookie uniquely identifies the computer and browser .In digital ad targeting , the cookie is used by ad servers in an attempt to identify the demographic or behavioral characteristics of the individual using the computer and the number of times the ad server should deliver an ad impression to each computer it sees .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.62395"}

{"text": "What I 'm going to outline in the remainder of this article are three steps that you can take to get the momentum you need to see quick results from your home based business .The by - product of this information will be that you can share it with your recruits or affiliates to help them see the results they need to see right away .Set A Schedule And Stick To It .The first way to generate early momentum in your home based business is to commit to a schedule .In order to plan out your schedule , you will first need to do a self - analysis in terms of how it is that you spend your time everyday .This will require you to sit down and list your daily activities on a sheet of paper .Make sure to take every activity and chore into account so that you can get a realistic view of what you 're working with .If you work at your business 5 days a week than you will need between 3 - 4 hours a day to devote to your internet business .If you choose to work 6 days a week than you will need to put in at least 3 hours a day .The point is that without giving serious consideration to your schedule your results will be scattered if any to say the least .Avoid Overwhelming Yourself .A huge trap that most individuals fall into right away is the trap of trying to do too many things right out of the gate .As the old saying goes : \" Rome was not built in a day \" , and the same goes for your home based business .It 's understandable that you want to start generating income as fast as possible from your home based business .However it 's a fact that if you try to rush the process , you will more than likely make mistakes that will only set you back and eat up your time .It 's better to do things right the first time .Do n't Expect Perfection .If there is one thing that keeps more people from ever attempting to reach their profit potential online , it 's the false expectation that everything has to be perfect .You can create the best product , program or service anyone has ever seen , but the true fact of the matter is that a large majority of the people that use it , wo n't use it properly to begin with .Some people will follow your instructions to the tee , others will pick and choose what it is they want to use , and the remainder will more than likely not even look through your offer once or more than once .So save yourself the anxiety of trying to be perfect and commit to becoming as successful as you can be by doing what you have to do today in order to enjoy the lifestyle you wish to live tomorrow .Once your downline representatives and affiliates begin to experience some favorable results , your home based business will begin to take on a life of it 's own and all you 'll need to do is maintain that momentum for greater success .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.53317"}
{"text": "The BGH follows the example of other national courts , which also referred similar questions to the ECJ .The claimant owns a trade mark registration for \" PCB - POOL \" and the defendant used the sign ' pcb ' as an ' AdWord'/keyword for its website .This led to the result that the search term \" PCB - pool , when typed into a search engine , retrieved sponsored links that referred to the defendant 's website .The court of appeal , the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart , had agreed with the claimant and ruled that the use of a trade mark as a keyword/'AdWord ' in this case did constitute trade mark infringement .In this case the BGH overturned the decision of the Higher Regional Court of Stuttgart and denied trade mark infringement .In a first step , the BGH established that the relevant specalist consumers would understand the acronym \" pbc \" as short for \" printed circuit board \" .Such descriptive use was permissible and could not constitute trade mark infringement .A referral of the ECJ was not necessary .Comment : It appears noteworthy that the defendant only purchased \" pcb \" as a keyword and not \" PCB - pool \" .The matter would have perhaps decided differently if PCB - pool has been used .The IPKat will scrutinise the actual decision but ca n't really find much fault here but wonders what do the readers think ?Whilst company names are protected under the German trade mark act , it is important to note that this protection is not based on harmonised European law but a German quirk .The claimant in the second case ( I ZR 139/07 ) was also the claimant in the third case .The defendant had designated the claimant 's company name \" Beta Layout \" as an ' AdWord ' .The court of appeal , the Higher Regional Court of Dusseldorf , had decided that this use did not infringe the claimant 's company name .The Dusseldorf court ruled that there was no likelihood of confusion because users of search engines knew how to distinguish between advertisement and actual search results .The BGH confirmed the decision of the Higher Regional Court of Dusseldorf .The internet user would not assume that the sponsored link , which was visually separated from the search results , originated from the claimant .The BGH could not find any fault in this finding of facts .Given that the legal protection of company names was not based on harmonised European law , the BGH decided that this matter did not have to be referred to the ECJ for a decision .Comment : The protection of company names in the trade mark act is a German quirk .However , the IPKat wonders why company names should ( potentially ) be treated differently to trade marks .This decision also seems to indicate the the BGH is of the view that in cases where the search engine users can clearly distinguish between sponsored links and actual search results , the use of a company name ( ... and a trade mark ? ! ) should per se be permissible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.015175"}
