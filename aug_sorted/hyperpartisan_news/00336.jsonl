{"text": "One person who seems to know about things like this stated that if Obama is disqualified after the EV votes and before the inauguration , the current Vice President ( Cheney ) would become the acting president until such time as a new president is elected .On the other hand , if Obama is disqualified before the EC votes , the electors would then be free to vote for some other candidate , possibly Biden or even someone else proposed by the party .I ca n't swear to this !I 'm just relaying what I have read ... and it 's probably no help at all ... .Between November 4 ( the popular vote election ) and December 15 ( when the electors gather in the 50 state capitals ) , there is constitutionally no president elect .If someone dies , or suffers a major scandal , in this interval , the electors will vote however they like .Each state has its own set of laws governing whether the electors are bound , and if so , under what conditions .Many of these states have laws saying what happens if the presumed winner dies ( typically they give his party the right to choose a replacement ) .However , every elector is free to vote how they wish if they do n't mind facing the penalty !Even if a state gave an elector a prison sentence , that would n't invalidate their vote .Between December 15 and January 6 ( the date that the votes are formally counted in a joint session of Congress ) , it is ambiguous in federal law whether Obama is technically the \" president elect \" .If he is , and he were to die or be disqualified , Congress might claim that the 20th Amendment ( cited by Will above ) is now active , and that Biden receives all of Obama 's votes .If Congress chose this route , the Supreme Court would probably have to issue a verdict as to whether Obama is truly \" President Elect \" during this interval .Alternatively , the Congress could simply count the votes on January 6 as if Obama were alive and qualified ; at that point Obama would become president - elect and Biden vice - president elect .Next , Congress would declare Obama disqualified ( by reason of death , or resignation , or disqualification , or whatever ) ; at that point Biden would be promoted to President Elect by the 20th Amendment .This route avoids the need to involve the Supreme Court , and is completely constitutional .Between January 6 and January 20 , Obama will be President Elect , and if he were to die or be disqualified the 20th Amendment would govern , and Biden would become president on January 20 .Papabile - The suit that the Supreme Court might examine claims that neither Obama nor McCain ( nor some obscure 3rd party candidate who was definitely a foreigner ) meets the qualification of \" natural born .\" This is an attempt to get the SC to define exactly what is meant by this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.57032"}

Bush and records related to terrorism , including the Khobar Towers bombing in 1996 .The archives said other topics would include British Prime Minister Tony Blair , disability rights and documents from several presidential speechwriters .The former secretary of state 's potential White House campaign has sparked interest in memos and records from her husband 's administration during the 1990s along with her work in public service .Clinton , a former New York senator , is the leading Democratic contender to succeed President Barack Obama should she seek the presidency again .A first wave of documents released in February provided insight into the Clinton administration 's concern over the failed health care overhaul plan , which Hillary Clinton helped lead , and showed how advisers to the first lady tried to shape her public image .On Friday , paper 's from a top Clinton adviser during the health care effort will be released that could offer more insights into that period .The papers may also reveal details on the twilight of the Clinton administration , as Gore sought the presidency but ultimately lost to Bush despite winning the popular vote .The records could provide a behind - the - scenes look at how the White House viewed the recount saga in Florida and the abbreviated transition that took place before Bush 's inauguration .Another topic of interest will involve records related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy .Congress passed the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 , which established an assassination records review board during the Clinton administration to carry out release of records .About 5 million pages of documents from the Kennedy assassination have been released thus far and all records are to be released by 2017 , with some exceptions .The Clinton records were previously withheld by the National Archives because they were exempt from disclosure under restrictions related to appointments to federal office and confidential advice among the president and his advisers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.91442"}

{"text": "little gal , thanks for posting that link .This could get more interesting than anyone expects .Apparrently , twenty - four states have laws to punish faithless electors .[ 1 ] While no faithless elector has ever been punished , the constitutionality of state pledge laws was brought before the Supreme Court in 1952 ( Ray v. Blair , 343 U.S. 214 ) .The court ruled in favor of the state 's right to require electors to pledge to vote for their party 's nominee , as well as to remove electors who refuse to pledge .Once the elector has voted , their vote can only be changed in states such as Michigan and Minnesota , where votes other than those pledged are rendered invalid .However , in all twenty - four states , a faithless elector may only be punished after he or she votes .The Supreme Court ruled that electors are acting as a function of the state , not the federal government , and therefore states have the right to govern electors .This is because all electors are elected via state elections on Election Day and meet in their respective state capitals which is usually the third Monday after the second Wednesday in December .The votes are then delivered to Congress which then tallys the votes .The constitutionality of state laws punishing electors for actually casting a faithless vote , rather than refusing to pledge , has never been decided by the Supreme Court .To date , faithless electors have never changed the otherwise expected outcome of the election .No faithless elector has ever been punished or charged with a crime . 1 )The electors of some states are free to vote for whomever they please . 2 )The electors of other states are bound by law to vote for particular candidates as determined by the vote in that state .3 ) Should an illegible person be elected , by the Electoral College , to the office of the presidency , he would be barred by Article II of the Constitution from taking office .4 ) HOWEVER , enforcing that requirement requires a lawsuit brought by an individual who has standing to enforce the provisions of Article II .Standing is a somewhat complex and amorphous legal doctrine , but the principle essentially amounts to the fact that a person must have been personally injured by a violation of the law and the law must be able to provide him with some tangible remedy to correct that injury .5 )In practice , it is extremely unlikely that any person would be found to have standing to bring a lawsuit enforcing Article II .If the person elected were quite clearly ineligible ( were , say , 20 years old ) , it is possible that the standing doctrines might be tweaked if an attractive enough litigant were to come forward .Obama is only arguably ineligible if every possible law is read in the manner most unfavorable to him .Nothing whatsoever can invalidate the vote of the electors when they meet in the Eletoral College .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.27457"}

{"text": "120 ] .In the Middle East , Bush began a new approach to the peace process , the so - called Annapolis process , which attempts to encourage Israeli and Palestinian leaders to agree on the outlines of a peace accord .Although both sides cite some success in these discussions , critics believe the talks have unduly ignored Hamas , which has been labeled as a terrorist organization , despite the fact that it holds an enormous amount of political power in the region .[120 ] Obama had not specified what his approach would be , although it was considered likely that he would appoint a high - level Middle East envoy , in part to free his Secretary of State so that other matters can also be addressed .[120 ] Hamas expressed a willingness to talk to Obama , who has said that he will reciprocate only if it renounces terrorism , recognizes Israel 's right to exist , and agrees to abide by past agreements .[121 ] The Hamas leader in Gaza , Ismail Haniyeh , has said the Hamas government would accept a Palestinian state that followed the Green Line and would offer Israel a long - term truce if Israel recognises the Palestinians ' national rights .[122 ] .During his second term , Bush pursued an agreement with North Korea to end its nuclear weapons programs .To prevent a collapse in the process , Bush agreed to remove North Korea from the State Department 's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism , which Obama supported .[120 ] Obama has criticized Bush for taking so long to engage with North Korea , and has indicated that he would be eager to engage in a more proactive diplomatic effort to reach an agreement .A senior North Korean official recently [ when ? ] told reporters that \" we are ready to deal \" with the incoming Obama administration .[120 ] .Obama also deliberated on how to deal with Iran .Outgoing Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had assembled a coalition of six states - the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Russia , China , and the United States - to confront Iran .[120 ] While the group won approval from the United Nations , Iran largely ignored its demands .While Obama had previously advocated carefully planned direct talks with Iran , he was now being seen as likely to build on the current coalition to broker an agreement with Iran .[120 ] .In addition , Obama formulated a policy to deal with the U.S. missile defense shield that was under construction in Poland .He discussed the matter with both Polish President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev .While his advisors were working on a missile shield policy , his position at that time was simply that one might be deployed if and when it has been \" proved to be workable \" .[ 123 ] .Obama also planned to revoke a series of executive orders enacted by Bush that would have the effect of overturning a practice that many critics have labeled as torture against \" detainees .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.03811"}
