{"text": "As someone who started his college career at a local community college , I am happy to hear that President Obama is also investing in community colleges and career training programs .Plus , he does n't want to cut funding from PBS and fire \" Big Bird \" like Romney does !President Obama renewed Unemployment Benefits twice .As someone who was unemployed for almost one full year , this definitely helped me and my family out .Not only that , a program called \" Keep Your Home California \" which was created because of the Obama Administration 's efforts to help people who lost their jobs to be able to keep their homes .This also directly helped me and my family out by helping us pay our mortgage bill while I was unemployed for 9 months .To those who say that President Obama did not keep all his promises , such as not closing Gitmo .If we as American Muslims really want change in the way that we are seen and perceived in our own country , then we need to step up and get involved in the US political system .We always complain about how Israel can \" get away with anything \" and the US supports Israel no matter what .Let me explain briefly why this is .The American Jewish community has been involved in the affairs of the United States for well over 100 years ( the ZOA was established in 1897 ) .Not only that , but American Jews have gone into every major field of influence ( Media , Politics , Law , Education , etc . ) and became leaders in their respective fields .This is not something to condemn , but to applaud .They spread their influence and diversified their skills .We American Muslims on the other hand are disproportionally involved in Medicine , Computer Science and Engineering , and to top it off , we do not donate any money to political campaigns or lobbyists like other minority groups do .Then we complain because we voted once or twice , forwarded some emails and donated $ 20 for Obama 's campaign and then expect the whole world to change in our favor !In conclusion , if you want to give up on Obama because you feel that he disappointed you , then do n't vote for Obama .But keep in mind that by not voting or voting for a Third Party Candidate for President instead is basically giving your vote to Romney .Mitt will not only take your free vote , but he will not do anything at all to help American Muslims out .Romney 's foreign policy team is made up of Islamophobes , Pro - Military Extremists and War Hawks who are just waiting to attack Iran ( by the way the government of Israel wants Romney to win as well because they felt Obama was too tough on them ) .He ended water - boarding torture which was initiated by G.W.
