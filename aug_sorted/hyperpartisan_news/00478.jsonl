'We researched raw feeding , reading about the BARF model ( Biologically Appropriate Raw Food ) and the Prey Model .BARF includes vegetables and fruits and the Prey Model does not .We went with the Prey Model .However ... .It turns out that feeding a dog raw animal matter is n't cheap .We figured we were spending about $ 2.50 a day or $ 75 a month on food for her when she was eating kibble and eggs / meat / bones .How were we going to stay even close to that while feeding her high quality animal foods ?We all know how expensive grass - fed meats are , and sometimes getting organ meats from grocery stores is impossible .He 's a local rancher who sells meat for pets from beef , alpaca , pork , lamb , bison , and llama .Prices for all parts of those animals range from $ 1.50/lb to $ 3.45/lb and hover around the $ 2.50/lb range .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.881226"}
{"text": "What would I have learned from her ?I wonder ... .My maternal grandmother , Helen Nordgren Moline , had a very short life , but she left us with a mystery .Well , several mysteries .She was killed by a hit and run driver as she stood on a corner in Seattle in September of 1929 .At the time , she was already living away from her husband , two adopted children and three biological daughters .In 1930 Grandpa Moline and the three girls are living with another young woman in the house , presumably the adopted daughter .But where was the adopted son Donald Moline ?And , why two adopted children when they had three girls ?Did Grandpa want a boy so bad to carry on his name that he wanted Grandma to keep having babies till she ' gave him one ' , and when she had my mother , the youngest and another girl , did they decide to adopt ?There are plenty more people for favorites in Jim 's family too : .Henry Skaggs , one of the \" long hunters \" who ( I was told ) had an unnatural relationship with his granddaughters .He 's not my favorites because of that , just the long hunter part because he was one of the pioneers who went into Kentucky with men such as Daniel Boone .My husband Jim is a descendant of Henry Skaggs through Henry 's marriage to Susan Scott .Their daughter Nancy Skaggs married Peter DeSpain .Of that union a son , John DeSpain married ( 3 ) Mariah Perkins .John and Mariah 's daughter Mary Elizabeth DeSpain married John W. Whitmore , a Medal of Honor recipient in the Civil War .The DeSpain and Whitmore families settled in Des Moines County near Pleasant Grove , Iowa .Peter DeSpain and Nancy Skaggs had 19 children .I know she probably had no choice , but I sure admire that woman !If you read the title of this article , it might be a bit misleading in that I was able to get the photo below with just Google .I did use SnagIt ( which I LOVE ! ) too to capture the image .I am not real adept at using Google with SnagIt , so that 's why you see that silly magnifying glass thing in the picture .Google presents the opportunity by supplying the street view ; SnagIt makes it easy to capture .No doubt there are other ways .My Grandpa Elvin \" Al \" and Grandma Lillian \" Eppy \" ( Epstein ) Moline lived on the second floor in this building probably from the 1950 's to the late ' 60 's .The address is 1105 Spring Street , Seattle , WA .I think it 's called the Decatur Condos now .They had the apartment at the bottom of the photo , which included the small balcony .Grandma was a sun worshiper , so no doubt she was delighted to have a way to get outside .Their apartment was a corner one , so the three windows from left to right shows the size of their one bedroom abode .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.95573"}
