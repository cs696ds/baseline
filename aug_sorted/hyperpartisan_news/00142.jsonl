{"text": "Sen. Sessions can make the difference in prison reform ( opinion from Wade Henderson and Richard Cohen ) .U.S. Sen .Jeff Sessions has the opportunity to once again be a key leader in reforming our criminal justice system for the better , serving both his home state of Alabama as well as the entire nation .Sessions has a lead role on the Senate Judiciary Committee , which is considering the most important legislative overhaul to our criminal justice system in years .The committee is working right now to merge three bipartisan proposals that would reform how our nation 's criminal sentences are enforced , leading to a more ethical , leaner , and more effective prison system .In a congressional environment that has never been more polarized , an unprecedented bipartisan consensus has lined up behind these bills .The last time the committee considered criminal justice reform legislation was in 2010 , when Sessions championed the Fair Sentencing Act , which addressed a counter - productive and discriminatory disparity in how people are punished for possessing crack cocaine .Crack and powder cocaine are two forms of the same drug , but crack is used more often by minorities and carried much harsher punishments .Since its passage , the Fair Sentencing Act has saved about a half billion dollars in unnecessary incarceration expenses while reducing unfair and discriminatory sentences for crack cocaine offenses .2014 is as propitious a time as ever for Sessions to continue his leadership role .Since the last time the senator addressed this issue , support in Alabama for criminal justice reform has grown even stronger .Both the conservative Alabama Policy Institute and the NAACP have endorsed similar sentencing reforms for Alabama state prisons .So have Democratic and Republican officials across the state .At a recent congressional briefing , Congressman Spencer Bachus ( R - AL ) called these problems in our justice system an \" embarrassment \" and compared them to slavery and apartheid in South Africa as a defining moral issue of the day .He noted how Communist China is four times our size , yet that repressive regime still imprisons fewer people than we do in the United States .He also pointed out that our prison population , now overwhelmingly black and Latino , was once more reflective of the racial makeup of the nation .These criminal justice reform bills offer the nation a justice system that is fairer , more affordable , and responsive to priorities of Democrats and Republicans alike .We encourage Sessions to continue his groundbreaking work .Alabama is behind him and so is the nation .Wade Henderson is the president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights , a coalition of more than 200 national civil and human rights organizations .Richard Cohen is the president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center , a nonprofit civil rights organization dedicated to fighting hate and bigotry , and to seeking justice for the most vulnerable members of society .Follow Us .\u00a9 2015 Alabama Media Group All rights reserved ( About Us ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.92921"}

Knight Foundation .I know many of you are noticing the increased attention our Community Engagement Coordinator , Jennifer Marley , has put on everything from social media to community events .For those of you interested in reviewing this data and the presentation , we are naturally curious about your observations .We are half way through this grant , and I 'd like to hear what 's on your mind .May 04 , 2011 .Charlottesville Tomorrow has been named as one of 3 finalists for the Charlottesville Business Innovation Council 's 2011 \" Community Award . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.20773"}
