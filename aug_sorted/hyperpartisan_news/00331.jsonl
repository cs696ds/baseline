{"text": "The bill 's leading advocate , Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D - Mass . , and other Congressional Democrats joined Obama for the announcement .Sen. Bernie Sanders , I - Vt . , told NECN he wholeheartedly supports a debtor 's ability to refinance their student loans and make the costs more manageable .He said lessening the interest payments would allow borrowers to spend their resources elsewhere , thus strengthening the middle class .\" We have just a terrible crisis , \" Sanders said , describing the level of student loan debt in the United States , which he said could easily turn families off of sending their children to college . \" As a nation , if we want to compete in the global economy , we need the best - educated workforce in the world .We need to encourage people to get that education , not discourage them .\"Sanders said he regularly hears stories from constituents with undergraduate degrees carrying $ 25 - 60,000 in debt , and ones with graduate degrees carrying twice that amount or more .However , Sanders acknowledged passing the refinancing legislation will be a tough fight , with Senate Republicans raising concerns over the cost to the government and over how that same legislation proposes new taxes on some high - income taxpayers .Shortly before President Obama signed the executive memorandum , Secretary of Education Arne Duncan told reporters the initiative 's price tag has not been determined .\" We actually do n't know the costs yet , \" Duncan said .\" We 'll figure that out on the back end .\" The AP reported Republican leaders in Congress have faulted Obama 's steps on loan repayments for failing to address the root cause of crippling debt loads : college costs that are too high .As a separate push from the refinancing legislation , Sen. Sanders has another proposal to bring down college costs .Sanders would like to expand programs that allow high school juniors and seniors to take college - level classes and earn credit that counts toward both high school and college graduation .His office explained in a news release that the approach reduces the cost and time necessary to complete a college degree .The bill is co - sponsored by several senators including Sen. Patrick Leahy , D - Vt . , Sen. Chris Murphy , D - Conn , and Sen. Jack Reed , D - R.I. , Sanders ' staff noted .As for recent grad Nathan Bacon , he told NECN he hopes his mechanical engineering degree helps him convert a paid internship into a full - time job at a Vermont manufacturer of cables for industrial , automotive , commercial vehicle , and military customers .Bacon said he 'll need to work hard to earn cash to afford to live and make those student loan payments for years to come .\" Unless I win the lottery , \" he chuckled .\" That 'd be cool ! \"Nearly 19 percent of people with student loans owe more than $ 50,000 , according to a report from the Federal Reserve , and that number is expected to rise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.67073"}

Bernie Sanders , I - Vt , says he 'll continue pushing for additional relief for indebted Americans .Monday , President Obama signed a memorandum that will expand an existing program allowing borrowers to spend no more than 10 percent of their monthly income on student loan payments .The White House said the move could provide relief for around 5-million Americans with student loan debt .Nearly 19 percent of people with student loans owe more than $ 50,000 , according to a report from the Federal Reserve , and that number is expected to rise .Take a look at which states ' residents have the most and least student debt .\" Americans now owe more on student loans than they do on credit cards , \" Obama said of the more than $ 1-trillion debt load for student loans in this country . \"And the outrage here is that they 're just doing what they 've been told they 're supposed to do . \"Nathan Bacon , who told New England Cable News he recently graduated from Norwich University in the central Vermont town of Northfield , said later this year , he 'll start paying off nearly $ 40,000 in student loan debt .\" I 'm signing away my life for the next , like , 15 - 20 years , \" Bacon said .\" People are profiting off of the fact I went to school .\" Expecting to pay $ 200 or more a month in student loan payments , Bacon said he worries about making ends meet with other costs , like rent , utilities , and food .\" I drive an old car , so any time I have to make a repair-- if it 's a $ 500 repair-- that 's something that 's going to put me on thin ice through my next paycheck , \" Bacon added .Obama also announced he is directing the government to renegotiate contracts with federal student loan servicers to encourage them to make it easier for borrowers to avoid defaulting on their loans , the Associated Press wrote .He asked the Treasury and Education departments to work with major tax preparers , including H&R Block and the makers of TurboTax , to increase awareness about tuition tax credits and flexible repayment options available to borrowers .\" It 's going to make progress , but not enough , \" Obama said .\" We need more .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.45642"}
