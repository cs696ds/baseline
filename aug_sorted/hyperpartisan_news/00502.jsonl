Meerwald last summer , were crushed and submerged by stormwaters .The new \" debris diverter \" will be installed near the north access ramp to deflect oncoming trees and other objects pulled downriver by floods and other weather events .\" The problem that we 've had traditionally has been the north corner , where the strong current hits first , \" said Kevin Bannon , executive director of the park commission .\" Our hope is that making an investment in that diverter piece will prevent a lot of that damage that we 're getting in that section . \" Trenton - based G.M.H. Associates of America bid successfully to cover maintenance and upgrades , including welding repairs , the diverter dock and two new dock sections , which cost $ 35,000 and $ 15,000 .Installed in 2002 for $ 1 million , the Waterfront Park docks were intended by the county and the state 's Department of Environmental Protection to provide access to the Delaware River for fishermen and boaters .It was envisioned that baseball fans could pilot their boats to the stadium as an alternative to driving .The county must maintain the dock under an agreement with the state government , county officials said .Last year was not the first time the dock incurred big damage - related expenses .After a bout of below - freezing days in January 2004 , ice damage cost the county $ 115,000 in repairs , and it cost another $ 200,000 to remove the dock from the water .The 600-foot floating dock must be removed , stored and reinstalled each year .Hydro - Marine Construction , a division of The Castle Group , has a publicly bid , two - year contract with the county to install and remove the dock , which costs approximately $ 103,000 annually .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.694565"}
