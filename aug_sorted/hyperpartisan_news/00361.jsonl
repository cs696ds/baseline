{"text": "In December , Obama said in an interview that \" it does not make sense , from a prioritization point of view , for us to focus on recreational drug users in a state that has already said that under state law that 's legal . \"In April , Attorney General Eric Holder said to Congress , \" We are certainly going to enforce federal law . ...When it comes to these marijuana initiatives , I think among the kinds of things we will have to consider is the impact on children . \"He also mentioned violence related to drug trafficking and organized crime .In May , Obama told reporters : \" I honestly do not believe that legalizing drugs is the answer .But I do believe that a comprehensive approach _ not just law enforcement , but prevention and education and treatment _ that 's what we have to do . \"Rep. Jared Polis , a Colorado Democrat who favors legalization , predicts Washington will take a hands - off approach , based on Obama 's comments about setting law enforcement priorities .\" We would like to see that in writing , \" Polis says .\" But we believe , given the verbal assurances of the president , that we are moving forward in Colorado and Washington in implementing the will of the voters .\" The federal government has taken a similar approach toward users in states that have approved marijuana for medical use .It does n't go after pot - smoking cancer patients or grandmas with glaucoma .But it also has warned that people who are in the business of growing , selling and distributing marijuana on a large scale are subject to potential prosecution for violations of the Controlled Substances Act _ even in states that have legalized medical use .Federal agents in recent years have raided storefront dispensaries in California and Washington , seizing cash and pot .In April , the Justice Department targeted 63 dispensaries in Santa Ana , Calif. , and filed three asset forfeiture lawsuits against properties housing seven pot shops .Prosecutors also sent letters to property owners and operators of 56 other marijuana dispensaries warning that they could face similar lawsuits .University of Denver law professor Sam Kamin says if the administration does n't act soon to sort out the federal - state conflict , it may be too late to do much .\" At some point , it becomes so prevalent and so many citizens will be engaged in it that it 's hard to recriminalize something that 's become commonplace , \" he says ._ _ _ .There 's a political calculus for the president , or any other politician , in all of this .Younger people , who tend to vote more Democratic , are more supportive of legalizing marijuana , as are people in the West , where the libertarian streak runs strong .In Colorado , for example , last November more people voted for legalized pot ( 55 percent ) than voted for Obama ( 51 percent ) , which could help explain why the president was silent on marijuana before the election .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.848816"}

{"text": "Tag Archives : legalize marijuana .The Denver NBC affiliated has projected that Colorado in a historic vote that will reverberate around the nation will pass Amendment 64 and would legalize marijuana .News networks have begun to confirm that Colorado 's Amendment 64 has been passed by voters by a vote of 53 % to 47 % ( with 38 % of the vote tallied ) .This marks the first time in history that a state has moved for legalizing marijuana outright for adult consumers .The vote demonstrates that cannabis prohibition is a failed , unpopular policy , like alcohol prohibition before it , which largely relies on state and local enforcement .The prohibition of alcohol came to an end when some states enacted legislation repealing the state 's alcohol prohibition laws .Till now , no state in the United States of America has defined cannabis as a legal commodity though some state laws do provide for legal exceptions that permit certain qualified patients to possess specific amounts of cannabis as needed .But with this development from Colorado , cannabis has been classified as a legal product that may be lawfully possessed and consumed by adults .During 2008 - 10 , many western and central states witnessed an exponential surge in the number of medical marijuana dispensaries that sold marijuana for medicinal purposes .California , the first state in the United States to legalize marijuana , has been the biggest beneficiary and supplier of marijuana in the country .In recent times , the business of medical marijuana is growing with every passing day despite the stigma often linked with drugs .Medical marijuana has been used for alleviating symptoms of physical conditions , including chronic pain , gout , vision problems and nausea associated with chemotherapy treatment .The consumption of marijuana is no longer restricted to hippies at concerts and its sale is no longer limited to shady people in alleys .Erik Santus , the owner of Lotus Medical , a medical marijuana dispensary in Colorado , said he opened a dispensary for medical marijuana to create a favorable environment for people to learn about the benefits of marijuana .Santus further remarked that bringing a dispensary involves several initial hurdles and a burden of $ 200,000 to set up and another $ 15,000-$20,000 every month for maintenance .The list of clients is long but legitimate .While some have fought in Iraq and struggling with post - traumatic stress disorder , a few elderly take it for getting relief from chronic pain and have a sound sleep , and some take medical marijuana for finding comfort from health conditions such as gout .According to a survey by Gallup , a record high fifty percent of the United States population says that the use of marijuana should be legalized .The use of marijuana was favored by 12 percent of the American population in 1969 and 84 percent opposed its legalization .From the late 1970s to the mid 1990s , the support for marijuana legalization remained in the mid-20s but it went to 30 percent in the year 2000 and 40 percent of the US population supported marijuana legalization in the year 2009 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "121.454956"}
