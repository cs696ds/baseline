{"text": "According to Webster 's , racism is \" a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race .It is thus not a belief in the existence of racial differences as such , but the belief that those differences produce an inherent racial superiority , that constitutes racism .So far Webster 's definition is helpful , but it only deals with racism as an intellectual theory .Explicit racist doctrines - except among groups such as the Nation of Islam- have notably declined in the last fifty years , and today we think of racism more as a matter of attitude and behavior than as a formal ideology .As action ( and speech ) , racism consists of systematic oppression , violent acts , the stirring up of hatred , and so on .I would say further that the racist belief in another group 's inferiority concerns their inherent worth as human beings , not a mere difference in some particular trait or talent .Otherwise , the distinction between an opinion regarding racial differences and a belief in racial superiority is lost .We may observe , for example , that Japanese are more disciplined and hard - working than Samoans , or that Africans on average have longer limbs than Caucasians , without denying anyone 's humanity .Depending on tone and context , such comparisons might or might not be invidious , but they are not inherently racist .The virtue of this provisional definition is that it attempts to provide a clear and reasonable standard that distinguishes genuinely racist behavior from behavior which can not be said to be racist by any reasonable standard but which is now routinely labeled as such .A well - known recent instance will show what I mean .\" I think we would all agree that Snyder 's comment was offensive and insulting , as well as incorrect .But how in the world was it racist ?The network did not bother to say .It was simply understood by everyone that the remark concerned race , that it was offensive , and that people ( white people , that is ) are not supposed to talk openly in today 's society about racial differences ; therefore it was \" racist .The first of these ideas was a theme of the Harvard conference mentioned above .Participants were told that professors teaching a class should never \" introduce any sort of thing that might hurt a group\"-a prescription for the massive repression of speech .As for the second idea , it 's simply absurd ; if there were not these plainly discernible physical groupings of the human family , we would not even have a concept of race .Structural \" Racism .Apart from such ridiculous but common usages of \" racism\"-which I think any sensible person ought to reject - there is today the widely accepted idea of \" institutional racism , \" which we need to consider .In Portraits of White Racism , David T.

{"text": "Today , most whites still do not \" see , \" or do not wish to see , the impact of institutionalized racism or to recognize its determinative role in everyday life .A substantial majority persist in denying that white racism is systemic , commonplace , and devastating for its targets .It is this aggressive move in the direction of increasing real collective empathy and new invigorated organizations to expand that collective empathy that white conservatives and reactionaries seem most worried about .Recent political news has focused extensively on whether modern times are sounding a death - knell for the Republican party ( photo credit : makelessnoise ) .In my mind , these debates reveal a major problem for the Republican party and highlight the ways in which narrow racial framing is limiting their future opportunities and success .When Republicans debate whether to \" stick to their guns \" ( pun intended ) or establish a \" bigger tent , \" they are thinking short term and avoiding some very real racialized realities that have an impact for their future and ultimately their continued existence .So it 's not especially shocking that Republicans would be oblivious of what - and who - they are ignoring when they think only in terms of going more moderate or staying conservative .The racial issue that I refer to is this .All demographic data indicates that within a mere 30 to 40 years , this country will no longer have a clear white majority .What we are headed towards , whether Republican elites like it or not , is a nation that is mostly multiracial and where whites are irrevocably becoming a numerical minority .I do n't think many Republicans have really taken that fact in , perhaps because it is hard to imagine in a nation that has been run by a white majority for centuries .But it 's happening , and evidence of the implications of this were even present in the last election .While some commentators like to pretend that Obama 's election is indicative of the fact that we 're past \" all the racial stuff \" , the reality is that most whites did not vote for Obama .It took a multiracial coalition of African Americans , Latino / as , Asian Americans , and a small but important minority of whites to get Obama into the White House .Ultimately , however , he won without the support of most whites , because there are finally enough Americans of color to have a significant , determining impact on electoral outcomes .Had Obama not had the foresight to appeal to a broad variety of racial groups , we would be dealing with President McCain and Vice President \" I Can See Russia From My House \" right now .Republicans would do well to think about how this dynamic plays into their \" more moderate or more conservative \" dilemma .What I think it means is that if they want to \" stick to their roots , \" that in itself needs to involve a fundamental paradigm shift .Of late , the Republican roots have n't just been small government and tax cuts , those roots have also included appealing to white racism and demonizing groups of color .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.76675"}
