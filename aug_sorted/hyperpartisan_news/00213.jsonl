Larry Hogan 's veto of a bill allowing felons to vote while still on parole or probation .The bill restores that right to nearly 40,000 people .The governor argued that the bill unjustly rewarded people who still owed a debt to society .But legislators were persuaded to override the veto by research showing that people who have voting rights are less likely to commit new crimes or return to prison .The measure drew strong support from several law enforcement and criminal justice organizations , including the American Probation and Parole Association .The group told the legislature that \" civic participation \" was crucial to the process that helps people leave crime behind to become \" law - abiding \" citizens .Another big problem with felon disenfranchisement laws is where they come from .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.317535"}

{"text": "Site Search Navigation .Site Navigation .When key Republicans refused earlier this month to schedule hearings with the White House budget director on the president 's new budget , the move was widely and correctly seen as churlish and childish .It was also another example of Republicans choosing to insult the president - and the presidency - rather than adhere to Republican roots and ideals .To explain : The law that requires the president to submit an annual budget request was passed by the Republican - dominated Congress in 1921 and signed into law by President Warren Harding , a diehard Republican .Before that , cabinet secretaries generally submitted their agencies ' budget requests to Congress and lawmakers took it from there .Lawmakers wanted the president to submit a request because they blamed that era 's deficits on the lack of coordination among cabinet departments , which , they said , let each secretary ask for top dollar without regard to how much was being requested overall .For the record , flaws in the budget process were not the cause of the deficits .The cause was the cost of fighting World War I. In fact , all of the nation 's wars have led to deficits , as did the combination of tax cuts and defense buildup under President Ronald Reagan .But I digress .The point is that for going on 100 years , when presidents have submitted their annual budgets to Congress , they have been carrying out a law with a Republican pedigree .That alone is a reason for Republicans to respond with at least a touch of class .Then again , judging from their behavior , few Republicans have any detailed knowledge of , let alone respect for , their party 's heritage .But the party history is there , if only they would live up to it .Bernie Sanders on the night of the New Hampshire primary .Credit Todd Heisler / The New York Times .Readers dissected the influence of gender , generation and political agenda in response to recent columns and editorials about Senator Bernie Sanders 's lopsided victory over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the New Hampshire primary .\" People are tired of old saws , they hate the establishment with a passion , they are fed up with the lack of attention to our borders , \" Stephen Light of Grand Marais , Minn. , wrote in response to an editorial .\" There is one message that Hillary must understand - both the Democrats and Republicans want radical change . \"\" It is Bernie who attracts the independents , not Hillary , \" Maro wrote from Massachusetts .\" The goal posts have been moved in the current election cycle .Income inequality and independence from corporate interest have become the two most significant signature issues for the voters in Democratic primaries . \"Women reflected on the symbolism of Mrs. Clinton 's candidacy .To some , the prospect of having a longtime feminist elected to the White House carries a powerful promise of change .\"The glass ceiling still exists and electing Hillary will finally shatter it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.324005"}
