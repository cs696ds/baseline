{"text": "Independent voters are now the largest and fastest - growing segment of the electorate .At the end of the day , we decide which party will win control of Congress or which candidate will win the presidency .But a candidate who panders to the extremes and parades his own irresponsibility can not assume that he 'll win independent votes just because he slaps the independent label on a self - funded candidacy .A credible independent candidate needs to be a consistent advocate for the principled positions independent voters care about - reducing the deficit and debt while combating hyper - partisanship .Trump made a decision to enflame polarization in the pursuit of self - promotion .As a result , he sacrificed his right to be taken seriously as well as any claims he had to represent independent voters credibly in the 2012 election .And that 's the issue : .Trump can not present himself as representing independent voters .He can - given these polls - correctly say there is interest in the Republican party for birtherism .He can correctly present himself as representing the country 's talk radio political culture and the reality show political culture .He can correctly represent himself as the epitome of the pandering politician who will use any issue he can to whip people up and get attention to achieve his own - Donald Trump 's - personal goals .And , most assuredly , he can correct represent himself as a someone who rather than trying to appeal to the best instincts in Americans and trying to unite them is appealing to the worst instincts in Americans - and is dividing them .As a self - described \" uber - moderniser , \" Finkelstein urged Cameron to \" show that he still carries the modernizing torch . \"Further , Finkelstein called for a \" sharp break from the strategy \" that had cost the Tories victory in the past three national elections .It was a difficult moment for British conservatives , especially party reformers .When Prime Minister Tony Blair stepped down in June , there was a widespread belief that incoming Prime Minister Gordon Brown would shift from the centrist - outcome - based philosophy of Blair to become a liberal ideologue .Moreover , the remarkable communication skills of Blair seemingly had been absent during Brown 's years as chancellor , earning him a reputation for dour economic speak and raising questions about his ability to lead .So it was not unreasonable , as Brown took charge , for conservatives to assume the departure of Blair gave them their best political opening in a decade .After all , the situation was not unlike the 2000 U.S. election , when Vice President Al Gore , who also lacked the communications abilities of his predecessor , gave Republicans an opportunity when he moved left and away from the centrist policies of President Bill Clinton .But only three months after Blair left office , to the great consternation of many British conservatives , it turned out Brown was an able politician who in just a few months as party leader had brought Labour to a double - digit advantage over the Tories in national polls .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.221497"}

Bush .Across the nation , towns and cities have been passing pro - impeachment resolutions .Websites promoting impeachment keep springing up .In several states , bills have been introduced in state legislatures that , if passed , would become formal bills of impeachment in the U.S. House of Representatives , requiring initiation of impeachment hearings under congressional rules dating back to the early 19th century .Those poll results were reported all over the Internet , but they barely made it into any mainstream corporate news reports .Indeed , impeachment itself is getting short shrift in the media , despite all this impeachment organizing activity .When the House Judiciary Committee 's ranking minority member , Rep. John Conyers ( D.-Mich . ) , introduced a bill in December calling for creation of a select committee to investigate \" possible impeachable crimes \" by Bush , the dramatic move received virtually no mainstream coverage beyond an AP wire item ( 12/21/05 ) .Even as the number of Democratic House members co - sponsoring that bill rose from an initial handful to 39 , it has received scant attention .The first time impeachment made the front page of the Washington Post was March 25 , 2006 , when that paper finally ran a story on the wave of town government resolutions across the country .Interestingly , though , the Post did provide Conyers space on the op - ed page for a column explaining that he would not immediately push for impeachment should he become chair of the House Judiciary Committee ( \" No Rush to Impeachment , \" 5/18/06 ) .Similarly , when Sen. Russ Feingold ( D.-Wisc . ) introduced a censure measure in the Senate Judiciary Committee , the New York Times tucked it away on page A17 ( 3/13/06 ) .But days later , when Republicans tried to sideline the measure by claiming that such a move would help them in November by \" energizing \" their conservative base , the Times perversely played that classic \" reaction \" story on Page 1 ( 3/16/06 ) .In part , the media downplaying of impeachment may reflect a now - longstanding fear on the part of editors of frontally challenging the Bush administration .C ertainly the corporate media 's approach to calls for Bush 's impeachment contrasts markedly with the same outlets ' coverage of the Clinton impeachment effort in the late 1990s .Though public support for Clinton 's impeachment never got above about 36 percent , even at the height of congressional impeachment proceedings , many media outlets responded to the prospect of impeachment by calling on Clinton to resign .According to the Columbia Journalism Review ( 11 - 12/98 ) , by September 1998 , 181 newspapers ( roughly one in 10 papers in the country ) had called for his resignation - including major papers like USA Today ( 9/14/98 ) and the Philadelphia Inquirer ( 9/12/98 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.72943"}

{"text": "Now , on the east coast , deep - blue Maryland 's 2013 assault weapons ban is back in the legal crosshairs , with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that a stricter legal standard should have been applied to ascertain its constitutionality .It 's a tremendous decision , though the current ban remains in effect while the legal camps begin arming themselves for the fight ahead .This was applied to federal enclaves ; it was expanded to the states in the McDonald v. Chicago decision .Yet , the Court noted that this right was not unlimited , and that certain limitations on weapons considered \" dangerous and unusual \" could pass constitutional muster .Grenade launchers , rocket - propelled grenades , and atomic weapons fit this category , not AR-15 semiautomatic rifles .Yet , as Dahlia Lithwick wrote in Slate , it 's dubious whether the Supremes will get involved in Kolbe v. Hogan .It 's certainly a possibility , and it offers another legal avenue for Second Amendment supporters to make their case for a broader ruling over the entire country concerning the legality of assault weapons bans .On a side note , Ms. Lithwick , like most left - of - center publications , need to brush up on their firearms nomenclature ( of which I sometimes screw up ) right : .The 4th Circuit then argued that since handguns kill far more people than semi - automatic weapons , and that since Heller made handgun ownership constitutional , the less overall deadly semi - automatic assault weapons must not be dangerous and unusual either .Writing alone in dissent Judge Robert B. King is unequivocal : \" Let 's be real : The assault weapons banned by Maryland 's FSA are exceptionally lethal weapons of war .In fact , the most popular of the prohibited semiautomatic rifles , the AR-15 , functions almost identically to the military 's fully automatic M16 . \"He also notes that the Supreme Court specifically called out M16 rifles in Heller when defining \" dangerous and unusual .\" First , there are no weapons that are \" less deadly semiautomatic \" weapons , unless you 're referring to bolt - action rifles , commonly associated with hunting , or muzzle - loaders , of which no one has really used en masse since the 18 th and 19 th centuries .Second , most handguns in circulation are semiautomatic ( self - reloading ) .An AR-15 rifle is also a semiautomatic weapon , which is why this argument that the AR-15 and the M16 are pretty much the same is so silly .An M16 rifle , the ones used by our military , can fire multiple rounds per trigger pull .There are other firearms that will continue to fire as long as the trigger is pulled ( aka automatic ) as well .That makes these weapon systems wholly different from the AR-15 , not identical .And , yes , automatic firearms for civilians are legal if you are willing to undergo the long process overseen by the ATF , wherein you pay a tax and have your weapons catalogued in a database .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.29133"}

Bush began the war in Iraq he did n't really know what he was doing .The Shia are dominant in Iraq , Saddam Hussein , a Sunni , had kept the lid on the Shia in Iraq the years he was in power .With \" democracy \" in Iraq the Shia are now in power , just as the Shia are in power in Iran .( Iran is ethnically Persian , Iraq is Arab ) .This distinction between Shia and Sunni is critical to understanding the differences among Muslims .Egypt is much less likely to adopt an Islamist extremist government due to its history as a more secular and Sunni culture .A second factor is the role of Israel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.38293"}

Kennedy he was determined to initiate a \" war on poverty \" to create a more just society .Caro said that the Vietnam War kept Johnson from \" transforming \" American society , but many programs Johnson began are now taken for granted by people today such as Medicare .A full acounting of how Johnson improved American society has not been appreciated because conservatives over the past decades have been too successful in castigating the gains of the \" Great Society . \" But the comment that especially caught my attention was what Caro said about Bobby Kennedy .He said that if Bobby Kennedy had been elected president there would have been a real transformation in the country along the lines of what Barack Obama may be doing for the country today .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.24852"}
