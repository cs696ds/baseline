Daniels .Harbaugh said it was Wallace 's decision : \" I do n't talk people out of it , especially not on game day , \" the coach said .Wallace , a seven - year veteran who was not in the league last year , played five seasons in Seattle and two in Cleveland .He was signed by San Francisco earlier this month after the Saints cut him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "144.72943"}

Daniels - to enter the battle for the backup shot .The 5-foot-11 rookie from South Florida did n't take any snaps in the preseason opener , but made the most of his opportunity Friday after taking increased practice snaps this week .Daniels , who entered late in the third quarter , completed 6 of 9 passes for 72 yards and had a 128.0 rating .He directed a 13-play , 90-yard drive , which he capped with a delicately placed 14-yard , game - winning toss to undrafted rookie Chuck Jacobs with 2:02 left .Daniels ' performance comes with the usual preseason disclaimer : He was playing against a defense composed largely of players likely to be out of the league in a month .Still , Harbaugh said Daniels played well , ran the team smoothly and was in the mix for the backup job , which he 'd said earlier in training camp .\" I 've been practicing hard , \" Daniels said .\" I give credit to the defense I see every day .You see those guys every day and the players that we have .I just had a lot of confidence to go in the game .I felt like I could manage the offense . \" Last year , of course , the 49ers had no backup - quarterback worries when they finished the season with Alex Smith .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "145.87846"}
