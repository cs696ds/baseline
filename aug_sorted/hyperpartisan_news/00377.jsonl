Bellows , a Senior Litigation Counsel in the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia .Mr. Bellows submitted his exhaustive report on May 12 , 2000 ( the ' ' Bellows Report ' ' ) , and made numerous findings of fact and recommendations .Given what the FBI and OIPR knew at the time , it should have resulted in the submission of a FISA application , and the issuance of a FISA order . ' 'The Bellows team concluded that OIPR had been too conservative with the Wen Ho Lee FISA application , a conservatism that may continue to affect the FBI 's and DOJ 's handling of FISA applications .The Bellows team made another finding of particular pertinence to the instant issue .Director Mueller has adopted a new policy , not formally recorded in writing , that he be informed of the denial within the FBI of any request for a FISA application .However , in an informal briefing the weekend after this new policy was publicly announced , the FBI lawyer whom it most directly affected claimed to know nothing of the new ' ' policy ' ' beyond what he had read in the newspaper .From an oversight perspective , it is striking that the FBI and DOJ were effectively on notice regarding precisely this issue : that the probable cause test being applied in FISA investigations was more stringent than legally required .We appreciate the carefulness and diligence with which the professionals at OIPR and the FBI exercise their duties in processing FISA applications , which normally remain secret and immune from the adversarial scrutiny to which criminal warrants are subject .Yet , this persistent problem has two serious repercussions .First , the FBI and DOJ appear to be failing to take decisive action to provide in - depth training to agents and lawyers on an issue of the utmost national importance .We simply can not continue to deny or ignore such training flaws only to see them repeated in the future .Second , when the DOJ and FBI do not apply or use the FISA as fully or comprehensively as the law allows , pressure is brought on the Congress to change the statute in ways that may not be at all necessary .From a civil liberties perspective , the high - profile investigations and cases in which the FISA process appears to have broken down is too easily blamed on the state of the law rather than on inadequacies in the training of those responsible for implementing the law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.52475"}
