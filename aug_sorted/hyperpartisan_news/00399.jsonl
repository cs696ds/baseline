David Vitter ( R - La . ) to remove from the comprehensive immigration reform bill the only path to legalized immigration status for undocumented immigrants .The amendment would have eliminated provisions in the bill that created a new category of \" Z visas \" available to immigrants living in the United States illegally .The visas could be applied for by undocumented immigrants residing in the U.S. before 2007 , legalizing their residency and ultimately putting them in line for citizenship if they could pass a background check , demonstrate efforts to learn English and U.S. civics and pay large fines .No other provisions in the bill provided opportunities for undocumented immigrations to legalize their immigration status .[ 1 ] .The Drum Major Institute for Public Policy opposed the amendment and selected the vote on the amendment for its middle class scorecard at theMiddleClass.org .It stated : .The Middle Class Opposes .The American middle class relies on the economic contributions of immigrants .While the overall immigration bill this amendment is attached to recognizes these contributions and would allow them to continue under the Z visa program , this amendment eliminates that pathway to legalization .This mass deportation is the explicit aim of many of the bill 's supporters .But imprisonment and deportation is not only a bad policy for the middle class but also a tremendously expensive and ultimately unworkable one .Many undocumented immigrants would still evade deportation , while others would continue to enter the country illegally .Attempting to enforce such an unworkable policy would further drain scarce enforcement resources .Equally important is the way this legislation would exacerbate the threat that undocumented workers pose to the wages and workplace conditions of aspiring middle - class Americans .Because unscrupulous employers can threaten to have their undocumented employees deported at any time , these immigrants are particularly vulnerable to exploitation in the workplace .While this legislation seeks to drive undocumented immigrants out of the workplace completely , the more likely effect would be that they remain in the country but are driven further underground , increasing their vulnerability and further undermining middle - class wages and working conditions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.01496"}
{"text": "I believe the American people understand in order to succeed in our society , immigrants need to learn English .But the amendment would do a number of things that are problematical .The first is that it is contrary to the provisions of law that exist in many States .For example , in New Mexico , you have in their State Constitution , a provision that says that many of the documents within that State have to be provided in both English and Spanish .The same thing is true for the State of Hawaii .I believe this is a States rights issue , and those constitutions of those States ought to be respected .I do not believe it is a matter we ought to be imposing here from Washington DC .Also , this amendment would undo an executive order conceived by President Bill Clinton and implemented by President George Bush .Both recognized it is important that people who have limited English proficiency receive the kinds of services so they can understand what is going on in terms of the interface between the Government and themselves .This legislation says we wish to add something called guest workers or temporary workers .With guest workers , working Americans would discover there is no opportunity for upward mobility at their job .In fact , every day their employers are trying to find ways to push down wages , eliminate retirement , and eliminate health care .What has happened in this country , with what is called the \" new global economy , \" is dramatic downward pressure on income for American workers .The guest worker program provides that 400,000 people will be able to come in to assume jobs in our country per year -- adding to the 12 million illegal immigrants already here .Opponents recommend voting NO because : .I certainly concur about the need to secure our borders , about the need to have a workable immigration system , and the need for reform that ensures the rule of law is restored in the US .Where I differ is in the belief that we can actually achieve these goals if we have no ability for temporary workers to come to the country .This amendment would eliminate the temporary worker program from this bill .Now , there are several reasons why a temporary worker program , within certain constraints , is a good idea .The first reason is because it will help to relieve the magnet for illegal immigration .The reason most of the people are crossing our border illegally is to get employment .There are jobs available for them .Some people say this is work Americans will not do .That is actually not true .But there are not enough American citizens to do all of the work that needs to be done .So naturally the law of supply and demand sets in here .People come across the border illegally , and they take that work .What we want to do is both close the border , but also eliminate the magnet for illegal employment here , because the reality is desperate people will always try to find some way to get into the country .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.034767"}

Circuit 's uber- textualist ruling .I continue to think it was a mistake for the judiciary to have involved itself in the political branch appointments battles .No reporter , academic , or commentator , however , has yet revealed that Noel Canning also revoked President Lyndon Johnson 's January 1964 judicial recess appointments of civil - rights legends Leon Higginbotham , Spottswood Robinson , and David Rabinovtiz .In a just - published article in the Houston Law Review 's online edition , I expose the unconsidered Noel Canning consequence of the judgeship revocations .As the recess commission were signed by Lyndon Johnson during an eight day intersession recess of the 88th Senate , Noel Canning judged the recess 48 hours too short and the judgeships illegal .The recess appointments were \" rendered illegitimate \" for failing the \" presumptive 10-day \" recess test .The eight day break was 48 hours too short .Six weeks after John F. Kennedy 's murder , LBJ forced the racial and religious integration of three federal courthouses .The new president signaled his administration 's commitment to civil rights and directly challenged racist and reactionary forces in both the Senate and the federal judiciary .The LBJ White House tapes tell the story for Higginbotham , Robinson , ( expect a slight delay ) and Rabinovitz , and as Johnson made sure he secured the most political capital for signing each commission in the coming battle for the Civil Rights Act .On Monday , President Obama announced in a video address that he had commuted the sentences of 46 people sentenced to long prison terms for drug offenses .His counsel , Neil Eggleston , stated that , \" While I expect the President will issue additional commutations and pardons before the end of his term , it is important to recognize that clemency alone will not fix decades of overly punitive sentencing policies . \"Mr. Eggleston added that \" the President is committed to using all the tools at his disposal to remedy unfairness in our criminal justice system . \"However , judging from the President 's speech to the NAACP the next day , clemency is the only one of those tools that is calculated to result in any more prison releases .The President has now issued 89 commutations , the most since Lyndon Johnson .But even if the President ends up granting triple that number or more , it will hardly make a dent in the number of those in prison potentially eligible for relief under the announced standards of the Administration 's clemency initiative .Meanwhile , the system for administering the clemency initiative is reportedly having difficulty gaining traction .Some prisoners have now expressed concern that perhaps the blessing of this Project was not the \" fast track \" to relief they had imagined .There is a growing sense of urgency among those who are responsible for organizing the clemency effort , in the Department of Justice and in the private bar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.463905"}

{"text": "Before discussing the case itself , though , it is worth contextualizing the political and legal dynamics that have culminated in this landmark case , highlighting the role both partisanship and federalism have played in landing Texas before the high Court .As I detail in a recently co - authored book , immigration policy since Sept. 11 , 2001 has fallen victim to party polarization in a way that had previously not been true of immigration politics .That polarization largely explains the inability of Congress to pass immigration over the past 15 years , despite several attempts and broad support from the American public .In turn , Congress ' silence has cleaved space for two emerging policy dynamics .First , states have stepped more fully into the legislative void , enacting an unprecedented volume of both restrictionist and integrationist policies .Second , the federal executive branch has become much more conspicuous and robust in fashioning immigration policy through both enforcement calibration and litigation .The Texas case implicates both trends , and their partisan roots , simultaneously .From 2004 through 2011 , restrictionist state enactments reached record levels , with most of those policies enacted by Republican - controlled state governments seeking to enhance immigration enforcement and encourage unauthorized immigrants to \" self - deport . \"As I chronicle in a forthcoming law review article , the Obama Administration took the unusual step of suing several states - including Arizona and Alabama - to quash these state immigration regulations .The Court 's 2012 ruling in Arizona v. United States struck down several provisions of these laws , based in large part on a conflict between the state laws and the Administration 's enforcement priorities .Upholding the state immigration enforcement law in Arizona would have changed business - as - usual in immigration federalism , shifting significantly more power to the states to potentially dictate the volume and characteristics of immigration enforcement .Instead , some have argued that the case reified - perhaps expanded - executive control over immigration policy .As it turned out , the administration 's victory in Arizona was only the second most prominent executive - led immigration event of 2012 .That summer , the president announced his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program ( DACA ) , providing deportation relief and the possibility of employment authorization to a large portion of undocumented youth .DACA , along with the Arizona case and the president 's reelection , triggered another wave of state and local enactments , but this time with a more integrationist bent .States expanded driver 's license , public assistance , and educational benefit availability for undocumented immigrants .Not surprisingly , in contrast to restrictionist schemes , integrationist policies were passed almost exclusively from jurisdictions - like California and New York City - controlled by Democrats . by Victor Williams , Clinical Assistant Professor of Law , Columbus School of Law , Catholic University of America .On the first Monday in October , the Supreme Court returned from its long summer recess .Thus , the 2014 NLRB v.

{"text": "Earlier , it was reported that the surge in undocumented border crossing by minor children from Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador was on course to reach 90,000 by the end of this year .Independent reports as well as those of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) indicate that the children are fleeing from a sharply deteriorating situation of deepening poverty combined with extreme violence .These conditions are generated by unequal trade relations between these already poor Central American states and their wealthy , industrialized trading partners , mainly the United States , by activities of drug trafficking cartels but also by the U.S. financed \" war on drugs \" .The vast majority of the children come from Honduras , Guatemala and El Salvador .UNHCR officials who have interviewed the children say that as many as 58 percent of them could have grounds , under international law , for protection as refugees .When the media broke the story , Republican politicians and right wing commentators immediately jumped on it to see how they could use it to hit two targets : The Obama administration and the movement for immigrant rights .Against the Obama administration , they made the accusation that the government 's \" excessive leniency \" in dealing with undocumented immigrants has created rumors that young people who cross the borders without papers will get a free pass to live in the United States .They were referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program which the Obama administration initiated in 2012 , which allows some people brought without papers as minor children to avoid deportation .Although DACA has indeed helped out some half a million young \" Dreamers \" , the current group of border crossers would not qualify for it .In fact , the current administration has deported immigrants at a rate exceeding any other one in recent history .What has been happening on the political scene explains to some extent why the right wing has been so eager to seize on the child migrant issue .Although the Senate passed an immigration reform bill last year and the movement has heavily lobbied individual Republican members of the House of Representatives , there has been no progress .President Obama promised the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that if the Republicans in the House did not move on immigration reform before the 4th of July recess , he would take executive action to expand the categories of people now covered by DACA .He asked the Secretary of Homeland Security to start a review of the way deportations are being carried out .Subsequently , Obama asked the Secretary to delay this process until the end of the summer , to give the House leadership some more time .Immigrant rights activists are thinking in terms of expanding DACA to cover at least the parents of dreamers , undocumented family members of U.S. citizens , and other specific categories .Meanwhile , another movement has started for deported persons whose families , which include U.S. citizens , have been threatened with death or kidnapping in Mexico to be allowed to return to the United States .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.96449"}

{"text": "Another Jobs Bill Killed via Open Congress : Blog by Donny Shaw on 6/23/11 .On June 6th , the Senate opened debate on the Economic Development Revitalization Act of 2011 , a bill to reauthorize and expand a long - running and consistently successful job - creation agency , the Economic Development Administration .The EDA has traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support , and this reauthorization bill was introduced with bipartisan co - sponsorship and passed out of committee without any dissent from Republicans .But after two weeks of debate , the bill was unanimously filibustered by Republicans and has now been pulled from the floor .Like the last jobs bill to die in the Senate , the bill was bogged down and ultimately killed by dozens of controversial and unrelated amendments that were submitted to it .Senate rules do not requireamendments to be germane to the bill they are submitted to , so individual senators can choose to use any bill to force a vote on any of their pet issues .By the time the EDA bill was killed , 99 amendments had been submitted , and the list read like an overview of current hot - button political topics .The amendments included everything from raising the debt ceiling , to repealing health care reform , repealing financial regulatory reform , expanding offshore oil drilling , and more .This problem of non - controversial bills being killed by controversial amendments has its roots in a deal on procedure that Democratic and Republican Senate leaders agreed to at the beginning of this session .In exchange for Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid [ D , NV ] keeping bills open to amendments , Minority Leader Mitch McConnell [ R , KY ] and his caucus agreed to not mount filibusters of bringing bills to the floor as a matter of routine .As a result , the Democratic majority has been able to hold debates on their legislative agenda , but the Republicans have also been able to turn every debate into an attempt to repeal health care reform .The Senate Majority Leader has almost complete control over what bills get brought up for debate , so it is the case that most Republican issues stand no chance of being voted on this session outside the amendment process .But the Senate ca n't vote on every contentious political topic for every bill , so Reid has to make a decision when to cut off the amendment process and start moving towards passing the underlying bill .In this case , Reid allowed two Democratic amendments and two Republican amendments to be voted on before filing a motion to end debate and move forward towards passage .But since most senators did n't get to have their pet amendments voted on , they voted against he motion to end debate and essentially forced a filibuster .Even Sen. James Inhofe [ R , OK ] , an original co - sponsor of the bill , voted for the filibuster .And so gridlock prevails , even on the one issue that everyone claims to care about - job creation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.009"}

Lincoln and Mark Pryor , sided with all 41 Republicans in opposing debate .While Democrats criticized Republicans for killing the chance to have an up or down vote on the DREAM Act it is unclear how an actual vote on the immigration legislation would have turned out : .From a policy perspective , the immigration measure was more controversial and Democrats seemed likely to face opposition to it not only by Republicans but from within their own ranks .Adding the measure to the bill would similarly require 60 votes , and aides in both parties said the effort would likely have failed .Below is a video of DREAM Activists on Fox and Friends this morning .These activists present the struggles of immigrants who would benefit from the DREAM Act with conviction , and advocate on behalf of this legislation with class seldom seen on cable news these days . . ..And it all comes down to this , at 2:15 PM eastern the Senate will vote cloture on a motion to proceed to the Defense Authorization Legislation .As of now , Defense Authorization does not contain the DREAM Act , however Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has indicated that he will attach the legislation as an amendment if it passes cloture today .Though there is wide support for the DREAM Act , among Democrats , and military personnel , at this point it is not looking very good for the Defense Authorization bill as a whole .Peter Shrag of the LA Times has more in his story Dashing the DREAM Act : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.074524"}

Robert Menendez said Thursday he will introduce comprehensive immigration reform legislation in the Senate before the year 's end .He made the announcement at the White House after a meeting with President Obama .Menendez also conceded the legislation will only serve as a vehicle that can be reintroduced in the next Congress , but added that Obama told him that he supports the senator 's plan to move forward with a bill .Politico 's Scott Wong notes HERE that the legislation is likely to be heavy on border security : .His announcement Wednesday , before about 200 pro - immigration activists at a church near Capitol Hill , came a day after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev . ) signaled he would try to pass a separate bill next week providing citizenship to young , undocumented immigrants if they attend college for two years or join the military .Sources familiar with the Menendez bill said it would include border security provisions , employment verification , a temporary - worker program and a path to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants now living in the U.S .Senator Menendez said the following at a rally in front of 200 immigration activists : . \" A journey of a 1,000 miles begin with a single step , \" said Menendez , the Senate 's lone Hispanic member .\" There can be no chance if there is no legislation .The reality is that legislation gives the process , the vehicle by which to garner support and to move forward . \"Sen. Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) announced today he plans to bring the DREAM Act to the floor again today so it will be \" poised and ready to be called \" as a standalone bill or an amendment .That 's not to say it will happen soon , though .Durbin said it might not be possible to pass the act for some undocumented students and military service members to gain legal status until a lame duck session or even the next session of Congress .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.554794"}

{"text": "[ Full poll results here ] .Latino Decisions and others have done other polling in the recent past about how Latinos feel about various issues , and when it comes right down to it , Latinos fall in line with Democratic Party - promoted policies on education , health care , and jobs / economy .So , why were n't these polled voters reminded of the Rubio , Bush , and especially Ryan positions on those policies .Ryan ( and Romney ) was defeated in 2012 because of those positions .It is obvious to me that the poll was created to put a scare into Republicans , but assuming that Latinos are solely single issue voters taints the poll .We are not .On top of that , the current Latino political conversation has included the addition of the \" border surge \" to the bill which Rubio very loudly insisted be included or he would not play the game anymore .I wo n't even go into Bush 's \" fertile \" remark .And , Ryan , well , he still wants to cut off our viejitos and viejitas from Social Security .Do n't get me wrong , I 've been a fan of Latino Decisions .Recently , they even wrote up a defense of the Voting Rights Act backed up by science and numbers .So , I know they are capable of good work .But this last poll goes against what we should be doing - educating and empowering Latino voters with facts .And especially about candidates .Besides , we are seeing everyday that the GOP is not going to budge on immigration reform , and moreover , that the GOP has all but given up on the Latino vote .At least , that 's how it looks today .Whether it is Cornyn 's \" poison pill , \" or what might be Marco Rubio 's half - a - poison pill which will enact virtually unreachable triggers before green cards are even given , little doubt is left that Republicans are doing everything they can to kill immigration reform .There is grumbling among some Democrats that they 're in this bind because Rubio - a key Gang member - made border security an issue by saying it needed to be tightened in order to get 60 Senate votes .Then , the Florida Republican embraced the Cornyn plan when it was announced last week .And on Sean Hannity 's radio show Wednesday , Rubio described it as \" an excellent place to start in terms of having that conversation .\" Frankly , I think Reid should call for the vote and put the entire Senate on notice .But then this happened .Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev . ) wanted to put the Cornyn plan up for a vote Wednesday hoping to kill it quickly and show undecided Republicans that it 's going nowhere .But Reid held back at the GOP 's request , according to two Senate Democratic leadership aides .A Cornyn spokesman said that was n't the case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.83941"}
