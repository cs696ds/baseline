{"text": "In the closing stages of the trial , the prosecution was ordered to drop charges of plotting to murder the victims after the judge , Lord Turnbull , ruled there was insufficient evidence .The pair instead faced reduced charges of plotting to assault their targets , and a second charge of making Lennon believe the first hoax device they sent was capable of exploding and injuring him .Strathclyde police were originally told by forensics experts that the devices were very dangerous as they contained a volatile homemade explosive called TATP ( tri - acetone tri - peroxide ) or organic peroxide , often associated with al - Qaida attacks .When the plot was revealed last April , police commanders warned that they were \" viable devices \" and \" very definitely capable of causing real harm \" .But the jury learned that more detailed forensic checks found that none of the devices were viable .Their electronic devices , such as cheap digital watches and wires , were not capable of acting as detonators .The first parcel sent to McBride was an inert hoax device , using putty and 248 nails .The TATP and organic peroxide was theoretically capable of exploding with a battery charge or shock .The incendiary device sent to McBride , an outspoken lawyer who was Lennon and Celtic 's QC who died suddenly midway through the trial while abroad , included a small container of petrol and was packed with nails .Tim Niven - Smith , for the prosecution , told the jury that both Muirhead and McKenzie believed their devices were bombs and were capable of causing injuries .The jury saw CCTV images of McKenzie buying plastic travel bottles , padded envelopes and a watch from a local discount shop , and then nails from a nearby B&Q on 14 April , the day before the package for McBride was found in a postbox .Muirhead sent McKenzie a text message which read \" Sorry m8 our package was in Pennyburn last night waiting on navy bomb disposbal [ sic]. \" Muirhead 's son Gordon , who lived near a postbox used to post the McBride device , said both his father and McKenzie had warned him not to turn left , in the direction of the postbox , the night it was sent .McKenzie had also told Gordon Muirhead : \" If you hear a bang in the night do n't open the curtains \" .In a police interview , Muirhead admitted watching the first device to Lennon being posted in March 2011 , and to obtaining the peroxide hair dye for the devices , but wholly blamed McKenzie .He claimed McKenzie had \" pure hatred \" for Lennon and Celtic , and that he was terrified of his friend .In his police interviews , McKenzie admitted to building the devices .He told police \" OK , then aye , I 'm involved . \"He claimed the first was intended just to be a hoax , but said the latter devices were intended to \" scare \" their recipients .He had seen on the internet that using peroxide would make them \" flash \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.79676"}

{"text": "Collectively , the findings indicate that news reporting follows the law of opposites - the characteristics of crimes , criminals , and victims represented in the media are in most respects the polar opposite of the pattern suggested by official crime statistics .To some extent , this is to be expected , because the most sensational crimes - the ones everybody wants to talk about - are by definition rare .As the adage has it , \" Man Bites Dog \" is news , \" Dog Bites Man \" is n't .Unfortunately , because we tend to think in examples rather than statistics , the novelty criterion for news gives precisely the wrong impression in the case of crime reporting .Data for 100 percent coverage .One simple possible answer to this selective misrepresentation problem is simply to report all crimes .That 's not possible in the traditional model because of time constraints ( and , for print , space constraints . )But as NYU journalism professor Jay Rosen has suggested , trying to cover all of something is a great way to force innovation in news .So , data : All police departments collect crime statistics , and many now put them online .Sometimes these are inconvenient PDFs , but increasingly police departments are producing machine - readable feeds that can power maps and other types of analyses .The standout example here is the Los Angeles Times ' crime map , a project spearheaded by newsroom developer Ben Welsh .The Times ' map displays crimes for your neighborhood , and even generates automated alerts for unusual spikes in a particular type of incident .It was n't a trivial matter to produce this map , because we 're still in the early stages of open government data - different agencies use different systems and formats , and data quality varies widely .The Times had to work with both the Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department to obtain all of the necessary data in suitably formatted feeds .Even then , after the launch of the site , the Times discovered that the official data contained major omissions and errors ( since fixed ) .The result is a comprehensive view that individual stories can not deliver .No one has to tell a user looking at these maps that property crime is much more common than more sensational violent crimes .With color - coded incidents , anyone can see this at a glance .Crime data can be used for maps , personalized alerts , and trend analysis .It 's even possible to have a computer automatically write text stories from data , as Narrative Science does for sports and business .This may not make for great stories ( yet ? ) but that 's not the point here .Algorithmic techniques \" can take a little bit of the burden off , so you actually can dive deeper and do bigger stories , while still trying to do some of the bread and butter stuff that you 're doing , \" said Boyle .Homicide Watch D.C. pioneers a new way .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.952736"}

{"text": "Indeed SFA chief Stewart Regan 's statement last night spoke of ' dismay ' and how the ' fans had let the club down on the night ' .UEFA opened a door for Regan to demand Rangers fans cease polluting domestic football grounds with their bile , yet he failed to walk through it .The SFA chief is relatively new to Scotland , but he ca n't be unaware of what is sung at every game Rangers play in or , indeed , the background to the case .Rangers were just like any other Scottish football club until they embarked on a policy of religious discrimination that lasted for eight full decades , until Maurice Johnston signed for them in 1989 .Since then , they have been like any other equal opportunities employer .They sign and employ people regardless of their race , religion or colour .It had been hoped that after Johnston signed , there would be a dilution of the bigotry from the stands .The fans were later to see an Italian Catholic club captain and a Catholic manager of the club .For some of the fans who burned their season tickets when Johnston signed , these two acts must have been the culmination of all their fears when the club allowed a Catholic ' in the door ' on that infamous day .Football , however , is a business and any business must know its market , so Rangers still had to appeal to their large , core support .Some of these could easily be dismissed as a bit of a laugh amongst like - minded people , but another way of seeing it would be that this type of ' banter ' is simply the thin end of the wedge .In case anyone is under the illusion it is a response to Lennon 's perceived personality , two Northern Irish Catholics playing for Celtic also received death threats in the form of bullets through the post , two quieter footballers it would be hard to imagine in Scotland .On top of all that , Lennon has also had bomb threats intercepted and his family has had to be moved to a safe house .None of this has met with a comment or condemnation from Rangers , the only club who stand to gain from these heinous crimes from the more extreme of their supporters , which at the very least are a heavy distraction to Lennon and Celtic .The police service , the ambulance service , the fire service , and the NHS have all admitted to institutional bias and have apologised for it .Rangers , as the self - proclaimed ' second most important institution in Scotland ' should follow suit .They may well lose many of their core support , but they might finally come out the other side as a club with a broader appeal than that which they have already .They certainly have nothing , in the long term , to lose .Until Rangers themselves extinguish the smouldering embers of sectarianism at their club , there is always the danger that the flames will once again erupt and the house that they have built will be damaged beyond repair .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.18613"}

{"text": "The statistics may be public , but do we really want to leave it to the police to speak frankly about longer term patterns in crime ?There are also issues with the crime data itself , in how crimes are counted or reported .Our online discussion surfaced numerous examples of journalists discovering that official statistics were flawed or cooked , as in Los Angeles , Milwaukee , and New York .More generally , it 's the journalist 's job to hold the police accountable in light of their sweeping powers , as in this eloquent story about fighting for public acces to Baltimore police records .But trend stories and police department accountability are not the bread and butter of crime reporting .Exceptional cases like Boyle 's aside , I 'd argue that paying professional journalists to produce the classic \" this just happened \" crime spot story is a lot less valuable than it used to be .The question becomes even sharper when one considers it in terms of opportunity cost .Clearly , a reporter can produce a better crime story if they visit the crime scene themselves and write the story in their own words .But is it still worth assigning someone to do this , instead of any other story they could be reporting ?Moreover , even individually accurate stories can , over time , add up to the wrong impression .The public perception problem .Polling shows that most Americans believe that violent crime is increasing , and have believed this for several decades , yet nationwide violent crime rates have been decreasing steadily since the mid-1990s .This singular fact , more than any other , makes me believe there is something very wrong with the way we cover crime .Here are the charts , from Gallup : .Why is this ?What makes a person believe that crime is going up or down ?One answer is that - as experimental psychology research has consistently shown - people tend to reason from examples .When thinking about crime ( or most other things ) , we naturally call to mind specific notable incidents .We do n't think about overall rates , or compare the statistics to last year or to other life risks .By this standard , journalism naturally produces a highly skewed report of crime because journalism reports on the most heinous crimes .In Chicago in 1987 , fewer than a third of 684 homicides were reported in the daily papers .In Los Angeles County from 1990 to 1994 , it was 2782 out of 9442 ( 29 percent ) .In national papers in England and Wales 1993 to 1996 , it was 1,066 of 2,685 ( 40 percent ) .Smaller places often have a higher coverage rate , such as 163 out of 223 ( 73 percent ) in the Baltimore Sun in 2010 .Moreover , homicides command a disproportionate amount of coverage .Something in the range of 70 - 90 percent of crimes are property crimes , but coverage is dominated by violent crime .White - collar crime is also drastically undercovered , especially on TV news .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.977455"}
