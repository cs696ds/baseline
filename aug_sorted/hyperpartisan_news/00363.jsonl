{"text": "Surprisingly though , this is not a history lesson and more of a film about the two dudes who were in these famous series of interviews together .Director Ron Howard really gives it his all with this film because of the way he makes these interviews seem less like actual interviews and more like a boxing match of words between two famous figures .Howard keeps the tension building up and up on these interviews and gives us enough character development to realize just how much both of these people need these interviews .One for fame , the other for forgiveness and setting the record straight .Another great element to this film that makes it so damn watchable is that it 's script is very very good with a lot intelligence , wit , and small doses of humor to keep us laughing and entertained .I never actually saw the play that this is based off of but apparently everything is taken verbatim which makes the transition from stage to screen even better .The problem with this film that keeps it away from being anything perfect or amazing like it could have easily been is that I feel like Howard could have really went out - of - bounds with this film .I also never understood why Howard have the actors who portrayed these actual people , come off and randomly narrate what was happening and why .I feel like the film is trying to give a sort of documentary feel when in reality it could have just stayed away from that or even used the real - life people itself .We all know who the actors are and who the real people are , so there 's no need to trying to show us otherwise .Michael Sheen is a lot of fun to watch as David Frost because this guy is sometimes at the lowest points of his life , but no matter what keeps a big olde smile on his face .Sheen reminds me of that very cheeky , very corny , but always funny British guy that always seems to think he 's better than everybody , and usually is depending on who you are talking .However , this film really does belong to the one and only Frank Langella as Richard Nixon .Even though he does n't look like Nixon , Langella probably does the best performance / impersonation of the man that any other actor has ever done in their whole lives .Yes , Anthony Hopkins has played Nixon too , Langella is THAT GOOD .Consensus : Though it does n't achieve greatness , Frost / Nixon is still a great flick with two great performances , a clever script , and a direction from Howard that keeps this film tense and on its toes .First Ryan Gosling saves her , now Channing Tatum does .Lucky ass chick !Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum star as Paige and Leo , a recently married couple whose lives are devastated by a tragic car accident .When Paige loses all memory of her relationship with her husband , Leo vows to do whatever it takes to make her fall in love with him all over again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.704975"}

{"text": "Hey , I 'm not complaining that I got to see Alexis Dziena nakey - wakey but to me , it just seemed way too weird to have in a film that seemed to really base itself on the real events that would happen with something like this .There were many more moments like this ( well , not quite like this ) but this was the one I kept coming back to .Since Don Johnston is a very sad dude , the film relies solely on Bill Murray to play it subtle , which is something he can do perfectly .His character arc is pretty strong considering we do n't know much about this guy , but I felt like i really wanted to just because Murray can create so many emotions with just one look on his face .You can tell when he 's happy , sad , or just plain and simply hangin ' out being Bill Murray .Jeffrey Wright almost takes the show away from Murray as his fun - loving neighbor , Winston .Wright is the total opposite to Johnston which makes him the best character in the whole flick .His performance is obviously a lot of fun and he brings a lot of life to the flick whenever he 's on - screen or talking on the phone to Johnston .It blows that he was n't in the flick some more because whenever he was gone , you could really feel the energy sort of come and go .All of Don 's ex - girlyfriends are all played perfectly by older actresses that somehow find a way to make every performance different for all of their slightly different female characters that show a lot of Don 's life somehow .The story centers on New York City couple George and Linda ( Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston ) who are forced to relocate to Atlanta when George is downsized out of his job .Once there , the two stumble upon Elysium , a peculiar community populated by colorful characters who embrace a much simpler way of life .After checking out director David Wain 's last flick , ' Role Models ' , and actually liking it quite a bit , I went into this one expecting the same type of laughs .Oh who am I kidding , I went into this ready to see some naked ladies .However , what I got was naked dudes and a so - so comedy .Not a very good combo .As a comedy , this film works pretty well .All of the jokes here are very raunchy and dirty but also had me laughing quite a bit at times .Besides , it 's always funny to see hippies being hippies in their own natural habitat but it 's also a lot funnier to see two , normal American people be brought into this new and cool life - style .It 's not really trying to be anything else and it 's also pretty surprising to see hippies get the kind of treatment in today 's world as they did way back when .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.68753"}

Anderson , Mt.

{"text": "It gets worse .He made a guest appearance in at the Venetian last year with Pauly Shore .I 'd say that 's pretty much rock bottom .Monthly Archives : February 2012 .Main reason why Neeson should have just taken that Abraham Lincoln role .Liam Neeson stars as a man who regains consciousness after an auto accident only to discover that another man is impersonating him , and that no one - not even his wife ( January Jones ) - recognizes his identity as the real Dr. Martin Harris .Finding himself with an unexpected ally ( Diane Kruger ) , Harris struggles to solve the mystery and hang onto his own wits , while also being stalked by anonymous killers .The whole premise itself tries to be like a thriller that is meant for adults but could have even targeted at teenagers due to how silly it is .The whole first hour builds up on this premise and actually does a great job with it .I felt a lot of tension during this first hour as I did n't quite know what was going to happen next nor did I know where this film was going to end up , which is always a nice recipe for a good popcorn thriller .However , things just started getting way out - of - hand real quick .The plot twist itself was n't too bad and I actually think it kind of worked in a way but once it is revealed then everything starts to turn into the ridiculous action - thriller cliches that we are so used to seeing nowadays .It seems like director Jaume Collet - Sera just likes putting in plot twists that somehow work and make sense but then likes to knock them down with being predictable .He did it with ' Orphan ' and I guess he has n't learned much .Liam Neeson always tries his hardest with everything he ever appears in and his performance as Dr. Martin Harris , is no different .There are plenty of ridiculous and overboard things that he does but Neeson makes it seem believable just by being the way he is .Still , at age 59 , does n't seem a little unbelievable that this guy could still be considered an action star that can do half of the things that he does in all of his films .Maybe it 's time for him to start trying for Oscars again .The way the rest of the cast looks , makes this film seem like we were going to get a real treat but nobody really adds anything to this flick either .Heavenly Creatures is true story of two teenage girls ( Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey ) from New Zealand who form a very strong friendship that changes both of their lives as they live through their own imaginations .However , things start to get strange when their friendship turns into obsession , which soon leads into murder .The most disturbing aspect of this whole film is that this is an actual true story and while that is effed up in it 's own right , the chicks are still alive and well today , roaming the streets of only God knows where .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.82422"}

{"text": "I was angry with these people and personally when a film can do that to me , it 's pretty good .The only problem with this script is that for every chilling and good moment of emotion , there 's an almost unintentional funny moment that this film always seems to find .One of the highlights of this film and probably the best example of unintentional hilarity at it 's finest , is when Foster 's character goes into a party and absolutely beats the shit out of everyone around him , making him almost look like a ninja .The guy does a round - house kick to someones face , gets hit with a bottle then keeps going , and even knocks out a girl there or two .I mean this scene was awesome by how insane it was but it felt out - of - place for this film and was one of the various moments of unintentionally funny moments this film had .This ensemble cast though , I must say does a pretty good job as well .Anton Yelchin is actually amazing in this role as Zack , who has this sort of too sweet voice that makes him seem a little fruity and geeky at first , but instead has you totally feeling so many emotions for him even by the end .Yelchin 's great in this role because honestly shows what a tied - up kid would do if he was able to live a little and just party all the time , without having to worry about parents , responsibility , or grades for that matter .I felt like I was watching an actual kid on - screen the whole time and as it goes on the film gets more and more disturbing .Let , me also not forget that Olivia Wilde is in this too , showing off some pretty nice boooooobiesss too .And that 's always a watch in my book .My Left Foot tells the true story of Irishman Christy Brown ( Daniel Day - Lewis ) , who was born with cerebral palsy , only allowing him to only control only his left foot .The film follows Christy Brown over time where he soon becomes a writer , artist and builds strong relationships with his mother ( Brenda Fricker ) and the rest of his working - class family .Director Jim Sheridan does something with this pretty generic story , and make it actually very interesting to watch as if we 've never seen this type of plot ever done before .One of the main reasons being is the fact that it is not told like the regular Hollywood biopic where you get a whole bunch of cheesy montages , sentimental scenes , and moments that seem only made - for - film rather than sticking straight to the realistic approach .Sheridan is able to linger away from these conventions and I think that is why this film mainly works .Even though the film does try to set itself apart from what we usually see , the film still has great moments of inspiration mainly because this man , Christy Brown is such an extraordinary human - being , even if he was a little hard to handle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.94751"}

{"text": "Those damn Metal head stoners are always killing those girls for no reason .A troubled high school slacker , Samson ( Daniel Roebuck ) , kills his girlfriend for no particular reason and shows off her dead body to his friends Layne ( Crispin Glover ) and Matt ( Keanu Reeves ) , whose reactions vary about whether to involve the police .After watching ' Bully ' a long long time ago , I realized that there were more stories like that one out there , and it soon started to make me realize something : Teens love to kill people .Writer Neal Jimenez does a very good job at showing these kids as none other than complete alienated misfits , that do n't really have any effect from a murder of one of their own friends .You get the real idea that these kids have no idea what to do or even think after this shocking murder has just happened , and it seems like they also do n't even really care .This is a little shocking no matter how many years go by , but that ca n't be said about the rest of the film .Even though this film starts off very strong , it really starts to fall apart pretty easily .I 'm all down for a little bit of creepiness here and there but the real story at hand , seemed so much more interesting than what any of these little annoying sub - plots or happenings even showed .The gritty look of it has something to be admired , but many times I felt like the film could have been so much better with it 's real portrayal of these punk kids in a suburban town .These kids are alienated from the rest of the world around them , I get it , but please show me something that can actually glue me into the story rather than just drag me along .However , when I looked down on everything , I thought about the cast and that 's kind of when I eased up a bit since there are some real good performances here .Keanu Reeves plays his usual dumb - ass role here as Matt , but he does a great job with this character and gives a lot of his more emotional scenes , a believability that this character needed to actually work .The best performance from the whole cast is probably the one and only Crispin Glover as Layne , the total speed - freak that takes this whole film over with every scene he gets .Glover does a great job with this character because he 's doped out on his pills and weirdness that when it comes down to something real and dramatic like this murder , he does n't know what to do and panics every chance he has .Glover is perfect at creating this character that 's a little nutty , mean , raw , but also very emotionally attached to the world around him and was my favorite thing about this film .Check out ' Bully ' instead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.94272"}

{"text": "If we were to pay the total costs , it would be far too expensive an undertaking .Our grants are made to qualified individuals , mainly at universities and colleges that already have a sizeable research program .Thus our research grants supplement present ongoing plant research programs by supplying special funds to expand existing plant research programs to include research on the plants in which we are interested .We benefit because we share the use of high dollar items without incurring the total bills In the same manner , the programs at the various universities and colleges are enhanced by including our plants in their current programs .To conduct expanded research , it is only necessary to use present personnel and equipment on a cooperative basis .Grant recipients in turn benefit from extra funds placed at their disposal from our grants for their research .The small grants have other advantages .They can act as \" seed money \" in the sense that research administrators are encouraged to provide additional funds in support of rhododendron and azalea research .In other cases , our funds provide a salary for graduate student help , for temporary labor , or for travel which is often restricted , such as travel out of state for state employed researchers .In a few instances , our grants can be used for special equipment that facilitates both new research on rhododendrons and azaleas and the original research program .In brief , Research Foundation grants provide funds for rhododendron and azalea research to the mutual benefit of all concerned .The Research Foundation Needs Your Support Each year , requests for grant funds far exceed the dollars available from trust fund earnings .The ARS Research Committee in recent years has received more than thirty proposals per year .A maximum of ten proposals have been funded in any one year .This means that desirable proposals have been passed over .We are not able to fulfill the potential research demand .If the amount of money in the trust fund is augmented through increased giving by Society members , a larger number of grants can be supported yearly .In order for the program to continue to grow , it depends on today 's support from individuals through gifts , donations , endowments or legacies .Our giving today will support research for many tomorrows .Some Research Recently Sponsored By The ARS PUBLICATIONS 1 .More than 30 full length articles reporting the results of research funded wholly or in part by grants from the Research Foundation have been published in the ARS Journal ( formerly the Quarterly Bulletin ARS ) .These are usually identified by the special logo of the Research Foundation .One requirement of each grant is that the research results be submitted for publication in the ARS Journal .The book , Rhododendrons of China , was made possible by a grant of $ 1,800 to defray part of the costs of translation from the original Chinese .The American Rhododendron Society and the Rhododendron Species Foundation cooperated in the publication of this book .A Compendium of Rhododendron and Azalea Diseases , edited by Duane L.
