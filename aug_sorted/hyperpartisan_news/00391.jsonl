{"text": "MSF Calls on Moroccan Government , EU , to Address Needs of Sexual Violence Victims .Rabat / Barcelona / New York -- March 25 , 2010 --Sub - Saharan migrant women are enduring various forms of sexual violence in their countries of origin and while en route to Europe , with many forced to flee their homes because of violent conflict or to escape forced marriages or domestic violence .Women face further abuse and sexual violence on their journey northward .In Morocco they are frequently subjected to sexual exploitation in the form of prostitution .Few of them dare to speak out about what they have suffered .MSF is concerned that information gathered by its medical teams in Morocco represents only a small fraction of a large - scale sexual violence problem that has , to date , gone unaddressed by Moroccan authorities and European Union countries .Special Report .Between May 2009 and January 2010 , one out of three women treated by MSF in Rabat and Casablanca admitted to having been subjected to one or more sexual attacks , either in their country of origin , on their journey , and/or in Morocco .MSF gathered testimonies from 63 patients , of which over 21 percent were minors .These testimonies illustrate the extreme vulnerability of these women throughout their journey .\" The Moroccan Government needs to improve the care provided to Sub - Saharan migrants who are victims of sexual violence in their territory , \" said Alfonso Verd\u00fa , head of MSF operations in Morocco . \" European Union countries need to be aware of the serious consequences their increasingly restrictive migration and asylum policies have on the health and safety of migrants , particularly the most vulnerable : women and young girls . \" In Morocco , MSF teams treat people such as O.A. , a 26-year - old Congolese woman who fled the conflict in her country after being raped by a group of men .Since she had no passport , a truck driver offered to smuggle her from Mauritania into Morocco under the seat of his truck .On the way , the truck stopped in the middle of the desert .\" The driver and his friend started to argue and then the driver got closer to me and hit me , \" recounted O.A. \" When I fell down , he squeezed my breasts and insulted me .Then the friend of the driver raped me .I screamed but no one could hear me , we were in the desert .When they finished , they fled .\" She managed to reach Morocco with the help of another driver .The border between Maghnia , in Algeria , and Oujda , in Morocco , constitutes a particularly dangerous part of the journey .Of the 63 women interviewed by MSF , 59 percent reported being sexually assaulted there .Although the border with Algeria remains officially closed , the Moroccan security forces still expel migrants to that area .Expulsions tend to take place at night , increasing the likelihood of attacks .T.D. , a 19-year old woman , was arrested by the police when she was going to the market in Oujda and transferred to the police station where there were another 28 Sub - Saharan migrants .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.655594"}

{"text": "The new political prioritisation of borders has been shaped by various factors , from economic insecurity and anxieties about national identity to law enforcement and security concerns .Today Europe 's immigration controls are no longer limited to the continent 's territorial frontiers but extend both inside and outside the continent .Devastating consequences .This system has had devastating consequences for the people it is designed to exclude .At least 15,000 migrants have died attempting to cross the EU 's maritime and land borders .Men , women and children have drowned in the Mediterranean and the Aegean , frozen to death in the mountains of Slovakia and Poland , or been blown up in minefields along the Greek - Turkish border .Migrants have also fallen from trucks and trains , or killed themselves to escape detention or deportation or because they were reduced to stateless destitution .Such deaths have since become so routine that even the most spectacular tragedies increasingly attract little more than cursory media attention .European governments frequently attribute the horrific migrant death toll to the ruthlessness and cynicism of traffickers and people smugglers - and not always without reason .But the death toll on the continent 's borders has become a kind of collateral damage in an undeclared ' war ' that treats undocumented migrants as criminal and harmful intruders to be kept at bay through a quasi - military enforcement effort .The moral condemnation of the people - smuggling industry ignores the fact that that migrants make use of such services in order to find a way through the gauntlet of obstacles that have been placed in their path .It also tends to overlook the demand for undocumented migrant labour in key sectors of the European economy - a demand that is often enhanced by the fact that illegal workers have few or no legal protections .European governments do not want migrants dying on the continent 's borders .But their common determination to prevent or at least slow down the pace of migration has in practice created pockets of impunity , in which the worst things can happen to migrants but no one is ever responsible or accountable for them .In 2005 at least 13 African migrants were shot or fell to their deaths when Spanish and Moroccan security forces attempted to prevent mass crossings of the border fences in Spain 's Moroccan exclaves at Ceuta and Melilla .To date neither the Moroccan nor Spanish security forces have accepted responsibility for these deaths .In the Aegean and the Mediterranean , there have been a disturbing number of incidents in which coastguard and naval vessels from various countries are alleged to have rammed migrant boats or refused to rescue their passengers .Such allegations have tended to produce inconclusive investigations , insofar as they have been investigated at all .These incidents can not be considered the norm .Thousands of migrants have indeed been rescued at sea by European coastguard officers and naval personnel .Undermining Europe 's principles .These priorities have remorselessly ground away at the principles that supposedly define the European Union , in ways that are not always visible to the general public .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.05255"}
