Brodie laid the cornerstone of the pedestal of the statue of \" Liberty Enlightening the World \" with full Masonic ceremony .On November 13 , 1884 Bartholdi delivered a lecture and gave the Lodge a report on the history and various methods used in the execution of the statue .Again the Lodge witnessed his emotion when he came back from his visit to the United States in 1887 , and he told them of the ardent welcome he had received and of the wide enthusiasm created by his work .Lady Liberty was the focal point of waves of immigrants , who came ( and still come ) to the shores of the United States from all over the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.30013"}

Christie refers to are illegally holding 11.5 MILLION jobs that belong to Americans and naturalized citizens .Shame on you , Gov. Christie for thumbing your nose at our federal immigration laws and encouraging even more criminals to break into our country .Roll out the welcome mat .Unemployment in New Jersey is holding at a steady 9.3 % .Gov. Christie apparently does n't care if jobs go to illegal aliens instead of legal citizens in his state .After all , they 're simply \" undocumented \" .# 2 Wages For American Workers Will Continue To Decline .When you have a lot more workers competing for the same number of jobs , what happens ?That is right - wages go down .We are seeing this happen in industry after industry .For example , several decades ago a roofer could live a nice middle class lifestyle and support an entire family on one income .But today that is no longer the case .So what has changed ?A flood of illegal labor has entered the marketplace .# 3 Illegal Immigrants Will Overwhelm Our Welfare System .Every year , illegal immigrants receive tens of billions of dollars in welfare payments .They get free food assistance , free housing assistance , free health care benefits and free education for their children .Life is good if you are an illegal immigrant and you know how to game the system .In fact , many cities in United States now openly advertise that they will help illegal immigrants with these things .Unfortunately , according to Devvy Kidd the cost to taxpayers is getting to be astronomical .... .Last year alone , the cost to taxpayers of LA County was whopping $ 600 MILLION dollars in welfare for children of illegal aliens .I guess it does n't bother the people there getting fleeced in taxes to pay for all that welfare because they continue to elect governors who refuse to lock down the border and sympathizers of the invasion across the southern border of California to their legislature .Overall , it has been estimated that U.S. taxpayers spend $ 12,000,000,000 a year on primary and secondary school education for the children of illegal immigrants .# 4 Mexican Drug Cartels Will Establish A Presence In Nearly Every City In The United States .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.14055"}

{"text": "Second , the policy has exacerbated divisions within the EU .Merkel did not consult widely before her August offer of refuge , which waived the usual Dublin treaty limitation that would send asylum seekers back to the first country through which they entered the continent .Coming from Europe 's economic powerhouse , the offer immediately attracted tens of thousands of additional asylum seekers , including a great many non - Syrians .It put them on the move through transit countries that were unwarned and ill - equipped to assume the logistical burdens .Not surprisingly , those governments resented the situation , and some , notably Hungary , responded with razor wire .Third , without the Dublin limitation , the only apparent mechanism to discourage or restrain the flow is cruel and sometimes lethal - though this was not the conscious intention .One observer at a transit point near the Greece - Macedonian border innocently asked what should be an obvious question : : \" Why do people have to walk 3,000 kilometers ?Only the fittest and the strongest will make it . \"Having to get to Germany on one 's own has meant that thousands entrusted their fates to smugglers , who often supplied flimsy dinghies or dangerous sealed trucks for the journey .The fourth problem , security risks , became apparent in the aftermath of the terrorist murders in Paris .Some attackers appear to have come to France as part of the disorderly flow through Greece .Transit states have tried to do basic registration as migrants pass through , but the circumstances preclude effective security checks .The fifth problem is perhaps the most alarming in the long run .Right - wing anti - immigrant parties have found a fear - mongering bonanza that has greatly enhanced their electoral chances .Besides the security angle , they can use those staggering scenes of trudging masses filling one lane of a superhighway or being herded in thick columns through pastures and cornfields as proof that ruling parties have lost control of borders .If humane leaders do n't get out in front of this soon , they may be replaced in several countries by hard - liners implementing rejectionist policies along the lines of Hungary 's .The trick for Merkel is to pull back from the hastily imposed August policy in a way that reassures a restive citizenry , but keeps alive genuine protection opportunities .The vague changes sketched so far seem unlikely to match the challenge .A better alternative is available , but it requires an expansion of traditional European thinking .To explore such an alternative , imagine what might have happened if Merkel 's advisors had given her some different options when she signaled in August that she wanted to rescue hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees .The most logical step , one might have thought , would be to set up processing in the first - asylum countries hosting nearly 4 million Syrians - Turkey , Lebanon , and Jordan - and then move approved refugees to Germany or other participating states .German or EU officers could screen for security risks there , before relocation , rather than months later , after an asylum seeker was already resident in Europe .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.41066"}
