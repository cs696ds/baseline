{"text": "Six days before Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh was supposed to be executed in 2001 , then U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft had to put the execution on hold - thanks to the FBI .The problem : the FBI had withheld thousands of documents , including potential witness statements , from McVeigh 's defense attorneys .The mishap provoked a wave of criticism within the FBI itself , especially when public speculation centered on the possibility that the withheld documents could jeopardize the government 's conviction of McVeigh .Several FBI agents publicly questioned their bureau 's actions , and one even called the withholding of documents obstruction of justice .Another agent said the FBI had a \" cultural problem \" that was jeopardizing the bureau 's reputation and ability to do its job .In the end , the document scandal did not derail the execution of McVeigh , who was put to death a few weeks later .The FBI 's attempt to foster intelligence sharing between it and the private sector came under fire after The Progressive reported that the program had given participants the power to shoot - to - kill .The claim was based on the account of one member of InfraGard , a network involving thousands of companies and other organizations that share and receive top - secret information with the FBI .In response to the shoot - to - kill declaration , an FBI official in Washington refuted the claim , saying the bureau had in no way deputized InfraGard members to carry out such actions during the imposition of martial law .In November 2001 , InfraGard had approximately 1,700 members .By January 2008 , InfraGard had 23,682 members , including 350 of the nation 's Fortune 500 corporations .Having overstepped its bounds , the FBI is now faced with threats by lawmakers and even President Bush to clamp down on the bureau 's domestic spying .Following 9/11 , the federal government adopted the Patriot Act which , among other things , gave the FBI increasing leeway to investigate suspected terrorists without court approval .At the center of concerns are what 's known as National Security Letters which the FBI used to demand information from businesses and individuals without a court order .Lawmakers from both parties called for new limits that would curtail the FBI from improperly obtaining telephone logs , banking records and other personal information on thousands of Americans .Fine also found that the FBI had arranged for several leading telephone companies to allow the agency to ask for information on more than 3,000 phone numbers - often without a subpoena , without an emergency or even without an investigative case .In 2006 , the FBI then issued blanket letters authorizing many of the requests retroactively .Both Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York and Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania threatened to introduce legislation to amend the Patriot Act to prevent the FBI or other federal law enforcement offices from abusing the Letters of National Security .Ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks , the FBI 's intelligence gathering ability has been questioned .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.61162"}

Heintze Jr. said , \" While it is not prudent to discuss the issues before the court , the principles under which we operate date back to 1901 .The same principles have been applied to the protection of our presidents and world leaders for generations .\" During private meetings , sources said , Merletti told officials from Starr 's office and the Treasury and Justice departments that trust and proximity to a president are crucial to protecting him .If a president asks an agent to stand a few feet away to allow him to talk without being overheard , Merletti reportedly said , it could keep the agent from being close enough to stop a bullet .To make that case , the service ran through the history of assassination attempts , showing instances where they succeeded or failed , possibly depending on how close agents were to an intended victim .Sources said they produced rare photographs of John F. Kennedy 's fateful 1963 motorcade through Dallas , where agents were not standing on running boards on the back of his exposed automobile when shots rang out because the president several days before had ordered them not to .By contrast , service officials displayed pictures showing agents standing right next to Ronald Reagan during the 1981 assassination attempt , enabling them to push him immediately into a car and evacuate him before he was hit by more than a single bullet .In its court papers , the service has agreed its agents have an obligation to report any criminal activity they may witness , even by the president , but makes a distinction at discussing events that , by themselves , are not illegal .To Starr and his deputies , however , the agents are law enforcement officers duty - bound to cooperate with any criminal investigation .Some legal experts also suggested that the Secret Service position could be seen as inconsistent because it does not seek blanket protection .If testifying about a president 's actions would diminish trust and endanger his life , they said , then it would do so whether or not it involved criminal activity .The Secret Service argument also could be undercut by the fact that several officers already have given sworn grand jury testimony in a separate Starr investigation into the July 1993 suicide of White House deputy counsel Vincent W.

Mitchell Palmer , assisted with investigating suspected anarchists and communists .In 1919 , William J. Flynn , former head of the Secret Service , became Director of the Bureau of Investigation and was the first to use that title .Flynn would serve five years as director .During that time , Washington was awash in political scandals emanating from the administration of Warren G. Harding , including the infamous Teapot Dome scandal which destroyed the president 's reputation .Following Harding 's death in 1923 , Calvin Coolidge assumed the presidency and replaced many of Harding 's disgraced cabinet members .For the new Attorney General , Coolidge appointed attorney Harlan Fiske Stone .Stone then selected Hoover to head the Bureau of Investigation in 1924 .When Hoover took over , the Bureau of Investigation had approximately 650 employees , including 441 Special Agents who worked in field offices in nine cities .By the end of the decade , there were approximately 30 field offices , with divisional headquarters in New York , Baltimore , Atlanta , Cincinnati , Chicago , Kansas City , San Antonio , San Francisco and Portland .Hoover fired any agents he deemed unqualified and adopted important changes to the bureau 's operations .For instance , the bureau 's seniority rule of promotion was abolished , replaced by uniform performance appraisals .In January 1928 , Hoover established a formal training course for new agents and mandated an age requirement of 25 - 35 for new recruits .He also gave preference to agents with law or accounting experience .The following year , 1929 , the stock market crashed , ushering in the Great Depression and an era of increased crime .It was during the 1930s that the bureau began to earn a national reputation and Hoover solidified his law enforcement empire .Noting the widespread interest of the media to report on crime , Hoover began to use newspapers to carry his message that the Bureau of Investigation was working to secure the safety of honest Americans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.90997"}

Mitchell Palmer , assisted with investigating suspected anarchists and communists .In 1919 , William J. Flynn , former head of the Secret Service , became Director of the Bureau of Investigation and was the first to use that title .Flynn would serve five years as director .During that time , Washington was awash in political scandals emanating from the administration of Warren G. Harding , including the infamous Teapot Dome scandal which destroyed the president 's reputation .Following Harding 's death in 1923 , Calvin Coolidge assumed the presidency and replaced many of Harding 's disgraced cabinet members .For the new Attorney General , Coolidge appointed attorney Harlan Fiske Stone .Stone then selected Hoover to head the Bureau of Investigation in 1924 .When Hoover took over , the Bureau of Investigation had approximately 650 employees , including 441 Special Agents who worked in field offices in nine cities .By the end of the decade , there were approximately 30 field offices , with divisional headquarters in New York , Baltimore , Atlanta , Cincinnati , Chicago , Kansas City , San Antonio , San Francisco and Portland .Hoover fired any agents he deemed unqualified and adopted important changes to the bureau 's operations .For instance , the bureau 's seniority rule of promotion was abolished , replaced by uniform performance appraisals .In January 1928 , Hoover established a formal training course for new agents and mandated an age requirement of 25 - 35 for new recruits .He also gave preference to agents with law or accounting experience .The following year , 1929 , the stock market crashed , ushering in the Great Depression and an era of increased crime .It was during the 1930s that the bureau began to earn a national reputation and Hoover solidified his law enforcement empire .Noting the widespread interest of the media to report on crime , Hoover began to use newspapers to carry his message that the Bureau of Investigation was working to secure the safety of honest Americans .In 1932 , the first issue of the FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin - then called Fugitives Wanted by Police , was published .High profile cases such as the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby in 1932 gave Hoover 's bureau a chance to involve itself in a case that received constant media attention .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.705505"}

Bush wanted a solution that relied on the market rather than on government regulation .So in the Clean Air Act of 1990 , he proposed a plan that would cap sulfur - dioxide emissions but let the market decide how to allocate the permits .That was \" more compatible with economic growth than using only the command and control approaches of the past , \" he said .The plan passed easily , with \" aye \" votes from Sen. Mitch McConnell and then - Rep .Newt Gingrich , among others .In fact , as recently as 2007 , Gingrich said that \" if you have mandatory carbon caps combined with a trading system , much like we did with sulfur . . .it 's something I would strongly support . \"As for the 1990 budget deal , Bush initially resisted tax increases , but eventually realized they were necessary to get the job done .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.870895"}

Heneghan of the West Precinct was visiting Baily at the hospital , and a nurse confronted him , records show .She asked the sergeant why Baily was n't being tested for alcohol when one of the other drivers was under police guard and being blood - tested , records show .Heneghan then noticed the odor of alcohol near Baily , the report said .Heneghan did n't write down the woman 's name , and police were never able to identify her .Heneghan alerted accident investigators about 5:30 a.m. .At that point , police investigators could have blood - tested and processed Baily for DUI , but they did n't .Seattle attorney Paul Cullen , a DUI specialist , said the law would n't have prevented Baily 's prosecution .He said experts can scientifically show that a person was drunk at the time they were driving , using blood - alcohol evidence gathered by police 3 1/2 hours later .Later that day , a lieutenant told internal investigators about the nurse 's comments .The city attorney later considered prosecuting Baily - a police union board member - for DUI .He considered using tests on blood vials that a paramedic and the hospital staff routinely collected from Baily right after the accident , but concluded that the evidence would n't stand up in court .Finding Baily 's case was difficult .When the Police Department released a stack of internal investigative records to the P - I - including Baily 's - the accused officers ' names were blacked out , as the city 's contract with the police union dictates .But Baily 's name was visible on a sheet mentioning his three - day suspension for , among other things , \" use of alcohol \" in his department car .The report noted that the accident was n't his fault , and , indeed , it was n't .Lynnwood defense lawyer Jim Feldman , who represented the inebriated man who ran a red light and hit Baily 's car , told the P - I that he had felt Baily deserved a DUI citation .He said Baily 's unofficial test reading was higher than that of his client , who was prosecuted .Records ultimately confirmed that his client 's blood - alcohol level was 0.10 and Baily was between 0.12 and 0.15 .Three weeks after the accident , SPD internal investigators with a search warrant obtained three vials of Baily 's blood and test results from Harborview Medical Center .The state toxicology lab tested it .Selected for evidence was the lowest reading , which was from the first vial drawn less than a half - hour after the accident .An investigator , Sgt .Mike Teeter , and supervising assistant city attorney Mike Finkle explored a possible DUI case , but in July 2003 Finkle wrote a memo concluding that it was n't possible .He noted that blood collected by the hospital was n't preserved or handled in the way courts require .Finkle based his decision largely on technical opinions by Ann - Marie Gordon , manager of the state toxicology lab .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.72112"}

{"text": "STATE LEGISLATION & LOBBYING Law enforcement groups use their significant political clout , based largely on financial resources .According to a 1992 study by California Common Cause , law enforcement groups in that state contributed $ 1.2 million to local lawmakers between 1989 and 1991 .[ L]aw enforcement groups also hold the potent weapon of campaign endorsements , the study noted . ...If legislators vote against bills supported by police interests , they know they run the risk of being labeled as ' soft on crime , ' even if the legislation has nothing to do with public safety .The last thing a legislator wants in an election year is to lose the endorsement of police groups , or worse yet , wind up on their hit list .In California , and other states , law enforcement groups have used this clout to pass a Police Officer Bill of Rights that grants privileges to cops during disciplinary processes privileges not available to suspects whom the same officers may have arrested or questioned .The Bill of Rights proposed in Pennsylvania , for example , restricts non - department questioning of officers and prohibits anonymous complaints .Others require that complaints be removed from personnel files after a few years and restrict the types of behavior that can trigger disciplinary action .In 1992 and again this year , California legislators proposed major amendments to that state 's Bill of Rights Act imposing a one - year statute of limitation from the time of the complaint to the date of punitive action .Given normal backlog and lengthy appeal delays , this limit would have virtually guaranteed immunity from discipline .Massive organized opposition from the ACLU and other groups defeated the proposed legislation .Since 1986 , when the federal Fair Labor Standards Act was applied to public employees , most police unions have argued that the issue of citizen involvement in individual officer discipline falls under collective bargaining and thus involves only two parties : the union and the employer .This position omits entirely the role of a public justifiably concerned that police will act abusively or unlawfully and that their superiors will not take appropriate disciplinary action .The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized this right of the public to participate .Since collective bargaining is not an appropriate process for the full consideration of the issues raised in a complaint by a citizen against a police officer , it ruled , effective citizen review is essential to maintaining the public trust and disciplining police abuses .N ot all rulings have been as sympathetic to public involvement .In 1992 , the Spokane ( Washington )City Council established a citizen review process giving citizens the right to appeal whenever the police chief refused to discipline an officer after a complaint .The police union fought back with a complaint to the state 's Public Employment Relations Commission .It alleged that the City had unilaterally changed procedures and by publicly disclosing disciplinary information , had invaded the officers ' privacy rights , something that inherently constitutes a working condition .T he Emploment Relations Commission agreed with the union that changes in disciplinary procedures were subject to collective bargaining .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.832214"}

Mattei presented the government 's evidence against Braddock for a jury of five men and three women .Mattei , in his opening arguments , stressed the importance of a transparent election finance system .Braddock is charged with helping to submit a false report to the Federal Elections Commission , the agency charged with maintaining a clean elections system . \" As American citizens we have a right to know something about our candidates .We have a right to know who gives them money and how much , \" Mattei said .Throughout Monday 's proceedings , Mattei played snippets of what he said amounted to hours of recorded conversations collected through wiretaps on personal phones and audio equipment covertly attached to cooperating witnesses .Paul Rogers , a smoke shop owner who has already entered a guilty plea , also testified .Braddock 's lawyer , Frank Riccio II , did not dispute that tobacco shop owners had conspired to try to funnel money into Donovan 's campaign .However , he argued that the government could not prove that his client was aware of illegal activity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.92752"}

{"text": "Obamacare .If Mitt Romney had won , we can be sure that Republicans would have found a way to prevent these tax hikes .And we can now see what happened because he did n't .According to the new tables , the average income tax rate for 99 percent of Americans barely changed from 2012 to 2013 , but the tax rate for the top 1 percent rose by more than four percentage points .The tax rise was even bigger for very high incomes : 6.5 percentage points for the top 0.01 percent .These numbers are n't enough to give us a full picture of taxes at the top , which requires taking account of other taxes , especially taxes on corporate profits that indirectly affect the income of stockholders .But the available numbers are consistent with Congressional Budget Office projections of the effects of the 2013 tax increases - projections which said that the effective federal tax rate on the 1 percent would rise roughly back to its pre - Reagan level .No , really : for top incomes , Mr. Obama has effectively rolled back not just the Bush tax cuts but Ronald Reagan 's as well .The point , of course , was not to punish the rich but to raise money for progressive priorities , and while the 2013 tax hike was n't gigantic , it was significant .Those higher rates on the 1 percent correspond to about $ 70 billion a year in revenue .This happens to be in the same ballpark as both food stamps and budget office estimates of this year 's net outlays on Obamacare .So we 're not talking about something trivial .Speaking of Obamacare , that 's another thing Republicans would surely have killed if 2012 had gone the other way .Instead , the program went into effect at the beginning of 2014 .And the effect on health care has been huge : according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the number of uninsured Americans fell 17 million between 2012 and the first half of 2015 , with further declines most likely ahead .So the 2012 election had major consequences .America would look very different today if it had gone the other way .Now , to be fair , some widely predicted consequences of Mr. Obama 's re - election - predicted by his opponents - did n't happen .Gasoline prices did n't soar .Stocks did n't plunge .In other words , the 2012 election did n't just allow progressives to achieve some important goals .It also gave them an opportunity to show that achieving these goals is feasible .No , asking the rich to pay somewhat more in taxes while helping the less fortunate wo n't destroy the economy .So now we 're heading for another presidential election .And once again the stakes are high .Whoever the Republicans nominate will be committed to destroying Obamacare and slashing taxes on the wealthy - in fact , the current G.O.P. tax - cut plans make the Bush cuts look puny .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.28833"}

Mitt Romney passed an individual mandate in Massachusetts and drove its number of uninsured below 5 percent .The Clean Air Act of 1990 solved the sulfur - dioxide problem .The 1990 budget deal helped cut the deficit and set the stage for a remarkable run of growth .Rather , it appears that as Democrats moved to the right to pick up Republican votes , Republicans moved to the right to oppose Democratic proposals .It has become a sad truth that there is no longer a progressive party in the United States ( although there are still a few progressives in the Democratic Party ) .We have a center - right party in the Democrats and a far - right party in the Republicans .It 's no wonder that the American people are disappointed and discouraged by the Democrats , because they do n't offer much real change from the failed policies of the Republicans .Why then do the Republicans oppose everything proposed by Obama and the Democrats ( since they are just revived Republican programs ) ?That 's easy .The Republicans made a decision to oppose everything Obama tried to do .They believe that is their path to a return to power .The sad fact is that Obama could adopt everything in the current Republican platform , and the Republicans would just move further to the right and vote to oppose it .They are truly the party of NO -- even voting no to their own policies .And even sadder is the fact that Obama , in an effort to be \" bipartisan \" , has moved further to the right to please them .I wish I could say that a big Democratic victory in 2012 would set things right , and we would see the Democrats pass some progressive legislation .But I do n't really believe that .America , and both its parties have moved right of center -- and until the people wake up and demand change , the country is in for a hard time ( and a continuing recession ) .That 's just the way things are right now .It is a sad fact in this country that a majority of Republicans ( and far too many of the general public ) believe that President Obama was either not born in the United States or that there is some doubt that he was born here .This is because of conspiracy theorists called \" birthers \" ( who just are unable to accept that an African - American was elected president by the people of the U.S. ) .The folks at CNN have decided to settle this question once and for all .They sent a reporter to Hawaii to find the truth , and discover if there is even a grain of truth to the questions posed by the \" birthers \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.67145"}

{"text": "Here is how Republicans answered the survey : .MITT ROMNEY would / might vote for ...............69 % would not vote for ................ 26 % .MIKE HUCKABEE would / might vote for ...............69 % would not vote for ............... 22 % .SARAH PALIN would / might vote for ............... 60 % would not vote for ............... 37 % .DONALD TRUMP would / might vote for ............... 52 % would not vote for ............... 46 % .Of course the deciding factor will be in who shows up at the polls during the state primaries and caucuses .Candidates like Palin and Trump ( and Bachmann and Santorum ) might be better placed than some of us think , because the teabagger element is almost sure to vote .It remains to be seen if more moderate Republicans ( if there still are many left in the party ) will vote in as large a numbers as the teabaggers .Some people are celebrating the decision of the Minnesota judge to end the NFL lock - out , and some even say there is a much better chance the full season will be played now .I 'm not so sure .There is no doubt that the owners will appeal this judge 's decision to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals -- a court generally considered to be much more conservative and business - oriented ( since most of those judges were appointed by Republicans ) .The truth is that the lock - out might or might not be continued , but either way the owners and players are no closer to solving their disagreement .But what confuses me today are the seemingly inconsistent actions of the judge .Just a couple of weeks ago she demanded that the NFL and the union ( ? ) continue their negotiations through mediation -- a mediation scheduled to continue about the middle of May.Then she issued her opinion that said the owners could not lock out the players .They could have locked out a union , but she ruled the union was legally decertified and the NFL could not lock out what is now essentially about 1900 individual players .Do n't these two positions seem to be diametrically opposed ?If there is no union , then how can negotiations continue ?How can the owners be expected to negotiate with an entity that does not exist ?If the former union is now nothing more than sort of a social club composed of 1900 individuals who are under no obligation to obey the dictates of that social club , then would n't the owners have to negotiate with all 1900 players individually ?The judge has ordered the two sides to continue negotiating , but said the players have no union authorized to do that negotiating .This makes no sense .Either there is a union or not -- and if there is n't then each player would have the right and responsibility to negotiate on his own , and the league would have the right to make all the rules that would bind all the clubs and players .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "117.34782"}
{"text": "Here are the results of that poll : .This is quite different from this same survey when it was taken in January 2011 .Back then it showed : .Mitt Romney ............... 24 % Sarah Palin ............... 19 % Mike Huckabee ............... 17 % Newt Gingrich ............... 11 % .Of course it is still very early and no candidate has yet been able to separate himself / herself from the pack .But it is interesting that Trump 's newfound popularity seems to have come mainly at the expense of Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin .Both have dropped precipitously in this poll since January .But while Trump 's birtherism has played well among the Republicans ( especially the teabaggers ) , it has not done his TV show any good at all .Some have said he is just playing at being a candidate so boost the viewership of his TV show ( The Apprentice ) .If that is true , then it has been an abysmal failure .He has lost at least 2 million viewers in the last couple of weeks ( when he became very public with his birther views ) .How can that be ?Well , it turns out that the TV show was more popular among liberals than conservatives .And his birther view ( racism ) is not selling well to the TV show demographic .I doubt it will happen , but I would love to see the Republicans nominate Donald Trump or Sarah Palin ( or even Michele Bachmann ) .It would not only make for a fun campaign , but would be the best present Democrats could get .The teabagger Republicans are running the state of Texas .They have their man in the governor 's mansion and have fairly large majorities in both houses of the legislature .So it should n't surprise anyone that some new gun laws would be proposed -- and I do n't mean laws that would restrict ownership or carrying of guns , but instead these would be laws loosening the gun regulations .The only real surprise is that no new gun laws have passed the legislature yet .For a while it looked like they would pass a law allowing adults to carry concealed weapons on college campuses ( even though most college presidents and officials lobbied hard against that bill ) .But a parliamentary procedure has kept that bill from coming to the floor of the senate for a vote .A bill can not come to the floor unless at least 22 senators vote to allow it to come up for a vote , and the bill 's sponsor ( Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio ) was only able to corral about 20 votes .It looked like that bill might be dead , but NRA - type Republicans are nothing if not persistent .Wentworth found a bill that he thought could get to the senate floor ( a bill to allow colleges more flexibility in funding rules ) and tried to take his own bill onto it as an amendment .An amendment only needs 16 votes and he could easily get that many .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "128.67848"}
