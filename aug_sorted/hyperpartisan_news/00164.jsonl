{"text": "This letter is an attempt to do so .The powers and limitations of the government concerning religious matters are controlled mainly by the two religion clauses in the First Amendment to the US Constitution , which states : \" Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .\" The first part of that phrase is known as the establishment clause , and the second part as the free exercise clause .Sixteen simple words that guarantee religious liberty in the United States , and which have spawned thousands of pages of writings and numerous Supreme Court cases .Based on Supreme Court precedent , the establishment clause prevents the government from endorsing one religion over another , or endorsing religion in general over non - religion ( and vice versa ) .In a nutshell , the government must be neutral in matters of religion .The free exercise clause guarantees an individual 's right to practice their religion as they see fit ( or not practice any at all ) without interference or persecution from the government .Concerning religion in the public schools , the idea that \" we do not allow ( God ) to be mentioned or even hinted to in our schools \" is untrue .Students can practice their religion and express their faith individually or among their peers as long as is does not disrupt the school or classroom .Teachers and other staff can also practice their religion and express their faith individually or among their peers .This is protected by the free exercise clause of the Constitution .The only things that are prohibited are religious activities sponsored or endorsed by the school , or performed publicly in the school by representatives of the school .Concerning President Obama taking his oath of office using two Bibles , the US Constitution explicitly spells out the oath for the President in article II , section 1 .It is : \" I do solemnly swear ( or affirm ) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my Ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States .\" As you can see , there is no requirement to swear this oath using a Bible or any other text .That President Obama chose to swear the oath using two Bibles ( one belonged to Abraham Lincoln and the other to Martin Luther King , Jr. ) was his personal choice and is protected by the free exercise clause of the Constitution .Also , since the inauguration is a privately funded and organized event the establishment clause does not apply .Concerning displaying the Ten Commandments in our courts , doing so would clearly be an endorsement of religion by the government and is therefore prohibited by the establishment clause .Displaying one version only ( there are differences between the Jewish , Catholic , and Protestant versions ) would be a government endorsement of one religion over another and is also prohibited .There are some grey areas in what the government is , and is not , allowed to do concerning religious matters but the overall ideas are very clear thanks to the US Constitution and many precedents set by the courts on its interpretation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "27.72139"}

{"text": "Notice the actual language of the First Amendment : \" Congress shall make no law ... \" .As one of many efforts to limit the power of the federal government , the Constitution left authority over religious matters to the States .The Supreme Court consistently adhered to this constitutional principle until well into the twentieth century .But in the 1925 ruling , Gitlow v. New York , the Supreme Court began ignoring its predecessors and precedents .The Court reasoned that one of the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment was to extend the Bill of Rights to the States .( This would obviously expand the powers of the federal courts to a great degree . )The history of the Fourteenth Amendment does not support their contention , nor do the earlier Courts .Nonetheless , the 1925 Court ignored the historical record and the opinions of their predecessors , establishing a new precedent .Gitlow dealt with freedom of speech and the press ; religious matters would soon follow .In the context of religion , the Court 's first and most abusive reinterpretation began in a 1940 Supreme Court ruling , Cantwell v. Connecticut .Here , the Court applied the \" free exercise \" clause of the First Amendment to the states .Again , religion was a State matter .State courts were , and are , completely capable of handling the issue .Nevertheless , the Supreme Court , in direct opposition to the original intentions of the Constitution , applied yet another portion of the Bill of Rights to the States .They did not stop there .The next landmark ruling came down in 1947 .In the case , Everson v. Board of Education , the Supreme Court applied the \" establishment clause \" of the First Amendment to the states .In the context of the \" separation of church and state , \" the Court 's foundational reinterpretation of the Constitution was complete .From 1947 forward , the Court has ruled with regularity on religious issues , in direct violation of the original meaning of the First Amendment .Their rulings , and those of lower courts ( federal and State ) have become the \" law \" of \" separation of church and state .\" That was a very brief description of how the federal courts have taken authority over religious issues , reinterpreting the First Amendment and applying it to the States by way of the Fourteenth Amendment .All of this was done in clear violation of the actual wording of the Constitution , as well as the intentions of its framers .The modern concept of \" separation of church and state \" can not be justified using the historical record .We are forced , however , to work with the existing court doctrines .Therefore , what does the phrase mean today as it is applied in American public policy ?The First Amendment , which prohibited any \" law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , \" has evolved into something entirely new .During the last generation , the courts , at all levels , have ruled in ways that essentially guarantee the freedom from religion , instead of the freedom of religion . \" Separation of church and state , \" as applied to education , means that a prayer at a graduation ceremony is unconstitutional .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "34.823708"}

Established Religions in the American Colonies .English settlers in the colonies promptly established their religions .In Massachusetts , where they established the Congregational Church , only church members could vote between 1631 - 1664 ; dissenters ( Roger Williams , etc . ) were banished ; and between 1650 - 1670 , Quakers were whipped , imprisoned , banished , and put to death .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "37.932045"}

New York , the Supreme Court began ignoring its predecessors and precedents .The Court reasoned that one of the purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment was to extend the Bill of Rights to the States .( This would obviously expand the powers of the federal courts to a great degree . )The history of the Fourteenth Amendment does not support their contention , nor do the earlier Courts .Nonetheless , the 1925 Court ignored the historical record and the opinions of their predecessors , establishing a new precedent .Gitlow dealt with freedom of speech and the press ; religious matters would soon follow .In the context of religion , the Court 's first and most abusive reinterpretation began in a 1940 Supreme Court ruling , Cantwell v. Connecticut .Here , the Court applied the \" free exercise \" clause of the First Amendment to the states .Again , religion was a State matter .State courts were , and are , completely capable of handling the issue .Nevertheless , the Supreme Court , in direct opposition to the original intentions of the Constitution , applied yet another portion of the Bill of Rights to the States .They did not stop there .The next landmark ruling came down in 1947 .In the case , Everson v. Board of Education , the Supreme Court applied the \" establishment clause \" of the First Amendment to the states .In the context of the \" separation of church and state , \" the Court 's foundational reinterpretation of the Constitution was complete .From 1947 forward , the Court has ruled with regularity on religious issues , in direct violation of the original meaning of the First Amendment .Their rulings , and those of lower courts ( federal and State ) have become the \" law \" of \" separation of church and state .\" That was a very brief description of how the federal courts have taken authority over religious issues , reinterpreting the First Amendment and applying it to the States by way of the Fourteenth Amendment .All of this was done in clear violation of the actual wording of the Constitution , as well as the intentions of its framers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "41.85007"}

Oregon .The newly expanded right gained traction in subsequent cases .But these advances proved evanescent , and later cases involving the rights of \" speech and assembly \" routinely resolved the latter within the framework of the former .Although the right of assembly remained important in several decisions overturning convictions of African Americans who participated in peaceful civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s , courts resolved most cases involving group autonomy without considering assembly .The Supreme Court , in fact , has not addressed an assembly claim in thirty years .Around the time that assembly began falling out of political and legal discourse , the Supreme Court shifted its constitutional focus to a new concept : association .The development of the constitutional right of association - and with it , the disappearance of assembly - in many ways depended upon surrounding contexts .I divide these contexts into two eras .The first , which I call the national security era , began in the late 1940s and lasted until the early 1960s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.721184"}

{"text": "The courts have generally provided strong protection of pure speech from government regulation .Speech - plus involves actions , such as demonstrating or protesting , as well as words .Speech - plus is not generally protected as strictly as is pure speech , because actions can be physically dangerous .The courts have ruled that demonstrators may not obstruct traffic , endanger public safety , or trespass illegally .Flag Burning .Symbolic speech technically involves no speech at all , but it involves symbols that the courts have judged to be forms of free expression .Symbolic actions such as wearing black armbands in school and draft - card burning fit this category .Symbolic speech is highly controversial , and as a rule , the courts have sometimes considered it to be beyond the limits of free speech .However , the Supreme Court did uphold the right of an individual to burn an American flag in the 1989 Texas vs. Johnson decision .Many of the same principles that apply to freedom of speech apply to the press , but one with special meaning for the press is prior restraint .The courts have ruled that the government may not censor information before it is written and published , except in the most extreme cases of national security .Freedom of Assembly and Petition .Freedom of assembly and petition are closely related to freedom of speech , and have been protected in similar ways .Former Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes wrote , \" Peaceable assembly for lawful discussion can not be made a crime . \" Generally , that point of view has prevailed .Freedom of assembly has to be balanced with other people 's rights if it disrupts public order , traffic flow , freedom to go about normal business or peace and quiet .Usually , a group must apply for a permit , but a government must grant a permit provided that officials have the means to prevent major disruptions .For over 100 years after the ratification of the Constitution , the First Amendment protected these freedoms only in theory .As individuals in the 20th century have challenged the government in the courts when they believed their rights were assaulted , the First Amendment has taken on a stronger meaning .It remains the single most powerful instrument for protecting the sacred freedoms of religion , speech , press , assembly , and petition for modern Americans .Electronic Frontier Foundation The Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded in 1990 to ensure that the principles embodied in the U.S. Constitution and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights are protected as new communications technologies emerge .The EFF provides legal help to people who feel their \" cyberspeech \" rights are violated , and publicize instances of government attempts to censor the Internet .Their Blue Ribbon Campaign , the world 's largest grassroots Internet organization , fights for free speech online internationally .People for the American Way The first clauses of the First Amendment call for a separation of religion and government .People for the American Way is an activist lobbying organization which monitors religious groups it feels are trying to make government support their religious beliefs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.12567"}
{"text": "Where do they think that the dogma was in your message , OhioDoc ?I do n't see the dogma , but instead they seem to be misusing language in order to deceive people , including deceiving themselves .In various places on the ' net I 've seen some of the US Christian extremists attempting to turn all of the atheistic criticisms of religion around to use them against the seculars / atheists .Some of them do it very well and could certainly fool a more credulous person .Traditionally , the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that in order for a law to prevail over an individual 's free exercise of religion it must have a compelling state interest .I think that is a tradition , but am suspicious that they 'd attempt to apply it to religious acts done with government authority , which would be against the tradition .Actually , I think that what they 've done here is to swap in their word \" religion \" for the Supreme Court 's word \" speech \" , in that statement .But I 'm not that knowledgeable about the history of the Supreme Court to be certain about this .In their minds , they probably fully believe that free speech during government activities is the same freedom as free religious practices as a part of government activities .However , in 1990 the Court rejected this traditional interpretation and essentially placed the burden on individuals to prove why their free exercise rights had been violated .When I call the police I have to show them some proof that a crime is happening or has happened before it would go to trial .This burden of proof on the accuser is normal , but they 've tried to swap that norm around by placing the burden on the government when the religious extremists are made to limit their religious practices from government .I think their language is very twisted and deceptive , well rehearsed and well networked also .Seven years later in Boerne v. Flores , the Court threw out Congress 's attempt to remedy the Supreme Court 's trampling of religious liberty .As a result , the religious liberty of Americans is more unprotected than ever .And another twist in the language usage !Now the Supreme Court is supposedly \" trampling \" religious liberty ( making the Court into the bad guys ) when Congress attempted to supposedly \" remedy \" ( making Congress the good - guys ) their trampling .Then they make it sound like this is an nontraditional new development with , \" more unprotected than ever .\" Obviously the Court has a long tradition of upholding the \" wall of separation between church and state .\" Those are Thomas Jefferson 's words as recognized by the Court as far back as Reynolds v. United States 98 U.S. 145 in Oct. 1878 , and the religious extremists ignore Jefferson 's history having happened .I suspect that that history is intentionally left out of their education as part of the political strategy of the religious extremists .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.473156"}

{"text": "This book offers assembly as an alternative to the enfeebled right of expressive association .The history of assembly reveals four principles that help us see its contours and its contemporary applications .First , assembly extends not only to groups that further the common good but also to dissident groups that act against the common good .Second , this right extends to a vast array of religious and social groups .Third , just as the freedom of speech guards against restrictions imposed prior to an act of speaking , assembly guards against restrictions imposed prior to an act of assembling - it protects a group 's autonomy , composition , and existence .Fourth , assembly is a form of expression - the existence of a group and its selection of members and leaders convey a message .Collectively , these four principles counsel for strong protections for the formation , composition , expression , and gathering of groups , especially those groups that dissent from majoritarian standards .The judicially recognized right of association advances neither these principles nor the values that underlie them .The forgetting of assembly and the embrace of association thus marked the loss of meaningful protections for the dissenting , political , and expressive group .While today 's cultural and legal climate raises the most serious challenges to practices at odds with liberal democratic values , the eclectic collection of groups that have been silenced and stilled by the state cuts across political and ideological boundaries .The freedom of assembly once opposed these incursions .But the social vision of assembly does more than enable meaningful dissent .It provides a buffer between the individual and the state that facilitates a check against centralized power .It acknowledges the importance of groups to the shaping and forming of identity .And it facilitates a kind of flourishing that recognizes the good and the beautiful sometimes grow out of the unfamiliar and the mundane .Indeed , almost every important social movement in our nation 's history began not as an organized political party but as an informal group that formed as much around ordinary social activity as extraordinary political activity .We lose more than the shared experience of cheese fries and cheap beer when we bowl alone .Recovering the vision of assembly remains an urgent task .In June 2010 , the Court dealt a twofold blow to the principles of group autonomy by relying on attenuated conceptions of the rights of speech and association .In Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project , the Court curtailed in the name of national security interests the right of individuals to associate with and advocate on behalf of certain foreign political groups .Holder and Martinez hinder the group autonomy upon which democracy depends .As Stephen Carter has argued , \" Democracy advances through dissent , difference , and dialogue .The idea that the state should not only create a set of meanings , but try to alter the structure of institutions that do not match it , is ultimately destructive of democracy because it destroys the differences that create the dialectic . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.5981"}

{"text": "With all due respect to the gentleman from New York , I must suggest that I do not believe the President would express his strong support for a bill that would have the impact that some others have suggested it would have .Mr. Speaker , we go back to RFRA , the ACLU - supported RFRA .Now they have changed their minds .What triggered this objection ?I think what all of this is about , if we get right down to the facts of what is motivating this , was a 9th Circuit case in which a small religious landlord challenging a housing law was granted an exemption from compliance .This should not be a cause for alarm .It is clear from the case law that under strict scrutiny sometimes religious landlords win their claims for exemption , sometimes they do not depending upon the facts of the case .H.R. 1691 will continue in this tradition weighing and balancing competing interests based on real facts before the Court .Religious interests will not always prevail , nor will those of the government .But the Nadler amendment would determine in advance that the interest of the Government will always prevail in certain cases .This is not what this Congress intended when it passed RFRA unanimously here in the House and is not the type of law I believe the American citizens want their Congress to enact .Let me finally say that H.R. 1691 remedies the Smith case 's tragic outcome which resulted in only politically influential people being able to obtain meaningful protection of their religious freedom against a neutral law of general applicability .The Nadler amendment , on the other hand , exemplifies the problem created in the Smith case by legislatively doling out protection only to politically influential classes of claimants , or perhaps more accurately denying protection to politically not influential classes of claimants .Now , that is not the way we should be operating when we are dealing with religious liberty .Religious liberty should not be put in a second - class status to other civil rights .That is just not right .Now , we are not saying in this bill that religious freedom always takes precedent over everything else .That is not what the bill does , and the gentleman knows that , and anyone who has read the bill knows that .So on that basis I would urge the Members of the House to reject the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York ( Mr. Nadler ) and move forward to the passage of this bill which has such broad support from the religious community .As we have noted earlier , it is truly remarkable that such a diverse group of religious organizations have joined together in support of any legislation .It is an unusual circumstance when we can come to the floor with such broad support .We have that broad support in the religious community .We have the support of the administration .Mr. Speaker , I would like to thank the Department of Justice for the work that they have done in helping us craft this legislation and addressing various concerns that had existed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.912006"}

{"text": "Given the norms of the day , the founders ' avoidance of any expression in the Constitution suggesting that the government is somehow based on any religious belief was quite a remarkable and plainly intentional choice .They later buttressed this separation of government and religion with the First Amendment , which constrains the government from undertaking to establish religion or prohibit individuals from freely exercising their religions .The basic principle , thus , rests on much more than just the First Amendment .To the extent that some nonetheless would like confirmation - in those very words - of the founders ' intent to separate government and religion , Madison and Jefferson supplied it .Instructive as that letter is , it played but a small part in the Court 's decision .Perhaps even more than Jefferson , James Madison influenced the Court 's view .Madison , who had a central role in drafting the Constitution and the First Amendment , confirmed that he understood them to \" [ s]trongly guard [ ] . . .the separation between Religion and Government .He made plain , too , that they guarded against more than just laws creating state sponsored churches or imposing a state religion .The Constitution of the United States forbids everything like an establishment of a national religion .While the First Amendment undoubtedly was intended to preclude the government from establishing a national religion as you note , that was hardly the limit of its intended scope .The first Congress debated and rejected just such a narrow provision ( \" no religion shall be established by law , nor shall the equal rights of conscience be infringed \" ) and ultimately chose the more broadly phrased prohibition now found in the Amendment .During his presidency , Madison vetoed two bills , neither of which would form a national religion or compel observance of any religion , on the ground that they were contrary to the establishment clause .While some in Congress expressed surprise that the Constitution prohibited Congress from incorporating a church in the town of Alexandria in the District of Columbia or granting land to a church in the Mississippi Territory , Congress upheld both vetoes .In keeping with the Amendment 's terms and legislative history and other evidence , the courts have wisely interpreted it to restrict the government from taking steps that could establish religion de facto as well as de jure .Contrary to your supposition , the Supreme Court has recognized that the First Amendment limited only the federal government , and the Court did not draw on the concept of a living Constitution to extend the Amendment 's limits to the states .Rather , the Court observed that the Constitution was later amended to protect from infringement by states the privileges and immunities of citizenship , due process , and equal protection of the laws .The Court naturally looked to the Bill of Rights for the important rights thus protected by the 14th Amendment and ruled that it effectively extends the First Amendment 's guarantees vis a vis the federal government to the states .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.06391"}

{"text": "In the Establishment Clause context , the original check on religion 's influence in the public sphere , the principle of formal neutrality reigns , meaning that a benefit given to a non - religious group must be shared with religious ones ( Madison 's Remonstrance notwithstanding , apparently ) .The principle of formal neutrality , adopted by this court in Everson and its progeny , has effectively erased the Establishment Clause from the constitution and made an ornament of Jefferson 's great wall .As the recent controversy surrounding the Obama administration 's \" attack on religious freedom \" demonstrates , however , equal protection and formal neutrality are not the unitary standard with which we adjudicate conflicts between the state and religious institutions .Indeed , when it comes to the Free Exercise Clause , the Court paradoxically continues to hold religion as a thing apart .This was not always the case .The Lockean public - private antinomy is on display in the Court 's early free exercise cases .In Reynolds v. United States , a Mormon man 's challenge of his conviction for bigamy on free exercise grounds was roundly rejected .The Court held the dictate of Reynolds ' religion irrelevant to the implementation of general , secular laws , so long as these laws were not specifically intended to persecute .The Court 's reasoning here is directly descended from Locke 's .This principle was abandoned for a more expansive right during the Warren and Burger Courts and has only recently returned to a more narrow , liberal conception of the dichotomies of public law and private religion .That is if you are a member of a non - mainstream , non - Abrahamic religion .Indeed , whereas the free exercise claims of Native American religious practitioners wishing to use peyote in their religious ceremonies was rejected , the Court recently held that a Lutheran organization invoking the same principle may fire a subordinate for any reason , religious or non- .It would seem that certain types of free exercise are favored over others , ironically raising the equal protection problem addressed by the Court in Everson and throwing light on the problems of adapting the Religion Clauses to the adherents of non - private religions that require more than faith alone .That the Court has traded religion clause counterpoise for a preference for the positive right of free exercise ( free of the negative antiestablishment right ) can be seen in Chief Justice Roberts ' selective historical treatment in Hosanna - Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .This interpretation is not faithful to the framers ' intent , and it is especially uncharacteristic of Madison 's thoughts on the subject .Madison called the presumption that the civil magistrate could \" employ Religion as an engine of Civil policy \" an \" unhallowed perversion .\" The Supreme Court has , since its decision in Everson , worked to bronze this unhallowed perversion as constitutional law and continues to take the names and liberal principles of our founding fathers in vain .There is little doubt that much of the carping about \" religious liberty \" in the wake of Obama 's contraception debacle is political posturing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.275948"}

{"text": "The second constitutional period of the right of association is the equality era , which began in the mid-1960s .The equality era introduced its own political , jurisprudential , and theoretical factors to the right of association .The primary political factor involved ongoing efforts to attain meaningful civil rights for African Americans .As the Civil Rights Movement gained traction , the focus of activists shifted from protecting their own associational freedom ( as represented in cases like NAACP v. Alabama ) to challenging segregationists ' right to exclude African Americans from group membership .Questions over the limits of this right to exclude became increasingly complex when civil rights litigation moved from public accommodations to private groups .The jurisprudential factor in the equality era involved the right to privacy .Although privacy and association had been linked in some of the Court 's earliest cases on the freedom of association , new connections emerged when the Court first recognized a constitutional right to privacy in its 1965 decision Griswold v. Connecticut .Because privacy , like association , appeared nowhere in the text of the Constitution , the Court 's earlier recognition of the right of association in NAACP v. Alabama became an important example of the kind of \" penumbral \" reasoning underlying Griswold .But there was a definitional problem with the Court 's understanding of associational privacy .In contrast to the view of privacy as the guarantor of individual autonomy that Griswold came to represent , privacy in the early right of association cases had more to do with protecting the boundaries of group autonomy .The theoretical factor in the equality era was the rise of Rawlsian liberalism .Rawlsian questions about the relationship between liberty and equality and the meaning of justice dominated scholarly discussions about associational freedom .Rawlsian premises also permeated the work of legal scholars like Kenneth Karst and Ronald Dworkin .Dworkin 's recognition of \" rights as trumps \" revealed that Rawlsian - inspired thought shared concerns about majoritarianism voiced by earlier theorists like Madison and Tocqueville .But unlike Madison 's factions and Tocqueville 's associations , the ostensibly neutral procedural devices of Rawls 's \" public reason \" and Dworkin 's \" law as integrity \" did n't merely counter majoritarian influence - they constrained the autonomy of groups that failed to comport with liberal values .The influence of Rawlsian liberalism and the two lines of cases that emerged over the right to exclude and the right to privacy coalesced in Roberts v. United States Jaycees .Justice Brennan 's opinion for the Court identified two separate constitutional sources for the right of association in earlier cases .One line of decisions protected \" intimate association \" as \" a fundamental element of personal liberty . \"Another set of decisions guarded \" expressive association , \" which was \" a right to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment - speech , assembly , petition for the redress of grievances , and the exercise of religion .\" Sixteen years later , the Court reaffirmed this fundamental distinction in Boy Scouts of America v.

( Citations omitted ) .The Court held , however , that in enacting Title VII Congress created substantive goals for individuals superior to the employees ' collective ability to bargain effectively .Consequently , the principle of majority rule , however central to the national labor relations policy , is on occasion subordinate to the rights of individual employees .This is true of age discrimination in the workplace , where younger workers invariably outnumber those near retirement age and the best interests of younger and older workers naturally conflict .Advancement by younger employees in salary , responsibility , and seniority , for example , can be delayed by an older worker 's hesitancy to retire .Conversely , job security , firings and layoffs often depend , especially in a unionized plant or office , on experience and years of service .Thus , the decision in Alexander extends to the ADEA .Aside from their close historical and legislative relationship and similar prohibitions against employment discrimination , the ADEA and Title VII confer individual rights on employees of state and local governments to equal employment opportunities .Allowing the union here to waive individual rights under the ADEA frustrates the fundamental purpose behind the Act .5 It leaves many workers in the unionized sector of the economy vulnerable to job discrimination based on their age .Implementation of the Act in the unionized workplace would be sporadic and unpredictable , depending almost entirely on the economic bargaining strength of the union , the incentives offered in exchange for these statutorily conferred rights , and the intensity of management attitudes toward the Act .In fact , it appears from the collective bargaining agreement before us that the union may have sacrificed the rights of individual members near retirement age in order to better the common good of the membership .The County asserts that , in exchange for the right to require retirement at 65 , it assumed full responsibility in the labor contract for financing the retirement fund .In return for this , the union allegedly exchanged the rights under the ADEA of a few members near retirement age .Thus by all indications , the union bartered the individual rights of a few members in order to reduce the financial obligations of many others .Congress clearly did not envision this result when it enacted the ADEA .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.54255"}

United States Jaycees .Political , jurisprudential , and theoretical factors shaped the right of association in each of these eras .In the national security era , the primary political factor was the historical coincidence of the Second Red Scare and the Civil Rights Movement .From the late 1940s to the early 1960s , the government 's response to the communist threat pitted national security interests against group autonomy .Segregationists in the South capitalized on these tensions by analogizing the unrest stirred by the NAACP to the threats posed by communist organizations ; segregationists even charged that communist influences had infiltrated the NAACP .The Supreme Court responded unevenly , suppressing communist groups in the name of order and stability but extending broad protections to civil rights groups .The jurisprudential factor shaping the right of association involved disagreement on the Court over the constitutional source of that right .This disagreement was most evident when the Court applied the right to limit state ( as opposed to federal ) law .Justices Frankfurter and Harlan argued that association constrained state action because like other rights , it could be derived from the \" liberty \" of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment .Justices Black , Douglas , Brennan , and Warren insisted that association was located in some aspect of the First Amendment and argued that it be given the same \" preferred position \" as other First Amendment rights .On their view , association applied to the states because the Fourteenth Amendment had incorporated the provisions of the First Amendment .These differences encompassed not only the source of the constitutional limits on state action but also the extent of those limits .For Black , the rights in the First Amendment were \" absolute \" and could not be restricted by state action .Frankfurter argued instead for a \" balancing \" that weighed the interests of the government against the liberty of the Fourteenth Amendment .The result of these two perspectives was that the Court was more likely to uphold a state law restricting expressive freedom if it followed the liberty argument and more likely to strike down the law if it followed the incorporation argument .The theoretical factor influencing the shaping of association was the pluralism popularized by David Truman and Robert Dahl in the 1950s and 1960s .But mid - twentieth - century pluralism merged these insights with currents from Arthur Bentley 's \" science of politics \" and Louis Hartz 's \" Lockean consensus . \"The resulting political theory emphasized the balance and consensus among groups rather than the juxtaposition of groups against the state .These assumptions laid the foundation for the freedom of association in two ways .First , they established a normative presumption that groups were valuable to democracy only to the extent that they reinforced and guaranteed democratic premises and , conversely , that groups antithetical to these premises were neither valuable to democracy nor worthy of its protections .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.21884"}

Smith , neutral laws of general applicability are constitutional , regardless of the burden they may impose on religious practices .Indeed , the law upheld in Smith banned a religious sacrament .But it was neutral , in that it did not intentionally target religion , and it was generally applicable , in that it was neither riddled with exceptions nor grossly underinclusive .The regulation requiring employers who provide health insurance to include contraception in that coverage is likewise a neutral law of general applicability .While a recent Supreme Court decision ( Hosanna - Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC ) carved out an exception to this \" neutral - generally - applicable - laws - do - not - violate - the - Free - Exercise - Clause \" rule , it does not apply here .This exception - which holds that religious institutions are immune from neutral , generally applicable anti - discrimination laws when they are sued by their ministers - was designed to protect churches ' ability to pick their leaders without interference from the state .However , the provision by religiously - affiliated organizations of health insurance to their employees , many of whom do not belong to the same faith as their religious employer , clearly does not involve ministers or internal church governance .In short , there is no valid Free Exercise Claim .The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops ( USCCB ) has been leading the charge against the contraception mandate , but its opposition to the mandate does not represent the USCCB 's first entanglement with contraception lawsuits .ACLU of Massachusetts v. Sebelius involved an Establishment Clause challenge to a grant given to the USCCB pursuant to the Trafficking Victims Protection Act .The grant was to provide services to victims of sex trafficking , who are often forced into prostitution and forced to endure rape or other sexual abuse .In accepting the grant , the USCCB made very clear that its religious beliefs prevented them from providing contraception or abortion to their clients , or referring them to others who would .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.968216"}

United States[vii ] , the defendant argued on the basis that the Espionage Act violated their First Amendment rights to the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press .The case involved Charles Schenck , who had , during the war , published leaflets challenging the conscription system then in effect .The Supreme Court unanimously upheld Schenck 's conviction for violating the Espionage Act .The Supreme Court therefore requires the government to provide substantial justification for the interference with the right of free speech when attempting to regulate the content of the speech .A less stringent test is applied for content - neutral legislation .The Supreme Court has also recognized that the government may prohibit some speech that may cause a breach of the peace or cause violence .The right to free speech includes other mediums of expression that communicate a message .Questions have often arisen over the power of the federal government and the states to permit restriction on obscenity or pornography .While The Supreme Court has usually refused to give obscenity any protection under the First Amendment , pornography is subject to little regulation .With the evolution of time however , the exact definition of obscenity and pornography has changed .Personal possession of obscene material in the home may not be prohibited by law .However , it is not unconstitutional for the government to prevent the mailing or sale of obscene items , though they may be viewed only in private .The First Amendment also guarantees the right to assemble by which people are allowed to gather for peaceful and lawful purposes .The right to assembly includes the right to association and belief as well .The Supreme Court has expressly recognized that a right to freedom of association and belief is implicit in the First Amendment .It does not include a right of social association .The government may prohibit people from knowingly associating in groups that engage and promote illegal activities .The right to associate also prohibits the government from requiring a group to register or disclose its members or from denying government benefits on the basis of an individual 's current or past membership in a particular group .There are exceptions to this rule where the Court finds that governmental interests in disclosure / registration outweigh interference with first amendment rights .The government may also , generally , not compel individuals to express themselves , hold certain beliefs , or belong to particular associations or groups .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.16757"}

{"text": "Were Lincoln 's political principles significantly different from those of the Founding Fathers ?Obviously there were differences ; given the important shifts in both circumstance and culture between their time and his , there had to be - but on the whole I remain considerably more impressed by the similarities and continuities , especially on the level of fundamental belief .As a number of scholars ( most notably Harry Jaffa ) have suggested , Lincoln correctly understood , as Stephen Douglas and Chief Justice Roger B. Taney among many Page [ End Page 4 ] .others did not , that the political thought of the Revolutionary generation was grounded in the logic of natural right and that natural rights inhered in all members of the human species .Lincoln was absolutely correct to attribute to the Founding Fathers the belief not only that slavery was wrong - that it challenged the very logic of republican government - but also that its presence in the United States could be tolerated and defended only in terms of temporary necessity imposed by circumstance .Did Lincoln feel any significant degree of estrangement , or alienation , from the Founding Fathers ?Inferring belief from action - in the absence of confirming evidence and in the presence of ample contradictory evidence - seems worse than farfetched .Did Lincoln 's ambition , comparable in degree and kind to that of the Founding Fathers , prompt him during the 1850s to help precipitate a national crisis in which he might achieve greatness ?Here we must first acknowledge the important contribution of the revisionists , especially Forgie , in clarifying and enriching our understanding of the precise character of what William Herndon memorably referred to as that \" little engine that knew no rest , \" Lincoln 's ambition .[ 8 ] In this area , in fact , Lincoln may have had much more in common with the Founding Fathers than many of the revisionists explicitly allow .In an essay first published more than twenty - five years ago , the historian Douglass Adair brilliantly described the distinctive passion that animated so many leaders of the Revolutionary generation : a lust for fame , or the immortality earned through the remembrance of a grateful posterity .Lincoln 's ambition was never simply ordinary ambition , or what Alexis de Tocqueville described as the prevalent desire among Americans of his generation to acquire property , power , and reputation .Of course Lincoln was ambitious in that sense , but what ultimately Page [ End Page 6 ] drove him was more than the familiar desire to rise in society .He understood quite well what Alexander Hamilton had meant by referring to \" the love of fame \" as \" the ruling passion of the noblest minds .\" [ 10 ] .Like Adair 's Founding Fathers , some of whom were rather ordinary men driven to perform at an extraordinary level by the lure of fame , Lincoln , who was anything but ordinary , appears to have been after bigger game than the immediate rewards of public office .He , too , longed above all to be remembered for what he was doing to advance a great cause .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.37214"}

United States , the State emphasizes that under the Constitution , Congress lacks the power directly to compel the States to require or prohibit certain acts pursuant to a federal statute .And of course , argues the State , PASPA prohibits States from offering sports betting .The entire brief is a worthy read , as the State picks apart the 10th Amendment characterizations presented by the leagues and the DOJ .In short , the State takes the position that the anti - commandeering doctrine has been applied to federal statutes that command the States to maintain a certain state of affairs .No matter how Judge Shipp rules in this case , an eventual appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court seems inevitable .There 's simply too many dollars at stake for either the leagues or New Jersey to back down until the Supreme Court says to do so . \"New Jersey will likely encounter in the near future efforts by federal authorities challenging such legislation on the basis of the Supremacy Clause .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.37157"}

{"text": "The Freedom From Religion Foundation , a national nonprofit organization based in Madison , Wisconsin , that advocates the separation of church and state , ignited the spark that brought the story into the national spotlight .The organization said it received a complaint about the religious nature of the cheerleaders ' signs from somebody in the community , but citing privacy concerns , would n't reveal any additional details .The foundation then sent a letter to the Kountze Independent School District , claiming that the religious nature of the cheerleaders ' signs was illegal .Based on a precedent set in a 2000 Supreme Court case , Santa Fe Independent School District v. Jane Doe , the Kountze Independent School District 's attorneys advised Superintendent Kevin Weldon to immediately ban the religious banners .In that case emanating from southeast Texas , the Supreme Court ruled that it would not allow the broadcast of student - initiated and student - led prayer over the public address system before high school football games .After the Kountze Independent School District 's decision , the cheerleaders and their families filed suit on September 20 .Judge Thomas issued a temporary two - week restraining order later that day , allowing the cheerleaders to continue using their \" spirit run - through banners , \" and extended that order another two weeks on October 4 .The school district is trying to walk a very thin line here , and to obey the law .That 's the primary motive , the primary focus of the school district , \" he said .\" On the one hand , we 're trying not be endorsing any particular religion .On the other hand , we 're not trying to be hostile to religion .We 're trying to walk that very thin line of this elusive neutrality that we are required to achieve .Texas intervention .On Wednesday , the state of Texas intervened , filing a petition with the Texas District Court of Hardin County to support the Kountze cheerleaders on the basis of defending the constitutionality of Texas statues .We will not allow atheist groups from outside the state of Texas to come into the state to use menacing and misleading and intimidating tactics to try to bully schools to bow down to the altar of secular beliefs , \" Abbott said Wednesday .In a statement , the Attorney General 's office explained that the Texas Religious Viewpoints Anti - Discrimination Act requires school districts to treat a student 's voluntary expression of religious views in the same manner that the district treats a student 's expression of any other point of view .Those banners , which the cheerleaders independently produce on their own time with privately funded supplies , are perfectly constitutional .The State of Texas intervened in this case to defend the cheerleaders ' right to exercise their personal religious beliefs - and to defend the constitutionality of a state law that protects religious liberties for all Texans , \" the statement read .Texas Gov.

Hall , Fifth Circuit judge William Woods rejected both arguments .He concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment had made the rights of speech and assembly applicable to the states and had authorized Congress to enforce those rights against the states .Moreover , the state need not have itself endorsed or carried out the violence , because \" denying the equal protection of the laws includes the omission to protect , as well as the omission to pass laws for protection . \"As Lane suggests , this meant that the federal government \" had the power to protect freedmen not only from discriminatory state legislation but also from ' state inaction , or incompetency .

{"text": "I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting the Nadler amendment as it is a positive step forward in protecting the rights of all Americans and finally restores the legal protections for religious freedom for the average American citizens that have been threatened for nearly a decade .Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee ; I appreciate the opportunity to share some thoughts with you today .Two weeks ago , Governor George W. Bush signed the Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( Texas RFRA ) into law , I as privileged to work the Gov. Bush as the House author of this important bill .And I 'm proud of this bill , because I believe it strengthens religious freedom in Texas without weakening other fundamental individual rights .Long before I ever heard of the Smith case or the federal RFRA , I knew how hard it was for individuals to assert their first amendment religious freedoms against the bureaucracy .I 've fought battles with our prison system over allowing Jewish prisoners to practice their faith .So when the American Jewish Committee and the Anti- Defamation League , on whose local boards I serve , put the state Religious Freedom Restoration Act on their legislative agendas , I was eager to become the lead sponsor .And I was certainly encouraged by the early and strong support of Gov. Bush , who announced just before the opening of our legislative session that Texas RFRA would be one of his legislative priorities as well .Of course you know that no bill is a simple bill .Early on , I saw that the model RFRA language left open a possibility that the act could be used to get around Texas ' civil rights laws .That concern was first raised to me by the AJC , and then later the ADL , the two groups that had initially brought me the legislation , and two groups with long histories of defending civil rights internationally .Clearly , the intended purpose of this bill was not to weaken civil rights laws .When Gov. Bush talked about the need for RFRA , he cited examples , including the skullcap situation , where RFRA could be used to help protect a person 's religious practice from government interference .None of the examples were about giving any individual the right to deny another person 's equal protection rights .The Texas Constitution is very clear about the primacy of civil rights .The third and fourth sections of our Bill of Rights guarantee equal protection under the law .The next three sections protect religion and guarantee freedom of worship .So , clearly , our framers saw these fundamental rights as being on the same plane .I wanted to pass a strong RFRA in Texas , but not one that would rewrite Texas civil rights laws .So I added language clarifying that the act neither expanded nor reduced a person 's civil rights under any other law .That language drew no objection initially .So coalition members helped craft language to apply RFRA to the special circumstances of religious organizations , while continuing to leave the task of balancing religious and equal protection rights to the courts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.34674"}

{"text": "The appellant offers two arguments to support this position .First , appellant contends the amendment must have been passed under the Commerce Clause because Congress lacked the authority to pass it under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment .The appellant relies heavily on Massachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia , 427 U.S. 307 , 96 S.Ct .2562 , 49 L.Ed.2d 520 ( 1976 ) , where the Supreme Court held a state law requiring state police officers to retire at age 50 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause .In Murgia , the Court found that employment by the state was not a fundamental right and concluded that a rational relation existed between the state 's interest in protecting the public and the rule requiring police officers to retire at 50 .From Murgia , appellant argues that since the Supreme Court has concluded that a state involuntary retirement statute similar to the County policy at issue here does not violate the Equal Protection Clause , Congress had no authority under section 5 to prohibit such a policy through the ADEA .This argument was considered and dismissed in Katzenbach v. Morgan , 384 U.S. 641 , 86 S.Ct .1717 , 16 L.Ed.2d 828 ( 1966 ) .The court held : .Neither the language nor history of \u00a7 5 supports such a construction .As was said with regard to \u00a7 5 in Ex parte Virginia , 100 U.S. 339 , 346 , 25 L.Ed .676 , \" It is the power of Congress which has been enlarged .Congress is authorized to enforce the prohibitions by appropriate legislation .Some legislation is contemplated to make the amendments fully effective . \"A construction of \u00a7 5 that would require a judicial determination that the enforcement of the state law precluded by Congress violated the Amendment , as a condition of sustaining the congressional enactment , would depreciate both congressional resourcefulness and congressional responsibility for implementing the Amendment .Under Morgan , the proper question is whether the ADEA as applied to state and local governments is \" appropriate \" legislation under section 5 to enforce the Equal Protection Clause .Legislation is appropriate if it is \" plainly adapted \" to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment and is \" not prohibited by but is consistent with the ' letter and spirit of the constitution . '\" Id. at 651 .The appellants do not seriously challenge the ability of the ADEA to satisfy this test .This court recently held in EEOC v.

{"text": "This is an issue that is seemingly litigated every year in connection with Christmas displays .Generally , courts have ruled that governments can not establish displays are are exclusively religious , meaning that a Nativity display by itself would not be acceptable , but a nativity display with a Christmas tree might be .Courts have also often required that if governments allow outside groups to utilize public spaces for such holiday displays they must give equal access to other faiths and points of view , including obviously satirical things such as the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster .Under these rules , the decision by the Mayor to deny access to the FFRF would clearly seem to be impermissible .If you 're going to give access to one point of view on religion , then you must give access to all points of view , otherwise you 're violating both the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause .Third , even if the Mayor 's decision to exclude the FFRF were not considered a violation of the religion clause of the First Amendment , it most assuredly would be a violation of the Freedom of Speech clause .While the Supreme Court has given governments , especially on the local level , the authority to regulate the time , place , and manner of speech , it has required that those restrictions must be , above all else , content neutral .For example , a city could adopt an ordinance restricting sound trucks from broadcasting on public streets during certain hours but it could not adopt an ordinance that banned sound trucks broadcasting particular points of view .In this case , Mayor Fouts has explicitly stated that he is banning FFRF from public grounds because of the content of their speech .That is quite obviously an unconstitutional content - based restriction on speech .In other words , no matter how you look at it , what Mayor Fouts is doing here is clearly unconstitutional .Based on what he is saying in public though , I doubt he even realizes what the Constitution says : .WJBK reported that the city of Warren has approved the \" Prayer Station , \" a Ramadan Display , a Nativity scene and a Day of Prayer - but nothing for atheists .\" I will continue to support all groups regardless of race or religion , but I will not support a group that denigrates those groups , \" Fouts told the station .\" I emphasize one thing , \" he added .\" The government can not restrict an individual 's freedom of speech , but an individual can not restrict the government 's freedom of speech . \"Can anyone even explain what this last part means ?Someone needs to send Mayor Fouts to a remedial Civics class , because he clearly failed it the first time around .Related Posts : .About Doug Mataconis Doug holds a B.A. in Political Science from Rutgers University and J.D. from George Mason University School of Law .He joined the staff of OTB in May , 2010 and also writes at Below The Beltway .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.939224"}

Diggins 's The Lost Soul of American Politics , for instance , Lincoln 's towering greatness stems from his having self - consciously distanced himself from his illustrious predecessors .The historian Diggins clearly believes that the Constitution of 1787 was a reactionary document , designed by its framers to contain and even thwart the more radical impulses of 1776 .He is also convinced that his hero Lincoln in effect held the same \" Progressive \" interpretation of the Constitution and therefore felt , as Diggins describes it , \" an acute estrangement \" from the Founding Fathers of 1787 and their principles .[ 3 ] Dissatisfied with the house they had built , he razed it ; which is to say , Diggins 's Lincoln sought and ultimately achieved a major reconfiguring of the Republic and its ideological scaffolding .More recently , Garry Wills , in his brilliant study of Lincoln at Gettysburg , agrees that Lincoln redefined and thus reinvented both the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence .[ 4 ] .As Wills observes , some present - day American conservatives see the same Lincoln swindle but find it anything but benign .Consider , in this light , the writings of M. E. Bradford , who was a professor of literature and rhetoric at the University of Dallas , which fit squarely into what the historian Don E. Fehrenbacher called a submerged but shrill \" Anti - Lincoln tradition \" in American culture .[5 ] Bradford 's Lincoln is a master of deception and demagoguery , a country hustler Page [ End Page 3 ] of immense intelligence and rhetorical genius whose guiding principle was personal ambition , pure and simple .Bradford finds little in Lincoln 's writings to dignify with the label of political philosophy , but he believes that Lincoln 's powerful rhetoric , with its emphasis on human equality , initiated a \" derailment \" of the noble political tradition established by the Founding Fathers .Bradford is convinced that Lincoln 's distortion of their teachings was calculated and deliberate .As he announced to an unreceptive gathering of Lincoln scholars in Gettysburg , \" In appealing to an imaginary history , \" Father Abraham was rankly \" duplicitous .\" [ 6 ] .Each of these revisionist interpretations has its own distinctive shape ; no single , common thread unites them .But taken together , they suggest a composite portrait of Lincoln 's relationship to the Founding Fathers worth pondering .Do the revisionists ' theories actually make sense ?On the whole I think not , although I also believe that we have something important to learn from them .As a historian who has worked primarily with the Founding generation and who has recently begun to take a closer look at Lincoln , I propose to venture a tentative summary of my assessment of these propositions and of the composite image of Lincoln they present .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.6842"}

{"text": "Let me offer a few other examples of the kind of contextual analysis that I have in mind .In the 1950s , African American voters in Fort Bend County , Texas , challenged their exclusion from the Jaybird Democratic Association - a private group not governed by state election laws .The Jaybird Association held an election among its members every year prior to the Democratic primary .For more than sixty years , the candidate selected by the Jaybirds went on to win the Democratic primary and the general election .Most people would recognize that the Jaybirds would qualify under my definition as a peaceable , noncommercial assembly .Most people would also recognize that the Jaybirds had so skewed the balance of power in Fort Bend County that they deserved to be denied the protections of assembly .Or take a more contemporary example .Suppose that membership in the Christian Legal Society at Hastings College of the Law was a prerequisite to the most desirable legal jobs - a feather in the cap surpassing even membership on the Hastings Law Journal .If that were the case , the Christian Legal Society may well lose the protections of assembly .Of course , membership in the Christian Legal Society at Hastings College of the Law did not provide these kinds of advantages .A closer case may have existed with the Minneapolis and St. Paul Jaycees when the Court decided Roberts v. United States Jaycees in 1984 .The problem is that we simply do n't know .The opinions in Roberts lack any contextual analysis .The justices simply assumed that the state 's interest in eradicating gender discrimination warranted trumping the autonomy of the Jaycees .Nobody offered any explanation of why this remedy helped to eradicate gender discrimination in these circumstances sufficient to trump the autonomy of this group .Having mentioned these examples , let me be quick to note that I find aspects of my own proposed drawing of lines incomplete and imprecise .For example , I am unsure how a theory of assembly would address highly regulated groups like political parties , labor unions , and professional associations .As Steven Calabresi notes , these kinds of groups present a particular challenge to questions of group autonomy : \" Some so - called mediating institutions may truly mediate between the private individual and the state .Synagogues , churches , temples , families , and voluntary community and civic associations and groups often fall readily into this category .Other groups , however , such as political parties , labor unions , bar associations , and other modern - day corporate ' guilds ' may not .It may often be the case that these kinds of groups do not so much ' mediate ' between the individual and the state , as that they try actually to enlist the state on their side of some otherwise - private competitive struggle .\" On the other hand , some highly regulated groups embody the very values and purposes that I defend throughout this book .In fact , in recent decades , the Court appears to have developed a distinct right of \" political association \" applicable to political parties .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.01016"}

{"text": "I disagree that hate speech is an expression of discrimination .It 's an expression of prejudice ; not discrimination .Words and discrimination are two different things - unless the words explicitly incite unlawful discrimination ; in which case they should be crimes because they incite criminal acts .Mere hateful views should n't be criminal .Who decides what is hateful ?The state should not have such power .It 's open to abuse , as happened to anti - war protesters who abused British soldiers for their role in Iraq .Members of the Grand Dragon faction of the Ku Klux Klan shout insults at gay couples going to request marriage licences in Houston .Carlos Sanchez / Reuters .You suggest the police and courts are capable of distinguishing between hate speech and merely offensive speech .This is not true in Britain , where insults can be treated as hate speech .I was arrested for saying the homophobia and sexism of Islamist extremists is akin to the mentality of the Nazis .Separately , a youth was arrested for calling Scientology a dangerous cult .In both instances , it was deemed we had committed religious hate crimes .Although it is claimed that hate speech influences people to commit hate violence , it 's difficult to demonstrate that anyone has responded to hateful words with violent acts .The causal link is unproven .People do n't kill abortion providers because they heard a hate speech .They commit these crimes because of a zealous belief that abortion is immoral .I have some sympathy for your narrow definition of hate speech ( the Taylor test ) and that only repeated hate speech to a wide audience should be criminalized .Perhaps this is where we come close to common ground ?Joyce .In Canada , legal definitions of discrimination encompass hate speech .I agree that people should not be arrested for the types of insults you describe .But one bad law or the abuse of laws is not an argument against hate speech laws .We are smart enough to craft better definitions of hate speech that protect marginalized groups from discrimination based only on immutable characteristics , which include religious affiliation but not specific religious beliefs or behaviours .Blasphemy must be permitted .It can be very difficult to prove the causal effects of any law , but we accept living under a system of laws because they serve many other purposes .That said , a US court found that ' Wanted Posters ' issued in the 1990s by anti - abortion groups for a dozen named abortion providers constituted a true threat because they led to the murders of several of them , even though the posters made no specific threats .People kill abortion providers not simply because they believe abortion is immoral , but because widespread hate speech against doctors creates an atmosphere of perceived acceptance and impunity for their actions .Hate speech is destructive to society and to its victims .Enduring hatred over years can limit people 's opportunities , isolate them socially , push them into poverty , lead to loss of self - esteem and depression , and endanger their health and safety .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.31978"}
{"text": "When I read the book Founding Brothers : The Revolutionary Generation by Joseph Ellis , I did n't realize the extant of Benjamin Franklin 's involvement in the fight to abolish slavery in the early nation .Ellis ' book details Benjamin Franklin 's attempt in 1790 to force Congress to confront the issue of slavery .This last crusade of Benjamin Franklin before he died was the culmination of a lifetime where he evolved in his views on slavery and the equality of African Americans .In his early life , Franklin held many of the same views of race as his fellow neighbors .His newspaper publication had ads for slave trades and he personally owned a slave couple until 1751 .That year he wrote an essay Observations on the Increase of Mankind which argued against slavery on economic grounds , but was demeaning of Africans as a race .Franklin 's attitudes on race began to change when he joined the Associates of Dr. Bray to establish schools for blacks in America .Walter Isaacson 's book Benjamin Franklin : An American Life describes how Franklin 's wife Deborah had enrolled her servants in the Philadelphia school and expressed her \" high opinions of the natural capacities of the black race . \" Benjamin Franklin himself observed how these African American children were just as smart and learned just as quickly as their white counterparts , and this led to a change in his opinions .In the book A Benjamin Franklin Reader edited by Walter Isaacson , Franklin wrote a letter to Reverend John Waring in December 17 , 1763 about his change in attitude : .This is chiefly to acquaint you , that I have visited the Negro school here in company with the Rev. Mr. Sturgeon and some others ; and had the children thoroughly examined .I was on the whole much pleased , and from what I then saw , have conceived a higher opinion of the natural capacities of the black race , than I had ever before entertained .Their apprehension seems as quick , their memory as strong , and their docility in every respect equal to that of white children .You will wonder perhaps that I should ever doubt it , and I will not undertake to justify all my prejudices , not to account for them .From that time on , Franklin began a slow process of supporting abolitionist sympathies .He began to write articles , like the 1772 The Somerset Case and the Slave Trade , which argued against Britains foisting of slavery on America .Most significantly , Joseph Ellis notes in his book Founding Brothers : The Revolutionary Generation that during the Constitutional Convention , Benjamin Franklin had wanted to introduce a statement of principle in the Constitution condemning slavery and the slave trade to commit the government to eventual emancipation .Several northern delegates , however , persuaded Franklin not to introduce the statement on the grounds that it put the fragile Sectional Compromise that held the Consitutional Convention together at risk .In 1787 Benjamin Franklin agree to serve as president of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society and he made the abolitionist cause the final project of his life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.615456"}

{"text": "BARONE : I remember when my parents bought a set of The World Book Encyclopedia , around 1951 or 52 , when I was seven or eight years old .I was so glad to see that they had not only the 1940 census populations for the states and cities and counties , but also the 1950 census populations .I started making tables comparing the 1950 census and the 1940 census .I also remember my mother telling me that , in our neighborhood , the Protestants voted Republican and the Catholics voted Democratic .I thought , why should this be so ?I 've been trying to answer questions like that ever since .COLE : You started early .BARONE :Yes .( Laughter . )Most of the other kids were out playing , and I was memorizing the fact that the population of Detroit , where I lived in 1950 , was 1,849,568 , and that Los Angeles had passed it in the 1950 census , and it was 1,970,144 .And those numbers have remained imprinted on my brain .COLE : What is the population of Detroit now ?Do you know ?BARONE :Well , the latest census estimate for 2005 is 866,000 , less than half , almost a million people fewer .COLE : I grew up in the Midwest , in Cleveland , which has also shrunk abysmally , the population .My mother bought some World Books as well .That 's where I figure I got an education .I got hooked on those World Books and , I think , the stories too .BARONE : I think we 've got a lot to thank encyclopedia salesmen for .COLE : I 've read that you 've visited every congressional district , in every state .How did you get started doing that ?BARONE : I 've always been interested in beginnings , in traditions , in how things got started .In my write ups of the states and the various congressional districts , I often go back to origins .Why is New Hampshire the kind of place it is ?Well , because it was a very different sort of colony from Massachusetts .It was made up of people who did n't want to live in Massachusetts .They wanted to \" live free or die \" as the state 's motto says .They did n't want the Puritan ministers of Boston or the King 's customs collectors to get in their way of practicing their religion and making money , despite the English Navigation Acts .And so , New Hampshire has had a character different from Massachusetts that continues to shape its politics .I tried to do that for each state and district .After I coauthored my first Almanac of American Politics , which came out in 1971 , I had already traveled a fair amount around the country .I grew up in Michigan and the Midwest , and went to college and law school in Massachusetts and Connecticut .It occurred to me that I was writing about these 435 districts , but I had n't been in even a majority of them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "126.953156"}
{"text": "Crispus Attucks .Another prominent person in this time period was Crispus Attucks , the first person killed in the Boston Massacre .His father had been enslaved and his mother was a Natick Indian ; Attucks himself was a slave who escaped and became very active in the Revolutionary movement in Boston .Whereas the men mentioned above were probably born free , Attucks was likely born a slave and that status may have influenced his identification as an African - American .Certainly he is remembered as one of our African - American heros of the American Revolution , and his Native ancestry is underemphasized .Natick Indians spoke a language from the Algonquin language family and likely possessed cultural futures similar to other Northeastern Algonquin peoples , including patrilineal kinship .But the Native world of the Northeast was in such flux at this moment in history that it is difficult to say for certain how kinship practices influenced the identity of men like Crispus Attucks .I speak of these tribal communities in the past tense , but of course they still exist today and practice many of the same cultural traditions .African - Native Interactions .The reference you make to the individual 's literacy reminds me of Frederick Douglass 's experience as a slave in Baltimore , where his master 's wife taught him to read and write .Douglass remarked that American slaves thought themselves the most forsaken of God 's children , until they met the American Indian .The history of African - Native interactions in North America goes back to the 1526 expedition of Lucas Vasquez de Allyon , a Spanish soldier who established a colony at the mouth of the Peedee River in South Carolina .Four months later , Allyon died and the colony fell apart ; the 100 enslaved Africans that Allyon brought with him were free to join local Native communities .we have to recognize that ideas about racial and cultural identity have changed significantly over time .When we consider this long history , then - one that dates back to the very invasion of the Americas - we have to recognize that ideas about racial and cultural identity have changed significantly over time .As i indicated above , these men that we remember as African - American today may not have thought of themselves that way .Native peoples were in power long enough through the 18th century to exert considerable influence over how their communities functioned and how they determined belonging .Similarly , African - American literature flourished in the 18th century , as freed slaves wrote their life histories .Dozens of these tracts have survived , emerging from a time in our history when whites did not universally see slave literacy as a threat to the social order .I suspect if the story you seek exists in one person , it is to be found in this body of slave narratives .Not coincidentally , the Removal and dispossession of Indians occurred around the same time as increased repression of African - Americans , both free and enslaved , in the 1830s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "127.87452"}
