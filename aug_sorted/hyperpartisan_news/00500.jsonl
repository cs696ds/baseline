{"text": "During that period , the flag became the standard for those committed to defending classrooms , bus depots , and other public spaces ( now battlefields themselves ) from black encroachment .In fact , the flag 's use throughout the 20th century covered a time span significantly longer than its presence on Civil War battlefields .Its placement atop southern statehouses like South Carolina ultimately reinforced the flag 's connection to segregation and racism .Confederate flags no longer enjoy those privileged perches .In fact , over the past few years , white and black southerners have become less tolerant of the public display of the flag , which has relegated its supporters to the sidelines and a much more defensive posture .Last year , the city of Lexington , Virginia , banned the flying of the flag from public fixtures .This past spring , the Museum of the Confederacy opened a new branch at Appomattox that did not include the display of the flag outside its doors .Finally , late last year , the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond removed Confederate flags flying on the grounds of the Confederate Memorial Chapel , which the museum oversees .The museum 's decision led to the creation of a grassroots group called the Virginia Flaggers , but despite daily protests in front of the museum and a social media presence , its efforts have met with no success .The Sons of Confederate Veterans utilized their mailing lists and other resources in response to all three events , but they also have little to show for their efforts .These shifting fault lines suggest that while white and black southerners may tolerate the right of the individual to display the flag on private property , its display on public grounds and at other institutions will be met with suspicion and openly challenged .None of this easily fits into the popular narrative of a region mired in the past that uses a 19th century flag to pit the races against one another .I suspect there will be few , if any , Confederate flags to count during the coverage of next month 's DNC , and that should tell us a great deal about how far we 've come as a nation .Post navigation .18 thoughts on \" Our Obsession With the Confederate Flag \" .As the flags in public spaces come down , I wonder if the Confederate soldier monuments on courthouse lawns across the South could be next ?After all , I think many of the arguments against the display of the flag on public buildings could easily extend to such monuments .I do n't think I 'd want to see that happen as many of these statues could be viewed as historical artifacts and/or artistic sculpture in their own right .But it would not surprise me if some did .Thoughts ?It 's a good question and I could be wrong , but I do n't think the courthouse monuments are next .At least as far as I am aware there is no movement to remove them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.274704"}
