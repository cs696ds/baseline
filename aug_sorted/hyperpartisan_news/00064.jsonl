' \" President Obama has consistently faced a number of controversies that are , frankly , not based on fact .We thought that his critics ' persistence in pursuing these fantasies , such as Obama 's birth in a foreign nation or being a Muslim , in the face of facts saying otherwise , might be indirectly rooted in racism .Our research investigated whether people who held racial prejudices might be more likely to see Obama as ' un - American , ' presumably because of his race .Indeed , this is what we found .Whites who were prejudiced against blacks were more likely to see Obama as un - American , and in turn , evaluated Obama as performing more poorly as president .Whites who were not prejudiced , and blacks in general , did not do so .Additionally and importantly , this relationship was only found with Obama , as prejudiced whites did not see Vice President Joe Biden as un - American , despite the fact that Obama and Biden share political party affiliation and agenda . \"He will conclude : \" The April 27 release of Obama 's long - form birth certificate is a situation where President Obama and the White House eventually had to exert effort to quell a controversy that should never have been an issue .Our research indicates that one reason it may have initially become an issue at all has more to do with his race than his place of birth .We find that racial prejudice can , in part , influence evaluations of an elected leader , a phenomenon which is quite ' un - American .

{"text": "------------------------------------Some reporters who helped break the National Security Agency surveillance story reject the impartial journalistic stance that was a fundamental principle for a previous generation of reporters .By James Rainey , Los Angeles Times June 17 , 2013 , 8:28 p.m. .But it 's not just the mole in the National Security Agency surveillance story who is operating in new channels .The reporters who brought his account forward also represent something distinct in journalism .In some cases , their profiles loom larger , particularly on the subject of security and spying , than those of their publications .And a couple offer full - throated attacks on unchecked government surveillance , as they reject the impartial journalistic stance that was a fundamental principle for a previous generation of reporters .That combination means significant parts of official Washington have attacked not just Snowden , but some of the reporters who brought forward accounts of the NSA 's vast trove of telephone and Internet data .Rep. Peter T. King ( R - N.Y. ) has called for the criminal prosecution of Glenn Greenwald , the columnist , author and lawyer who first broke the story for the Guardian of London .Some journalists had complaints about the stories as well , a few because of what they said was imprecise reporting but others because of details the stories did not disclose .They wanted to know more about the kind of individuals whom the security agency investigated and why .That 's been my only agenda from the start .I rarely post here ( or anywhere ) , but this latest kerfuffle was the limit , when I saw that its origin was Glenn Greenwald .Steve Clemons ( of the now neo - liberal Atlantic ) jumped on board with his breathless , utterly irresponsible tweets , then Declan McCullagh iced the cake , creating quotes out of whole cloth .Journalism has changed , and not for the better .If there 's any takeaway here it 's that readers should be very careful .Internet reportage has no standards and it shows .You have provided a perfect example of what the article is saying .Both Clemons and Greenwald . are well respected bloggers , but on the Left throughout the Bush era .Not on the Right .But even if they were on the Right , IF they were reporting facts , it should not matter .Apparently , according to the article , our ' news ' media has now reached a point where the ' messenger ' is attacked by those who do not like the facts .The fact is that Democrats like Ron Wyden and Jerry Adler and Scott and Grayson and most of our best most Progressive Dems have been warning about this for a long time .Do you look at them too and dismiss the whole story ?If you ca n't take what is on a Liberal forum , I ca n't help you with that .We are liberal democrats and care more the truth than about individuals .I used to be a blind partisan Dem certain that MY party could do no wrong and was willing and did take on any Republican who said otherwise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.67035"}

Vinson that Title VII also prohibits sexual harassment , for it is a form of illegal sex discrimination .Winning a sexual harassment case under Title VII involves two steps .First , the plaintiff must prove that actionable harassment occurred .This entails proof of a quid pro quo - in other words , the threat of employment consequences for the failure to submit to sexual conduct - or a hostile environment .An actionable hostile environment involves unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that is either severe or pervasive , and which creates a subjectively and objectively hostile , offensive , or abusive working environment .Second , the plaintiff must prove that the employer can be held liable for the harassment .( There is no individual liability under Title VII . )For harassment by co - workers or third parties , the employer is only liable if it knew or should have known about the harassment and failed to take prompt and effective remedial action .For harassment by supervisors , employers are held to a higher standard , because courts reason that the supervisors are \" aided by the agency relation \" with the employer .When a supervisor directly draws on that power by threatening or imposing an employment quid pro quo , the employer is strictly liable .When a supervisor draws less obviously on that power by creating a hostile environment , the employer is automatically liable , but has the opportunity to avoid liability or damages through proof of an affirmative defense .To make use of the defense , an employer must show that ( i ) it took reasonable care to prevent and correct harassment and ( ii ) the victim unreasonably failed to take advantage of corrective opportunities - such as internal company harassment complaint procedures .Given the facts of this case , it is no surprise that the jury found KarenKim liable for harassment and awarded both compensatory and punitive damages .Manwaring 's conduct created a hostile work environment several times over , and poisoned the work environment for all of the female employees there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.559494"}

{"text": "And given that Manwaring was the Store Manager , KarenKim was subject to the supervisory standard for liability .Finally , KarenKim had no chance to prevail on the affirmative defense given that it had no policy or grievance procedure , had never trained its employees on the subject , and , most damningly , had responded to complaints by either ignoring them or punishing the complainants .The company thus would have been liable even under the weaker negligence standard applied to cases of co - worker harassment .The Real Fight in This Case : What Should the Scope of the Remedy Be ?The issue on appeal in this case did not concern the finding of harassment or the imposition of liability on KarenKim .It concerned , instead , whether the lower court should have granted the EEOC 's request for an injunction , to ensure that the grocery store did not continue to be plagued by harassment .Title VII 's ban on sexual harassment can be enforced by private victims , or by the EEOC on their behalf .In either case , Title VII allows for the imposition of monetary damages - both compensatory and punitive - and various forms of equitable relief and attorneys ' fees .In this case , the EEOC won compensatory and punitive damages for the victims , amounting to a little over $ 100,000 for each of the ten victims .But it also requested various forms of equitable relief , based on the contention that the company still had not adopted adequate measures to prevent future harassment .Among other indications of KarenKim 's inadequate efforts is the fact that Manwaring , despite having been fired for sexual harassment , is regularly present in the store by virtue of his new job as a produce vendor .In stark contrast , one of the victims who attempted to buy groceries at the store after the jury issued its verdict was ordered out of the store , and told never to return as a customer .Manwaring is also still in a romantic relationship with the store owner , and there is no legal bar to her rehiring him .The injunction requested by the EEOC was admittedly broad .The district court denied the EEOC 's request for injunctive relief on the basis that it was unnecessary and overly burdensome .It also objected to the length of the requested relief and the intrusiveness of having both an independent monitor and the EEOC overseeing their efforts .Fundamentally , the district court disbelieved that the future risk of harassment was as great as the EEOC urged .It pointed out in its ruling that the problem was comprised of \" isolated instances involving a manager who is no longer employed by the company . . .during a period when the company did not have clearly established anti - harassment policies .\" But now , the district court pointed out , the company has both an anti - harassment policy and a \" keen awareness of the issue .\" The court characterized as \" specious \" the idea that Connors would let her relationship with Manwaring affect her ability to curtail his behavior .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.94162"}

{"text": "You guessed it , it depends on the date of the Vernal Equinox - one more example of how Christians absorbed Pagan holidays into their calendar .Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday is the culmination of the celebration of the birth of Jesus , beginning on The Epiphany , January 6-the day of the supposed arrival of Three Kings ( or Wise Men ) bearing gifts of frankincense and myrrh for the newborn child .This year Easter falls on April 5 .The time between Epiphany and Mardi Gras is commonly referred to as Carnival , during which parades take place in Catholic strongholds like Brazil , Venice , Uruguay , Trinidad and Tobago , and New Orleans .Like many Catholic holidays , Mardi Gras bears resemblances to ancient pagan rituals , particularly Saturnalia and Lupercalia .The former honored the god Saturn , an agricultural deity , and was marked by gift - giving , revelry and gambling .The latter was conducted in mid - February to honor Faunus , the god of fertility , which involved feasting , drinking and debauched behavior .When Rome was Christianized , the Catholic Church adapted popular pagan holidays into the new faith .Mardi Gras season became a time to celebrate before the 40 days of Lent marked by prayer , repentance and atonement .As Christianity spread throughout Europe and the New World , so did Mardi Gras traditions .The pre - Lenten festivals continue to be marked by drinking , dancing and feasting on fatty foods containing meat , eggs , milk and cheese - ingredients that are restricted during Lent .Shrove Tuesday falls on the same day as Fat Tuesday .It is the day before Ash Wednesday when Christians are reminded they will soon enter a season of penance .\" Shrove \" comes from the word \" shrive , \" which means to confess .In the Middle Ages , Catholics began marking Shrove Tuesday as a time to confess their sins before Lent .After about five months of working at Davison Home Bakery , she 's preparing for the biggest day of the year : Fat Tuesday .\" They tell me it 's going to be pretty insane , \" she said , standing in the bakery the morning of Monday , Feb. 16 , wearing a white baker 's apron .Fat Tuesday is the day before the Christian tradition of Lent , when practitioners give up something for 40 days and 40 nights .Sweets are a common thing to give up , and for many , Fat Tuesday is one last chance to splurge .And the favorite way to splurge on Fat Tuesday ?Paczki .Paczki are like doughnuts , if you 're the kind of person who thinks there just are n't enough calories in cream- or jelly - filled doughnuts as it is .Diane Henson , a baker at Davison Home Bakery , has been making paczki since 1972 .The morning of Feb. 16 , she and baker Mitch French had already made 200 dozen , having been there since 9 p.m. the night before .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "129.41953"}
