Kennedy 's fateful 1963 motorcade through Dallas , where agents were not standing on running boards on the back of his exposed automobile when shots rang out because the president several days before had ordered them not to .By contrast , service officials displayed pictures showing agents standing right next to Ronald Reagan during the 1981 assassination attempt , enabling them to push him immediately into a car and evacuate him before he was hit by more than a single bullet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "46.289543"}

Cooper , a Washington , DC attorney , he states : .The crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice , like the crimes of treason and bribery , are quintessentially offenses against our system of government , visiting injury immediately upon society itself , whether or not committed in connection with the exercise of official government powers .Before the framing of our Constitution and since , our law has consistently recognized that perjury primarily and directly injures the body politic , for it subverts the judicial process and this strikes at the heart of the rule of law itself .Professor Gary McDowell , the Director at the Institute for United States Studies at the University of London , also testified in the same hearing in reference to the influential writer William Paley , and this is also in chart form for those who would like review it later .Paley saw the issue of oaths and perjury as one of morality as well as law .Because a witness swears that he will speak the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , a person under oath can not cleverly lie and not commit perjury .If the witness conceals any truth , Paley writes , that relates to the matter in adjudication , that is as much a violation of the oath , as to testify a positive falsehood .Shame or embarrassment can not justify his concealment of truth , linguistic contortions with the words used can not legitimately conceal a lie , or if under oath , perjury .Professor McDowell concludes with a quote from Paley which accurately provides , I believe the essence of a lie or perjurious statement . 'It is willful deceit that makes the lie ; and we willfully deceive , where our expressions are not true in the sense in which we believe the hearer apprehends them . 'Neither has this United States Senate been silent on the issue of perjury .You have rightfully recognized through previous impeachment proceedings the unacceptable nature of a high government official lying under oath , even in matters initially arising from what some would argue here are merely personal .Indeed , truth - telling is the single most important judicial precept underpinning this great system of justice we have , a system which permits the courthouse doors to be open to all people , from the most powerful man in America to a young woman from Arkansas .On May 6 , 1994 , Paula Corbin Jones attempted to open that courthouse door when she filed a Federal sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton .The case arose from a 1991 incident when she was a State employee and he was the Governor .Further details of the underlying allegations are not important to us today , but Ms. Jones ' pursuit for the truth is worth a careful study .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.923515"}

'Nevertheless , Congress and the Supreme Court have concluded that embarrassment - related concerns must give way to the greater interest in allowing aggrieved parties to pursue their claims .Courts have long recognized the difficulties of proving sexual harassment in the work place , inasmuch as improper or unlawful behavior often takes place in private .To excuse a party who lied or concealed evidence on the ground that the evidence covered only ' personal ' or ' private ' behavior would frustrate the goals that Congress and the courts have sought to achieve in enacting and interpreting the Nations 's sexual harassment laws .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.01474"}

'These offenses -- perjury and obstruction of justice -- are not trivial ; they represent an assault on the judicial process .Again , Judge Bell 's words are instructive : .Truth and fairness are the two essential elements in a judicial system , and all of these statutes I mentioned , perjury , tampering with a witness , obstruction of justice , all [ are ] in the interest of truth .If we do n't have truth in the judicial process and in the court system in our country , we do n't have anything .So , this is serious business .I agree .The crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice are public crimes threatening the administration of justice .They therefore fit Alexander Hamilton 's famous description of impeachable offenses in Federalist No . 65 : ' [ O]ffences which proceed from the misconduct of public men , or , in other words , from the abuse or violation of some public trust . 'The electorate entrusted President Clinton to enforce the laws , yet he chose to engage in a pattern of public crime against our system of justice .We must not countenance the commission of such serious crimes by the chief executive of our nation .The President broke his oath to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help him God .He likewise broke his oaths to take care that the laws be faithfully executed .Just how important are oaths ?We take oaths to substantiate the sanctity of some of our highest callings .Years ago , I took the Hippocratic Oath to become a physician .In January 1995 , I took an oath of office as a United States Senator to preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States .Then , just last month , I had to take a special oath of impartial justice for this impeachment trial .Raising your right hand and swearing before God is meant to be serious business .Swearing falsely is equally serious .I recall the conclusion of the Hippocratic Oath : .President Clinton broke his oaths ; the opposite of honor and fame should be his lot .Many of my colleagues have publicly expressed their belief that President Clinton broke his oaths and committed the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice .Some have gone further and said that these are high crimes and misdemeanors .Yet they flinched from removing President Clinton from office , hoping that we could just move on , put this behind us , and ' heal ' the Nation .Although our acquittal of President Clinton may bring initial relief at the end of this . ordeal , it will also leave unfortunate , lasting lessons for the American people : Integrity is a second - class value ; the hard job of being truthful is to be left to others ; and virtue is for the credulous .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.162094"}

'He then wagged his finger at us on national TV and chided us for believing what has since proven true .He embarked on a quiet smear campaign against Ms. Lewinsky , calling her a ' stalker ' and sending aides into the grand jury to repeat that mean - spirited falsehood .Above all else , he could have come clean when he went before the grand jury .Indeed , the discovery of the infamous blue dress served as a powerful reminder to tell the truth .But he continued to lie .The pattern of behavior is disturbing .That pattern is driven by President Clinton 's choice , on every occasion in this saga , to put his self - interest above the the public interest .Indeed , President Clinton is well down the dangerous road Dr. Osler described to his students : ' A slow process of self - deception . 'To me , his perjury before the grand jury was defining .Some of my fellow senators urged him not to lie in that grand jury , lest he be impeached .He had a chance to try to set matters right by the American people and by our system of justice .Instead , he lied .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.70597"}
