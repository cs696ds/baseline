{"text": "Colbert 's White House Correspondent Dinner Performance Underscores Irony 's Power And Delicacy .The scene : The White House Correspondent Dinner .The time : right after President George W. Bush put in a boffo performance next to a top - notch Bush impersonator .It was a hard act to follow .But Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert most assuredly followed it in his irony - heavy TV persona of a TV News talk show host that seems reminiscent of a Fox News host with the initials B.O. ( or , rather B.O'R. ) .You could see it if you watched it live ( we did ) : while Colbert got laughs , cutaway shots showed some members of the audience unlaughing or seemingly unamused .If in show biz you measure the success of a comedy set by the duration and volume of laughs , Bush & impersonator were a smash .By THAT standard , Colbert was n't since he got ( with a few exception ) mostly softer \" titters .\"Yet , in terms of content , Colbert 's satire was more biting , had a message and was far less playful - more akin to what you 'd hear in a point - of - view \" set \" in a comedy club .And irony is always a tougher task .The Internet term for irony is \" snark .\" If done poorly it can veer into the area of clumsiness and die a painful death ( that seemed to be the consensus about radio talk show host Don Imus ' routine at the dinner 10 years ago . )As E&P reports : .A blistering comedy \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tribute\u00e2\u20ac ? to President Bush by Comedy Central\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 s faux talk show host Stephen Colbert at the White House Correspondent Dinner Saturday night left George and Laura Bush unsmiling at its close ... . ...Colbert , who spoke in the guise of his talk show character , who ostensibly supports the president strongly , urged the Bush to ignore his low approval ratings , saying they were based on reality , \u00e2\u20ac\u0153and reality has a well - known liberal bias.\u00e2\u20ac ?That was still one of the more gentle moments .MORE : .He attacked those in the press who claim that the shake - up at the White House was merely re - arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic .\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This administration is soaring , not sinking , \u00e2\u20ac ? he said .\u00e2\u20ac\u0153They are re - arranging the deck chairs - on the Hindenburg.\u00e2\u20ac ?Colbert told Bush he could end the problem of protests by retired generals by refusing to let them retire .He compared Bush to Rocky Balboa in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Rocky\u00e2\u20ac ? movies , always getting punched in the face\u00e2\u20ac\"\u00e2\u20ac\u0153and Apollo Creed is everything else in the world.\u00e2\u20ac ?Turning to the war , he declared , \" I believe that the government that governs best is a government that governs least , and by these standards we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq .That was one point where you could feel a chill from part of the audience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.188995"}

{"text": "I watched excerpts of his act , and it was more painful than funny , but was truthful to a fault .Its always uncomfortable when you strike a nerve , but it does take courage .In contrast , t he president 's double , Steve Bridges , was very funny , in a safe , non - offensive way .My guess is that Colbert 's routine , while not as well - received by the White House press corps , or the president and his cronies , will be much more memorable .Kieth Olbermann and Dana Milbank ( MSNBC 's \" Countdown \" , May 1 2006 ) didn\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 t like the performance the other night of their fellow entertainer Stephen Colbert at the Washington Correspondent\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 s Dinner .Both seemed prudishly miffed by the fact that Colbert had made the President uncomfortable - reenacting the Victorian cluck - fest the two held in the wake of the Corretta Scott King funeral , at which Bush\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 s panties had gotten similarly bunched .Olbermann incomprehensibly took a proprietary role regarding our president\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 s delicate sensibilities by worrying wether the dinner was \" the right venue \" for such talk .Milbank dismissed Colbert 's act by saying \" I don\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 t think he crossed a line : I just don\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 t think he was terribly funny \" .Wrong on both counts , Dana ; Colbert crossed lines that Washington\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 s timid journalists fear to even approach - the way a dog implicitly avoids its Invisible Electric Fence - and the satire was pristine .It was hilarious and bold because it rang true .The only people who weren\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 t laughing were those being so exquisitely skewered : the Bush administration and its huge stable of media sycophants - essentially the entire live audience .Out here in the country and blogosphere its all anyone can talk about - and we loved it !I found one of the funniest aspects of the show to be when the camera would reveal to us at home the stony faces of well - known journalists experiencing the first pangs of cognitive dissonance , and the realization that Colbert was in fact roasting them .Like most franticly defensive reactions , Olbermann\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 s and Milbank\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 s objections lack internal logic .The two make no bones about the fact that these events themselves are fatuous , pretentious , and \" painful \" to attend - and yet they lament the possibility that Colbert had \" irrevocably damaged \" the Correspondents dinner .Well , that\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 s what a good iconoclast does - he shatters institutions that damage or strangle society .I hope there never is another \" Correspondent\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 s Dinner \" , as it has always been an unnatural affair which has served to tame our Fourth Estate to the hand of their masters .I don\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 t want my journalists enjoying \" cucumber martinis \" with those who should be treated as their natural enemies - our government .Its not good for the country .Colbert is a patriotic hero , and funny to boot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.000923"}
