{"text": "Let 's go back to Kevin James ' May of 2015 column , where he detailed the free college initiative- and how it would fail : .The idea would cost $ 70 billion per year , more than twice what the federal government spends on Pell grants .And much of that money would provide a free education to students whose families can already afford it .But even more important than how much we spend and who we spend it on , we should ask ourselves what impact free public college would have on the delivery system of higher education .That is , would free college make higher education more efficient , more innovative and higher quality ? [ ... ] .Right now we have a decentralized system where students can take much of their student aid with them to the institution of their choosing .This enables a wide variety of organizations - public and private - to offer a range of different educational programs .In contrast , free public college would limit choice as many private institutions , now trying to compete with a highly - subsidized , free public option , would likely struggle to survive .In addition to reducing options , this would significantly reduce pressure on public institutions to serve students effectively .Many free college proponents would likely point out that by providing aid directly to institutions , the government can actually exert more direct control over how they operate .For example , Sanders ' bill would require institutions to reduce their reliance on adjunct professors .But are such top - down controls really likely to create the dynamic and innovative system that we need ?By trying to dictate innovation from Washington , such a proposal is more likely to create a system that is rigid , bureaucratic and unresponsive to the changing needs of students and the economy over time .[ ... ] . ...there are a remarkable number of regulatory barriers preventing new and innovative educational institutions from gaining a foothold .Thus , what occurs naturally in other industries - innovative market entrants shaking up the status quo - rarely occurs in higher education .Policymakers must work to clear out unnecessary regulatory underbrush that impedes new options .Fundamentally , the \" price \" of free public college is more than the money taxpayers would spend on it .By moving us to a system based largely on public institutions managed through top - down regulation , Sanders ' proposal would exacerbate the challenges above , not solve them .He also wrote that we should \" foster more entrepreneurship in higher education , \" and force colleges to have more skin in the game , instead of just worrying about meeting enrollment quotas and graduation rates ; they should be invested more in the outcome of their students .The huge part of this will come from the entrepreneurial side , which under socialism , can not thrive .Here We Go : Voting Underway New Hampshire , Trump and Sanders Are Frontrunners .Tuesday , February 9 .By Guy Benson .MANCHESTER , NH -- Coming out of Iowa , a few narratives began to congeal : Hillary is going to struggle to put Bernie away .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.53946"}
