Nov. 9 , 2009 ) ( Norgle , J. ) Judge Norgle denied defendant Neo - Neon International 's ( \" Neo - Neon \" ) Fed . R. Civ .P. 12(c ) motion for judgment on the pleadings regarding plaintiff 's unjust enrichment claim in this copyright dispute .Plaintiff sued Neo - Neon and others for alleged infringement of plaintiff 's copyrighted decorative holiday lighting products .Plaintiff also asserted an unjust enrichment claim against Neo - Neon alleging that Neo - Neon profited from making , using and selling products based upon plaintiff 's designs .The unjust enrichment claim met the first prong of the preemption test because plaintiff admitted the designs at issue were copyrighted .But the second prong was not met .Neo - Neon 's accused acts occurred outside the US , in China .Because the alleged acts were extraterritorial , they did not fall within the exclusive rights granted to copyright holders pursuant to \u00a7 106 .This was true even though the same acts in the US would presumably have been covered and , therefore , preempted . ...Continue Reading .Cassetica Software , Inc.v.

Civ .P. 12(b)(6 ) motion to dismiss plaintiff 's copyright , trade secret and related state law claims .The Court noted that the Seventh Circuit required a registered copyright , not just pre - registration , to file a copyright complaint .But the Court held that it was sufficient to allege the registration and did not dismiss the claim because the registration was not attached .The Court did note , however , that the registration requirement was jurisdictional and the motion , therefore , should have been styled a Fed . R. Civ .P. 12(b)(1 ) motion for lack of jurisdiction .The Court also denied defendants ' motion to dismiss plaintiff 's trade secret complaints .While plaintiff did not specifically identified the allegedly misappropriated trade secrets they did allege misappropriation of customer lists , vision test methodologies and other information that could be trade secrets .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.72414"}
