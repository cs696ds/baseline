Scott Applewhite , File ) / AP .\" I do not believe a filibuster is appropriate and I would oppose such a move , \" McCain told reporters Monday , two days after Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell raised the possibility of forcing a showdown vote .In the fiercest exchange of Hagel 's confirmation hearing last week , McCain questioned the nominee about the Iraq war and whether he was right or wrong in opposing an additional 30,000 U.S. troops in 2007 .The Arizona senator said he still has questions on the nomination and \" was not happy with his ( Hagel 's ) failure to answer a really simple question .\" But McCain insisted he would not support use of the filibuster , a procedural tactic which can derail a confirmation vote and which can be stopped only by the votes of 60 of the 100 senators .Several other Republican senators echoed McCain about a step that would be historic on a Cabinet choice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.34279"}
{"text": "Recommended Games .Suspense in Senate : Debt vote shrouded in secrecy .The meeting came after lawmakers voted on must - pass legislation to increase the government 's debt limit and after their leaders decided to drop the parliamentary equivalent of a curtain on the voting until its outcome was assured ( AP Photo / Manuel Balce Ceneta ) .Nervous senators were watching too , well aware that political fortunes could be on the line .So on perhaps the most important vote of the year , the Senate did something extraordinary this week : It tried to keep the vote tally secret until the outcome was assured .As lawmakers voted Wednesday on must - pass legislation to increase the government 's debt limit , they dropped the parliamentary equivalent of a curtain on the voting as it was in progress .Typically , roll - call votes in the Senate play out in a very public manner .People watching from the galleries or tracking action from afar via C - SPAN can watch democracy unfold in all its messy wonder .Each senator 's vote is announced by the clerk ; each time a senator switches sides , that 's announced too .Onlookers can keep a running tally of how it 's going .But not this time .Fifteen minutes into the vote , as captured by C - Span cameras , the tally clerk rose to recite the vote .A Senate aide alerted Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz . , one of the six Republicans who later switched his vote from \" nay \" to \" aye .\" McCain intervened , and the clerk sat right back down .\" Would you ... \" McCain said before the live microphone cut off .A McCain spokesman denied the Arizonan intervened . \" McCain did n't know that they were n't going to read the names and he did n't care if they did .He did n't have input on that , \" emailed spokesman Brian Rogers .Senate leaders hoped they would get the necessary votes ultimately , but they were worried at the time and faced financial and political repercussions if the vote cratered in public view .Both sides were concerned that investors might panic , causing the stock market to tank in real time .That 's what happened in 2008 when the House voted to reject a Wall Street bailout plan , triggering a 7 percent drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .Skittish Republicans had an additional concern : They knew the Democratic - backed legislation could n't move forward without at least a few GOP votes , but none of them wanted to be left hanging out there alone on what could be a politically treacherous vote .Whatever the reason , they kept the public in the dark while they worked things out .A Democratic spokesman later explained that Republicans requested the clerk stay silent so it would be easier for GOP senators to switch their votes .No more announcing each individual \" yea \" and \" nay .\" The running tally was known only by a handful of insiders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.40158"}
