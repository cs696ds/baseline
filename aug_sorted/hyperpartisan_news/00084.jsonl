{"text": "Evidence demonstrates that children of Turkish , Kurdish or Arabic backgrounds - known as \" migrant \" children in Germany even if they are the second or even third generation of immigrants - wind up in disproportionate numbers in the lowest level Hauptschule , condemning them to a cycle of marginalization .Migrant children in Germany , on average , attend a Hauptschule twice as often as even other children of the same socioeconomic class .Migrant children , despite some progress , also continue to be underrepresented in the highest - level Gymnasiums .In short , the German education system is failing to help children overcome the disadvantage and marginalization that they experience as a result of their background , including as ethnic or religious minorities .After a 2000 OECD study found German children , too , fall well below the average performance on literacy , math , and science across the 32 countries surveyed , Germany attempted to address these deficiencies .An effort to improve the situation of migrant children , in particular , included integrating the Hauptschule and Realschule into a new kind of school , the Sekundarschule , which was recently introduced in Berlin .The purpose of this change was to create greater mobility within the secondary school system and to encourage ethnic diversity among student populations .But only a small percentage of schools were restructured and the impact on minority students is unclear .In Berlin , in an effort to integrate student populations , Gymnasiums are no longer allowed to handpick all their students .A Gymnasium may pick 60 per cent of its students ( and 10 percent are reserved for siblings ) , but the remaining 30 per cent of its places will be allocated by lottery and are open to all pupils .In theory , attempts to create more diverse schools are a positive development .But in reality , this reform has prompted an increasingly hostile attitude towards migrants and , in particular , those affiliated with Islam - mainly people of Turkish , Kurdish , and Arabic descent .Integrated schools have also adopted segregated classrooms : in Berlin , both primary and secondary schools , and especially Gymnasiums , have started to create separate classes for native - born German and for migrant students , with predictably negative consequences for the latter .The separation of students into different classrooms is done under the pretext that the migrant students ' German language skills are inadequate for \" regular \" classes .These children commonly speak German ( as a second language ) , but some may require additional language support to enable them to access regular classes .They simply are not getting that additional support , dooming them to permanent educational careers in the lowest level classes .Under a recently introduced policy , students who are not performing at a certain level after the first year are dismissed from Gymnasium and \" relegated \" to special classes in an integrated secondary school .Unsurprisingly , this practice disproportionately affects children with a migrant background .In 2011 , only a few weeks into the school year , many migrant students in Berlin were informed by their teachers that they were unlikely to pass ; unremarkably , they eventually failed the first year test .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "41.124382"}

{"text": "Y , T & A v. Berlin Education Authority .Three school pupils of migrant background were admitted to the Leonardo da Vinci gymnasium , a top grammar school in Berlin .They were placed in a class disproportionately composed of children of migrant background .The class and the students were treated as having no academic future .Within a few months , the students were told that they would be relegated from the gymnasium at the end of the school year to a lower - level secondary school , due to poor results .A legal challenge to their treatment argued that educational reforms adopted in Berlin , which in principle allow easier access to quality secondary education at the gymnasium level , are being implemented in a discriminatory fashion that continues to restrict educational opportunities for children of migrant background .While their legal challenge failed , it brought about a change in the policy of Berlin schools .Facts .In August 2011 , the Leonardo da Vinci gymnasium established a class with approximately 66 percent of pupils from a migrant background .They came from the same primary school which itself was mainly composed of students of migrant descent .Some of the students had received a recommendation from former teachers that they should attend the gymnasium .Others had taken advantage of a change in the law that allowed them to attend without a specific gymnasium recommendation .By October 2011 , several students in this class were informed that they were to be relegated from the gymnasium at the end of the year and would be sent to lower - level Sekundarschulen elsewhere in Berlin .During the rest of the academic year , the students complained that harsh disciplinary measures were imposed upon them and that the attitude of the school was that they were a \" lost cause .\" Some of the parents requested that their children be transferred to another , less \" problematic \" parallel class , but this was refused .The school stated that it had not subjected the students to any discriminatory treatment , and that the reason for the relegation was that the students showed unacceptable behavior , were uninterested in learning , and came from a low education family environment .At the end of the year , the students were relegated to the Alfred Durer integrated school , where they were placed in special classes for relegated pupils .In December 2012 , an answer to a question in the Berlin Parliament revealed that there were twice as many school pupils of migrant origin who were relegated from Berlin gymnasium than children without a migration background .Other schools in Berlin have segregated classes in which virtually all the children are from a migrant background .Across Germany as a whole , the official 2010 Ministry of Education report [ PDF ] reveals that children with a migration background attend the lowest tier secondary education twice as often as children without a migration background - even within the same socio - economic class .Open Society Justice Initiative Involvement .Three students sought to challenge their discriminatory treatment and subsequent relegation by the school .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.321724"}
