{"text": "It really is just that simple .I 'm not sure how or why they believe there 's a religious exception to having to obey negotiated consent decrees ... but apparently these folks think there is one .If they were ethical people , though , they 'd have taken responsibility for their wrongdoing , would n't be purposely misrepresenting the situation , and accept the punishment that goes along with it .But we all know that religionists do n't possess the integrity to do that .The religionazis who are currently in charge of the state of Oklahoma , took a hit recently in their effort to use Ten Commandment monuments on government sites to proselytize their religion ( as reported by the AP , via Google News ): .Backers of a new law authorizing a privately funded Ten Commandments monument on the grounds of Oklahoma 's Capitol did n't get good news this week .A three - judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that a similar display at the Haskell County Courthouse in Stigler was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion , prompting both sides to wonder if legal wrangling over the state law is next .Both of these laws were rationalized in the wake of cases such as Glassroth v. Moore , which collectively made it clear that government - funded religious monuments were unconstitutional .They figure that having someone else pay for the monument somehow made it acceptable to put it on government grounds and convey the inevitable impression that that 's the government religion .Nice try , but no dice , folks ... or so the 10th Circuit basically said .Fortunately , their maneuverings are transparent and predictable , making it easy to counter them .Religionists have found an additional avenue for driving religion into public schools .And that is to get the kids to promote religion themselves .They can then declare that the promotion of religion was voluntary on the kids ' part and is not adult proselytizing .Here 's an example of this tactic in practice : .This past school year , a second - grader decided to sing Awesome God .But during rehearsal , the teacher in charge , on hearing the title and lyrics , told the child that principal Joyce Brennan would have to approve that song .Brennan contacted the attorney for the school district .Brennan then explained in a letter to the child 's mother that the song was \" inappropriate for a school - run event with a captive audience of , in many cases , quite young children because of its religious content . \" In the Frenchtown Elementary School 's case , the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey is supporting the child plaintiff .Attorney Jennifer Klear , who took the case on behalf of the ACLU , filed a brief to the court .In it , she made the essential - and to me , obvious - point that it was the child who chose the song , not the school .Here 's the problem with this scenario as it 's being painted - that a second grader , of all people ( what , 7 or 8 years old ? ) spontaneously decided that an appropriate song for a school assembly was a hymn , of all things ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.22891"}
