{"text": "While I understand airline employees have to enforce the rules , this has nothing to do with security and it 's a rule that has n't been enforced for years .Is it a coincidence that now airlines make big bucks off those checked bag fees ?Just make sure you pack even more patience before heading to the airport .What frustrating thing will happen at the airport next ?Unlike most things in life , once you book an airline ticket you 're stuck with it unless you want to pay big bucks to change the reservation .Most airlines do n't make it an easy decision as it 's sometimes cheaper to just book a one way ticket to change your flight .All those fees add up for the airlines .Between reservation changes and baggage fees , airlines collected $ 5.7 billion in fees in 2010 .Delta stood out from the crowd collecting more than $ 470-thousand dollars more in 2010 than 2009 in just baggage fees .American came in second but made far less money - just over $ 105-thousand dollars in baggage fees .I refuse to pay those fees and could n't tell you the last time I checked baggage .Luggage alone would easily add $ 100 to a family 's tab if they were to take a trip .Think of all the stuff you need to pack for young kids .Anytime I check luggage at the airport , I wonder if I 'll ever see it again .Even with fewer people checking bags because of the fees , you still worry that a checked bag will get lost and never make it to your destination .According to the latest government data , your chance of a damaged , lost , or delayed baggage are highest on American Eagle Airlines , and least likely on Air Tran Airways .Losing your baggage is a big hassle and really impacts your vacation especially if it 's on a cruise which happened to me several years ago .Not knowing where your luggage is located and when or if it will arrive is one of the worst things .Now , one airline is helping ease your mind with a system that lets you track your luggage as it makes its way on and off planes and through the airport systems .If you fly and check bags on Delta , your luggage will be treated like a trackable piece of mail .You can track the bag by your last name and bag tag number .If you do n't have a smartphone , there will be self - service kiosks at 18 of Delta 's busiest airports .You 'll be able to see where your bag is , the carousel it will arrive on , and file a claim if it 's damaged or does n't arrive .If your bag is delayed for more than 12 hours , Delta says it will give you a $ 25 transportation credit voucher .You 'll get $ 50 for two checked bags .It 's unclear if the credit voucher will be on top of the baggage fee you paid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.216286"}

{"text": "Did not end up using the backpack option .There was a problem loading comments right now .Please try again later .I have grown tired of flying with a full - size suitcase that has to be checked and do n't like the thought that my bag can get lost by an airline .So , I bought this bag to use .It is really good quality and can take a lot of abuse .It also stands out nice compared to all the black Samsonite luggage out there and has a great set of wheels and telescoping handle .I 'm thinking about buying a matching one for my wife as well before our next trip .Great product and I would definitely buy again .A hefty ' personal ' bag .What it is : A bag designed to comply with Spirit Airlines ' maximum limits for a personal bag , thus avoiding fees for carry - ons .For example , if you try to sneak through a bag that does n't comply with the maximum of 16 by 14 by 12 inches for a personal bag and get caught at the gate , it 'll run you $ 45 .That 's just a bit less than this bag costs .The bag also fits under the airline 's seating in many cases .It comes in black and three other colored patterns , and is made of polyurethane or polyester .It has a 23-inch telescoping handle , wheels and a strap handle .The good : Actually a handy bag whether you 're flying Spirit or another airline , the CarryOn Free is roomier than you might think .I packed all of my clothes , toiletries , an extra pair of shoes and a netbook for a four - day getaway .Beyond that I was able to take some of my overpacking wife 's items .Vacuum bags , now a mainstay for me , helped immensely .In addition to the main zippered compartment , there is a smaller compartment for , say , small electronics and your liquids , but take care not to stuff it , or the bag may end up oversize .The CarryOn also has a handy compartment in front for things such as boarding passes and passports .In an overhead bin , the bag takes up less space than a standard carry - on bag .The bad : Though the CarryOn is meant to meet Spirit 's personal - bag size maximum , it may not pass muster with other airlines as a personal bag .In many cases , however , all they require is that a personal bag fit under the seat .On many planes , this can .But even with Spirit , a wary gate agent asked if it met requirements .I strode up to the testing frame and momentarily panicked when it did n't fit in bottom first .When I turned it upside down , it slid in snugly - a perfect fit .The bag is heavy for its size : 7 pounds empty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.545006"}
