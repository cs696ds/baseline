{"text": "According to statistics reported by ABC News , nearly 30 percent of students are either bullies or victims of bullying , and 160,000 kids stay home from school every day because of fear of bullying .Bully - related suicide can be connected to any type of bullying , including physical bullying , emotional bullying , cyberbullying , and sexting , or circulating suggestive or nude photos or messages about a person .Some of the warning signs of suicide can include : o Showing signs of depression , like ongoing sadness , withdrawal from others , losing interest in favorite activities , or trouble sleeping or eating .o Talking about or showing an interest in death or dying .o Engaging in dangerous or harmful activities , including reckless behavior , substance abuse , or self injury .o Giving away favorite possessions and saying goodbye to people .o Saying or expressing that they ca n't handle things anymore .o Making comments that things would be better without them .If a person is displaying these symptoms , talk to them about your concerns and get them help right away , such as from a counselor , doctor , or at the emergency room .In some cases , it may not be obvious that a teen is thinking about suicide , such as when the suicide seems to be triggered by a particularly bad episode of bullying .In several cases where bullying victims killed themselves , bullies had told the teen that he or she should kill him or herself or that the world would be better without them .Others who hear these types of statements should be quick to stop them and explain to the victim that the bully is wrong .Other ways to help people who may be considering suicide include : o Take all talk or threats of suicide seriously .Do n't tell the person they are wrong or that they have a lot to live for .Instead , get them immediate medical help .o Keep weapons and medications away from anyone who is at risk for suicide .Get these items out of the house or at least securely locked up .o Parents should encourage their teens to talk about bullying that takes place .It may be embarrassing for kids to admit they are the victims of bullying , and most kids do n't want to admit they have been involved in bullying .Tell victims that it 's not their fault that they are being bullied and show them love and support .Get them professional help if the bullying is serious .o It is a good idea for parents to insist on being included in their children 's friends on social networking sites so they can see if someone has posted mean messages about them online .Text messages may be more difficult to know about , so parents should try to keep open communications with their children about bullying .o Parents who see a serious bullying problem should talk to school authorities about it , and perhaps arrange a meeting with the bully 's parents .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.627472"}
