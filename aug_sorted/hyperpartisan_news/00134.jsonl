'We 've been ID'ing voters who are leaners , people who are not sure , and we 've been knocking on thousands and thousands of doors for literally months and I 'll tell you it feels good out there . '\" Pickett 's article also details the data operation fueling the Cruz effort where the campaign micro - targets individual voters based on information gathered from extensive telephone and in - person interviews .Most of the campaigns would probably claim they 're doing similar things , but Cruz has already demonstrated that his operation is capable of squeezing every possible vote out of a state .For his part , Donald Trump also appears to have ditched the \" big rally \" strategy he unsuccessfully used in Iowa in favor of smaller , more retail - politics type events in The Granite State .But some are skeptical of Trump 's motives for the switch to more intimate rallies .New Hampshire native Steve Berman of The Resurgent explains , \" Could the smaller venues be a result of falling attendance at his super - rallies ?Trump claimed 11,500 in Little Rock , but the embarrassing tale of the tape pegs the number in the more dismal neighborhood of 4,000 or less .What 's clear is that the Trump band is no longer as new and shiny as it was a few months ago .Now , he 's just another candidate ... .\" Trump 's failure to invest in technology and shoe leather , along with his missed targets in Iowa lead me to believe , along with people on the ground in New Hampshire , that Trump will underperform his polls there .By how much ?We do n't know yet , but it 's likely Ted Cruz knows .Berman 's article was written before Saturday night 's Rubio crash - and - burn , so his conclusions may have changed some over the weekend .But the gist is he believes Trump will underperform and Cruz will do better - perhaps significantly so - than his poll numbers would suggest .There 's even more evidence that this may be the case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.573685"}
