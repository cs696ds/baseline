Lee .At about that time , Wool learned that General Taylor 's troops had taken Monterrey , Mexico , and that an armistice had put the war on hold for weeks .Wool 's troops continued their march into Mexico , traveling up to thirty - five miles per day in the desert .In December 1846 , Wool 's Army of the Central made a brutal march of 115 miles in three days from Parras to Agua Nueva , a few miles south of Saltillo .Taylor stopped the Chihuahua expedition because he needed Wool 's men for reinforcements due to the threat of Santa Anna 's Mexican army to the south .At Agua Nueva , small groups of mounted soldiers were sent on patrols .Some thirty - four Arkansans under Major Borland were captured on January 23 , 1847 , at Encarnacion due to the lack of guards at the rancho where they and their Kentucky counterparts slept .Also captured there was Kentucky lieutenant Thomas J.
