Johnson commuted the sentences of several hundred prisoners serving mandatory minimum sentences under the Narcotics Control Act of 1956 , without objection by Congress .The historical lack of controversy should n't be surprising .Under our tripartite system of government , an act of executive clemency in no sense \" usurps \" legislative or judicial authority .Rather , in the words of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , it \" is a part of the Constitutional scheme .When granted it is the determination of the ultimate [ executive ] authority that the public welfare will be better served by inflicting less than what the judgment fixed . \" The president 's pardoning authority is therefore limited only by the text of the Constitution itself , not by the transitory terms of the criminal code .Indeed , that was the Framers ' point in giving the power to the president in the first place , to act as a check on the other branches .To be sure , the president 's systematic exercise of the pardon power to benefit \" specific classes of offenders \" has not gone entirely unchallenged by Congress .But the Supreme Court long ago resolved this dispute in favor of Obama 's authority to redress the injustices entrenched by the current federal sentencing regime .In the aftermath of the Civil War , President Andrew Johnson issued a series of amnesty proclamations that restored the civil rights of former Confederate sympathizers .This was enormously controversial at the time , not least because it undermined the Radical Republican 's designs for the post - war reconstruction of Southern society .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.297653"}

Board of Education , would not have actually changed education for racial minorities in this country , had not thousands of people marched and fought and made that decision real .Gideon was the kind of decision that did n't have advocates , did n't have people out there insisting that enforcement take place right away .It was really left to the discretion of states and some states took up the challenge and many states did n't .And so today we have only 24 states that have statewide public defender systems .We have lots of states that have done very little to make the right to counsel for poor people effective .And so 50 years after Gideon , sadly , we still have a system that treats you better if you 're rich and guilty than if you 're poor and innocent .Wealth is still the determinative factor .BILL MOYERS :And how have events since then affected our inability or unwillingness to carry Gideon out ?BRYAN STEVENSON : Everything has been aggravated by mass incarceration .As you point out in the 1960s , there were 200,000 people in jails , in prisons .The number of people who were poor facing confinement was a very small percentage , or half .Today , we have 2.2 million people in jails and prisons , nearly five million people on probation and parole .And so our appetite for punishment , for incarceration , for condemnation has made the demand , the need for lawyers much greater than we 've been able to comply with , we 've been able to meet .And so I think quite sadly , the situation for poor people in the criminal justice system is much , much worse today than it was in 1963 , largely as a function of numbers .BILL MOYERS :What 's been the impact of the war on drugs ?BRYAN STEVENSON :Well , the war on drugs has been probably the biggest factor in driving the prison population up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.713665"}

Bush , who announced just before the opening of our legislative session that Texas RFRA would be one of his legislative priorities as well .Of course you know that no bill is a simple bill .Early on , I saw that the model RFRA language left open a possibility that the act could be used to get around Texas ' civil rights laws .That concern was first raised to me by the AJC , and then later the ADL , the two groups that had initially brought me the legislation , and two groups with long histories of defending civil rights internationally .Clearly , the intended purpose of this bill was not to weaken civil rights laws .When Gov.

{"text": "\" Carter 's appeal for a new moratorium falls at a time of mounting unease about the huge disparities in the use of capital punishment in America .For three days , The Arizona Republic has examined prosecutor conduct and misconduct , citing cases in which prosecutors stepped over the line without suffering consequences to themselves or the convictions they win .The question remains : What can be done about it ?Options already are in place .Yet , neither likes to do so .Prosecutors are arguably the most powerful people in the courtroom : They file the charges and offer the plea agreements .They determine whether to seek the death penalty , and , given mandatory sentencing , predetermine the consequence of a guilty verdict .Defense attorneys worry that if they cross a prosecutor , future clients could be treated more harshly the next time they face that prosecutor in court .Judges worry about prosecutors who use court rules to bypass those judges who rein them in .Both know that prosecutors are rarely sanctioned by the court or investigated by the State Bar of Arizona for ethical misconduct .So overly aggressive prosecutors continue to have their way in the courtroom - as long as they win cases , experts say .\" It comes from this ' end - justifies - the - means mentality , ' ' ' said Jon Sands , the federal public defender for Arizona .\" We 'll do anything we can to bring someone to justice .This symposium will be the culminating event of the American Bar Association 's eight - year endeavor to examine the fairness and accuracy of various death penalty jurisdictions in the United States .These states represent 65 % of the executions that have taken place in the U.S. in the modern death penalty era .The assessments have had a considerable impact on policy in those states as well as nationwide , and have played an important role in the continuing debate over capital punishment in the United States .Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter will open our symposium , which will be followed by a series of special issue panels discussing the ABA 's findings in various jurisdictions , recommendations for reform , and implications for the future of the death penalty in America .The Symposium is sponsored by the ABA Section of Individual Rights and Responsibilities , ABA Criminal Justice Section , Andrews Kurth , and Sutherland .Also , the IRR Section has announced that Ron Tabak will be the 2014 recipient of the Section 's Father Robert Drinan Award for Distinguished Service in recognition of his outstanding service and commitment .The award will be presented the evening of Friday , February 7 , 2014 in Chicago as part of the ABA 's 2014 Mid - Year Meeting .Monday , 14 October 2013 .That 's the title of an OpEd by Mark L.

Stevenson and John F. Stinneford .The Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution states : \" Excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted .\" This amendment prohibits the federal government from imposing unduly harsh penalties on criminal defendants , either as the price for obtaining pretrial release or as punishment for crime after conviction .The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause is the most important and controversial part of the Eighth Amendment .In some ways , the Clause is shrouded in mystery .What does it mean for a punishment to be \" cruel and unusual \" ?How do we measure a punishment 's cruelty ?And if a punishment is cruel , why should we care whether it is \" unusual \" ?We do know some things about the history of the phrase \" cruel and unusual punishments . \" In 1689 - a full century before the ratification of the United States Constitution - England adopted a Bill of Rights that prohibited \" cruell and unusuall punishments . \" In 1776 , George Mason included a prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments in the Declaration of Rights he drafted for the Commonwealth of Virginia .In 1791 , this same prohibition became the central component of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution .When the United States Constitution was first ratified by the states , it did not contain a Bill of Rights , and it did not prohibit cruel and unusual punishments .These protections were not added until after the Constitution was ratified .The debates that occurred while the states were deciding whether to ratify the Constitution shed some light on the meaning of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause , because they show why many people thought this Clause was needed .The proposed Constitution made the federal government much more powerful than it had been under the Articles of Confederation .One of the most significant of these new powers was the power to create federal crimes and to punish those who committed them .Opponents of the Constitution feared that this new power would allow Congress to use cruel punishments as a tool for oppressing the people .Patrick Henry asserted , even more pointedly than Holmes , that the lack of a prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments meant that Congress could use punishment as a tool of oppression : \" Congress . . . .may introduce the practice of France , Spain , and Germany of torturing , to extort a confession of the crime .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.8853"}
{"text": "So we have before us soon today , first of all , we have a rule which I am in support of , but the bill , well - intentioned as it is , may cause far more harm than good .Because , instead of limiting religious discrimination , it will allow for an increase in other forms of discrimination .Instead of enhancing constitutional protections , it may very well run afoul of the Constitution itself .I would like to take a moment or two to explain this .A letter came to me from the American Civil Liberties Union that started out working with a coalition supporting this bill .It was multiracial , multireligious .But now the Religious Liberty Protection Act is being opposed by the Civil Liberties organization because it does not include explicit language ensuring that the language will not undermine the enforcement of civil rights laws .The Congress should not break from its long - standing practice , they say , of refraining from undermining or preempting State civil rights laws that are more protective of civil rights sometimes than even Federal law .So the opposition by the Civil Liberties organization is , unless this bill is corrected and amended to protect civil rights laws , and I think the substitute of the gentleman from New York ( Mr. Nadler ) would accomplish this , we would have a very serious problem .The Civil Liberties Union goes on to say that , .We are no longer a part of the coalition supporting the Religious Liberty Protection Act because we could not ignore the potentially severe consequences that it may have on State and local civil rights laws .And although we believe that courts should find civil rights laws compelling and uniform enforcement of these laws the least restrictive means , we know that at least several courts have already rejected that position .We have found that landlords across the country have been using State religious liberty claims to challenge the application of State and local civil rights laws protecting persons against marital status discrimination .Now , none of these claims involve owner - occupied housing .All of the landlords owned many investment properties that were outside of the State laws exemptions for small landlords .These landlords are companies .And they all sought to turn the shield of religious exercise protection into a sword against civil rights prospective tenants .So , Mr. Speaker , we want to consider an alternative , an improvement , if possible , to this measure .Without this improvement , I think this is a serious regression in both religious liberty and in civil rights protections as well .My religion made me do it .This is a right no other citizen or government can assert .So the bill is so sweeping that this new defense will not only apply to religious institutions themselves but to companies and corporations as well .Pursuant to House Resolution 245 , the bill is considered read for amendment .The text of H.R. 1691 is as follows : .Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled , .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.9328"}

Smith decision .We have heard the Smith decision being mentioned quite frequently because it has been the one that has upset the apple cart in terms of recognizing the importance of individuals having the personal and private right of exercising their religion .Congress attempted to remedy this by enacting on a bipartisan basis the Religious Freedom Restoration Act which the court struck down in part in its 1997 City of Boerne v.

Review Board .There are numerous examples that we can find , for example , where it was partially struck down , of churches being ejected from certain neighborhoods , church soup kitchens and welfare programs being closed and prisoners having been denied basic rights to worship .But , Mr. Speaker , I started out by saying this is an enormously important constitutional right .My question to my colleagues : .Can we do less in the United States Congress ?Can we in fostering a bill that is to enhance rights not ensure that we protect the rights of others who simply want to ensure that they in a more vulnerable position not be denied civil rights ?My fear is that passing of this legislation without respecting the civil rights has some concerns that we should acknowledge .Mr. Speaker , I rise today in support of H.R. 1691 , the Religious Liberties Protection Act of 1999 .This legislation was introduced by my friend , the gentleman from Florida ( Mr. Canady ) , and it is an important step in preserving the freedom that the Constitution affords religions in America .A little over 10 years ago , 200 of our Nation 's leaders from all sectors signed the Williamsburg Charter .It affirmed that , ' ' Religious liberty in a democracy is a right that may not be submitted to vote and depends on the outcome of no election .A society is only as just and as free as it is respectful of this right , especially toward the beliefs of the smallest minorities and the least popular religious communities .

Stevenson , Professor of Clinical Law , New York University School of Law , and Executive Director , Equal Justice Initiative .Read the full discussion here .My own research into the original meaning of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause shows that Justice Scalia 's and Thomas 's approach has a fatal flaw : It ignores the meaning of the word \" unusual .\" Their decision to ignore this word makes sense because there seems to be no connection between a punishment 's rarity and its cruelty .In other words , a common punishment might be more cruel than a rare one : For example , it would be more cruel to commit torture on a mass scale than on rare occasions , not less .But in reality , the word \" unusual \" in the Eighth Amendment did not originally mean \" rare\"- it meant \" contrary to long usage , \" or \" new . \"A punishment is cruel and unusual if it is \" cruel in light of long usage \" - that is , cruel in comparison to longstanding prior practice or tradition .This understanding of the original meaning of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause leads to very different results than either the non - originalist approach or Justices Scalia 's and Thomas 's approach .The best way to understand this is to run through those four questions once again , using our new understanding of the original meaning of the Clause : .( 1 )The appropriate benchmark for determining whether a punishment is cruel and unusual is neither the subjective feelings of the current Supreme Court nor the outdated standards of 1791 .Rather , the benchmark is longstanding prior practice .If a given punishment has been continuously used for a very long time , this is powerful evidence that multiple generations of Americans have considered it reasonable and just .This does not mean that any punishment that was once part of our tradition can still be used today .If a once - traditional punishment falls out of usage for several generations , it becomes unusual .If a legislature then tries to reintroduce it , courts should compare how harsh it is relative to those punishment practices that are still part of our tradition .( 2 )The Clause prohibits disproportionate punishments as well as barbaric methods of punishment .If a punishment is significantly harsher than punishments traditionally given for the same or similar crimes , it is cruel and unusual , even though the same punishment might be acceptable for other crimes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.13727"}

Simpson , to be tried in criminal court for a crime and then be sued in civil court for damages caused by the same criminal act .The laws and rules that apply to the two different legal systems are sufficiently different that , for the purposes of the Fifth Amendment , they are considered distinct .Additionally , an individual may also be tried for different crimes committed in the course of one action or set of actions .For example , when Timothy McVeigh was tried in Federal Court for bombing the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City , he had been charged with murdering federal government employees and with destroying federal government property .The possibility remains that McVeigh could still be tried in Oklahoma state court for the murders of the other people killed in the bombing .Because they are separate crimes ( as defined in the law ) , another trial would not bring about \" double jeopardy . \"No Excessive , Cruel or Unusual Fines or Punishments .The Eighth Amendment forbids the government from imposing excessive bail , fines or \" cruel and unusual \" punishments .Given the era during which the Eighth Amendment was drafted and ratified , one of its obvious intents was to prohibit torture .Under the limitations imposed by the Constitution , penalties for crimes may include fines or incarceration , but not excessively painful or physically harmful penalties such as whippings or branding , both common practices in the 1700s .The Court has also interpreted the Eighth Amendment to prohibit imprisonment in unsanitary or inhumane conditions .However , the Court has been reluctant to define such conditions too broadly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.265945"}

Rick Perry spare his life .Alternately , the petition asks for a 120-day reprieve to pursue a new sentencing hearing .Although the other five killers received new hearings , all again were sentenced to death .One has been executed .The problem in Buck 's case arose when Dr. Walter Quijano , a defense psychiatrist , testified that the killer would not likely pose a future danger to society if imprisoned .\" Future danger \" is a key question jurors must consider before assessing a death sentence .On cross - examination , however , the doctor agreed to a prosecutor 's assertion that being African - American enhanced chances for future violence .That comment became a key factor in the state 's push for execution .Tuesday , 06 September 2011 .There is no question that Duane Edward Buck killed two people and wounded a third victim in a 1995 shooting in Houston .But there are two nagging questions concerning Buck 's case that we must ask : . 1 ) Should he have received the death penalty for his crimes ? 2 ) Would he have been sentenced to death had his race not become a major factor in the trial 's punishment phase ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.32364"}

{"text": "Against Cruel Innovation : The Original Meaning of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause , and Why It Matters Today .By John F. Stinneford .This essay concerns the original meaning of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause .It argues that the Constitution should be interpreted in accordance with its original public meaning , and it demonstrates what effect such an interpretation would have in the real world .In recent years , some judges and scholars have argued that the meaning of the Constitution should change as societal values change .For example , Chief Justice Earl Warren once famously wrote that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause should \" draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society . \"Trop v. Dulles ( 1958 ) .This approach allows the Supreme Court to get to whatever result it considers desirable , regardless of what the text of the Constitution actually means .If the Court wanted to get rid of the death penalty , for example , it could simply announce that the death penalty no longer comports with current \" standards of decency , \" and thereby abolish it .Originalists object to this approach for many reasons , including the fact that it is inconsistent with democratic principles and the rule of law .Phrased differently , there is nothing in the Constitution that gives unelected judges the authority to overturn laws enacted by democratically elected legislatures , based on the judges ' own subjective ideas of what current \" standards of decency \" require .In response to the non - originalist approach to the Constitution , some judges and scholars - most prominently Justices Scalia and Thomas - have argued for a very narrow approach to original meaning that is almost willfully indifferent to current societal needs .To understand their approach , let us revisit the four questions raised in the joint statement concerning the settled history and meaning of the Eighth Amendment : ( 1 ) What standard should the Court use in deciding whether a punishment is unconstitutionally cruel ?( 2 ) Does the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause only prohibit barbaric methods of punishment , or does it also prohibit punishments that are disproportionate to the offense ?( 3 ) Does the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause prohibit the death penalty ?( 4 ) Are some modern methods of punishment - such as the extended use of solitary confinement , or the use of a three - drug \" cocktail \" to execute offenders - sufficiently \" barbaric \" to violate the Eighth Amendment ?If a punishment was acceptable in 1791 , it must be acceptable today .( 2 )The Clause prohibits only barbaric methods of punishment , not disproportionate punishments .A life sentence for a parking violation , for example , would not violate the Constitution .( 3 )The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause does not prohibit the death penalty , because capital punishment was permissible in 1791 , and because the text of the Constitution mentions the death penalty .Specifically , the Fifth Amendment commands that \" No person shall be held to answer for a capital . . .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.57218"}

Florida , the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that it is unconstitutional to sentence juveniles to life without the opportunity for parole for a non - homicide crime committed when they were under age 18 .The Court concluded that these offenders should have an opportunity to have their sentences reviewed , and the logic of the Court 's opinion extends to every young person convicted of a serious crime .I was a prosecutor for 12 years .During that time , I prosecuted a wide variety of crimes , ranging from international terrorism to securities fraud , from domestic violence and sexual abuse to homicide .I prosecuted cases in which offenders received very substantial sentences .I am proud of my work as a prosecutor and I have no doubt that criminal punishment is critical to keeping communities safe .... .But ... there are other youthful defendants who have been sentenced to unjust sentences of life without the opportunity for parole .... [And there is a ] critical fact to keep in mind about those seeking to end life without parole for juveniles .No one is arguing that any particular individual should be let out of prison .Ending juvenile life without parole merely leaves open the possibility that a child who commits a crime can petition for release later in life , if he can demonstrate that he is remorseful , has rehabilitated , and will not reoffend .Parole authorities can and should be trusted to make informed , reasoned decisions regarding the release and continued incarceration of inmates petitioning for parole .This approach makes sense as a matter of justice and economics .Juvenile offenders have diminished culpability : a view supported by science -- and common sense , as anyone can attest to who remembers his or her years as a teenager .Juvenile offenders also have increased potential for rehabilitation and , in fact , even without intervention , most offenders age out of crime commission .Thus , in certain instances , spending on extremely lengthy terms of incarceration on juveniles would be wasteful .Extending the reasoning in Graham , so that it applies to every young person , will have no significant adverse impact on public safety and will allow for flexibility in juvenile sentencing .This will reduce incarceration costs and support the possibility for rehabilitation in young offenders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.37619"}

' ' This legislation protects the right of government entities to limit religious actions if there is a compelling interest to do so .Court cases have clearly established , for example , that protecting against race and gender discrimination are compelling State interests , as are safety and health protections in the laws .In the real world I recognize there are sometimes direct conflicts between one citizen 's right and another citizen 's right .That is why we have the judicial system , a system that can look at those issues on a case - by - case basis .I believe the judicial system , rather than the legislative system , is the best way to determine those specific cases .Consequently , personally I believe it would be a mistake for Congress in this bill to try to define who does and who does not have protected religious rights or to exclude certain circumstances from free exercise protections under this bill .To my Democratic colleagues who will vote for the Nadler amendment , I respect your decision .No one in this House has been a stronger defender of religious liberty and civil rights in Congress than the gentleman from New York ( Mr. Nadler ) , and I respect his genuine concerns about possible conflicts between religious rights and other rights .However , if the gentleman 's amendment fails , I would hope that Members who supported his amendment would vote for final passage of this bill .The need to protect religious freedom and to do it today is real .It is important .This bill can still be modified in the Senate , in the conference committee , and Members can make their final decision on passage at that time .But the principle of protecting religious freedom in my opinion is too important to delay .Mr. Speaker , no bill is perfect .I do not suggest this bill meets that impossible standard .But I believe the Religious Liberty Protection Act deserves our support because it protects the fundamental principle that government must have compelling reason to limit the religious rights of individual citizens .I can find few reasons more compelling to support any legislation before this House .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.64991"}

{"text": "The question was asked time and again : Could something like that happen here ?The short answer is , no .The First Amendment does not permit government interference with \" the freedom of the press .\" What that freedom is , is among the great undefined terms in American jurisprudence .But its enduring strength is that few are willing to take the first step down the slippery slope of determining who is a journalist and who is not , and what constitutes good journalism and what does not .It 's all protected , for good or ill .But no scholar on the topic would argue that it 's all for the good .There are plenty of examples of constitutionally protected bad journalism .In the 1991 case Masson v. The New Yorker , the Supreme Court ruled that deliberately , falsely attributing quotes to a speaker does not necessarily give rise to a defamation claim , even when the manufactured quotes cast the \" speaker \" in a negative light .That is , it is not \" actual malice , \" in legal terms , to act with malice .Akre and Wilson said they were ordered by Fox executives to change the story by inserting statements from rBGH manufacturer Monsanto that they knew to be false .They claimed that they were fired after refusing to do so and threatening to report the station to the FCC .They sued for wrongful termination , asserting that their firing violated Florida 's whistleblower protection statute .A jury ruled in Akre 's favor , awarding her $ 425,000 in damages .In short , the court bought Fox 's argument that there is no law to stop them from deliberately falsifying the news .But a state appeals court overturned that decision in 2003 , finding that the FCC 's policy against \" distorting the news \" does not rise to the level of a law or regulation .In short , the court bought Fox 's argument that there is no law to stop them from deliberately falsifying the news .\" False , \" of course , is often conditional and sometimes subjective .It 's a standard that would be hard to enforce , subject to the whims and political ideas of judges and juries .Who determines that something is false ?On what basis ?And what review mechanism could ensure that the decision was reached fairly in most instances , let alone every one ?And that 's before you even get to the question of what news is , and what it means to practice journalism .No , those are questions that ca n't be answered with any reasonable reliability .The best we can hope for is transparency , integrity , and accountability .There is no licensing authority for journalists as there is for lawyers or doctors , but the Society of Professional Journalists puts forth a set of ethical standards , though it has no means to enforce them .First among them is : \" Deliberate distortion is never permissible .\" It should go without saying , but there it is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.163086"}

Button , 371 U.S. 415 ( 1963 ) .With this heightened level of judicial scrutiny in mind , there are two bodies of first amendment case law which are directly implicated by H.B. 593 .Because the bill creates a statutory disparagement action so closely aligned with defamation , the first amendment restrictions imposed by the United States Supreme Court on defamation suits must be examined .Moreover , as product disparagement actions may arise in the commercial setting , the Court 's commercial speech doctrine is also relevant .Each of these bodies of law will be discussed before being applied to H.B. 593 . A. Defamation and the First Amendment .In the last 20 years , the United States Supreme Court has placed significant first amendment restrictions on the law of defamation and has established a complex set of rules governing when defamatory false speech is actionable .In its leading opinion , New York Times Co. v. Sullivan , 376 U.S. 254 ( 1964 ) , the Court determined that public figures can not prevail on a defamation action without proving \" actual malice , \" defined as intentional falsity or reckless disregard for the truth .The Court reasoned that , in open public discussion , false statements about public figures are inevitable and that worthwhile contributions to the flow of information might be deterred without the insulation from liability provided by the actual malice rule .Subsequently , in Gertz v. Robert Welch Inc . , 418 U.S. 323 ( 1974 ) , the Court declined to extend the malice requirement to defamation suits brought by private figures .The Court did , however , require that private figures prove some degree of fault , at least negligence , to recover actual damages .The Court went on to hold that malice would be required for private parties to recover presumed or punitive damages .I d . at 349 - 50 .While the Court has not directly addressed the issue , the prevailing view is that , under the Court 's reasoning , public figures can never recover punitive damages .Moreover , the Court also concluded in Gertz that a private party could , in some instances , become a \" limited purpose \" public figure and subject to the malice standard for any recovery .I d . at 351 .The United States Supreme Court has also provided other first amendment protections in the defamation area .For example , only factual assertions or opinions which \" imply an assertion of objective fact \" are actionable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.27196"}

How did it come to be that an intellectual of the Italian Enlightenment had an impact on American 's Founding Fathers ? A. The trans - Atlantic book trade brought many new ideas to the New World .Beccaria , like Montesquieu , believed that any punishment that goes beyond what is absolutely necessary is \" tyrannical . \"A number of Italians , including a botanist from Milan who was in Beccaria 's social circle , also came to America during the founding era , so ideas were conveyed in that way , too .Beccaria wrote a lot about cruelty , and his ideas shaped the founders as they wrestled with what should be considered to be cruel .The Eighth Amendment was ratified in the decades after Beccaria 's book became so popular .Q. It sounds as though Beccaria 's ideas continue to have currency today .We 're still debating the death penalty ; We 're seeing greater use of restorative justice . A. Criminologists and legal historians still read Beccaria 's book , but most Americans -- indeed , most lawyers -- know little if anything about him and his ideas .My book , a comprehensive look at Beccaria 's influence , attempts to correct that .In the founding era , the death penalty was the mandatory , or usual , punishment for certain crimes .Today , however , the use of life - without - parole sentences far eclipses the use of executions .While convicted murderers are now regularly punished with LWOP sentences , death sentences and executions have become unusual or rare .Indeed , non - lethal corporal punishments have already long been abandoned in the U.S. penal system , though executions continue in a few states , mostly in the South .Q. What else might tempt the reader to pick up The Birth of American Law . A. The book is a fascinating story about how someone who never came to America had a major impact on the development of American law .His ideas led to the abandonment of England 's \" Bloody Code \" and to the creation of the penitentiary system .The fact that the Founding Fathers admired the writings of a death penalty opponent is also quite interesting .In 2014 - yes , the 21st century - state legislators are busy hunting for constitutionally acceptable alternatives to the state 's troubled lethal injection protocol .How about using nitrogen ?Firing up the electric chair ?Redeploying the firing squad ?Can the guillotine be far behind ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.95659"}

Florida , the Supreme Court held that it is unconstitutional to sentence a non - homicide juvenile offender to life in prison without parole .While states need not guarantee release to these juvenile offenders , they can not foreclose such an outcome at the sentencing phase .Scholars have identified several long - term ramifications of Graham , including its likely influence on juvenile sentencing practices and on retributive justice theory .What has yet to be examined are the thorny legal issues raised by Graham that judges and lawmakers need to address in the very short term .To whom does the Graham decision apply ?What is the appropriate remedy for those inmates ?What affirmative obligations does the Graham decision impose upon the states ?These and other pressing questions are before judges and legislators today , and in this Article I endeavor to answer them .In Part I , I briefly describe the Graham opinion and survey what scholars to date have identified as salient aspects of the decision .In Part II , I seek to provide a blueprint for lower courts and legislatures implementing the Graham decision .Finally , in Part III , I situate Graham in the context of our nation 's ongoing criminal justice failings .While the sentence challenged in Graham ought to be viewed as a symptom of such failings , the Graham decision may offer a window of hope for reform on that same front .Here , Mathurin faces a mandatory minimum 307-year sentence .Because Congress hasabolished the federal parole system , this sentence gives Mathurin no possibility of release basedon demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation .A significant portion of this sentence is comprisedof mandatory 25-year consecutive sentences required under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(D)(ii ) , which provides : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.27976"}
{"text": "Only about four outstanding issues remain , he said , predicting the package will be unveiled before August recess .GOP House members request AG Lynch to provide accounting of Prez Obama 's commutations .As reported via this official press release , it would appear that some GOP House members , seemingly concerned with how President Obama is now using his clemency powers , have decided to question Attorney General Loretta Lynch about what her boss is doing .Here is what the press release explains ( along with the full - text of letter , which is also available at this link ): .House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte ( R - Va . ) and 18 Republican Members of the House Judiciary Committee today pressed for answers about the Obama Administration 's unprecedented clemency program for certain federal drug offenders in a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch .Although the Justice Department 's own manual states that commutation of sentence is \" an extraordinary remedy that is rarely granted , \" the Obama Administration last year announced a clemency program for certain federal drug offenders and asked the defense bar to recruit candidates for executive clemency .To date , 89 federal offenders have received sentence commutations , with the vast majority of those commutations going to federal drug offenders .Here some key language from the letter , which I find curious and questionable in a variety of respects ( especially the language I have emphasized below ) : .No one disputes that the President possesses the constitutional authority to grant pardons and commutations .However , as the Department 's own U.S. Attorney 's Manual states , commutation of sentence is \" an extraordinary remedy that is rarely granted . \"Additionally , the fact that the Department 's clemency initiative is focused solely on federal drug offenders continues this Administration 's plainly unconstitutional practice of picking and choosing which laws to enforce and which to change .Legally , there is no clear constitutional or other legal restriction on the President deciding , if he so chooses , to use his \" pardon power to benefit specific classes of offenders , or for political purposes . \"To this end , Pardon historian P.S. Ruckman rightly calls out this portion of the letter for \" a very special kind of stupidity and ignorance .\" But , so far , President Obama has merely shortened the extreme prison sentences of significantly less than .1 % of current federal drug prisoners .Signing this suspect letter are a number of House GOP members who have recently spoken in favor of significant federal sentencing reform to reduce undue reliance on excessive terms of incarceration for federal drug offenders .But when Prez Obama actually does something in service to all the reform talk in Washington , his political opponents ( perhaps spurred on by Bill Otis and others who oppose any and all criminal justice reforms ) can not resist the political instinct to complain . \"Fatal Re - Entry : Legal and Programmatic Opportunities to Curb Opioid Overdose Among Individuals Newly Released from Incarceration \" .The title of this post is the title of this notable new article by multiple authored recently posted on SSRN .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.28399"}

H.B. 593 AND PRODUCT DISPARAGEMENT LAW .H.B. 593 creates a statutory action for agricultural food product disparagement .Such an action already exists at common law .H.B. 593 codifies this action , but significantly alters certain elements of the common law tort .Traditional product disparagement is a tort in which the plaintiff must prove that a false statement concerning the nature or quality of plaintiff 's product was made by the defendant .The tort of product disparagement is closely associated with the more familiar tort of defamation .See Zerpol Corp.v. DMP Corp. , 561 F. Supp . 404 ( E.D. Penn .1983 ) .However , the two torts protect different interests .An action for defamation protects reputation or character from false statements directed at the moral character of an individual .Zerpol at 408 .The cause of action for product disparagement , on the other hand , \" protects economic interests by providing a remedy to one who suffers pecuniary loss from slurs affecting the marketability of his goods .\" Id. The two torts , while closely aligned , contain different elements .RESTATEMENT ( SECOND ) OF TORTS \u00a7 588 .In contrast , the elements for common law product disparagement are stricter .Zerpol at 409 .H.B. 593 modifies the common law tort of product disparagement .The most obvious modification is that the traditional malice standard has been replaced with the lower standard of negligence .As noted , at common law , the plaintiff has to show the defendant knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard of its falsity - a malice requirement .Under H.B. 593 , the plaintiff now need only demonstrate negligence ; that is , the defendant \" should have known \" the statement was false .Additionally , the statute contains no express provision that the false statement be \" of and concerning \" the particular plaintiff 's product .Finally , the statute includes a treble damage scheme not found in common law disparagement suits .Thus , while H.B. 593 is , in essence , a codification of the common law disparagement action , a number of the stringent common law requirements have either been relaxed or omitted altogether .II .RELEVANT CONSTITUTIONAL BACKGROUND .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.73929"}

Jan Brewer and to Arizona Department of Corrections director Charles Ryan , who may change the drug protocol for executions based on the report 's recommendations .Attorneys representing several prisoners and the First Amendment Coalition of Arizona are seeking information about lethal injection methods used by the state .U.S. District Court Judge Neil Wake asked both sides for input about the need for litigation before the report comes out .The public defender 's office is suing the Arizona Department of Corrections over what many are calling a botched execution .There are too many factors up in the air to start litigation .The question of this case is about the two drugs used in Joseph Wood 's execution last July .But the state is in the process of reviewing the execution .And it is n't clear whether the drug procedure will change based on the review .Federal Judge Neil Wake said it 's premature to litigate before the review is done .One of the Attorney 's suing the state is Mark Haddad .\" The judge wants to avoid in the future litigation by crisis .So one of the steps he 's asked the parties to take at a preliminary stage , \" Haddad said .\" One of the steps he 's asked the parties to take at a preliminary stage to discuss whether we can agree on a schedule for challenges in the future . \"After it took two hours and 15 doses of lethal - injection drugs for the state to execute convicted murderer Joseph Wood in July , the state 's death penalty procedure is still in limbo .A lawsuit in federal court , filed by both current death - row prisoners and a legal group representing media organizations , challenges various aspects of the state 's lethal - injection protocol .At a status conference today , Judge Neil Wake suggested there may be no way right now for the state to execute anyone .As Wake put it , \" There seems to be a great deal of uncertainty , to put it in a great understatement .\" Skyrocketing spending on television advertising in state supreme court elections has rendered justices less likely to vote in favor of criminal defendants , a new study found .And in the 23 states whose election bans on corporate and union independent spending fell because of the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision in Citizens United v.

Gladden ( 1966 ) ) .While jury trials are guaranteed by the Constitution , there are several instances in which a trial is conducted without a jury .First , persons accused of crimes can waive their right to a jury trial , perhaps believing that a judge will be more understanding of the situation .Additionally , the Court has ruled that \" serious crimes \" are only those that carry a possible penalty of at least a $ 500 fine or six months in jail ( see Blanton v.

{"text": "Hence even the best of the drafts would still ratify some aspect of the Court 's illegitimate power grab which the current Constitution does not support .In addition to these three options for congressional oversight , the Court 's self - imposed political question doctrine for many years protected the Court from overstepping its bounds and encroaching on the powers of the elected branches of the federal government or of the States .From the very outset of the exercise of judicial review in the 1803 Marbury v. Madison case , the Supreme Court itself eschewed any authority to exercise powers of constitutional review over political questions .The Court defined a political question as involving 1 ) matters \" which are , by the constitution and laws submitted to \" another branch or 2 ) matters \" whose subjects are political .They respect the nation , not individual rights .Elections fit both tests .First , Article I , Sections 4 and 5 of the Constitution assigns the whole subject of elections to state legislatures and to Congress .Second , election financing and election integrity respects the nation as a whole , not any particular individual 's or group 's rights .Elections are the quintessential political subject .Moreover , the Court 's excuse for encroaching on the political subject of election financing , by purporting to protect the \" right \" of all the nation 's voters to receive all electioneering messages , is also political .\" The court 's novel interpretation of the 1 st Amendment places the subject matter outside Court jurisdiction as it fits the very definition of a political question of the second type , a national issue not an individual rights issue .The Court 's consideration and decision of such a case is equally objectionable under \" standing \" doctrine .For example , in United States v. Richardson , 418 U.S. 166 ( 1974 ) , the Supreme Court properly declined jurisdiction to hear \" generalized grievances \" concerning a right shared by all citizens to access information , even information that the government was constitutionally required to provide .With the sole exception of properly enforcing the one person , one vote principle to overturn anti - democratic legislative minorities entrenched in power by the mal - apportionment of voting districts , the political question doctrine foreclosed the federal judiciary from hearing cases about elections down to 1976 .The political question doctrine was considered an essential bulwark defining the boundary between the separate judicial and legislative powers for nearly 200 years .In the Madisonian model , each branch of government has the obligation to maintain this bulwark .Madison explained in Federalist 47 : .The accumulation of all powers legislative , executive and judiciary , in the same hands , whether of one , a few or many , and whether hereditary , self - appointed , or elective , may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny .Congress neglected to protect its own powers over election integrity after the Court first encroached on them in the 1976 case Buckley v.

Tribe , American Constitutional Law Sec .16 - 20 at 1515 ( 2d ed .1988 ) ( urging that anti - subjugation should be test rather than purpose ) with Patrick E. Higginbotham , Laurence Tribe 's Visionary Theories of the Equal Protection Clause , 4 Benchmark 125 , 131 - 34 ( 1990 ) ( rejecting Tribe 's view ) .The merits of that debate aside , it was common ground that dispensing with the requirement of Washington v. Davis that violations of the Equal Protection Clause must be purposeful works a large relocation of power .This is not to suggest that RFRA 's dispensing with purpose is of a lesser magnitude .We doubt that it is .Rather , the point is that despite its large role , dispensing with purpose remains nonetheless an exercise of Congress ' remedial power , the power to reach conduct that only threatens the free exercise of religion .Undeniably , RFRA 's origins and codification of terms drawn directly from constitutional decisions make it unusual and are characteristic of what is termed a \" foundational statute .\" The critical question is whether they make RFRA unconstitutional .We think not .The City 's argument rests on the mistaken assumption that Smith describes not only how little the Government must accommodate religion but also how much it may accommodate it .Stated another way , the City must contend that Smith held not only that facially neutral laws having the incidental effect of burdening religion do not violate the Free Exercise Clause but also that exemptions to such laws do violate either that clause or the Establishment Clause .Only if the latter proposition is true does RFRA usurp the judiciary 's duty to interpret the Constitution .This view of Smith has its supporters , see Christopher L. Eisgruber & Lawrence G. Sager , Why the Religious Freedom Restoration Act is Unconstitutional , 69 N.Y.U.L.Rev .Prior to Smith , the Court recognized that legislatures were free to enact religious exemptions more expansive and accommodating than that required by the Free Exercise Clause .See Zorach v.

Smith , 972 F.2d 960 ( 8th Cir .1992 ) , where this court set aside a special condition attempting to regulate a defendant 's fathering of children while on supervised release , the condition here is not related to the nature and circumstances of Harris 's offense .The court did not find that Harris 's sexual activity was related to his unlawful possession of a firearm .Nor did the district court explain how restrictions on Harris 's sexual activity would deter Harris from future criminal conduct , protect the public from future crimes by Harris , or assist in Harris 's training , medical care , or correctional treatment .For similar reasons , the condition impermissibly involves a greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary to afford adequate deterrence , protect the public from future crimes , and provide the defendant with needed training , care , or treatment .As in Smith , the district court sought to address a perceived social problem that does not have the required nexus to factors that guide sentencing in a federal criminal case .We conclude that the district court exceeded its authority under \u00a7 3583(d ) when it imposed the special condition of supervised release at sentencing . \"Sentencing the Wolf of Wall Street : From Leniency to Uncertainty \" .The title of this post is the title of this notable new paper now available via SSRN authored by Lucian Dervan .Here is the abstract : .In Part II , the Article examines the Belfort case and his relatively lenient prison sentence for engaging in a major fraud .This section goes on to examine additional cases from the 1980s , 1990s , and 2000s to consider the results of reforms aimed at \" getting tough \" on white - collar offenders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.307526"}

' 'The best known example of accommodation from that period is the exemption from military conscription granted by the Continental Congress to members of the peace churches .The purpose of avoiding governmental action that does violence to the consciences of individuals is based on the understanding that there are claims on the individual which are prior to the claims of government .This understanding finds expression in Madison 's Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments .Madison there wrote : ' 'It is the duty of every man to render to the Creator such homage , and such only , as he believes to be acceptable to him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.04951"}

Sensenbrenner was defending federal mandatory minimum statutes on very dubious grounds .Here is an excerpt from the testimonty I found especially notable and important ( with my emphasis added ) : .Over the past three decades , America 's federal prison population has more than quadrupled - from 500,000 in 1980 to more than 2.3 million today .Prison spending has increased by 595 percent , a staggering figure that is both irresponsible and unsustainable .And yet , this increased spending has not yielded results .More than 40 percent of released offenders return to prison within three years of release , and in some states , recidivism rates are closer to 60 percent .Several studies have found that , past a certain point , high incarceration rates are counterproductive and actually cause the crime rate to go up .Especially among low risk offenders , long prison sentences increase the risk of recidivism because they sever the ties between the inmate and his family and community .These are the ties we need to help reintegrate offenders as productive members of society .These severed ties are also at the heart of the moral case for reform .It 's not just the people in prison who are paying the punishment for their crimes .Mass incarceration tears families apart and deprives children of their fathers and mothers .It likely means a loss of job , possibly home , and any support he or she had within the community .And that 's where we are with our sentencing policy - we 're spending more , getting less , and destroying communities in the process .The system is broke , and it 's our job to fix it .It is remarkable and a true sign of the modern sentencing times that this reform rhetoric , which sounds more like a passage from an opinion or article by Wisconsin District Judge Lynn Adelman , is coming from GOP Rep. Sensenbrenner .Highlighting why dozens of commutations barely move the mass incarceration needle .President Obama 's action to commute the sentences of 46 drug offenders yesterday ( basics here ) merits the label historic .But , as two recent commentaries highlight , the decision seems more compelling than it is truly consequential given the massive size of the federal criminal justice population .Here are links to and snippets from the pieces that provide important ( and somewhat depressing ) context for what the Prez did yesterday : .[ T]he problem of unjust sentences is simply too large to deal with through the clemency mechanism .When Lyndon Johnson commuted 200 drug sentences in the 1960s , almost everyone then in prison who deserved relief got it , thanks to the staffing efforts of the Bureau of Prisons .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.1138"}

Tornillo , 418 U.S. 241 , 94 S.Ct .2831 , 41 L.Ed.2d 730 ( 1974 ) , and Columbia Broadcasting System , Inc. v. Democratic National Committee , 412 U.S. 94 , 93 S.Ct .2080 , 36 L.Ed.2d 772 ( 1973 ) , we invalidated governmental efforts to pre - empt editorial decision by requiring the publication of specified material .In Columbia Broadcasting System , it was the requirement that a television network air paid political advertisements and in Tornillo , a newspaper 's obligation to print a political candidate 's reply to press criticism .Insofar as the laws at issue in Tornillo and Columbia Broadcasting System sought to control in advance the content of the publication , they were deemed as invalid as were prior efforts to enjoin publication of specified materials .16 But holdings that neither a State nor the Federal Government may dictate what must or must not be printed neither expressly nor impliedly suggest that the editorial process is immune from any inquiry whatsoever .It is incredible to believe that the Court in Columbia Broadcasting System or in Tornillo silently effected a substantial contraction of the rights preserved to defamation plaintiffs in Sullivan , Butts , and like cases .Quite the opposite inference is to be drawn from the Gertz opinion , since it , like prior First Amendment libel cases , recited without criticism the facts of record indicating that the state of mind of the editor had been placed at issue .Nor did the Gertz opinion , in requiring proof of some degree of fault on the part of the defendant editor and in forbidding punitive damages absent at least reckless disregard of truth or falsity , suggest that the First Amendment also foreclosed direct inquiry into these critical elements .III .It is nevertheless urged by respondents that the balance struck in New York Times should now be modified to provide further protections for the press when sued for circulating erroneous information damaging to individual reputation .It is not uncommon or improper , of course , to suggest the abandonment , modification , or refinement of existing constitutional interpretation , and notable developments in First Amendment jurisprudence have evolved from just such submissions .Curtis Publishing Co.v.

Florida that it was unconstitutional to give life sentences to juveniles who have n't killed .The justices ruled juvenile offenders must be given \" some meaningful opportunity \" for release .Senior Circuit Court Judge Maurice Giunta decided Tuesday that the proceedings should be pushed back six months , giving prosecutors and Kalapp 's public defender , Norma Wendt , time to prepare for a case that State Attorney R.J.

Grendels Den , Inc. ( 1982 ) .According to the Court : The law substitutes the unilateral and absolute power of a church for the reasoned decision making of a public legislative body . . .on issues with significant economic and political implications .The challenged statute thus enmeshes churches in the processes of government and creates the danger of [ p]olitical fragmentation and divisiveness along religious lines .In another scenario , the Supreme Court rejected an attempt to define political boundaries solely according to religion .In Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet ( 1994 ) , the state of New York designated the neighborhood boundaries of Satmar Hasidim Orthodox Jews in Kiryas Joel Village as a public school district to itself .Thus , the boundary was determined solely by religious identity , in part because the community did not want their children to be exposed to children outside the faith .The Court invalidated the school district because political boundaries identified solely by reference to religion violate the Establishment Clause .There Is No Such Thing as Church Autonomy Although There Is a Doctrine that Forbids the Courts from Determining What Religious Organizations Believe .In recent years , religious litigants have asserted a right to church autonomythat churches should not be subject to governmental regulationin a wide variety of cases , and in particular in cases involving the sexual abuse of children by clergy .The phrase , however , is misleading .The Supreme Court has never interpreted the First Amendment to confer on religious organizations a right to autonomy from the law .In fact , in the case in which they have most recently demanded such a right , arguing religious ministers should be exempt from laws prohibiting employment discrimination , the Court majority did not embrace the theory , not even using the term once .Hosanna - Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. E.E.O.C. ( 2012 ) .The courts are forbidden , however , from getting involved in determining what a religious organization believes , how it organizes itself internally , or who it chooses to be ministers of the faith .Therefore , if the dispute brought to a court can only be resolved by a judge or jury settling an intra - church , ecclesiastical dispute , the dispute is beyond judicial consideration .This is a corollary to the absolute right to believe what one chooses ; it is not a right to be above the laws that apply to everyone else .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.3472"}

White Jr. , a governor of Texas in the 1980s .In addition to their claims of racial bias , they said Texas was failing to follow through on a promise it had made to Mr. Buck .In 2000 , the attorney general at the time , John Cornyn , identified six capital cases in which Dr. Quijano had presented race - based testimony .Mr. Cornyn , now a United States senator from Texas , admitted that the state had erred in relying on such testimony in those and other cases , and that it was \" inappropriate to allow race to be considered as a factor in our criminal justice system .Mr. Buck 's case was among the six .But he is the only defendant who has not been granted a new sentencing hearing .The others had all been on death row , and were ultimately resentenced to death after their new hearings .The state has opposed Mr. Buck 's attempts to receive a new hearing , but did not oppose the requests for new hearings made by the five other defendants .Whenever Texas juries sentence a criminal to death , they have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the convicted is a continuing threat to society .When Duane Buck was sentenced to death , prosecutors relied on his race to help prove this point .As a black man , the jury heard , Buck was more likely to pose a future criminal threat .There is no doubt that Buck is guilty of murder .There is also no doubt that his death sentence is tarnished by racial considerations .The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is currently considering an appeal arguing that Buck deserves a new sentencing hearing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.028915"}

{"text": "When U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas announced he had hired lawyers to denounce and get rid of his Canadian citizenship , it makes one wonder if the Republican Party is not only the party of death but an extremely exclusionary , reactionary sect within a state .The very first societies were actually families , then the tribe , then the village , and then the state .The concept of citizenship , or belonging to a state , did not exist and evolved only in relation to draconian leaders and oppressive institutions that seized \" natural \" liberties .Authoritarian leaders demanded obedience , usurping even the sacred bonds of the family .They also imposed harsh institutions , organizing collective efforts of farming , irrigation , taxation , and the warehousing of food and redistribution for the \" common good . \" Citizenship soon evolved into absolute obedience to a ruler 's ambitions , propagated through the state and enforced by an army .Seldom were they accepted by the people .As elite rulers and states multiplied , so did disputes and wars over land , wealth , and tribute .Since the essence of good citizenship was to renounce one 's rights for the greater good , which is the state and its rulers , the individual looses many natural rights and liberties , including conscience .History has shown that even the most benign state tyrannized some .Citizenship usually clothed itself with the same garments of the emperor .Individuals internalized aggression while also perceiving of imaginary borders .Allowing themselves to be subjected to arbitrary laws , they mobilized their personhood and resources for war .Even democracy , in which citizens share political , economic , and social power , can unknowingly and unconsciously become totalitarian .This occurs when elite rulers manipulate the minds and behaviors of citizens to legitimize unfavorable , injurious laws .States and political parties , which Jean - Jacque Rousseau believed should be outlawed , are naturally exclusionary .They absorb and incorporate the individual , including the exercise of their will and reason .The rest of humanity is subhuman , a second - class citizen at best .By denouncing his Canadian citizenship , Senator Ted Cruz , who will be a 2016 presidential candidate , has missed a golden opportunity to broaden the Republican Party 's appeal .He could have encouraged U.S. citizens to practice positive , inclusive citizenship .It is also an ironic tactic , since he is multiethnic and multi - cultural , a favorite son of the Tea Party and Christian Right .The former consisted of newly arrived immigrants .The latter should live their global , heavenly citizenship that erases \" all \" kinds of boundaries .Still , Senator Ted Cruz is from a state that was once home to many indigenous tribes .Later , it came under Spanish control , only to become a part of Mexico and then annexed by the U.S. Borders and states are always changing , citizenship forever in a state of flux .While citizenship varies from state to state , in the United States it is synonymous with nationality , of one 's place of birth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.03718"}

Van Hollen , who has assigned an attorney from his department to argue against giving Ninham a chance at parole , would not comment on the Supreme Court 's acceptance of the case .But after the appeals court decision last year he issued a statement saying , \" For some juvenile offenders , a life sentence without parole is fair and just punishment .Ninham was properly punished for a horrible crime . \" But Stevenson argues that like all adolescents , Ninham has changed as he has matured .Before the murder , he was abused and neglected .He had never owned a toothbrush until he was sent to a group home at age 14 .His alcoholic parents allowed him to imbibe alcohol daily , and his father and brothers beat him .Soon after he committed the murder , Ninham was placed in a center for at - risk Native American kids and started to make \" extraordinary progress , \" says Stevenson , adding , \" We think he 's continued to make good progress . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.46217"}

Florida and the Future of Eighth Amendment Challenges to Noncapital Sentences \" .The title of this post is the title of this new paper now available via SSRN authored by Alison Siegler and Barry Sullivan .Here is the abstract : .In Graham v Florida , a Florida state prisoner asked the Supreme Court to hold that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment categorically precludes the imposition of life - without - parole sentences for any juvenile offender who has committed a nonhomicide offense .There was no Supreme Court precedent to support such a holding .Indeed , the relevant Supreme Court jurisprudence seemed clearly to preclude Graham 's argument .Remarkably , however , the Court accepted Graham 's invitation and left behind more than thirty years of consistent Supreme Court jurisprudence , seemingly without a second thought or backward glance .Indeed , the Court did not even acknowledge that the law had changed , still less that it had changed substantially and dramatically .The result reached in Graham was consistent with sound constitutional policy and could have been supported with many good reasons , but the Court failed to provide a candid explanation for its decision .Death was different no longer , but the Court did nothing to explain why that was the case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.91042"}

Salerno ( 1987 ) , to refuse a criminal defendant bail as a \" preventative measure .\" Together a judge 's decision should be considered proportionate to the nature of the criminal offense for which a defendant is charged .That 's why the framers wrote the Bill of Rights - to prohibit the British Bill of Wrongs done against their natural rights which under Natural Law are guaranteed by God .The Eighth Amendment 's prohibition against \" cruel and unusual \" punishments was unique in the 18th century because the Bill of Rights as a Natural Law document is entirely expressed in moral terms .Therefore , to be functional and relevant , \" it must be interpreted in moral language and through moral argument , \" Held wrote .Yet , since the 1900s , progressives , atheists , humanists and Positive Law scholars contend that employing moral language to judge cases regarding fundamental liberties or limits on state and federal power is virtually impossible .Progressives prefer an amoral approach to constitutional interpretation and scrupulously avoid at all costs the specter of Natural Law , while mandating the use of vague , moral - sounding language and moral argumentation to set down a field of protected liberty .Despite the fact that most historians agree that the Framers wanted to prohibit barbaric forms of punishment , including torture , as well as arbitrary and disproportionate penalties , there is little consensus on what specific punishments met this definition .The historical record shows that by the late 1800s , the Supreme Court had held that punishments like burning at the stake , disembowelment , and drawing and quartering violated the Eighth Amendment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.5157"}

{"text": "A common religious claim is that ' life ' begins at conception , based on ensoulment .More properly stated , this contention is that at the moment of conception the fetus becomes a person whose interests must be considered by public policy .This is a religious value rejected by most Americans , who understand the fetus to be only a potential person .While Roe v. Wade is a landmark Supreme Court decision for establishing the right to choose abortion based upon an implied constitutional right to privacy , its contention that the state 's interest increases with fetal development is logically untenable .Evaluating public interest requires deciding whose interests are included in the policy decision .If the conceptus were recognized as a person whose interests are included in the decision , abortion would be properly described as murder , and would therefore be unthinkable .But basing personhood upon any innate attribute of the fetus introduces a subjective value , whereas law should only be based on consequences to people .It is a common mistake to base upon medical attributes a determination that the fetus becomes a person at any particular stage of its development , such as heartbeat , brainwaves or viability .This misconstrues as biology a decision that is an act of social valuation .Personhood begins when society invests the individual with the rights that it recognizes as universal and protected by law .It is a basic tenet of ethics that obligation can not be derived from statements of fact , i.e. , you can not conclude an ' ought ' statement from ' is ' statements .There is , therefore , no moment at which a fetus a priori must be designated as a person .Social responsibility requires the availability of contraceptives and medically correct information about their use .Minnesota Atheists opposes so - called \" abstinence only \" sex education because it keeps from the sexually active students the information they need for responsible decisions .There is a political strategy to undermine women 's reproductive rights with so - called \" conscience clauses , \" which permit health care providers to refuse medical treatments on the grounds that they conflict with the provider 's religious belief .Conscience clauses in some states address fetal research , such as on stem cells , and reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization .The most common type of conscience clause permits pharmacists and emergency room staff to refuse to provide contraception , including emergency contraception to rape victims .While proponents try to justify conscience clauses as necessary to protect religious liberty , their actual and intended effect is to authorize a religious privilege to permit health care providers to impose their religious beliefs on others .It is unethical for health care providers to create obstacles to a woman 's access to safe , effective and legal health care .Public policy should ensure that medical care will be based upon the needs of the patient , and not be dictated by the religious beliefs and moral prejudices of caregivers .It should only be permissible to assert a right to refuse to fill a prescription when the patient is referred to a local pharmacy within a reasonable distance where the prescription will be filled without delay .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.482925"}

{"text": "At the time the United States adopted the First Amendment to the Constitution , other nations routinely imposed disabilities on religious minorities within their borders , depriving them of legal rights , making it difficult or impossible to practice their faith , and often enabling violent persecution .The Free Exercise Clause was thus an exceptional political achievement , imposing a constitutional norm of civic equality by prohibiting the federal government from interfering with all religious exerciseregardless of affiliation .Only a few years before the First Amendment was ratified , James Madison wrote that all people naturally retain equal title to the free exercise of Religion according to the dictates of conscience without the governments subjecting some to peculiar burdens or granting to others peculiar exemptions .A Memorial and Remonstrance against Religious Assessments ( 1785 ) .As Madison suggested , at the time the Constitution and Bill of Rights were ratified , the guarantee of religious free exercise was understood to protect against government discrimination or abuse on the basis of religion , but not to require favorable government treatment of believers .In particular , there is little evidence that the Founders understood the Free Exercise Clause to mandate religious exemptions that would excuse believers from complying with neutral and general laws that constrain the rest of society .The Supreme Court has historically left the question of religious exemptions to Congress and the state legislatures .This doctrine of judicially - ordered exemptions , however , was an historical aberration .In Employment Division v. Smith ( 1990 ) , the Court considered a claim by members of a Native American religion who lost their jobs as drug counselors for using an illegal drug in a religious ritual .The Court abandoned its new doctrine of religious exemptions , ruling that the Free Exercise Clause did not grant believers a right to exemptions from religiously neutral , generally applicable laws , though legislatures were free to grant such exemptions if they wished .This relegation of exemptions to the political process in most circumstances returned the Free Exercise Clause to its historical baseline .The growth of social welfare entitlements and religious diversity in the United States has underscored the wisdom of the Smith rule .Exempting believers from social welfare laws may give them a competitive advantage , and also may harm those whom the law was designed to protect or benefit .United States v. Lee ( 1982 ) .Similarly , the Court refused to exempt a religious employer from federal minimum wage laws , because doing so would give the employer an advantage over competitors and depress the wages of all employees in local labor markets .Tony & Susan Alamo Foundation v.

Andrews , No .SC91006 ( Mo. Dec. 21 , 2010 ) ( available here ) .Here is how the majority opinion gets started : .Antonio Andrews appeals the jury 's verdict finding him guilty of first degree murder for shooting and killing a police officer and the sentence imposed on him for that crime of life without parole .This case came directly to this Court because Andrews challenges the constitutional validity of two Missouri statutes .He challenges Missouri 's juvenile - certification statute , \u00a7 211.071 , RSMo 2000 , as violating his right to a jury trial in a criminal prosecution under the Sixth Amendment as applied in Apprendi v. New Jersey , 530 U.S. 466 ( 2000 ) .He also challenges the validity of the mandatory sentencing of a minor to life without parole for committing first degree murder as prescribed by \u00a7 565.020 , RSMo 2000 , as violating the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment .In addition , Andrews appeals the jury 's verdict claiming that there was insufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude Andrews committed first degree murder .Finally , Andrews claims the trial court erred by overruling his motion in limine , which sought to prevent uniformed police officers from being present during the jury trial .Affirmed .A lengthy dissenting opinion by Justice Wolff asserts that the defendant in this case had his Eighth Amendment rights violated .He states that \" [ s]entencing juvenile offenders to life without the possibility of parole is cruel and unusual punishment because society 's standards have evolved to prohibit it . \"Another lengthy dissenting opinion by Justice Stith finds asserts that the defendant in this case had his Sixth Amendment rights violated .She states : .When a court decides that a juvenile is to be tried as an adult , Apprendi requires that the Sixth Amendment command of a jury trial be obeyed .The jury 's verdict alone in this prosecution is insufficient to punish a 15-year - old defendant such as Antonio with a lifetime in prison .To prosecute Antonio as an adult , and to impose a sentence of life without parole , the additional fact - finding mandated by Missouri 's juvenile certification process also is necessary .To allow this additional fact - finding to be made by a judge and not by a jury violates the defendant 's fundamental right to a jury under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution .It will be very interesting to see if four Justices of the US Supreme Court might have an interest in taking up either of the ( crisp ? ) constitutional issues presented by this case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.535385"}

JP Morrell , D - New Orleans , is heading up a new Capital Punishment Fiscal Impact Commission .The group 's first meeting was Wednesday morning .Louisiana does n't have a well - researched estimate of how much it is spending on capital punishment trials and execution , according to Morrell .The commission 's goal is to get an idea of what the overall price tag is for executions in the state .The death penalty might be more expensive than the general public realizes .Inmates on death row are segregated from the main prison population and receive specialized care .Capital murder trials can also be much more expensive than regular murder cases .Members of the commission include lawmakers , prosecutors , public defenders , law enforcement , an auditor and staff members from nonprofit organizations .The group has been broken down into three subcommittees -- prosecution expenses , defense expenses and general Department of Corrections expenses .The subcommittees will meet approximately once per month .The overall commission will meet once per quarter , according to Morrell .The group has to conclude its work by the end of 2015 .Morrell says he 's looking for ways to streamline the process for dealing with capital cases and litigation that can stretch over decades .He says the data is critical to decision - making process .But tensions were obvious at the opening meeting of the commission , which included people who support and oppose the death penalty , along with officials from the legislative auditor 's office and the corrections department .Louisiana 's last execution was in 2010 , and plans for the next lethal injection have been put on hold , amid an ongoing legal dispute about the drugs that will be used .Throughout our lives together , we have held differing views on the death penalty .Nancy has always opposed it ; I have generally supported the right of the citizens of a state to establish the death penalty as a consequence for the most heinous crimes .Despite this difference , our views of the justice system have always shared a commitment to fairness , accuracy and public safety .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.99501"}

Simmons ( 2005 ) the Court barred imposition of the death penalty for crimes committed by juveniles , and in Graham v. Florida ( 2010 ) it forbade life imprisonment without possibility of parole ( LWOP ) for juveniles who commit non - homicide offenses .Both decisions held these penalties violated the Eight Amendment 's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment because they were disproportionate given juveniles ' distinctive cognitive , psychosocial and neuroanatomical characteristics .Roper and Graham reflect two decades ' long trends , one legal and one clinical , whose interaction will control the legal system 's approach to juvenile justice for some time .In Roper and Graham the Court resolved this paradox by siding clearly with clinicians .Monday , June 06 , 2011 .Possible Graham sequel from Jacksonville based on 1st - degree murder charge for 12-year - old .There must be something in the water in Jacksonville , Florida that makes it a special place for the development of cutting - edge juvenile crime and punishment issues .Astute readers know that Terrance Graham , whose case led the Supreme Court last year to declare that LWOP sentence for juveniles for nonhomicide crimes violate the Eighth Amendment , hailed from Jacksonville .Now a possible Graham sequel is in the works from the same locale based on this local story headlined \" Jacksonville 12-year - old charged with first - degree murder of brother . \" Here are some of the disturbing specifics : .Months before Jacksonville police say 12-year - old Cristian Fernandez beat his 2-year - old half brother to death , investigators started asking why the toddler 's leg was broken .The family said David Galarriago had an accident while playing on a jungle gym , according to court papers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.86784"}
{"text": "There are good arguments ' on both sides of the issue , which has been debated ad nauseam for at least the past 40 years .Many arguments against capital punishment use the dictum of \" cruel and unusual . \"States in the past have used hanging , firing squads and gas chambers .Currently , lethal injection is the most widely used method in the U.S. Idaho still has the firing squad as an option .Over centuries , U.S. law has mainly reflected British law in regard to the death penalty .The 18th century period of Enlightenment brought about the idea that the punishment should fit the crime .Now , most death penalty verdicts are based on convictions for murder and rarely for treason - federal jurisdiction .It is generally believed by adherents to the death penalty that it is indeed a deterrent to murder .However , conflicting statistics arise as to the accuracy of that idea .One thing is certain : opponents of capital punishment will say most every method of execution is both cruel and unusual .The gas chamber - first utilized in 1921 in Utah as an alternative to the electric chair - utilized cyanide gas .It was used extensively in California but outlawed by the 9th United States Court of Appeals in 1999 when a criminal was seen to experience a long and agonizing death during execution .Curiously , Oklahoma law provides for electrocution if lethal injection is ever outlawed and firing squad if both are found illegal .Nevertheless , lethal injection has been the preferred method of execution in 35 states plus the federal government and the U.S. military .Pentobarbital is a rapidly acting barbiturate with highly sedating properties , which at any dose does not produce rapidly falling brain levels as does the short - acting drug , thiopental .Death by sedation is literally that .Sedation for anesthesia has been used since William Morton first demonstrated it at the Massachusetts General Hospital in 1846 .Anyone undergoing anesthesia by ether found it somewhat discomfiting , having a mask placed over the nose and mouth , using the drop method to administer the drug .Modern science and the use of pharmaceuticals have attained a high degree of reliability , whether delivered by a regulated FDA - recognized pharmacy or a compounding pharmacy .Measurements of the amount of drug in a particular formulation may vary to some extent , and a state may make a provision that lots may be tested for the concentration of a drug that does not require the FDA 's stamp of approval .Given the nature of pentobarbital , sedation at various concentrations may be both sedating and lethal .Since anesthesia is necessary to relax muscle contraction , a tube is most often inserted in the trachea and the patient is assisted in breathing artificially .Most major surgeries utilize so - called general anesthesia for this purpose .Since the object of surgical anesthesia is to solve the problem without killing the patient , such avoidance does not apply to legal lethal injection .The addition of midazolam , also known as Versed , is used to allow sedation in a matter of seconds , the combination utilized to cause a rapid sedation and death when used for execution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.93554"}

Connecticut ( 1940 ) .Though it recognized that governments may not unduly infringe religious exercise , the Court reiterated that [ c]onduct remains subject to regulation for the protection of society , citing Reynolds as authority .Similarly , the Court held in 1961 that the Free Exercise Clause did not exempt an orthodox Jewish merchant from Sunday closing laws , again citing Reynolds .In the 1960s and early 1970s , the Court shifted , strengthening protection for religious conduct by construing the Free Exercise Clause to protect a right of religious believers to exemption from generally applicable laws which burden religious exercise .The Court held that the government may not enforce even a religiously - neutral law that applies generally to all or most of society unless the public interest in enforcement is compelling .Wisconsin v.

Dover case clearly established that Intelligent Design is not science and should not be taught in science class .In the non - science curriculum , public education should not display any bias toward religion .Schools should teach about the influence of religion on culture and society , but without endorsing religion or religious ideology .In literature and history classes it is permissible to use religious texts as long as there is no promotion of religion over non - religion .In social studies classes the Declaration of Independence reference to \" Creator - endowed rights \" should be taught in the context of enlightenment ideas , including deism ; and discussion should be encouraged on the source of human rights .2 ) Prayer .Prayer should follow established Federal guidelines for public schools ( K - university ) .No public employee should lead or endorse prayer in the public schools .Prayer should be a private matter and not involved in any ceremony or activity promoted by a public school .Collective prayer is always coercive for elementary and high school students .A mandated moment of silence is only a thinly veiled collective prayer .In the event that a public school should designate a room for prayer , meditation , or silence , the room should not be used for proselytizing .Anyone using the room should do so in silence when others of a different belief system are present .No symbols , books , or literature should be permanently displayed in the room .The room should not promote any religion over any other , nor religion over non - religion .3 ) Sex education in public school .Public schools should provide a sex education curriculum that is consistent with the research on what is effective and helpful to the health of students .An abstinence - only program that is taught with a religious motivation violates separation .Abstinence may be advocated only in conjunction with instruction in safe prophylactic practices .4 ) Religious activities in public schools .In 1990 , in the case Westside Community Schools v.
