Nelson A.

{"text": "To answer the first question , it 's because Obama told us so .Asked on the Daily Show last week whether his White House experience has changed what he said he believed about foreign policy four years ago , Obama said no -- and then went on to admit he had some unfinished business to do : .STEWART :This is a little game I call \" Still ?Or No ? \" So you 're the president now .Before , when you ran , you had certain things that you thought -- I wonder if four years as president has in any way changed that .Okay , first one is , we do n't have to trade our values and ideals for our security -- .OBAMA : We don't-- .STEWART :--do you still feel that way ?OBAMA : We do n't .There are some things we have n't gotten done .I still want to close Guantanamo , we have n't been able to get that through Congress .Despite being asked a broad question that could have gone in any direction -- from drone strikes to cybersurveillance to national service -- Obama proceeded , unbidden , to bring up the one campaign promise from 2008 that instantly raises the hackles of both the right and the left .For Obama to mention Gitmo on national television 15 days before the election carries no obvious electoral benefit .Among progressives and civil - liberties voters , Obama 's initial decision to shelve the Guantanamo issue represented a betrayal of the highest order .Dreaming publicly now about closing Gitmo after he did n't take the opportunity to do so in the first two years of his term -- when Democrats still controlled both houses of Congress -- rips open an old wound that only depresses base enthusiasm rather than energize it .More than anything , the renewed commitment is a dark reminder of what the president did n't do when he had the chance .Neither is it clear that the proposal will get much traction in the broader electorate .Americans support keeping the prison open for business at a rate of 70 percent .So if bringing up Gitmo does n't do anything for Obama on his left flank , and it does n't net him any new supporters from the middle or the right , what was the point ?I floated the question on Twitter before the segment aired , and speculation generally fell into two categories : 1 ) Obama wanted to make Congress look bad ; and 2 ) Obama had no way to avoid talking about Guantanamo .Now that the video 's up , we know the second explanation does n't hold water .It might have been one thing if Stewart had asked Obama point - blank about his intentions for the detention facility , but Obama had ample opportunity to take his answer in a different direction .As for Congress -- well , with an approval rating hovering in the teens , it does n't need any help looking bad .All of this presents Romney with free points .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.163597"}

W. Bush seemed to be always fighting the image of not being conservative enough .Being tied with the very popular Reagan White House was good enough to get him elected president , but it was not good enough to win a second term .George W. Bush was a two term president who was unquestionably conservative , but the compassionate conservative candidate with a more modest foreign policy disappeared after 9/11 .Vice President Cheney and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and some of the people that worked for them were the true believers in that White House , and 9/11 was their opening to enact the policies they had been thinking about for at least a decade .W. seemed to like the idea being the big picture CEO president , and let the policy nerds take care of the details , in the case of foreign policy , by the neocons .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.91441"}

Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) .Wasserman Schultz appeared on CNN 's The Lead with Jake Tapper on Thursday , and was asked to explain how Hillary Clinton , who lost to Sanders in New Hampshire by 22 points , could receive as many delegates as the winner : .Tapper : Hillary Clinton lost to Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire by 22 percentage points , the biggest victory in a contested Democratic primary there since John F. Kennedy .But it looks as though Clinton and Sanders are leaving the Granite State with the same number of delegates in their pockets because Clinton has the support of New Hampshire 's superdelegates , these party insiders .What do you tell voters who are new to the process , who says this makes them feel like it 's all rigged ?Wasserman Schultz : Well , let me just make sure that I can clarify exactly what was available during the primaries in Iowa and in New Hampshire .The unpledged delegates are a separate category .The only thing available on the ballot in a primary and a caucus is the pledged delegates .Those that are tied to the candidates that they are pledged to support and they receive a proportional number of delegates going into , going into our convention .Unpledged delegates exist really to make sure that party leaders and elected officials do n't have to be in a position where they are running against grassroots activists .We are as a Democratic Party really highlight and emphasize inclusiveness and diversity at our convention and so we want to give every opportunity to grass roots activists and diverse , committed Democrats to be able to participate , attend , and be a delegate at the convention .And so we separate out those , those unpledged delegates to make sure that there is n't competition between them .Tapper : I 'm not sure that , that answer would satisfy an anxious young voter but let 's move on .Sanders won 15 delegates and Clinton nine based on the New Hampshire primary results , but Clinton picked up six superdelegates to tie Sanders , despite being blown out by the voters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.91278"}
