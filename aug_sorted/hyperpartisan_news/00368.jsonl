{"text": "Last January , Forbes ran a clever feature called \" Jargon Madness , \" in which various egregious business catchphrases squared off against one another in a March Madness - style mock tournament .The champion was drinking the Kool - Aid , in a close win over leverage ( the verb form ) .Interestingly , I recognized only three clich\u00e9s as having crossed over to ( from ? ) academe , two of them being best practices and robust .( Transformative and service learning may be too specific to higher ed . )The third term in the Forbes list that I am familiar with , from countless meetings , e - mails , and memos , is reach out to .In the first two rounds , it demolished learnings and take off line , only to run into the juggernaut it is what it is in the quarter - finals .Reach out does not generally get a lot of love from people who notice and comment on language .This has become the new clich\u00e9 for yuppie types or any pseudo - intellectual types or just idiots that think it sounds special .It is simply just another way of saying : contact , call , speak to , notify , etc . .Several months later , another Urban Dictionary poster noted that thanks for reaching out had itself become a hackneyed formulation and gave this example of its use in conversation : . \"Hi John , thanks for reaching out .I 'm quite busy right now on many important projects .Why do n't you reach out to me again at this time next year and see if I have a couple of free minutes then .Or , better yet , how about never ?Does never work for you ?\" What 's not to hate about reach out to ?It 's a clich\u00e9 , a catchphrase ; it invokes emotional portent without earning it ; it is verbose .I despise it .Yet I recently found myself saying that I was going to \" reach out to \" someone , and I actually do n't feel so bad .This represents a dramatic change .Traditionally , when my students or children used the phrase , I reflexively told them to replace it with contact or get in touch with .But I have been reflecting that there is nothing so great about either of those alternatives .The Oxford English Dictionary calls contact -as - verb \" originally U.S. colloquial \" and cites a 1936 book by P.G. Wodehouse : \" The prospect whom I was planning to contact , as they call it in America , was leaning back in the arm - chair .\" Anyone who remembers when language mavens like - excuse me , such as-William Safire , Edwin Newman , and John Simon walked the earth will recall that this verb was one of their perennial examples of slovenly diction .That battle was lost long ago , but still , contact is hardly a shining example of English usage .( The animus against impact -as - verb still has some juice but is already fading . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.261375"}
