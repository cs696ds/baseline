He then arranged to have the papacy moved to Avignon in France sowing the seeds of a chaotic period for the papacy called the \" Great Schism \" during which there were often 2 or 3 competing popes .Philippe 's daughter Isabelle married Edward II , King of England .Then , his niece 's daughter married Edward III , King of England ( son of Isabelle and Edward II ) .Descent from Edward II down through Lady Eleanor Neville is duplicated in the previous genealogy and in the notes about that genealogy .This genealogy goes through George Stanley , another son of Thomas Stanley and Lady Eleanor Neville .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.51245"}

{"text": "( Another saint , better name ) .Ironically , King Henry I of England , father of 21 illegitimate children , fathered only three \" legitimate \" children ; two sons and a daughter with his wife .And by the time he died , those two sons were dead .This left only his daughter , Matilda , who styled herself as \" Empress \" and who engaged her cousin Stephen in a civil war over the disputed succession of the English crown to a female .Ultimately , the cousins made peace , allowing Stephen to continue as king but Matilda 's heirs to inherit the throne .Matilda 's heir was Henry II .He was a massively powerful European leader , controlling , through inheritance from each of his parents and through his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine , all of Britain and most of France ( Normandy , Brittany , Maine , Anjou , Touraine , Aquitaine and Gascony ) .Henry brilliantly managed and added to his empire .However , it was his personal relationships where he failed miserably .Many American filmgoers became aware of these failures in the 1960s when two films both starring Peter O'Toole as Henry ( \" Becket \" and \" The Lion in Winter \" ) .These films detailed his difficulties with his friend Thomas a Becket and with his estranged wife and sons .Henry was succeeded by his son Richard \" the Lionheart \" who , in turn , was succeeded by his brother John who lost many of the crown 's French holdings .Even after he signed the \" Magna Carta \" and gave away substantial powers , England still fell into another civil war .John died of dysentery before the conflict was resolved .John 's 9-year - old son Henry ( III ) succeeded him and reigned for the next 56 years .His reign was marked by further loss of territory in France but is remembered for commissioning the building of Westminster Abbey .After Henry III 's death in 1272 began a succession of three very different King Edwards which lasted just over a century .Edward I conquered Wales and made many brutal incursions into Scotland , efforts detailed in the film \" Braveheart \" .He made his son \" Prince of Wales \" the title every heir apparent since then has held .That prince became Edward II and the presence of his \" favorites \" , ( a euphemism for his homosexual lovers ) , in court life were a constant source of irritation for the barons , not to mention Edward II 's wife Isabelle of France .The queen entered into an adulterous alliance with Roger Mortimer and the lovers engineered Edward II 's abdication , imprisonment and likely , his brutal murder .His son , Edward III began his 50 year reign over England at age 14 .Because Edward III was the grandson of Philippe IV , King of France and because his wife Philippa was the granddaughter of Philippe IV 's brother , Edward III saw an opportunity to claim succession to the French crown .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "130.14503"}
