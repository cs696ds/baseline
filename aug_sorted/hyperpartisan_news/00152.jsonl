' ' Before , it used to be just one big feed that showed the updates of all your friends and fan pages .Now , your News Feed is put together by a Facebook formula that calculates what it thinks you would like to see .It will include posts that got a lot of comments and how likely you are to interact with that post .That means your News Feed can show things that are several days old up at the top if it 's really popular -- it 's not in chronological order .It also means you 're not seeing every friend 's update .That 's where Live Feed comes in .Live Feed is everything happening right now , in real time ... well , almost everything .Here 's how Facebook spokeswoman Meredith Chin described it to me : \" Live Feed defaults to showing you updates from your top 250 friends and connections [ including Pages].We algorithmically determine those 250 based on who and what you interact with most frequently . '' I just became a fan of the Florida Marlins page , but the updates are not showing on my Live Feed because Facebook does n't have a history of me interacting with that page .So basically you have to teach Facebook what you like by throwing a few comments or hit ' ' like ' ' on posts on new pages you follow .I have nearly 600 \" friends , ' ' I 'm a fan of 94 pages and a member of 88 groups .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.6866"}

'Facebook spokeswoman Meredith Chin told me in an e - mail that suggestions are based on profiles of people who are n't very active or completely filled out , and that they 're made to encourage those users to interact with others on Facebook more .I get that - but wonder if this will also irritate active users who do n't want to see the Facebook slackers .anyone else feel that way ?That explains why one of the suggestions I keep getting is my sister .She 's a busy mom of three young kids who has barely finished her profile .Still , we talk or text each other every day , but Facebook does n't know that -- so it keeps giving suggestions to ' ' get in touch with her .That 's one of the limitations of social media right now , and something that should be incorporated in future evolutions .People are already interacting so much on Facebook that it 's become a part of our lives .The next step in social media needs to be an integration of the two .Until then , be careful -- even if Facebook suggests you poke your boss , you know that 's not a good idea .These days it seems the most popular means of communication , are also free : social networking sites like Facebook , Twitter , MySpace and YouTube .Broward County would like to get in on the act too , but it 's bound by open government laws .As WLRN - Miami Herald reporter Joshua Johnson tells us , the County is considering new rules to help it navigate the world of social media .Today Twitter and LinkedIn announced that they have teamed up to help you cross the social media streams between the two networks .The feature is slowly being rolled out to LinkedIn users over the next few days , but the LinkedIn blog has a clear description how the cross - posting will work .I do n't support putting every Twitter post on your LinkedIn profile .Niala and I always preach you should be careful when crossing the streams .The network audiences are different , and no one uses the @ symbol in LinkedIn , so the language is sometimes different .Twitter tends to be a mix of personal and business updates , and LinkedIn always keeps a professional tone .But just by adding a simple # in to your tweet , it can post to your LinkedIn account .And it goes the other way around too -- just check a box while writing your LinkedIn status update to share it with your Twitter followers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.11181"}

{"text": "For example mydreamscape.org .But the way I see it is , I 'm very unlikely to dedicate 10 years of my life to one idea , grow it and nurture it through all the stages of making it successful .I actually put this to Richard St John a while ago at TedXSheffield , because I was really interested in what he thought of those like myself who do n't necessarily want to be successful ( as such ) .He cleverly turned the question around and said actually what i 'm actually after is success in the idea or the meme .Ideally I would have a team of people and certain people would make there job to take an idea forward for the sake of the team .I 've stated before that some of the largest benefits we will see from creating and maintaining our Lifestreams will be the services created on the backbone of that data .We are starting to see the first big service phenomenon from that coming in the way of content readers that are built specifically for us based on the data shared by our social graph .Early on when I first started writing about Lifestreaming I gave thought to services that could be built off of the data and one of the first that came to mind was a dating site .In fact I had multiple interviews at a top dating site a few years ago that was very interested in my knowledge and thoughts around Lifestreaming data .I did n't get the job , but I still felt that Lifestreaming data would at some point help power the matchmaking process .Well apparently a new dating service called Wings feels the same way .Wings has taken a unique and interesting approach when it comes to dating .They figured that instead of creating a site from scratch that people need to join , they 'd just tap into the 500 + Million Facebook users and build a dating app within their eco - system .The innovation does n't stop there as when you join there is no super long , multi - page questionnaire .After joining the service will analyze your Facebook data and let you also connect your Netflix , Pandora , Last.fm , Twitter , and Foursquare accounts to help paint a picture of who you are .I feel this is a much better way to build a profile for someone .Instead of a static survey filled out and frozen in time , your profile is dynamic based on the data collected on a daily basis .This is the crux of my idea .One of the most frustrating things about online dating is the lack of portability but also having to fill in those bloody profile statements or questions .So if you could leverage your lifestream instead to teach the system about who you really are .Then you might actually get better results .This would / could also cut down on Spam and more interestingly the lies people tell in online dating .I thought about using the same principle as in APML to mark up what s important in peoples lives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.38587"}

{"text": "While Twitter is great for getting thoughts out there , and getting responses from individuals , its weakness for me as a publisher has always been that it is limited in how it lets those who follow you interact with one another .Facebook and now Google+ solve this by letting those who follow you not only see what you think , but also what those who reply to you think .Having the stream of replies all in one place is gold for me .For example , last night ( 1.07am ... yep , it was a rough night )I asked those following me on Google+ for their thoughts about ebooks .100 + people commented and it was shared by some with their own circles of friends .The comments where not only people responding to me , but also to each other , which expanded the conversation even further .As an added bonus , the way Google+ works , comments pop up in real time .It 's almost like a chat room at times , and that can make it even more interactive .Research plus .Research and testing ideas to see if they have potential is something I love with both Twitter and Facebook - and Google+ is no different .In fact , it 's even better than the other networks because I can now test and research my ideas with targeted groups of people - all from one account .As a blogger who blogs in multiple niches , I 've always had to have multiple social media accounts to interact in a relevant way with different groups .As a result , I have a ProBloggerTwitter account and a Digital Photography one .Google+ gives users the ability to set up \" circles \" to segment different groups of people .This allows you to not only delve into specific topics to see what others are updating about , but also to share with those circles .As a result , if I want to test some ideas with my photography friends , I can simply put out an update asking a question specifically to my photography circle .I can see all kinds of applications for this .Being able to set up even more specific circles to test ideas in a more targeted way will be great .I 'm yet to do much with the Hangouts feature of Google+ , but I see some potential here to also build community and also be used in reasearch .At the moment , you 're limited to having ten people in a hangout , so it 's very much a small group activity , but I 'll watch with interest to see how Google evolves the feature .Could we be seeing the beginning of a tool that could be one day used for Webinar type interactions ?Driving traffic plus .As bloggers , we all want traffic to our blogs and , as with other social networks , there is opportunity to drive traffic here .I 've resisted sharing too many of my own links so far on Google+ , but it could be a powerful source of traffic if the user numbers of Google+ continue to climb beyond social media enthusiast circles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.99048"}

{"text": "Naaman also told me that they 've just really started getting into studying this - so we 'll be on the lookout for future findings .In the meantime , always worth remembering : if we are really about wanting to develop relationships on social networking sites , we should limit the screaming or whining about ourselves , start listening and interact .Twitter recently introduced a new tool , called Lists , to help users organize the massive amount of information broadcast through the network .Lists are a way for you to categorize users .You can create a public List for the world to see on your profile , and others can follow folks on that List .Or it can just be a private List for your personal use .Putting an account in a List does n't mean you are following them .Although the List tool is a great way to let others know of good folks to follow , you can get yourself into some trouble with co - workers if you start creating Lists of people you work with .For example , I wanted to make a public List of people who work at The Miami Herald .There are plenty of people here with Twitter accounts , and most people say in their bio that they work here in some manner .But the problem comes in when there are co - workers who DON'T say in their Twitter bio that they work here .Maybe they do n't want bosses to know they are on Twitter .Maybe they do n't talk about work and they keep it for their personal life only .And because it 's personal , maybe they do n't want people to think they represent the company .Regardless of the reason , the fact that they do n't identify themselves as an employee means I should n't \" out ' ' them in a public employee List without asking them first .I realize today the lines between career and personal life are totally blurred -- especially in our social media profiles .But you have to respect your connections who are trying their darnedest to keep those worlds separate in their Twitter or Facebook accounts .That , of course , brings up the point that Niala and I always preach about -- no matter what you use your network for , you should always act professionally .These days , there 's really no way to completely cut off your professional connections from stumbling upon something in your personal networks .It 's just better to be safe than sorry .You can access and manage Lists through Twitter 's website .Third - party Twitter applications like TweetDeck , Twhirl and Seesmic are still working on incorporating this new tool .But in the meantime , play around to get a feel for how they work .Since Faceboook made a few changes recently , active users have probably noticed a lot more \" suggestions ' ' prompting you to interact with people you have n't paid attention to for a long time -- and maybe are n't even around anymore .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.50484"}

{"text": "Herald Blogs .The New Oxford American Dictionary named \" unfriend \" the word of the year - beating out such other social media terms like \" hashtag \" and \" sexting \" .( There 's always 2010 , right ? )Oxford defined \" unfriend \" as a verb that means to remove someone as a \" friend \" on a social networking site such as Facebook .I trooped down the hall to our WLRN - Miami Herald News partner studios to have a chat with Kenny Malone about unfriending .Kenny and I are pretty much always laughing together - so apologies for me laughing in the middle of this segment that aired this morning : .It seems like we have a hard time forgetting about the \" I ' ' in Twitter .That was the conclusion by two Rutgers professors who studied the content of 3,000 tweets sent by 350 Twitter users .The communication and information professors , Mor Naaman and Jeffrey Boase , found that there tend to be two types of Twitter folks .The majority , or 80 percent , were what they called \" meformers \" -- Twitter users who sent out messages that revolved around themselves , updating others about their activities or sharing thoughts and feelings .The other 20 percent are \" informers \" -- people who were actually sharing information .Not surprisingly , the informers tended to have larger social networks and be more interactive .In their study , on average , informers had at least twice as many friends and followers compared to meformers .Another interesting note : women tended to be more \" meformers \" than men .Naaman told me he thinks people talk about themselves simply because it 's the easiest thing to do - it 's natural , and it is probably what we all talk about most of the time .He also thinks that as people get more used to these streams , like we had to do with e - mail , or even the telephone , usage will adapt .Naaman himself has even done this - after doing the study , he told me he realized his Twitter account was too much meformer than informer , so he set up a new account .Twitter 's picked up on this , too : Last week , the question ' ' What are you doing ? ' ' was changed to ' ' What 's happening ? ' ' -- an evolution perhaps in how they see people using the site .Because Naaman and Boase think social awareness streams are becoming an important part of the way some people communicate , both through public and personal relationships , they do n't come down that hard on the meformers as you think they would .Although the meformers ' self focus might be characterized by some as self - indulgent , these messages may play an important role in helping others maintain relationships , \" they wrote in their study .I do n't have a problem with meformers , per say - there are plenty of \" meformer\"-focused Tweets can are interesting , funny or help you connect with someone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.53587"}

{"text": "Unlike James I know what a meme is and I like the idea of memetics , which I first heard via Susan Blackmore .Anyway I 'm sure James actually does know what a meme is and its on with the rules .Here are the rules : .Each player starts with eight random facts / habits about themselves .People who are tagged need to write a post on their own blog ( about their eight things ) and post these rules .At the end of your blog , you need to choose eight people to get tagged and list their names .Do n't forget to leave them a comment telling them they 're tagged , and to read your blog .My first computer was a Commodore 16 Not a Commodore 64 or 128 , 16 as in 16k of total memory .My father bought the C16 for me when I was about 7 and I loved it .I use to play games then started to get into basic programming .I still remember the weird rounded tape cassette recorder thing and the blocky as hell graphics .I have worked in some odd places including ...Equinox Discotheque in Leicester Square I was between jobs and I only lasted 3 weeks before quiting .I learned how to pour drinks correctly and how to make a lot of cocktails .I was only paid 3.70 a hour because you were expected to make a ton of money in tips .This only worked well if you were a attractive woman .The best tips I got in one night was 20 pounds while my female equivilents were getting upwards of 100 pounds a night !I use to have hypersomnolence and now sleep Apnea This is a sleep disorder where I pause snoring and breathing during the night .This makes sleeping difficult and a couple of the side - effects are loud sleeping , morning headaches ( like being hangover ) , trouble concentrating , decreased sex drive forgetfulness , nocturia , etc , etc .Now you can see why working later in the day works better for me .I have also had surgery to try and correct it but its had little to no effect .Most people think its down to weight but actually I 've had this since I was really young and thin .I even know people who are very fit who have this same problem , you can imagine its a problem for the partner who thinks your dying while you sleep .I 'm a Diabolist What s a diabolo ?Well it actually means the devil with two sticks but really its a Chinese Yo - Yo .It looks like a egg cup with a string and sticks .Anyway , I learned how to do the Yo - Yo during the coke - cola yo - yo days and got fed up because everyone had them and everyone knew how to do most of the limited tricks .So I picked up on this thing called a wow ball .It turns out the wow ball was a cheap version of a diabolo and before long I was doing most of the same tricks with a full size diabolo .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.11041"}
