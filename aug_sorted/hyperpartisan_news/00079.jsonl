{"text": "But not every Republican is opposed to rights restoration .Sen. Rand Paul ( R - Ky . ) , for instance , has pushed for restoring rights after incarceration .In some states , such as the swing state of Florida , nearly 20 percent of voting - age African Americans can not cast a ballot due to the state 's permanent ban on felon and ex - felon voting .But in Maryland , the Democratic - controlled General Assembly was able to narrowly override the veto of Republican Gov. Larry Hogan in order to expand voting rights .The hype machine singled out some clear , if tragic , winners from the lineup of this year 's Sundance Film Festival .For instance , there was Other People , SNL writer Chris Kelly 's heartfelt , semi - autobiographical film starring Molly Shannon as a mother with a terminal cancer diagnosis .Not to mention Birth of a Nation , a film about the Nat Turner Rebellion that won Sundance 's domestic drama category - and then sold to Fox Searchlight for an unprecedented $ 17.5 million .But some of the most difficult films to watch from this year 's crop are among the most important .Reflecting the intensity of the national conversation , the festival included an impressive four entries on the topic of gun violence in the United States .With Republican legislators - and plenty of Democrats - quavering before the NRA , afraid to broach even the most modest changes to save American lives in the middle of a true national emergency , these four films are exactly what we need .Under the Gun , the latest from Fed Up director Stephanie Soechtig , delivers a masterfully crafted , well - researched look at the Second Amendment debate from a ( mostly ) measured gun control perspective .Narrated by Katie Couric , the film 's viewpoint is supported by interviews with leading researchers and experts ( including Mother Jones ' National Affairs editor Mark Follman ) who make the case for reasonable checks on gun freedoms .We also hear from gun owners and guns rights activists .But if it 's not obvious enough where the producers are coming from , the film ends with a call to action , urging legislators to enact universal background checks and other \" common - sense \" measures .Which is not to say Under the Gun lacks emotional impact .Soechtig spends time in Newtown , Connecticut - she was raised in neighboring Brookfield - with families who lost children at Sandy Hook , and she chronicles the painstaking recovery of Gabby Giffords , the former Arizona congresswoman shot in the head in 2011 by a deranged gunman .All of this makes for some very heartrending scenes .But Soechtig takes her case beyond Newtown and Aurora and Isla Vista to tackle the epidemic of street killings in Chicago , a problem she argues is just as important , and as preventable , as the mass shootings , given proper legislation .The film is nothing if not comprehensive .Under the Gun also delves into the innocuous roots and notorious progression of the National Rifle Association .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.672134"}

{"text": "Saturday , April 30 , 2011 .Hot Senate races in 2012 .If we are counting correctly , the next general election in the United States will take place in about eighteen months on Tuesday , November 6 , 2012 .Between now and then there will be a great many nomination races not only to see who the Republicans put up against President Obama but also for House and Senate seats in both parties .As a starting point , we thought we would look at the United States Senate , which , as any grade school child knows , elects a third of its membership of 100 every two years , who then get to serve six - year terms .In other words , those 33 who will be elected on November 6 , 2012 will serve from January 3 , 2013 to January 2 , 2019 .Unless something changes , Democrats are expected to have 23 seats up for election , which include two independents , who caucus with the Democrats , while the Republicans have only 10 seats up for election .Predicting what things will look like in a year and a half can be dodgy business , but the simple fact that far more Democratic seats need to be contested might suggest that there is greater potential for Republicans to win back the Senate .It may also be true that some Senate seats currently held by Democrats are in states which are more traditionally Republican .That would be fine too .Just to have a starting point , here are 17 of the 33 Senate races that could bare some scrutiny , either because they could flip to the other party or because they could be seriously contested in nomination battles .Others , of course , may be interesting for all sorts of reasons .So , that 'll keep us busy for a while and along the way we fully expect to get to some of the more interesting House and gubernatorial races -- in fact , we 've already started .It will be , we are sure , a very interesting year and a half .As you may recall , Conservative candidate Doug Hoffman emerged to challenge moderate Republican Dede Scozzafava in a special election to replace John McHugh , who resigned to become secretary of the Army .With lackluster backing from the party that nominated her and some high - profile Republicans switching their support to Hoffman , Scozzafava pulled out of the race , endorsing Democrat Bill Owens , who ended up winning the seat narrowly over Hoffman .Owens won again in 2012 , even more narrowly over Republican Matthew Doheney .But it was Hoffman who made the difference .He took just enough support away from Doheney to allow Owens to pull it out .Well , what happened in NY-23 may also be happening in NY-26 , where a rich Teabagger , Jack Davis , is dividing Republican / conservative support just the way Hoffman did .The seat is currently vacant , following the resignation of Republican Chris Lee ( of Craigslist scandal fame ) earlier this year , and Gov.

Neil Abercrombie ( D ) reiterate his memory of celebrating the birth with Obama 's mother , but so did Dunham 's college adviser and another mother giving birth in the hospital when Obama was born .She remembered because \" in those days , there were hardly any other black babies .\" The repeated debunking of the birther conspiracy has convinced numerous Republicans that Trump offers nothing but a \" joke \" candidacy .Last night , Gov. Jan Brewer ( R - AZ ) told CNN 's John King that this issue \" is leading our country down a path of destruction .\" Americans agree , with 64 percent saying \" they would definitely not vote for Trump in 2012 \" and half of all Americans believing he 'd be a \" poor \" or \" terrible \" leader .This , however , seems to be another fact Trump will entirely ignore .Republicans embrace Birtherism at their peril -- and yet that is precisely what they 're doing .It 's not an accident that he 's embraced Birtherism .It 's his key to Republican success , should he seek it , and he 's not about to drop it just because a CNN investigation says he 's crazy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.80585"}
