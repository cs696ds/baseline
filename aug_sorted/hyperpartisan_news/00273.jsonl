{"text": "The potential for a President Rubio to be nominating the next few Supreme Court justices could prove especially frightening seeing that the senator , in an address to a far - right Florida group , rejected the separation of church and state as unconstitutional .He has also embraced the Right 's phony religious persecution rhetoric , running campaign ads and delivering speeches about how conservative Christians like himself who oppose gay marriage are the real victims of discrimination in America .During Saturday 's debate , he said that Christians in America face far more discrimination than Muslim - Americans .On the economy , Rubio might even be further to the right of many in the GOP .Think of it as the Bush tax cuts on steroids : disproportionate government aid to the ones who need it the least that costs the government trillions of dollars in revenue .Despite this record , the media has given Rubio flattering coverage , portraying him as a mainstream candidate who can thwart radicals like Donald Trump and Ted Cruz .Part of Rubio 's reputation as somehow more \" moderate \" or \" mainstream \" comes from his previous support for a bipartisan immigration reform bill .But of course Rubio ended up renouncing the bill and tacking further to the right on immigration than many of his Republican colleagues .Even though Santorum , when asked last week , could n't name a single legislative accomplishment of Rubio 's , it is obvious that Rubio has succeeded in doing at least one thing : embracing the ideology of the GOP 's extremist wing without being held accountable for it .Whole Woman 's Health is the culmination of a decades - long strategy by groups like Americans United for Life to choke off abortion access by creating unnecessary regulations on clinics .These groups are also hoping to get the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe in the form of laws banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy , just before when the court has said that abortion bans are legal .But those who want to find a silver bullet to end abortion rights completely just had a day in court too ... and it did n't go well for them .The Supreme Court today declined to hear an appeal of a lower court ruling that struck down North Dakota 's \" fetal heartbeat \" law , which would have banned abortion at about six weeks of pregnancy , before many women even know that they are pregnant .The law was clearly unconstitutional - one prominent anti - choice lawyer has called such efforts \" futile \" - but North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple said that it was an \" attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of Roe v. Wade . \" The boundaries of Roe v. Wade , it turns out , however much they may be weakened by incremental restrictions , still prevent banning almost all abortions .Donald Trump has established himself as the candidate of hatred and bigotry , and he 's dragging the rest of the party along with him .Anti - immigrant and anti - Muslim rhetoric has become the norm in the GOP presidential debates , as Trump 's policy proposals become more absurdly racist and xenophobic -- like a ban on allowing any Muslims to enter the United States .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.79462"}

{"text": "But first , we need to consider one of the unfortunate realities -- in America and elsewhere -- which is that the purpose of immigration has changed .It used to exist for people who wanted to come to America and assimilate .Now , in a dramatic shift from even our grandparents ' generation , the \" sensitivity \" and \" diversity \" doctrine of the modern age is suggesting that we create cultural enclaves , where outsiders come to our country and live as if they never left home .That does n't work , as Europe will tell you .Instead , we lose our identity in the shadow of multiculturalism .It 's happened in France , and it 's happening in Britain .Leaders are learning a painful message that if you tiptoe around the global realities , you 'll pay for it .If people want to live in America -- including Muslims -- they need to embrace our Constitution and our culture .Others have said in less artful ways what conservatives have been warning for years : there is no such thing as coexistence between Sharia law and our constitutional republic .That is n't religious prejudice , but an ideological reality .What most people either do n't realize or willfully ignore is that only 16 percent of Islam is a religion -- the rest is a combination of military , judicial , economic , and political system .Christianity , by comparison , is n't a judicial or economic code -- but a faith .So to suggest that we would be imposing some sort of religious test on Muslims is inaccurate .Sharia is not a religion in the context of the First Amendment .Under the framework proposed by Senators Ted Cruz ( R - Texas ) and Rick Santorum , America would n't vet refugees based on religion but an ideology that 's incompatible with American liberty .\" I 've proposed actual concrete things [ like eliminating the visa lottery system ] and immigration law that would have -- not the effect of banning all Muslims , but a lot of them , \" Santorum explained .The bottom line is this : the U.S. Constitution is an agreement between people about how they 'll be governed .What good is it if people immigrate to America with the sole purpose of undermining that contract ?We should n't be embarrassed to say that we oppose those who want to come to the United States to destroy it .And while most Muslims are not radicalized , Sharia certainly encourages it .Based on polling from the Center for Security Policy , that 's the system most would choose .The majority of Muslims in America believe they \" ' should have the choice of being governed by Sharia [ law]. 'Sharia authorizes such atrocities as murder against non - believers who wo n't convert , beheadings , and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans , especially women .In America , we have freedom under the construct of ordered liberty .Even the Wall Street Journal struggles with the clash of these ideologies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.57663"}
