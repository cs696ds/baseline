{"text": "Should Conservatives Have Supported Hillary Clinton in 2008 ?02 Apr 2010 .In my Forbes column this week I ask conservatives to consider whether we would be better off today from their point of view if they had helped Hillary Clinton get the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 .I build my analysis around the theory of the second best , which is well known in the economic literature but also has applications for politics , I believe .BB .Often in politics , the first and best option is unavailable , making it necessary to choose the lesser of evils .However , voters often fail to think through what is their true second - best alternative .If one 's preferred candidate fails to get his or her party 's nomination , people tend to assume that the second - best alternative is simply whoever does get their party 's nomination .But it might be that a candidate of the other party would actually be preferable from their point of view .The theory of the second - best is well developed in the economic literature .It says that if all the conditions for a first - best solution can not be satisfied , it does n't necessarily follow that the second - best solution will look anything remotely like the first - best solution .For example , economists might agree that laissez - faire is the best way for a particular market to operate .But for some reason it might be impossible to have laissez - faire in that market .It might be that a heavily regulated market would actually work better than a market that is not completely free .In politics the second - best theory might work like this : There are three candidates , A , B and C. A and B belong to your party and C to the other party .Your first - best candidate is A , who agrees with you on all the issues .You agree with B most of the time , but with some important exceptions .You disagree with C on all the issues .Now suppose that A is defeated in the primary and you are forced to choose between B and C. It might seem obvious that B is your second - best alternative , but that may not necessarily be the case .It might be that B is very rigid on the issues on which you disagree , while C has a reputation for not holding any position too firmly and being willing to negotiate .It might therefore turn out that C is really your second - best alternative .I was prompted to think about this theory by something I read the other day by New Republic columnist Jonathan Chait .He was writing about how the interests of Obama as they relate to his potential 2012 Republican opponent may be different from those of liberals generally .Said Chait : .From Obama 's perspective , the crazier the Republican nominee , the better .Better [ Minnesota Gov. ] Tim Pawlenty than [ former Massachusetts Gov. ] Mitt Romney , and better [ former Alaska Gov. ] Sarah Palin than Tim Pawlenty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.88107"}

Guest : .\" They have all passed away , That noble race and brave , Their light canoes have vanished , From Oft the Crested Wave , But Their name is on your waters , You may not wash it out .\" There is a certain truth to this , at least with regard to Gananoque .At one point Colonel Stone attempted to change the name to the Thames River , but it just did n't catch on , even though the Gananoque is called the Thames on a number of early maps .The romanticism of the period inspired people to souvenir hunt through the Thousand Islands and elsewhere before the sites were properly identified and protected as parks .There was nothing to stop people from poking around ancient campsites and filling up their packs with whatever they found .Some of these items found their way into the Gananoque Museum Collections .People should never disturb an archaeological site .It 's much like a crime scene with clues scattered all about .Seemingly random placement of items can tell a trained archaeologist a great deal of information .Often times , digging something up and throwing it in a box can destroy an entire site .So , if you do find things out there , do n't touch them .Luckily , we can tell where some of the items in the collections came from , as an amateur historian , Frank Eames , attached labels to the various sherds of pottery he found .Most of them state that they came from Hay Island and were dug up in the late 1920s .Pottery , stone hatchets , spear and arrow points make up the collection , along with a few deer bone awls and other items .The problem of actually identifying them is made more difficult , however , in that the Hay Island items are mixed in with items from other sites as well as native crafts from the late 19th and early 20th centuries .In 2005 , Dr. Beverly Smith from the University of Michigan , visited the Arthur Child Heritage Museum and identified a number of the objects that are on display there .The collection contains objects that date from just before the arrival of Europeans in North America to spear points that were made somewhere around 8000 BC - just a short time after the last ice age !", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.85864"}

Bush 's .Many conservatives credit Secretary of State Clinton for this favorable ( from their point of view ) state of affairs .Right - wing foreign policy experts like Robert Kagan publicly praise the bipartisanship of Obama 's foreign policy .And James A. Baker , who served as secretary of State for George H.W. Bush , recently said that he agreed with the overwhelming majority of what the Obama administration is doing in foreign affairs .( McCain was always sticking his finger in the eye of conservatives before 2008 , and Romney imposed a health care reform in Massachusetts almost identical to the one later adopted by Obama . )I think the evidence suggests that Hillary Clinton could have won the Democratic nomination with just a little bit more support , and probably would be governing significantly more conservatively than Obama .For one thing , given her disastrous experience with health care reform in 1993 - 1994 , it 's reasonable to assume that she would have stayed away from that issue at all costs .At least some Republicans agree with my assessment .A Fox News / Opinion Dynamics poll last October asked people if Hillary had won the election would she be doing a better or worse job than Obama .Among Republicans , 34 % said yes , while only 22 % of Democrats did .So conservatives should have shifted their support to Hillary Clinton in 2008 , when it became reasonably clear that it was going to be a Democratic year .Refusing to consider that option gave us Obama , and much more liberal policies than we probably would have gotten under a President Hillary Clinton .Jon Chait comments here .Kevin Drum here .Matt Yglesias here .James Pethokoukis here .John Sides here . ...but I do n't think it 's accurate to say that she would have been substantially all that different from Obama .First off , that National Journal \" most liberal \" ranking was pure bunk : \" I actually browsed through the scorecard National Journal used to determine the ranking .There are precisely two scored votes where Obama took the liberal position and Clinton took the conservative . ...So there you have it .Obama is more liberal than Clinton because he voted with John McCain , the most likely Republican nominee , and Tom Coburn , one of the Senate 's most conservative members . \" Not to mention that there is n't anything that Obama has done that would n't have been acceptable to all mainstream conservatives a few decades ago ( or , in the case of RomneyCare , a scant few years ago ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "121.39256"}
