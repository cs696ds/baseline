{"text": "The revelations this week regarding Hillary Clinton 's use of private email ( discussed here , here , and here ) added to questions about her secrecy , opposition to transparency in government , and her character .Her actions also look remarkably foolish for a major candidate , especially considering how she had previously criticized Republicans in the Bush administration for the same actions .Her actions , and her poor response to the situation , have also reinforced concerns among some Democrats that Clinton is not a very good campaigner .Initially it appeared that Jeb Bush had out - maneuvered her by recently releasing email from when he was Governor of Florida .Now CNN is reporting that Bush is exaggerating the transparency of his administration : .Bush has released hundreds of thousands of emails from the personal account he used during his eight years as governor in the name of transparency - and after public records requests for those emails .A Bush aide told NBC News that a number of his staffers and his general counsel 's office decided which emails to release .But a CNN review of those emails turned up evidence a number of his official aides and family members also had email addresses housed at Jeb.org - and used them to conduct both official and political business - raising questions about how transparent that email dump ultimately was .Of course Bush is n't the only potential Republican candidate with email problems .Chris Christie 's administration had similar problems .Perhaps that is why Hillary Clinton thinks she can get away with primarily keeping quite about the whole thing .The reports I discussed yesterday regarding Hillary Clinton using private email as Secretary of State are leading some , such as Frank Rich , to wonder if Democrats need a backup plan for 2016 .A follow up story in The New York Times reports how Clinton used her private email to thwart requests for information , including requests from Congress and Freedom of Information requests from journalists .These ethical breaches by Hillary Clinton are of particular concern taking place so soon after scandals in the Bush administration regarding private use of email , making many liberals besides myself question why Clinton could have done something so foolish .Perhaps the most serious accusation facing Clinton is that she may have breached one of the fundamental tenets of classified information .J William Leonard , former director of the body that keeps watch over executive branch secrets , the Information Security Oversight Office , told the Guardian that if Clinton had dealt with confidential government matters through her personal email , that would have been problematic .\" There is no such thing as personal copies of classified information .All classified information belongs to the US government and it should never leave the control of the government . \" The Associated Press is considering legal action in response to her failure to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests for email : .The unusual practice of a Cabinet - level official running her own email server would have given Clinton - who is expected to run for president in the 2016 campaign - significant control over limiting access to her message archives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.346"}

{"text": "The Hill reports : .In order to speed up the transmission of a set of talking points , Hillary Clinton asked an aide to send information to her through a \" nonsecure \" channel .In an email marked June 17 , 2011 , that was released by the State Department on Friday , Clinton informs aide Jake Sullivan that she has not yet received a set of talking points .\" They say they 've had issues sending secure fax , \" Sullivan says .\" They 're working on it . \"\" If they ca n't , turn into nonpaper w no identifying heading and send nonsecure , \" Clinton responds .It is not clear what the contents of the email were , whether information sent was classified or secure or whether the order was carried out .The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment .Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R - Ia . ) chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , called the email \" disturbing . \"\" It raises a host of serious questions and underscores the importance of the various inquiries into the transmittal of classified information through her non - government email server , \" he added .If Hillary Clinton did instruct someone to remove the markings on classified information and send it over her private email system , this would be a felony , violating laws such as such as U.S. Code 793 .The question remains whether the information was classified , but from the context it is hard to accept any other explanation .If the information was n't classified , it would n't have been an issue that they were having difficulty with the secure fax .Ed Morrissey 's thoughts on this are hard to argue with : .Unclassified material does n't need to be transmitted by secure fax ; if the material was n't classified , Sullivan would have had them faxed normally .Ordering aides to remove headers to facilitate the transmission over unsecured means strongly suggests that the information was not unclassified .On top of that , removing headers to avoid transmission security would be a violation of 18 USC 793 anyway , which does not require material to be classified - only sensitive to national security .Contrary to Clinton 's previous claims that she did not send or receive classified email on her private server , by McClatchy 's count there were at least 1,340 emails contained classified material , including sixty - six in the latest release .While not marked as classified , \" intelligence officials say some material was clearly classified at the time .Her aides also sent and received classified information . \"As Reuters explained in August , when a smaller amount of classified information had already been discovered in Clinton 's email , this information could have been \" born classified \" and be considered classified regardless of whether the State Department had labeled it classified : .In the small fraction of emails made public so far , Reuters has found at least 30 email threads from 2009 , representing scores of individual emails , that include what the State Department 's own \" Classified \" stamps now identify as so - called ' foreign government information .

{"text": "Kasich barely squeaked into the prime time debate , and the two debates did show that Kasich really did deserve to be there more than Rick Perry , who was excluded , possibly by fudging the results of the polls .Kasich and Jeb Bush looked the most stable in the group .Bush already has his position as top contender after Trump , but now Kasich might replace Scott Walker as the leading challenger to Bush and move into the top tier .I also downgraded Bush for his discussion of his brother 's policies .It was n't faulty intelligence which got us in Iraq as he claimed , but his brother twisting the intelligence to justify the war he wanted to start .Jeb ! also seemed oblivious to the fact that ISIS and the other problems now occurring in Iraq are due to his brother destabilizing the region .They all seemed oblivious , when talking about the deficit , to the fact that the deficit is a consequence of George W. Bush both fighting the war on credit and cutting taxes on the wealthy .The other Republican who looked good , if you ignore his actual views , was Marco Rubio .He could make a good candidate in a television - based campaign .The entry of Trump into the race made it hard for candidates like Rubio to get attention , but he did get a shot at being noticed Thursday .On the other hand , it seemed a battle throughout the evening between Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz to be the most bat - shit candidate on stage , which was impressive considering that Donald Trump was on the same stage .I was edging towards awarding this to Huckabee , with lines such as , \" The purpose of the military is kill people and break things , \" until Cruz gave his closing statement , and clinched the title : .If I 'm elected president , let me tell you about my first day in office .The first thing I intend to do is to rescind every illegal and unconstitutional executive action taken by Barack Obama .The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice to open an investigation into these videos and to prosecute Planned Parenthood for any criminal violations .The next thing I intend to do is instruct the Department of Justice and the IRS to start ( sic ) persecuting religious liberty , and then intend to cancel the Iran deal , and finally move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem .I will keep my word .My father fled Cuba , and I will fight to defend liberty because my family knows what it 's like to lose it .In contrast , Huckabee went for the laugh as opposed to Cruz 's tirade : .It seems like this election has been a whole lot about a person who 's very high in the polls , that does n't have a clue about how to govern .A person who has been filled with scandals , and who could not lead , and , of course , I 'm talking about Hillary Clinton .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.41929"}

{"text": "The department would be the position of accepting Clinton 's assurances she was surrendering everything required that was in her control ... .The AP said Wednesday it was considering taking legal action against the State Department for failing to turn over some emails covering Clinton 's tenure as the nation 's top diplomat after waiting more than one year .The department has failed to meet several self - imposed deadlines but has never suggested that it does n't possess all Clinton 's emails .Having checked more coverage in the media and blogosphere since my initial post , I was pleased to see that most liberal bloggers I read did question Clinton 's conduct .For example , rather than a partisan defense Steve Benen 's post raised the same objective points : .There 's no shortage of problematic angles to this .Obviously , there 's the question of transparency and compliance with the Federal Records Act .Clinton was n't the first Secretary of State to make use of a personal email account - Colin Powell did the same thing during his tenure in the Bush / Cheney administration - but preservation rules have changed and Clinton apparently faced more stringent requirements .There 's also the matter of security : as Secretary of State , Clinton sent and received highly sensitive information on a daily basis , including classified materials , from officials around the world .By relying on private email , instead of an encrypted State Department account , Clinton may have created a security risk .Other liberal bloggers have been far harder on Clinton .Clinton is also receiving criticism on MSNBC , as opposed to the partisan defense we would expect in the reverse situation from Fox .Needless to say , conservatives tended to be quite critical , and hypocritical , usually ignoring the comparable use of private email by many Republicans , including officials in the Bush administration , Chris Christie , and Sarah Palin .It was disappointing but not surprising to see that the Clintonistas did quickly get some writers out to defend Clinton .Typically their defenses were no more honest than a report from Fox .Defenses of Clinton tended to concentrate on the arguing that Clinton did not actually break the law .This is definitely a case of moving the goal posts and possibly also incorrect .The defenses of Clinton point out that Colin Powell used private email , but ignore the changes in regulations made in 2009 which \" required that all emails be preserved as part of an agency 's record - keeping system . \"Her defenders have also ignored the more stringent requirements put into place in 2011 .As a consequence of these rules changes , John Kerry has used government email for his communications , as has Barack Obama since taking office in 2009 .Many of the other defenses of Clinton are rather trivial attacks on the journalist who wrote the story .The statements that these revelations came out as part of the Benghazi hearings is contradicted with finding a journalist who had reported on this previously .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.46817"}

{"text": "While there is no doubt Clinton is the front runner , her nomination can not be said to be inevitable months before a single vote has been cast .As I noted earlier in the week , the polls are not at all predictive in a nomination battle .This polling report from December 2007 described how Clinton had a huge lead over Obama .In December 2003 , Howard Dean was pulling away in the polls .Eventual winner John Kerry was in sixth place with only 4 percent , even trailing Al Sharpton .This race is far from over .Bernie Sanders could pull an upset , like Obama in 2008 or Kerry in 2004 , or the party might yet still call on Joe Biden .Jim Webb has dropped out of the race , leaving the question open as to whether he will run as an independent .He acknowledged that his views \" on many issues are not compatible with the power structure and the nominating base of the Democratic Party . \"As to whether he will continue to think of himself as a Democrat , he said , \" We 'll think about that .\" Webb might see himself as having a chance as an independent , being ideologically between the Democrats and the far right wing Republican candidates , but the system makes it quite difficult for an independent to compete .If Webb thought he did not receive enough attention in last week 's Democratic debate , he will likely receive even less as an independent .The Democrats and Republicans will continue to shut independent candidates out of general election debates , despite fights from the Libertarian and Green parties .Webb will also have to raise far more money than he has been able to raise so far , having new expenses such as achieving ballot access .Politco described how poor his fund raising has been : .In the same period , Hillary Clinton raised nearly $ 30 million with $ 25.7 million on hand .If Webb is to have any impact as an independent candidate , most likely it would be to affect the outcome in close states .The best case scenario is that , if Virginia is close , he takes more support from the Republican candidate and enables the Democrats to win the state .It remains unknown whether the number of Democratic candidates will remain the same after this week , with Joe Biden appearing to be planning to announce his candidacy but no official word as to this .The Washington Post inadvertently put out a story stating that Biden was running and had to retract it .The pundits who have been downplaying Bernie Sanders ' campaign form the start declared that Hillary Clinton was the winner of the first Democratic debate , despite the focus groups who considered Sanders to be the winner .As usually occurs , polls showed that after the fact the majority went with the pundits as to the winner ( with many probably not having seen the debate ) .However the pundits did not predict what has actually happened .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.00721"}

{"text": "He should have been prepared for a question based upon the recent Meet the Press interview .I recently discussed why the Democratic Socialist label is not hurting Bernie Sanders .Despite the labels he prefers , Sanders seeks to reform capitalism , not eliminate it .It is notable that he did point out his support for small and medium sized business : .SANDERS : I think everybody is in agreement that we are a great entrepreneurial nation .We have got to encourage that .Of course , we have to support small and medium - sized businesses .But you can have all of the growth that you want and it does n't mean anything if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent .So what we need to do is support small and medium - sized businesses , the backbone of our economy , but we have to make sure that every family in this country gets a fair shake ... .Sanders could have also done a better job on guns , but he did note his D- lifetime rating from the NRA ( with Sanders also receiving an F at least once ) .Let 's begin , Anderson , by understanding that Bernie Sanders has a D - minus voting rating ( ph ) from the NRA .And over the years , I have strongly avoided instant background checks , doing away with this terrible gun show loophole .And I think we 've got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers .I believe that everybody in this country who has a mental crisis has got to get mental health counseling immediately .Sanders was more prepared for the questions about Black Lives Matter .Note that Sanders repeated the phrase , but Clinton did not .Sanders wins a point over Clinton in his support for expanding Social Security .In contrast to the Republicans , it was good to see a political party which faced reality on climate change , but there are also aspects of Clinton 's environmental record which could have been challenged .Sanders was right in arguing that war should only be considered as a last resort .Clinton was unable to defend her mistakes on Libya or Syria , but her opponents could also have done a better job of criticizing her on these .Perhaps it would have been different if Joe Biden was there , considering how he spent four years opposing Clinton 's hawkish views .Sanders was also far better than Clinton when discussing civil liberties , including his opposition to NSA surveillance , and marijuana laws , including opposition to the drug war .Despite calling himself a Democratic Socialist , in many ways Sanders is the most libertarian candidate running from either party ( at least for us left - libertarians who concentrate on civil liberties as opposed to greater freedom for giant corporations ) .Clinton was right in saying that the economy does better when a Democrat is in office .It was clear that any of the participants in last night 's debate would have been better than the Republicans running .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.248055"}

{"text": "This buys real national security because when people do n't have reason to hate you , something called real peace happens .Obama is showing that we can model what is best about our country to the rest of the world again , rather than assert what is worst about it .He is reminding us of a time in the late 1940s and early 1950s when this was the United States and we really were that shining city on the hill .We sponsored the United Nations .We rebuilt Europe .We built international coalitions to handle the Korean conflict .We fed much of the malnourished world .We were an awesome country back then .To quote the late Hubert Humphrey , I 'm as pleased as punch with our president .Obviously he is not a flawless president .I too have major concerns with some of his decisions as president .However , his focus on a long game and doing the intelligent thing rather than the emotional thing certainly garners not just my respect , but also my deep admiration and gratitude .Thank you for being one of the few grown up leaders in our government , Mr. President .You need quite a long scorecard to keep track of the people running for president these days .As in 2012 , the number is disproportionately high on the Republican side .This time around the number of Republicans running is even higher .As of today there are eleven officially declared candidates : Ted Cruz , Rand Paul , Marco Rubio , Ben Carson , Carly Fiorina , Mike Huckabee , Rick Santorum , George Pataki , Lindsey Graham , Rick Perry and Jeb Bush .Unannounced candidates will likely include Scott Walker , Chris Christie , Bobby Jindal and John Kasich .Fox News and CNN get to figure out how to put them all on a debate stage .As a practical matter they should have two or three debates with subsets of the candidates at each .That way at least there is some chance of a debate .But will any of them say anything that truly distinguished them from the other candidates ?With the exceptions of Rand Paul ( who recently tried to kill the Patriot Act ) and George Pataki ( a suspiciously moderate former governor of New York state ) the answer is pretty much \" no \" .The rest are all cut from the same cloth ; they accept the same orthodoxy and thus all kind of blend into the debate stage together .Some are slightly more socially conservative than others , but even Republicans will have a hard time finding any meaningful differences between them .Some of these candidates could at least be laughed off the stage as simply not credible or for suffering from terminal foot in mouth disease .It appears that shame is no barrier to running for president : .Ben Carson opined that prison makes men gay , as if being a victim of rape in prison makes someone gay .He also said that Obamacare is the worst thing to happen since slavery .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.433655"}
{"text": "So I think we need to be very careful .Jeb Bush did n't have much of consequence to say on policy , but he did do a good job of responding to Donald Trump 's antics .He told Trump , \" Donald , you 're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency .That 's not going to happen . \"He summed up Trump here : .So Donald , you know , is great at - at the one - liners , but he 's a chaos candidate .And he 'd be a chaos president .He would not be the commander in chief we need to keep our country safe .He also questioned Trump 's source of information , referring back to a previous statement from Donald Trump that he obtained information on foreign policy from television shows : .HEWITT : Governor Bush , a commander - in - chief question .You 've said that Mr. Trump is not qualified to be president because he 's not qualified to deal with Vladimir Putin .Why are you better qualified to deal with Vladimir Putin than Mr. Trump ?BUSH : Because I - first of all , I know what I do n't know .I know what I do n't know .I would seek out , as I have , the best advice that exists .I wo n't get my information from the shows .I do n't know if that 's Saturday morning or Sunday morning .I do n't know which one .None of the candidates was remotely qualified to be president .( While Rand Paul was generally right in this debate , his economic views and opposition to reproductive rights , which did not come up in this debate would disqualify him . )Unfortunately the Democratic front runner holds essentially the same views , even if Clinton uses different rhetoric in appealing to Democratic as opposed to Republican primary voters .Bernie Sanders represents our best hope to both have a president who has not made the errors which destabilized the region , and who can inspire voters to turn out to defeat the Republicans in a general election .The above electoral map prediction from Western Illinois University has received a lot of attention , especially among supporters of Bernie Sanders , for showing Sanders winning in a landslide .Some argue that we should take this seriously because the mock election model has been right in every election it was used in since 1975 .The catch is that it was only used three times since 1975 .They deserve some credit for correctly predicting victories for Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford before many people had heard of Carter , and for predicting the election of Obama when many were ( as with Sanders now ) claiming he was unelectable .While I would love for this to be true , it is also very hard to accept the results in specific states , such as Sanders winning Mississippi and Georgia but losing in Hawaii and Maryland .Of course the claims of being right are limited to the final results and not accuracy of state by state predictions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.525604"}

{"text": "It is easy to dismiss this prediction , and I could not blame either Clinton or the Republicans for denying any meaning to it beyond the enthusiasm of college students for Sanders .The bigger question this year is whether we can believe the conventional polls , especially when they are being used to determine who qualifies for the debates , which can potentially influence the outcome .Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie have been eliminated from Tuesday 's main debate , along with George Pataki and Lindsay Graham being excluded from the undercard debate .Even some pollsters have argued that the polls should not be used in this manner .One problem is that the Republican candidates are too close together to use the polls to separate them .Then there is the question of whether the polls are all that accurate in predicting a primary election well before the vote .I 've followed the Democratic primaries far more closely , and have noted many times how little predictive value the polls have .This polling report from December 2007 described how Clinton had a huge lead over Obama .In December 2003 , Howard Dean was pulling away in the polls .Eventual winner John Kerry was in sixth place with only 4 percent , even trailing Al Sharpton .Among the problems with these polls , many voters in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire do not decide until the last minute .People are far more likely to switch between relatively similar members of their own party than they are to switch from a liberal Democrat to a conservative Republican in a general election .Pollsters also adjust the raw results based upon projections as to who will actually vote , but that is difficult to predict .Some polls this year are basing their prediction upon whether someone voted in previous Democratic primaries , but this excludes the people are who , at least from discussions on line , are saying they have just recently registered to vote Democratic in order to vote for Sanders .There is no good way to determine how many of these people , or how many who are turning out in huge numbers for Sanders events , will really vote .The results out of Iowa and New Hampshire could radically alter the results in subsequent states when the media covers the winners more favorably and voters see them in a new light .Pollsters are having an even more difficult time .An article at The New Yorker described how much fewer people are even responding to polls : .The participation rate - the number of people who take a survey as a percentage of the population - is far lower .Election pollsters sample only a minuscule portion of the electorate , not uncommonly something on the order of a couple of thousand people out of the more than two hundred million Americans who are eligible to vote .The promise of this work is that the sample is exquisitely representative .We wo n't be able to be in business ! \"A typical response rate is now in the single digits .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.79029"}
{"text": "Barack Obama did not .Wall Street was concerned that investors would not be able to immediately get back their money from MBS , ( mortgage backed securities ) if Hillary Clinton became president because all Hillary Clinton wanted to do was keep people in their homes .Wall Street backed Barack Obama behind closed doors because Barack Obama was going to , and did , allow parallel foreclosures for any sucker who applied for a mortgage modification .Parallel Foreclosure is as it sounds , as a bank is \" attempting \" to modify an existing mortgage , the bank can secretly begin foreclosing on that same homeowner !Parallel Foreclosure also explains why mortgage modification applicants had to keep resubmitting their paperwork , it was a stall tactic to ensure the foreclosure papers were processed .Where was Bernie Sanders in 2008 regarding Parallel Foreclosures ?If Bernie Sanders was protesting Parallel Foreclosure as being unethical and even constitution busting back in 2008 , then Bernie knows it was Barack Obama who was complicit to Wall Street , not Hillary Clinton .If Bernie Sanders does not know about parallel foreclosure in 2008 , then he 's a social activist fraud who was oblivious to over a million homeowners losing their homes to parallel foreclosure tactics .Either way , Hillary Clinton stayed above the fray back in 2008 , and once again , now , by not taking Bernie Sander 's Wall Street bait and revealing the truth because it could hurt Barack Obama 's legacy .Hillary and her Jesus Like behavior of staying above the fray allows Bernie Benedict Sanders to taint her with a false flag label of being a minion to Wall Street when the opposite was true in 2008 and continues to be true today as well .My biggest complaint about Hillary Clinton Supporters is they may be the only group in the world who would stand obliviously and idly by as sinister evil doers attack her in a myriad of Byzantine manners .Even local Supermarkets were cluster bombed by Globe Weekly and it 's Freedom of Speech busting anti - Hillary Clinton headline .Globe ragazine was actually allowed to display a HEADLINE STATING AS FACT that Hillary Clinton WILL be put in jail for the rest of her life .Has even one Hillary Clinton supporter gone to their local supermarket and either ripped up Globe magazine or protested loudly and vigorously to the supermarket owner to get that ILLEGAL piece of tripe off the newsstand .The sad fact is that Hillary Clinton 's supporters do n't fight for Hillary Clinton , they fight to get the closest spot in line so they can worship Hillary Clinton from as close a distance as possible .The sad fact is that Jesus Christ 's supporters did n't fight for Jesus Christ , they fought to get the closest spot in line so they could worship Jesus from up close .Wimps every one of you .Yeah , Hillary Clinton , wins the 2016 Iowa Caucus even as she faces relentless attacks from both neo conservatives and neo liberals and Media outlets like Fox and CNN who are doing their darndest to keep bringing up overblown , exaggerated issues even when she wins .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.83438"}

{"text": "Sanders rightly pointed out that most of these sorts of wars come back to bite us .O'Malley got a gotcha question when asked if he could point to experience that would show he could handle complex international incidents like this .No governor of course would have this sort of experience so it was pointless to ask .Sanders struck me as a little more grounded .In discussing terrorism , he argued that climate change was fueling terrorism .This is true in Syria , where a long - term drought is likely a result of climate change and feeding instability there .Unquestionably as the climate changes there will be more instability and mass migrations , and the latter will feed the former .Sanders was also correct in his analysis that the Defense Department 's priorities were pretty screwed up , with most of it going to maintain an inefficient infrastructure designed to address 20 th century military problems , and comparatively little going to address terrorism itself .All candidates walked a fine line on immigration but unanimously agreed that Islam itself was not a problem , only those perverting it .There was none of the xenophobia against immigrants we saw in all the Republican debates so far .All want to make college more affordable but Clinton wants to make is so students and parents are stakeholders .This effectively meant that she does not want a wholly free college education for our students .No one addressed the larger issue : with so many failing schools , fewer students are graduating with the skills to tackle college .A holistic educational solution is needed .Charter schools are probably contributing to the problem , as profit - driven schools have no incentive to keep poorer performing students .Overall O'Malley did well , but not enough to make him look unique or to offer a compelling reason to vote for him over Clinton or Sanders .Democrats are blessed with seasoned debaters as candidates , so if there are no major gaffes , the dynamics are unlikely to change .In this sense these debates are n't particularly helpful for candidates gaining more popularity .I do n't expect much change in the polling in the weeks ahead .Did you watch Hillary Clinton 's testimony in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi on Thursday ?Okay , most us did not , at least we did not watch all eleven hours of it .This includes yours truly .I did watch clip after clip online and the more I watched the more engrossed I got .I realized that Clinton did a Benghazi on the committee .It was a kind of charmed and karmic experience that did exactly the opposite of what the committee intended .It made Clinton look good , human and demonstrated she had both great leadership qualities and a great legal brain .It also demonstrated that she is grounded .As for the members of the committee , at least the Republican ones , the longer it went on the more foolish they looked , as they became increasingly nitpicky .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.078926"}

{"text": "Identifying that meme and planting it early may be crucial to winning in November .In 2012 the winning meme was that Mitt Romney did n't understand ordinary working people .The surreptitious recordings that he thought 47 % of us were moochers made it stick like superglue .Due to Trump 's wealth and disdain for all sorts of groups , this can potentially work again .However , it will be harder because Trump is drawing many of these people .Trump is running a Fox News election by creating a theme and hammering it in relentlessly .You must have been asleep for the last six months not to know it : Make America Great Again .What could be Clinton 's meme ?Perhaps she could borrow portions of Trump 's theme .Here is my suggestion for an election meme for the Democratic candidate : Make America Whole Again .She could appeal to the disaffected by promising to be the president not to push a liberal agenda but to bring America together again .She could say that if elected she will champion the cause of moderates .She could promise to end gerrymandering , which simply removes moderates from the political process .For example , she could promise to pass a law that requires states to draw districts that are politically neutral and are overseen by impartial federal judges .She could run a campaign for the people , not just those with wealth .She could say that our current poisonous partisanship is a cancer on our society and our government , and that Trump is exploiting it .( In fairness , Bernie Sanders has been saying this throughout his campaign . )In fact , she could say that Trump embodies this cancer and is making it metastasize .Fortunately Trump has quite a record that would be easy to exploit , for example his statement earlier in the campaign that Americans were being paid too much and are n't working hard enough .This is laughable to anyone actually in the workforce today . \"Make America Whole Again \" is the perfect rejoinder to Trump 's slogan .It plays on his slogan but makes it positive and sounds like something your mother would say .It acknowledges that things have gotten seriously off track but that she is the right one to fix it .She could even say that as a woman and mother , she knows it is true .She can play on the lessons that she learned , from her failure by being too insular in her health care legislation that she championed as First Lady , to her work as Secretary of State to help bind the wounds of a complex world .She can recall the real America she grew up with , that was hopeful and where America 's leadership was earned and based on respect and our beneficence .Trump 's entire demeanor is disrespectful .It could be a campaign about restoring our respect by making our government representative of everyone .A campaign message of wholeness and integrity I think would have real legs , because it is authentic , not weaselly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.11532"}

Kennedy but he at least radiated sensibility .Unfortunately , his record as Maryland governor was spotted at best , as was his tenure as Mayor of Baltimore .He was easy to smile at when speaking , but he seemed a bit milquetoast .There just was n't anything there that drew you to him as a compelling reason to prefer him to the others .Jim Webb too was new to most viewers .A one - term senator from Virginia , Webb ran a surprisingly successful quixotic campaign for senate some years back .He resonates strongly with a part of the Democratic Party that has sort of slipped away : the moderate domestically but hawkish militarily type .I think Webb would probably be a pretty good general election candidate , as he may be the only moderate in either party running for president so he would draw independents like crazy .He has sterling credentials and a firm grasp on the commander in chief side of being president .Unfortunately , there is no party for moderates anymore .The Democratic Party though at least embraces moderates .The Republican Party simply spurns them .As the debate dragged on not only did it become the Hillary vs. Bernie debate but the choice seemed to be pragmatic progressive ( Clinton ) vs. ideological progressive ( Sanders ) .Clinton impressed me in the debate .She did not make me anxious to vote for her , but she did reduce my anxiety should she win the Democratic nomination .She deftly handled the mostly bogus controversies surrounding her , in one case with the assistance of Sanders .While Clinton was polished , Sanders was too .Eloquent and passionate , he seemed to be the only candidate on the stage that was just being himself .Most observers gave Clinton the edge in the debate , but Sanders raised two million dollars from people after the debate and Google was overrun with queries from people wanting to learn more about socialism .Sanders was not just passionate , but passionately convincing .His long career demonstrates an ability to correctly line up on the issues .So it should make for an interesting campaign and I look forward to more debates .Clinton proved herself not to be the stereotype projected by her opponents .Sanders doubtlessly got a lot of interest from people who did not know what he is about .Webb , O'Malley and Chafee are on the way out to pasture ; they just do n't know it yet .Clinton needs to keep her projection going forward and Sanders needs to see if he can develop a critical mass of progressives to overwhelm Clinton 's natural advantages , principally with blacks and women .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.41777"}
