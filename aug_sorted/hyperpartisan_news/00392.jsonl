{"text": "In fact , I believe the only sensible way to understand these issues is through a feminist critique of - you guessed it - patriarchy .Rape and rape - like behavior .Before wading into the reasons we need feminism , let 's consider a hypothetical : .A young man and woman are on a first date .The man decides early in the evening that he would like to have sexual intercourse and makes his attraction to her clear in conversation .He does not intend to force her to have sex , but he is assertive in a way that she interprets to mean that he \" wo n't take no for an answer .\" The woman does not want to have sex , but she is uncertain of how he will react if she rejects his advance .She does not tell him what she is thinking , out of fear of how he may react .The man accepts the offer of oral sex , and the evening ends without conflict .If that sex happened - and it 's an experience that women have described ( see Flirting with Danger by Lynn Phillips and the companion film ) - should we describe the encounter as consensual sex or rape ?In legal terms , this clearly is not rape .So , it 's consensual sex .No problem , right ?Consider some other potentially relevant factors : If a year before that situation , the woman had been raped while on a date , would that change our assessment ?If she had been sexually assaulted as a child and still , years later , goes into a survival mode when triggered ?If this were a college campus and the man was a well - known athlete , and she feared the system would protect him ?By legal standards , this still clearly is not rape .But by human standards , this does n't feel like fully consensual sex .Maybe we should recognize that both those assessments are reasonable .In short , rape is a definable crime that happens in a rape culture - once again , both things are true .What is patriarchy and why does it matter ?Patriarchy is a term rarely heard in mainstream conversation , especially since the backlash against feminism took off in the 1980s .So , let 's start with the late feminist historian Gerda Lerner 's definition of patriarchy as \" the manifestation and institutionalization of male dominance over women and children in the family and the extension of male dominance over women in the society in general .\" Patriarchy implies , she continued , \" that men hold power in all the important institutions of society and that women are deprived of access to such power .It does not imply that women are either totally powerless or totally deprived of rights , influence and resources .\" Feminism challenges acts of male dominance and analyzes the underlying patriarchal ideology that tries to make that dominance seem inevitable and immutable .Yes , men who rape seek a sense of power , but men also use their power to get sex from women , sometimes under conditions that are not legally defined as rape but involve varying levels of control and coercion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.18271"}

{"text": "I would advise that you look at the findings - some have been pointed out above .The CDC report finds that in a 12 month window the number of men and women subjected to Sexual Violence is basically equal .It is much harder to comment on a 12 months figure for children as the report could not be compiled from data obtained from children , due to ethics .Again I would advise most strongly reading the report itself - pages 17 to 18 are all that is required to see the issues .Grey - The reports demographic of people interviewed is 18 plus for legal reasons .They could not interview minors over the phone .It also provides Data For Life Time Prevalence of experience from birth - and does deal with \" Child Sexual Abuse \" - which is why the findings state for example . \" More than one - quarter of male victims of completed rape ( 27.8 % ) were first raped when they were 10 years old or younger ( data not shown ) .\" I 'm sure you will agree that at ten years of age or less The title of the study does nor agree with it 's own findings .Child Rape and Sexual Abuse is not about Intimacy or having a sexual partner - but ii is about Sexual Violence .Your post is a great example of how people Read What they want and not what is written .It 's is why the Term Rape Culture is actually Dangerous - it causes people to filter the subject of \" National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey 2010 \" and think \" I Know That Subject - I do n't need to read the report \" .That is the sort of thinking that allows people such as Sandusky to thrive !That mental Privilege of \" I Know \" and \" I do n't Need To Think \" is very dangerous .It allows people to state All Women Are in Fear Of Rape - a nice Stereotype - which is in fact false .You read a Title and dismiss 126 pages .Not very enlightened - in fact dangerous .Rapists probably are going to rape people no matter what .Even in cultures where women only leave the house wearing a tent rape still occurs .But that does n't mean that you need to put yourself in the firing line .Giving people information about how to keep safe is n't oppressive , its common sense .Drinking oneself into a stupor and wandering through a dangerous neighbourhood leaves one vulnerable to all kinds of crime .It does n't mean that the victims of such crime deserved it by behaving in that manner , but its still sensible to warn people to drink in moderation and not walk home through Ballymun ( or whatever the local hotspot is where you live . )No offence Justin , but the estimation is that one in 20 men has committed a rape or sexual assault .1 in 6 college aged men will admit to rape , as long as it 's not called rape in anonymous surveys .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.68608"}
{"text": "\" I never meant to insinuate that men perpetrate rape culture on their own .Absolutely not .I think rape culture can be a real thing , look at the superfree clubs in Japan , but mostly it is n't .Or if it is its nowhere near as widespread as depicted by authors such as Nikki .For comparison , lets compare rape culture to other crimes influence by culture and see how it stands up : .Drug Culture : Jenny B is with her new friends in college , three of them are smoking weed .One of them offers Jenny a joint .She accepts because all her friends are doing it .Gang Culture : David O is hanging out with his friends , two of them are in the same gang as his older brother .They encourage him to shoplift a bag of crisps from the shop across the road .He does so because he feels he has to in order to be accepted .Rape Culture : James C is hanging out with his friends .Two of them start making jokes about women .A woman wearing a miniskirt walks down the path .His friends begin raping her , he joins in because he looks up to them .Does that last example make any sense ?The first two make perfect sense because they are communal activities , drug - taking and petty crime is often something suggested by friends and exacerbated by peer pressure .Gang rape exists , but as far as I 'm aware its much much less common than rape involving a solo perpetrator .Given that fact , and the way men actually accused of rape are usually treated by other men its a little difficult to see where there 's room for this theory of all male culture being fundamentally rapacious .OK .First , I think the point keeps getting missed about what rape culture actually is .Rape culture is not the idea that \" oh , my friends are doing some raping , so I 'll join in \" .Rape culture is the idea that , if a woman is sexually assaulted , it 's her damn fault for X , Y , or Z reason .Rape culture is what makes woman I know blame themselves for being raped .Rape culture is also why NONE the women I know who have been sexually assaulted reported that assault .It would also be the reason men do n't speak out about their rapes , too - and why they are shamed for it instead .Rape culture exists in that forum .My point here is that I do n't think we come out and say \" men rape \" - but it 's in the things we do n't say , and the things we do n't talk about .It 's actually in the idea that all rape is committed by men on women .It 's in the idea that women wearing something or behaving some way actually caused a man to rape her - again , a rapist is always going to want to rape , but a man is never going to decide to rape due to something like that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.69005"}
