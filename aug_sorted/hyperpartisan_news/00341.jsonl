Card Jr.The two White House officials were attempting to persuade Attorney General John D. Ashcroft , who was recovering from emergency surgery to remove his gallbladder , to reauthorize a controversial warrantless domestic eavesdropping program .Comey , who was acting attorney general in Ashcroft 's absence , had refused to agree to extend the program .When he learned that the White House was attempting to go around him and get the ill Ashcroft to sign off on an extension , Comey rushed to George Washington University Medical Center , arriving just before Gonzales and Card .Comey explained to Ashcroft what was happening and , when the White House officials arrived , the attorney general raised himself up and said he never should have authorized the program .He gestured at Comey and said , \" There is the attorney general , \" according to an account by former Washington Post reporter Barton Gellman .The White House had narrowed the search in recent days to Comey and Lisa Monaco , a former assistant attorney general for national security who became Obama 's chief counterterrorism adviser this year .One law enforcement source said that a few weeks ago , the Justice Department sent both names to the White House for consideration .Monaco would have been the first woman to lead the FBI , but Comey comes with extensive law enforcement experience .He served as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan , and he was the managing assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the Richmond division of the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia .While in Richmond , he was credited with reducing the homicide rate by shifting gun prosecutions from state court to federal court , where the sentences were tougher .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.871326"}

Tuchfarber has looked at the December polls and has also demonstrated how little predictive value they have .In polls from November 2007 , taken two months before voting , Hillary Clinton was leading the Democratic race .Rudy Guiliani was leading the Republican race , with Fred Thompson also ahead of John McCain .In 2011 Herman Cain was leading the Republican race , and had left the race by the time of the Iowa caucuses .One reason for the poor predictive value of national polls is that whoever wins in Iowa and/or New Hampshire generally gets a huge boost in subsequent states .That does n't mean that the polls in Iowa are all that more meaningful as voters there typically do n't make up their minds until the last minute .Hillary Clinton was leading in the polls in Iowa and came in third place in 2008 .In late 2007 Mitt Romney was leading the polls in Iowa , and came in second to Mike Huckabee .Herman Cain was leading in Iowa as well as the national polls two months before the Iowa caucus .Polls also have limited predictive value as the pollsters do not know who will actually turn out to vote .If the Democratic caucus in Iowa is dominated by long time Democratic voters , then the polls are showing the race as very close .If those who have n't previously voted but are showing enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders turn out to vote , there could be a big victory for Sanders .The much stronger degree of support seen for Sanders in social media is very encouraging , but no guarantee of votes .It might also be helpful for Sanders that the Iowa caucuses are later this year than in the 2008 cycle , when many college students were off on vacation .Even more might turn out for Sanders in this year than had turned out for Obama .Similarly we will not know whether Donald Trump will easily win the nomination , or if a party regular will challenge him , until we see how the voters act .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.158356"}

{"text": "Marxism : The granddaddy of political philosophies on the left .The child of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels , it 's the philosophy that laid the ground work for socialism and communism .But what is it ?Much is this is laid out by Marx in Das Kapital , which is a fascinating read if you are so inclined .Marxism is on the far left of the traditional left / right political spectrum .Communism : The direct descendant of Marxism .Some of the more well - known communist states in the world are the Soviet Union ( and her satellites ) , the People 's Republic of China , Vietnam , North Korea , and Cuba .Communism calls for the means of production to be owned by the government , and there is no private property .In theory , it is the final evolution of Marxism and is the perfect classless society .In practice : Well , George Orwell said it best in Animal Farm .\" All animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others .\" Communism is on the far left of the traditional left / right political spectrum .Socialism : The middle step between capitalism and full - blown communism .The formal definition of socialism is a way of organizing a society in which major industries are owned and controlled by the government rather than by individual people and companies .So the important industries like healthcare , power , communications , transportation , and other industries are owned by the state , but there is private property .Socialism is on far left of the traditional left / right political spectrum .Democratic socialism : Social ownership of the means of production , but with a democratically elected government .The formal definition is a political ideology advocating a democratic political system alongside a socialist economic system , involving a combination of political democracy with social ownership of the means of production .The adjective \" democratic \" is often added to distinguish itself from the Marxist - Leninist brand of socialism , which is widely viewed as being non - democratic .We have many aspects of democratic socialism in the United States today : Public libraries , snow removal , trash pick - up , Medicare , fire protection , police protection , and Social Security are just a handful of examples .Democratic socialism is on the left of the traditional left / right political spectrum .National Socialism , aka the Nazis : This is not socialism no matter what anyone tells you .It is a fascist - based philosophy .The formal definition is the ideology and practice associated with the 20th century German Nazi Party and Nazi state , as well as other far - right groups .It 's usually characterized as a form of fascism that incorporates scientific racism and anti - Semitism .National Socialism is on the far right of the traditional left / right political spectrum .Islamofascism : Is this really even a thing ?Formally it is defined as an ideology promoted by some Islamists , the aims of which are to establish Islamic orthodoxy and to resist western secularism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "128.5867"}
