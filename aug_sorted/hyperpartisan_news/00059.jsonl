Joseph \" Jumpin ' Joe \" Swing , a former West Point classmate and veteran of the 101st Airborne , as the new INS commissioner .Influential politicians , including Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson ( D ) of Texas and Sen. Pat McCarran ( D ) of Nevada , favored open borders , and were dead set against strong border enforcement , Brownell said .But General Swing 's close connections to the president shielded him - and the Border Patrol - from meddling by powerful political and corporate interests .One of Swing 's first decisive acts was to transfer certain entrenched immigration officials out of the border area to other regions of the country where their political connections with people such as Senator Johnson would have no effect .Then on June 17 , 1954 , what was called \" Operation Wetback \" began .Because political resistance was lower in California and Arizona , the roundup of aliens began there .Some 750 agents swept northward through agricultural areas with a goal of 1,000 apprehensions a day .By the end of July , over 50,000 aliens were caught in the two states .Another 488,000 , fearing arrest , had fled the country .By mid - July , the crackdown extended northward into Utah , Nevada , and Idaho , and eastward to Texas .By September , 80,000 had been taken into custody in Texas , and an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 illegals had left the Lone Star State voluntarily .Unlike today , Mexicans caught in the roundup were not simply released at the border , where they could easily reenter the US .To discourage their return , Swing arranged for buses and trains to take many aliens deep within Mexico before being set free .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.50766"}

Nov. 5 An official from the National Action Party confirmed that a municipal presidential candidate 's campaign manager was abducted by a group of armed men in Tamaulipas state .A Baja California state police officer was shot to death outside his home in Mexicali by two men who approached him as he was entering his house .The bodies of two unidentified men who had been shot to death were found in shallow graves in Durango state .Police believe they are two men who were abducted Sept. 27 .

Rolando Eugenio Hidalgo Eddy , local media reported .A firefight in Monterrey , Nuevo Leon state , left two federal agents dead and two wounded .The agents reportedly were attempting to flee from two vehicles that were following them , but were cornered in a gas station where a 20-minute gunbattle ensued .Three high - ranking police commanders from Baja California and Baja California Sur states were arrested by agents of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives in Phoenix for illegally purchasing weapons at a gun show several days before , U.S. officials announced .The public security director for the state of San Luis Potosi was shot dead by gunmen as he was driving his vehicle .His wife and son , who also were in the vehicle , were unharmed in the attack , in which gunmen fired more than 40 rounds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.628845"}

{"text": "In addition to the problem of the notoriously corrupt Mexican customs officials , efforts to stem the flow of guns into Mexico also have been hampered by technological limitations .For example , until recently , Mexican authorities lacked X - ray equipment to inspect vehicles entering the country , and this inspection capacity still remains limited .The cartels also obtain weapons from contacts along their supply networks in South and Central America , where substantial quantities of military ordnance have been shipped over decades to supply insurgencies and counterinsurgencies .Explosives from domestic Mexican sources also are widely available and are generally less expensive than guns .Aside from the cartels , other criminal syndicates are dedicated to the arms trade .These groups can range from small mom - and - pop operations involving a few individuals who obtain weapons from family members residing in the United States or Central America to large organizations with complex networks that buy dozens or hundreds of weapons at a time .As in other criminal enterprises in Mexico , such as drug smuggling or kidnapping , it is not unusual to find police officers and military personnel involved in the illegal arms trade .On Sept. 12 , three high - ranking police commanders from Baja California and Baja California Sur states were arrested by U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms ( ATF ) agents in Phoenix for illegally purchasing weapons at a gun show .( U.S. law prohibits foreigners from buying weapons . )Over the past few years , several Mexican government officials have been arrested on both sides of the border for participating in the arms trade .Although it is illegal for Mexican nationals to buy guns in the United States and for Americans to haul guns to Mexico , entrepreneurs have found a variety of ways to skirt such laws .Perhaps one of the least recognized ploys is plain old document fraud .Fake documents -- which are easily obtained along the border -- range in quality ( and price ) from poorly rendered counterfeits to genuine documents obtained with the assistance of corrupt government officials .Using such documents , a Mexican citizen can pose as a U.S. citizen and pass the required background checks to buy guns -- unless , that is , the prospective gun buyer was foolish enough to assume the identity of an American with a criminal record .Perhaps the most common way to purchase guns is by using a \" straw - man \" buyer ( sometimes in combination with document fraud ) .That is , paying a person with a clean record who has legal standing to buy the gun .This also is a tried - and - true tactic used by criminals in the United States who are ineligible to purchase guns due to prior convictions .The \" straw man \" in these cases often is a girlfriend or other associate who is paid to buy a gun for them .Also , with so many family relations spanning the border , it is easy for a Mexican citizen to ask an American relative to purchase a gun or guns on their behalf .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.782196"}
{"text": "The attack , which Mexican authorities say was an act of sabotage , comes two months after the guerrilla group Popular Revolutionary Army ( EPR ) claimed responsibility for a similar attack against Pemex pipelines in Queretaro state near Mexico City and in Guanajuato state .In that statement , the group demanded the release of two of its members from prison .One of the lines attacked in July , the one running from Mexico City to Guadalajara , also was struck in the most recent attack .In August , the group planted two bombs in the southern Mexican city of Oaxaca .One device , planted at a Sears store , detonated in the early morning hours , while the other , placed at a Banamex bank branch , did not explode .EPR , whose core membership is made up mostly of peasants , historically has expressed its anger at the Mexican government by shooting or vandalizing government facilities in the more rural areas of southern Mexico .Occasionally EPR has joined loosely with other leftist groups to plant small improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) in Mexico City for the purpose of making political statements .Until the summer , however , staging multiple strikes against pipelines seemed beyond the capability of rural farmers .It appears likely , then , that these attacks are being led by a fairly experienced bombmaker , perhaps an educated Marxist who has associated himself with the group .One indication of this is the lack of reports that unexploded IEDs have been found on the pipelines .Moreover , the attackers have avoided detection and have left authorities no clues .These latest bombings strongly suggest that the EPR -- or at least one of its cells -- has evolved , is expanding its target set and is increasing its operational tempo .This bombmaker likely has the ability to construct IEDs that are more powerful than the devices commonly used by the group .At this time , however , the cell appears to be committed to limiting human casualties .Pemex increased security at its facilities after the July attacks , but pipelines are generally difficult to secure completely .In addition , the attackers can benefit from the violence occurring in Mexico as a result of the government crackdown on the drug cartels .Mexican security services already have their hands full with the daily cartel violence .As young Mexicans have poured across the southern U.S. border in recent years , looking for work , a common American refrain has been to blame Mexican economic policy .Even many of us who welcome the new labor for the U.S. economy have also noted that the Mexican government 's failure to deepen the economic restructuring begun some 20 years ago has spurred migration , imposing a heavy burden on Mexican society .This reality has not been lost on President Felipe Calder\u00f3n .He campaigned in the lead - up to last year 's election on a platform that emphasized jobs , promising to deliver the policy changes that would bring them about .Unfortunately , Mr. Calder\u00f3n 's National Action Party ( PAN ) is only a minority in Congress , and judging by the \" reforms \" passed there last week , his vision of a modernized Mexico is still a long way off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.94385"}

{"text": "For American farmers , the answer has been to keep importing workers - which has now made the farmers more vulnerable to foreign competition , since even minimum - wage immigrant workers ca n't compete with produce picked on farms in China , Chile , or Turkey and shipped here cheaply .A flood of low - priced Turkish raisins several years ago produced a glut in the United States that sharply drove down prices and knocked some farms out of business , shrinking total acreage in California devoted to the crop by one - fifth , or some 50,000 acres .The farms that survived are now moving to mechanize swiftly , realizing that no amount of cheap immigrant labor will make them competitive .As foreign competition and mechanization shrink manufacturing and farmworker jobs , low - skilled immigrants are likely to wind up farther on the margins of our economy , where many already operate .For example , although only about 12 percent of construction workers are foreign - born , 100,000 to 300,000 illegal immigrants have carved a place for themselves as temporary workers on the fringes of the industry .In urban areas like New York and Los Angeles , these mostly male illegal immigrants gather on street corners , in empty lots , or in Home Depot parking lots to sell their labor by the hour or the day , for $ 7 to $ 11 an hour .That 's far below what full - time construction workers earn , and for good reason .Unlike the previous generations of immigrants who built America 's railroads or great infrastructure projects like New York 's bridges and tunnels , these day laborers mostly do home - improvement projects .A New York study , for instance , found that four in ten employers who hire day laborers are private homeowners or renters wanting help with cleanup chores , moving , or landscaping .Another 56 percent were contractors , mostly small , nonunion shops , some owned by immigrants themselves , doing short - term , mostly residential work .Because so much of our legal and illegal immigrant labor is concentrated in such fringe , low - wage employment , its overall impact on our economy is extremely small .A 1997 National Academy of Sciences study estimated that immigration 's net benefit to the American economy raises the average income of the native - born by only some $ 10 billion a year - about $ 120 per household .And that meager contribution is not the result of immigrants helping to build our essential industries or making us more competitive globally but instead merely delivering our pizzas and cutting our grass .Estimates by pro - immigration forces that foreign workers contribute much more to the economy , boosting annual gross domestic product by hundreds of billions of dollars , generally just tally what immigrants earn here , while ignoring the offsetting effect they have on the wages of native - born workers .If the benefits of the current generation of migrants are small , the costs are large and growing because of America 's vast range of social programs and the wide advocacy network that strives to hook low - earning legal and illegal immigrants into these programs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.58258"}

Breyer , Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg .Justice Anthony Kennedy , who had been anticipated as the \" swing vote \" on the court , sided with justices Samuel A. Alito , Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia in their own thoroughly right - wing dissent .While upholding the health care reform , the ruling was based on arguments that will serve to undermine corporate regulations and social programs .In particular , Justice Roberts joined with the other right - wing justices in rejecting the administration 's argument that the law was constitutional on the basis of the government 's ability to regulate commerce ( the Commerce Clause of the Constitution ) .Instead , he based the ruling on the government 's authority to use its taxation powers ( likening the penalty for those who do not purchase insurance to an additional tax ) .This ruling is highly significant because , beginning in the New Deal era of the 1930s and 1940s , Supreme Court decisions used the Commerce Clause to support the authority to prohibit child labor , regulate corporations and justify social reforms .For the past 15 years the Supreme Court has worked to set limits on the scope of this clause when it comes to social issues .The one provision of the health care law that the court rejected was the only measure relating to the expansion of government programs for health insurance .Under terms of the act , Medicaid , which is jointly administered by the states and federal government , would be expanded to cover all individuals under the age of 65 with incomes at 133 percent of the poverty level or less .The move would account for some 11 million newly insured individuals - who will receive the bare - bones care provided by Medicaid .According to the legislation , the federal government would provide 100 percent of the funds to cover this expansion of Medicaid up to 2016 , gradually decreasing to 90 percent thereafter .As the bill was written , if a state did not implement this expansion , the federal government could withhold all of its funding for Medicaid to that state .The high court rejected this in the strongest terms , writing , \" In this case , the financial ' inducement ' Congress has chosen is much more than ' relatively mild encouragement'-it is a gun to the head .\" Roberts goes on to state , \" The original program was designed to cover medical services for four particular categories of the needy : the disabled , the blind , the elderly , and needy families with dependent children .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.89401"}
