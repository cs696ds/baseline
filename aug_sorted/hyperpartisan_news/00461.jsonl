At the same time , the FBI conducted criminal investigations of the murder of civil rights workers , inclduing the 1964 slayings of voting registration workers Michael Schwerner , Andrew Goodman and James Chaney in Mississippi .Most of Hoover 's FBI clandestine activities were not revealed until after the director 's death in 1972 , after 47 years in power .His immediate successor was acting Director L. Patrick Gray , whose time in charge was cut short by the Watergate scandal .The FBI was charged with investigating the break - in of the Watergate Hotel and attempted spying of the Democratic Party by Republican operatives .Suspicions circulated around Washington as to Gray 's role in the conspiracy , which damaged his effectiveness in leading the bureau ( Gray was never indicted on any charges ) .He was replaced in April 1973 by another acting Director , William Ruckleshaus , a former Congressman and the first head of the Environmental Protection Agency .Ruckleshaus was merely a stop - gap measure until Clarence Kelley was appointed in July 1973 .Kelley , a former Kansas City Police Chief and twenty - year FBI agent , wound up serving five years as the head of the FBI , during which time he had the task of refurbishing the bureau 's tarnished reputation .In 1978 , William Webster took over the helm of the FBI during the administration of President Jimmy Carter .The Webster era at the FBI was marked by a series of high profile law enforcement campaigns that helped people forget about the bureau 's dark days .A rise in international terrorism led to the FBI taking on a larger role in counterterrorism efforts and investigating attacks and hostage - taking incidents involving U.S. citizens .Espionage cases also became big media stories with the FBI helping to capture spies such as former Navy officer John Walker and former National Security Agency employee William Pelton .Another expansion of FBI duties occurred with the Reagan administration 's War on Drugs .Webster strengthened the FBI 's response to white - collar crimes , especially cases of public corruption involving politicians .FBI agents investigated members of Congress ( ABSCAM ) , the judiciary ( GREYLORD ) and state legislatures in California and South Carolina .The FBI also uncovered instances of fraud that lay behind many of the savings and loans failures of the 1980s .In 1984 , the FBI acted as lead agency for security of the Los Angeles Olympics .In preparing for the Olympics , the bureau established the Hostage Rescue Team ( HRT ) , a special force designed to handle the kind of tragic events that marred the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.74494"}

At the same time , the FBI conducted criminal investigations of the murder of civil rights workers , inclduing the 1964 slayings of voting registration workers Michael Schwerner , Andrew Goodman and James Chaney in Mississippi .Most of Hoover 's FBI clandestine activities were not revealed until after the director 's death in 1972 , after 47 years in power .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.8013"}

{"text": "He should have been prepared for a question based upon the recent Meet the Press interview .I recently discussed why the Democratic Socialist label is not hurting Bernie Sanders .Despite the labels he prefers , Sanders seeks to reform capitalism , not eliminate it .It is notable that he did point out his support for small and medium sized business : .SANDERS : I think everybody is in agreement that we are a great entrepreneurial nation .We have got to encourage that .Of course , we have to support small and medium - sized businesses .But you can have all of the growth that you want and it does n't mean anything if all of the new income and wealth is going to the top 1 percent .So what we need to do is support small and medium - sized businesses , the backbone of our economy , but we have to make sure that every family in this country gets a fair shake ... .Sanders could have also done a better job on guns , but he did note his D- lifetime rating from the NRA ( with Sanders also receiving an F at least once ) .Let 's begin , Anderson , by understanding that Bernie Sanders has a D - minus voting rating ( ph ) from the NRA .And over the years , I have strongly avoided instant background checks , doing away with this terrible gun show loophole .And I think we 've got to move aggressively at the federal level in dealing with the straw man purchasers .I believe that everybody in this country who has a mental crisis has got to get mental health counseling immediately .Sanders was more prepared for the questions about Black Lives Matter .Note that Sanders repeated the phrase , but Clinton did not .Sanders wins a point over Clinton in his support for expanding Social Security .In contrast to the Republicans , it was good to see a political party which faced reality on climate change , but there are also aspects of Clinton 's environmental record which could have been challenged .Sanders was right in arguing that war should only be considered as a last resort .Clinton was unable to defend her mistakes on Libya or Syria , but her opponents could also have done a better job of criticizing her on these .Perhaps it would have been different if Joe Biden was there , considering how he spent four years opposing Clinton 's hawkish views .Sanders was also far better than Clinton when discussing civil liberties , including his opposition to NSA surveillance , and marijuana laws , including opposition to the drug war .Despite calling himself a Democratic Socialist , in many ways Sanders is the most libertarian candidate running from either party ( at least for us left - libertarians who concentrate on civil liberties as opposed to greater freedom for giant corporations ) .Clinton was right in saying that the economy does better when a Democrat is in office .It was clear that any of the participants in last night 's debate would have been better than the Republicans running .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.046295"}
{"text": "This is the biggest public display of support for the Muslim American community - cited by White House aides as a response to the anti - refugee and anti - Muslim rhetoric on the campaign trail from Republicans like Donald Trump .Obama reminded the audience that political opponents of Thomas Jefferson accused him of being a Muslim . \"So I was not the first , \" he said lightly as the audience laughed .\" It 's true .Look it up .I 'm in good company .\" Obama pointed out that the founding fathers also supported the religion of Islam . \"Jefferson and John Adams had their own copies of the Koran , \" he said .\" Benjamin Franklin wrote , that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach to us , he would find a pulpit at his service . \"He also recalled the history of mosques in America - pointing out that the oldest surviving mosque was in Iowa and that the first American mosque was built in North Dakota .Obama also urged Christians to defend Muslim - Americans when their religion was under attack .\" If we 're serious about freedom of religion - and I 'm speaking now to my fellow Christians , who remain the majority in this country - we have to understand , an attack on one faith is an attack on all our faiths , \" he said .He demanded that Americans stop profiling Muslims and treating them differently because of their faith - criticizing political rhetoric for inflaming hatred against the Muslim community .\" We have to reject a politics that seeks to manipulate prejudice or bias and targets people because of religion , \" he said .He specifically addressed young Muslim Americans , urging them not to grow cynical .\" Let me say it as clearly as I can , as President of the United States , you fit in here .Right here .You 're right where you belong .You 're part of America too , \" he said .According to photos on Twitter of the speech , the audience in the mosque was segregated - men in one section and women in a special balcony .As Obama concluded his speech , he said , \" May God 's peace be upon you and God Bless the United States of America .\" That American democracy would allow even one vote to be decided by a coin toss seems bizarre - but somehow the outcome of six separate Iowa Caucus precinct elections were decided by the flip of a coin Monday .And Hillary Clinton won them all .Precincts in Des Moines , Newton , West Branch , Davenport and Ames were decided by coin tosses , according to Reuters , and became crucial parts of Clinton 's Monday night win .Democratic Party counts show Clinton ultimately winning the Iowa Caucus by just four delegates .If you 're still scratching your head over how this could happen , the Iowa Democratic Party sort of explains : On the night of the caucus , Iowans vote for their favorite candidate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.35007"}

{"text": "The controversial liberal mayor has spent millions of dollars promoting gun control , and has proposed many nanny state provisions in New York City , such as banning sodas over 16 ounces , reducing sodium levels in food , banning trans - fats , and even to ban loud headphones .This is how Iranian President Hassan Rouhani describes the diplomatic swindle , known as the \" Iran nuclear deal .\" The Koranic term ( in Arabic Fatah al - Mobin ) refers to one of Prophet Mohammed 's successful guerrilla raids on a Meccan caravan in the early days of Islam .Rouhani claims the \" deal \" represents \" the greatest diplomatic victory in Islamic history . \"Leaving aside the hyperbole , a fixture of the mullahs ' rhetorical arsenal , Rouhani has reason to crow .If not quite moribund as some analysts claim , the Islamic Republic had been in a rough patch for years .For more than a year , the government was unable to pay some of the 5.2 million public sector employees , notably teachers , petrochemical workers and students on bursaries , triggering numerous strikes .Deprived of urgently needed investment , the Iranian oil industry was pushed to the edge with its biggest oil fields , notably Bibi Hakimeh and Maroun , producing less than half their capacity .Between 2012 and 2015 , Iran lost 25 % of its share in the global oil market .Sanctions and lack of investment also meant that large chunks of Iranian industry , dependent on imported parts , went under .In 2015 Iran lost an average of 1,000 jobs a day .Last month , the nation 's currency , the rial , fell to an all - time record low while negative economic growth was forecast for the third consecutive year .Having increased the military budget by 21 % , Rouhani was forced to delay presentation of his new budget for the Iranian New Year starting March 21 .Against that background that Obama rode to the rescue by pushing through a \" deal \" designed to ease pressure on Iran in exchange for nothing but verbal promises from Tehran .Here is some of what Obama did : .As head of Iranian Atomic Energy Agency Ali Akbar Salehi has said : \" Our nuclear project remains intact .The ' deal ' does not prevent us from doing what we were doing .\" The cash enabled Rouhani to start paying some unpaid salaries in Iran while financing Hezbollah branches and helping the Assad regime in Syria .Some cite Obama 's alleged belief that the US has been an \" imperialist power , \" bullying weaker nations and must make amends .Others suggest a tactic to strengthen \" moderates \" within the Iranian regime who , if assured that the US does into seek regime change might lead the nation towards a change of behavior .Whatever the reasons , what Obama has done could best described as appeasement - plus .In classical appeasement you promise an adversary not to oppose some of his moves , for example the annexation of Czechoslovakia , but you do not offer him actual financial or diplomatic support .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.18251"}
{"text": "Like many security people , my favorite SciFi TV show is Battlestar Galactica because it outlines a very realistic scenario that can come about with too much networking and technological reliance and too little back up and off - line capability .In the infosecurity world , we 've heard for years about the idea of \" hackback \" , basically an offensive response to an offensive action .Every couple of years this idea comes back around as someone gets frustrated with feeling like the attackers have all the advantages ( and fun ) and wants to take the fight back to them .It 's an understandable idea .And , in some measured cases may even make sense .But as a blanket rule , no it 's not a good idea .This latest development shows that \" hackback \" does n't need to be contained to computer tactics : a physical or kinetic response is just as ( if not more ) effective .The bigger story though is how this shows that the idea of \" infosecurity \" is more and more an empty concept and that it 's all just \" security \" .Premera Blue Cross today just announced a major data breach affecting 11 million people in Washington , Oregon and Alaska .It also affects other Blue Cross members that got treatments at their facilities .Was classified material sent or received by Secretary Clinton on this email address ?No .A separate , closed system was used by the Department for the sole purpose of handling classified communications which was designed to prevent such information from being transmitted anywhere other than within that system , including to outside email accounts .How did Secretary Clinton receive and consume classified information ?The Secretary 's office is located in a secure area .Classified information was viewed in hard copy by the Secretary while in the office .While on travel , the Department had rigorous protocols for her and traveling staff to receive and transmit information of all types .Where was the server for her email located ?The server for her email was physically located on her property , which is protected by U.S. Secret Service .What level of encryption was employed ?Who was the service provider , etc ?The security and integrity of her family 's electronic communications was taken seriously from the onset when it was first set up for President Clinton 's team .While the curiosity in the specifics of this set up is understandable , given what people with ill - intentions can do with such information in this day and age , there are concerns about broadcasting specific technical details about past and current practices .However , suffice it to say , robust protections were put in place and additional upgrades and techniques employed over time as they became available , including consulting and employing third party experts .Was the server ever hacked ?No , there is no evidence there was ever a breach .Was there ever an unauthorized intrusion into her email or did anyone else have access to it ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.11452"}
