Murphy ( Pa. ) and Harry E. Mitchell ( Ariz. ) and Sen. Jon Tester ( Mont. ) .These campaigns had field plans that included young people , utilized new media outreach to broadcast their message , and partnered with youth groups that had experience in turning out young voters .And , as those campaigns testify , that increased voter turnout among young people was the margin in their victories .While capturing the youth vote is not easy , it is doable if candidates target young voters , listen to them , talk with them about issues they care about and treat them like any other constituency group they are trying to secure to help them win .When campaigns treat young people as voters in both messaging and outreach , young people reward their effort with their time , money and votes .Jane Fleming Kleeb is executive director of the Young Voter PAC , which helps Democratic candidates and state parties win with the 18-to-35-year - old vote through endorsements , on - the - ground support , training , strategy and money .She is a regular on Fox and MSNBC .One of the few social issues where agreement crosses party lines is the unpopularity of undocumented immigrants .Laura S.

Barry Goldwater , who ran for President against Johnson in 1964 , ignore the fact that Goldwater wanted to force the Democrats in the South to stop passing discriminatory laws and thus end the need to continuously enact federal civil rights legislation .Those who wrongly criticize Goldwater also ignore the fact that Johnson , in his 4,500 State of the Union Address delivered on Jan. 4 , 1965 , mentioned scores of topics for federal action , but only 35 words were devoted to civil rights .He did not mention one word about voting rights .Then in 1967 , showing his anger with Dr. King 's protest against the Vietnam War , Johnson referred to Dr. King as \" that Nigger preacher . \"Contrary to the false assertions by Democrats , the racist \" Dixiecrats \" did not all migrate to the Republican Party . \"Dixiecrats \" declared that they would rather vote for a \" yellow dog \" than vote for a Republican because the Republican Party was know as the party for blacks .Today , some of those \" Dixiecrats \" continue their political careers as Democrats , including Robert Byrd , who is well known for having been a \" Keagle \" in the Ku Klux Klan .Another former \" Dixiecrat \" is former Democrat Sen.

W. Bush is bashed for using Willie Horton against Dukakis during the general election .Inner - city minister , Rev. Wayne Perryman , wrote a book , Unfounded Loyalty , based on his five years of research and sued the Democratic Party , demanding an apology for their 150-year history of racism based on the Democratic Party ' States Rights claims .The Democrats admitted their racist past under oath in court , but refused to apologize because they know that they can take the black vote for granted .Today , the failed socialist policies of the Democrats ( who have been running our inner - cities for the past 30 - 40 years ) have turned our inner cities into economic and social wastelands .In an effort to keep blacks poor , angry and voting for Democrats , Democrats are fighting every effort of the Republicans to help blacks out of poverty .Democrats opposed welfare reform in the 1990 's , then blocked extension of federal welfare reform in April 2004 .Democrats are opposed to school choice opportunity scholarships that would help black children get out of failing schools .Democrats are opposed to Social Security reform even though blacks on average lose $ 10,000 in the system because blacks on average have a five - year shorter life expectancy than whites .Democrats are crying loudly for an increase in the minimum wage , yet the Democrats , using bogus excuses , blocked the minimum wage bill passed by House Republicans in 2006 .Democrats are more interested in keeping the minimum issue alive as a political hammer than they are in making life better for poor black people .DEMOCRAT - CONTROLLED CONGRESS SNUBS BLACK DEMOCRAT CONGRESSMAN Democrats in control of Congress showed their utter disdain for black Americans when they refused to establish a Reparations Commission and hold hearings as requested by black Democrat Congressman John Conyers of Michigan .In 1989 , Conyers first introduced the H.R. 40 bill , Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act .He has introduced that bill in every Congress since 1989 and has vowed to continue fighting until the bill is passed .So , why are Democratic Party leaders in control of Congress turning their backs on Conyers , their fellow Democrat ?The answer is simple .A Reparations Commission and hearings would expose the 200-year history of horrendous racism against black Americans by the Democratic Party .We have a prime example in North Carolina .As a result of the1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission Report of May 31 , 2006 , the North Carolina Democratic Executive Committee , composed of over 700 party leaders and activists from 100 counties , issued a unanimous and historic apology on January 20 , 2007 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.49952"}
{"text": "Given this , the argument looks like little more than semantic quibbling over the meaning of the word \" universal , \" all too typical of Clinton 's struggle to contest Obama 's unexpected rivalry for the nomination .But the mainstream news media have it wrong .There is , in fact , a vitally important difference between the two positions , though one that their worldview makes them ill equipped to recognize .The difference is that Clinton would compel everyone to purchase health insurance ; Obama would not .The standard label for this difference in health policy debates is \" mandate , \" for what Clinton wants .Clinton has been evasive about exactly how she would compel the purchase of insurance - which is not surprising , as talking about punishing voters is not a good selling point in an election .The state of Massachusetts , which has a mandate , imposes fines on adults who do not have health insurance .Clinton has not talked about fines , but has suggested garnishing wages or making enrollment compulsory on admission to any hospital .Of course , Clinton promises to make health insurance affordable to everyone , through subsidies and through massive new regulation of the insurance industry .So does Obama .But what if their plans do not work out ?Under Obama 's plan , adults who thought even subsidized health insurance cost more than they could pay would remain uninsured , and at least be no worse off .Under Clinton 's plan , they would be forced to sign up , or penalized for not doing so - and either way they would be hurt .Obama , in fact , has fairly clearly called attention to this difference .For libertarians , of course , which plan is less bad is a fairly straightforward question : the one that allows a measure of free choice is a lesser evil than the one based on coercive social engineering .And a non - trivial part of the electorate may feel the same way ; where hard - core Democrats often favour Clinton 's views , independent voters are reported as less supportive of mandates .But there are hard questions about mandates even from the perspective of the Democratic Party itself .On one hand , people between fifty and sixty - five ( where Medicare comes into effect ) consume substantially more health services than younger people .Younger people are more likely to decide their low health risks do not justify paying for insurance .So forced enrolment would compel many younger people to pay for insurance they would not purchase voluntarily - but the benefit of enlarging the pool and lowering insurance costs would go disproportionately to older people .And on the other hand , those same older people are much more likely to own houses , to have savings and investments , and in general to be able to afford health care .So what Clinton is proposing is a regressive redistribution of wealth , from the worse off to the better off .It is hard to see how this makes sense within the publicly announced ideology of the Democratic Party .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.788864"}
