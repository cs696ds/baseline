{"text": "The formal announcement is expected to come as early as Monday .Fox declined comment .Specifics of the reorg plan are still murky but the discussions have been under way for several weeks .Reilly announced his plan to step down in May after seven years of overseeing Fox programming .The decision to bring the network and studio under the management of Walden and Newman was a logical move on the part of Fox Networks Group CEO Peter Rice and 21st Century Fox chief operating officer Chase Carey at a time when the network is in rebuilding mode .Walden and Newman have headed 20th TV for the past 15 years , expanding the studio 's operations as a supplier of primetime shows to networks and cable outlets .Walden in particular has long been seen as a contender to eventually take on programming responsibilities for the sibling broadcast network .Bringing the network and TV studio under the same management hierarchy is a return to the 1999 - 2003 period when Sandy Grushow held a similar post .A number of names floated around in the wake of Reilly 's announcement of his decision to step down .But sources said Fox brass were largely focused on internal candidates for his successor from the start .John Landgraf , head of FX Networks , was also seen as being part of a restructuring scenario that could have brought Fox Broadcasting under his group .But the marriage of the network and 20th TV makes strategic sense as the studio produces a majority of the network 's programming , including last season 's promising fantasy drama \" Sleepy Hollow .\"Fox .Fox have a bad reputation : they are known as chicken - killers and bird - robbers .That is why they have been hunted and chased away for a long time .They eat whatever they can get hold of , from rabbits to dead animals to rubbish from garbage containers .They will also eat berries and fruit .When there is more food than they can eat , a part of the spoils will be buried or hidden .The only Dutch Wadden Island where fox live is on Vlieland .On Texel .In 2010 , a dead fox was found on the side of a road .It appeared to have been hit by a vehicle .However , x - rays of the body showed numerous pieces of lead shot .So the animal had been killed by a rifle and not by a car .In addition , remnants of dung beetles that are only found in southern and eastern Netherlands were found in its stomach .Therefore , it is more likely that someone brought the fox to Texel as a joke .In the meantime , the fox has been stuffed ; both the fox and x - ray photos can be seen in the exposition in Ecomare .Since 1968 , fox have returned to the dunes .They were exterminated in the Middle Ages because it was seen as protection for the upcoming rabbit breeding .For four hundred years , the fox was unable to build up a population in the dunes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.955185"}
