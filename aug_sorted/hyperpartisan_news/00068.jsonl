{"text": "The reason why this type of racist abuse has been allowed to grow is the ever more paralysing effect political correctness and its component multiculturalism has on British society .The most grotesque example of the mentality I can think of is the case of a young white girl Rhea Page who was attacked by four Somali girls whilst walking with her boyfriend .What will happen now ?It is just possible that this is happening already without any conscious decision being made to do so by those with power .Secular ideologies never stand the test of time if they become the elite ideology .Marxism is the classic example , both because of the scope of its ostensible implementation and the length of time it existed , or arguably still exists in the case of China and North Korea .Such ideologies fail because they never accord with reality .They may have some truths but all seriously clash with what is .This means that those dependent on the ideology have to revise either the reality to accord better with reality or tell lies to cover the gap between the ideology and reality .Ideologies are also revised to fit the ambitions of individuals and the circumstances of particular societies .These often further remove the ideology from reality .The first great Marxist revision was the denial by Lenin that the proletarian revolution could only take place when a large degree of industrialisation had created an industrial proletariat .The second great revision was Stalin 's acceptance that \" socialism in one country \" had to replace the internationalist credo of Marx for at least a period of time .To those breaches in Marx 's system was added the ever growing corruption of the Soviet elite and the demoralisation of the people .The upshot was that Soviet propaganda became ever more absurd as the reality of Soviet life jarred ever more with fictitious official reports of soaring harvests and industrial production .This growing discord between what Soviet citizens experienced and what they were told was happening was an important agent in the fall of the Soviet Union .Political correctness is divorced from reality more emphatically than any other dominant secular ideology of the past century .Marxism , even in its revised Leninist and Stalinist forms , at least appealed to a widespread human desire for equality of material condition and social status , or at least a desire for no great inequality .Even at its most pure political correctness asks human beings to deny vitally important natural human behaviours by pretending that no distinction can be meaningfully or morally be made between races , ethnicities , cultures , religions , sexes or sexual behaviours .It seeks to treat all members of homo sapiens as interchangeable , sees the continuing idea of nations as pernicious and insists that no element of the universal and natural human trait of tribalism be countenanced .The pure version of political correctness would be very damaging and seriously divorced from reality .But the version of political correctness that actually exists is not pure and is a political recipe for widespread political unrest .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.43849"}

{"text": "Bill and Hillary Clinton : The White House Years .Introduction of For Love of Politics .One evening in the winter of 1998 , Bill and Hillary Clinton invited a small group of friends to watch a movie in the theater at the White House .Since the beginning of the Clinton presidency , invitations to these evenings had become badges of status , and they promised an opportunity to spend informal time with the First Couple .Everyone gathered outside the luxurious screening room in the East Wing , grabbed some soda and popcorn , and then found places amid the rows of 51 beige upholstered seats .Typically , the Clintons showed films that were about to open in theaters , making guests feel like insiders .But on this night , the film was a three - year - old comedy , Something to Talk About , starring Julia Roberts , Dennis Quaid , and Kyra Sedgwick .The President and First Lady sat in two of the four large armchairs in the front row , and the guests settled themselves for a welcome respite from weeks of headlines about the President 's involvement with Monica Lewinsky , a twenty - four - year - old White House intern .Five days after the story had broken on January 21 , Bill Clinton had stood before television cameras , wagged his finger , and emphatically denied having had sexual relations with \" that woman , Miss Lewinsky . \"The next day , Hillary had blamed the accusations on a \" vast right - wing conspiracy \" of enemies .Since then , both Clintons had resolutely gone about their business and maintained silence on the subject , even as lurid and specific details of the Lewinsky story emerged in the press .The movie screening came as the Clintons socially \" resurfaced following the Monica revelation , \" recalled Mary Mel French , the Chief of Protocol , one of the guests that evening .But the plot took an ominous turn when Grace and Caroline drove through town and saw Eddie outside his office building , kissing a beautiful blonde and walking away with her , arm in arm .Observing her mother 's fury , Caroline asked , \" Is Daddy in trouble ? \" \" Big trouble , \" said Grace .\" You marry a guy whose nickname in college was Hound Dog , \" said Grace 's sister , Emma Rae ( Sedgwick ) , \" what did you think was going to happen ? \"In the inevitable confrontation the next day , Emma Rae kneed Eddie in the groin and called him a \" lying sack of shit , \" while Grace told him , \" You do n't know how it feels to be made a big , fat fool of .\" Grace 's revenge , from a recipe invented by her eccentric Aunt Rae , was a dinner of salmon with mint mustard sauce laced with emetics .\" It 's not lethal , \" explained Aunt Rae .\" It will , however , make him sick as the dog that he is ....", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.384575"}
{"text": "Amritsar ( Punjab ) : A day after UKs ' former home secretary Jack Straw blamed some Pakistani Muslim men for targeting \" vulnerable \" White girls sexually , UK 's Hindu and Sikh organizations also publicly accused Muslim groups of the same offence .Feeling emboldened by Straw 's statement , UK 's Hindu and Sikh organizations have also come in open and accused some Pakistani men of specifically targeting Hindu and Sikh girls .\" This has been a serious concern for the last decade , \" said Hardeep Singh of Network of Sikh Organizations ( NSO ) while talking to TOI on Monday .Sikhs and Hindus are annoyed that Straw had shown concern for White girls and not the Hindu and the Sikh teenage girls who have been coaxed by some Pakistani men for sex and religious conversion .Straw does other communities a disservice by suggesting that only white girls were targets of this predatory behaviour .We raised the issue of our girls with the previous government and the police on several occasions over the last decade .This phenomenon has been there because a minority of Islamic extremists view all ' non believers ' as legitimate targets , \" said director NSO Inderjit Singh .Targeted sexual offences and forced conversions of Hindu and Sikh girls was not a new phenomenon in the UK , said Ashish Joshio from Media Monitoring group .This has been going on for decades in the UK .Young Muslim men have been boasting about seducing the Kaffir ( unbeliever ) women .The Hindu and the Sikh communities must be commended for showing both restraint and maturity under such provocation , \" he added .Hardeep said that in 2007 , The Hindu Forum of Britain claimed that hundreds of Hindu and Sikh girls had been first romantically coaxed and later intimidated and converted by Muslim men .This strikes me as differing in type from the abuse of white girls described in the Rochdale trial , because the Sikh and Hindu girls seem to have been recruited for conversion with sex used a tool to achieve this rather than simply being used as sexual vessels .The defendant was previously banned from court because of his threatening behaviour and for calling the judge a \" racist bastard \" .Simon Nichol , defending , earlier said his client did not wish to attend the sentencing hearing and had ordered the barrister not to put any mitigation before the judge on his behalf . \"He has objected from the start for being tried by an all white jury and subsequent events have confirmed his fears , \" Mr Nichol said . \"He does not take back any of the comments he has made to your honour , to the jury , or to anyone else in the court during the course of the trial .He believes his convictions have nothing to do with justice but result from the faith and the race of the defendants .The nature of Islam .The predominance of sub continental Muslims in this type of crime raises a question , what is it that makes them and not non - Muslims from the same region commit this type of crime ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.614426"}
