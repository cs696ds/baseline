{"text": "An internal White House assessment concludes that President Obama must distance himself from a recalcitrant Congress after being badly damaged last year by legislative failures , a government shutdown and his own missteps .Obama has said that his fraught relationship with Congress , especially after Republicans won the House in 2010 , complicated his ability to promote his agenda .But for the first time , following what many allies view as a lost year , the White House is reorganizing itself to support a more executive - focused presidency and inviting the rest of the government to help .The new approach comes after weeks of internal White House debate over a single question : What went wrong in 2013 ?The answers will help determine the outline of the State of the Union address Obama will deliver Tuesday evening , as well as how he pursues a meaningful legacy in the remainder of his term .Last year began with the fresh - start ambitions of his second inauguration but ended in a long trail of mistakes , international embarrassments and missed legislative opportunities that sapped Obama 's credibility with the public .Senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer outlined the lessons learned in a three - page memo that Obama discussed with his Cabinet in recent weeks , according to several administration officials who have read the document .Among its conclusions is that Obama , a former state legislator and U.S. senator , too often governed more like a prime minister than a president .In a parliamentary system , a prime minister is elected by lawmakers and thus beholden to them in ways a president is not .As a result , Washington veterans have been brought into the West Wing to emphasize an executive style of governing that aims to sidestep Congress more often .A central ambition of Obama 's presidency - to change the way Washington works - has effectively been discarded as a distraction in a time of hardening partisanship .The White House postmortem also concluded that the administration suffered from a lack of focus in a year without an election .The 2012 campaign imposed discipline on the White House , providing a political filter to assess every new initiative .Obama wanted to know how his decisions would be explained to voters , a demand that vanished once the election was won .As a result , senior advisers now say , the White House 's focus did not match its ambitions as 2013 began .A bid for new restrictions on gun sales died in the Democratic - controlled Senate .Immigration reform , thought to be a priority for Republicans after their poor showing with Latinos in the last election , languished .A late - arriving budget proposal that included cuts to entitlement programs surprised and angered Obama 's base .By the end of the year , a majority of Americans questioned his administration 's basic competence .Now without an election ahead , Obama has fewer opportunities to recover - making this State of the Union address as politically consequential as any speech in his tenure .\"A State of the Union creates a contract with the public about what you say and what you will do , \" said John D. Podesta , a senior adviser to Obama brought in this month to help design an effective governing strategy around the president 's goals . \" In that sense it is like a campaign , and it disciplines the priorities of the White House by creating an operation manual for the year ahead , \" he said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "42.73284"}

John McCain , R - Ariz . , Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales , columnist and blogger Manal Al - Sharif , and Harvard University student Shree Bose .If she runs and wins , Hillary Clinton would become the first woman U.S. president , a distinction that adds a historic element to her appeal .However , she was considered the Democratic favorite in 2006 and 2007 , only to have her hopes dashed in her prolonged 2008 primary duel with Obama .Political observers say she is smart to play it cool as she contemplates whether to make a second presidential bid .For now , she can enjoy the liberty of appearing where and when she wants without having to worry about Federal Election Commission rules and regulations .If she becomes an official candidate , public opinion will harden along partisan lines .She would face round - the - clock media coverage and risk overexposure .And become a target from Democratic rivals who so far continue to hope she wo n't run in 2016 .Republicans already have been taking political potshots at her in anticipation of a Clinton run .\" She does n't have to worry about fundraising , and she does n't have to worry about name identification . \" She legally can not coordinate with these groups , but would n't need to , either , experts say .\" She 's fierce , she 's funny , \" says the Ready For Hillary PAC website , whose online store raises money for the cause selling branded items such as cap , hoodies , T - shirts and coffee mugs .\" She 's focused and she 's a fighter . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.4722"}

{"text": "\"Paul maintains that Obama takes \" care of corporations and corporations take over and run the country .\" That may be rhetorical hyperbole , but the larger point is that rather than working to nationalize the American economy , Obama has ministered to the needs of private corporations , providing them with support and capital .Not only is Barack Obama not a socialist , he is , in many respects , the antithesis of the ideology of socialism .RINOS AND DINOS :ALTHOUGH FAITHFUL TO THEIR PARTIES ' ORIGINAL POLITICAL IDEOLOGY , THEY GET NO RESPECT .The terms RINO ( Republican in Name Only ) and DINO ( Democrat in Name Only ) are used pejoratively by adherents of contemporary partisan orthodoxy to describe ideological outliers .Partisans often question why moderate and liberal Republicans and moderate and conservative Democrats identify with their respective parties .It is quite ironic that these political positions have come to be ideological outliers .Based on the founding of both parties , the original ideological outliers were Conservative Republicans and Liberal Democrats .The Democratic Party we know today evolved from the Democratic - Republican Party of the 1790 's .The first contested Presidential election was in 1796 .The Democratic - Republican Party nominated the conservative Thomas Jefferson as their first presidential nominee .Party members were anti - federalists who favored state sovereignty , free markets , a decentralized federal government , and an originalist interpretation of the U.S. Constitution and the attendant Bill of Rights .The Democratic - Republican Party also supported the institution of slavery .Although difficult to fathom today , what we now know as the Democratic Party was the nation 's major conservative party throughout the nineteenth century .Democrat Martin Van Buren presided over the panic of 1837 , and during that time he was steadfastly opposed to using the government as a means of employing workers on public works projects .In fact , during this economic depression Van Buren literally sold the federal government 's tool supply so that the government could not use the tools for public works projects .This ideological mindset is diametrically opposite to the economic stimulus that contemporary Democrats now support and advocate for , especially during periods of economic morass .The Republican Party has also been through significant ideological alterations .The GOP was founded in opposition to the expansion of slavery , supported railroad construction , supported more money for public education , a more liberal immigration policy , and agreed with the sale of unoccupied land to Homesteaders .At the time , the Republican Party was seen as the progressive alternative to the conservative Democratic Party of Presidents Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan .For much of the latter - half of the nineteenth century the GOP continued to be the liberal party .This is especially evidenced by the 1888 Presidential election where Republican Benjamin Harrison was elected President by advocating a liberal platform .He favored expanding the money supply , expanding the protective tariff , and munificent funding for social services .Harrison lost his re - election bid in 1892 to Democrat Grover Cleveland , who advocated a conservative platform , including maintaining the gold standard , reducing the protective tariff , and supporting a lassie faire approach to government intervention in the economy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.021862"}

Kennedy .Kennedy upset Humphrey , first in Humphrey 's neighboring state of Wisconsin , and then in West Virginia .This is significant because West Virginia was about 95 percent Protestant and Kennedy was a Catholic , and because the blue - collar electorate was tailor - made for Humphrey .Part of the reason Humphrey lost West Virginia was that Kennedy 's campaign manager and brother , Robert F. Kennedy , prompted Kennedy supporter Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. to suggest that Humphrey had been a draft dodger during World War ll .The accusations were mendacious in that Humphrey failed his medical examination because of a hernia .Roosevelt later withdrew his charge , but the damage was done .Kennedy won the nomination .Romney first sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 .Though Romney had waged a vigorous campaign in Iowa , spending millions , he lost by nine points to former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee .Half of the state 's caucus goers were evangelical voters , and that group backed Huckabee , a fellow evangelical , over Romney by 27 percentage points .Romney was then embarrassed by U.S. Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) in Romney 's neighboring state of New Hampshire .By working the townhall circuit , McCain overcame a 12-point deficit to defeat Romney .Romney was also hurt by opponents who portrayed him as a \" flip flopper \" for his change of position on a litany of issues , including abortion , climate change , and his support for President Ronald Reagan .McCain later bested Romney in Romney 's birth state of Michigan and went on to pocket the nomination .Despite a bitter campaign , McCain considered picking Romney as his vice presidential running mate , but ultimately chose the more provocative and charismatic Alaska Governor Sarah Palin .In 1964 , Humphrey was selected by Kennedy 's successor , Lyndon B. Johnson , to be his vice presidential runningmate .In 1968 , when Johnson , fatigued from the escalation of the war in Vietnam , announced that he would not seek re - election as President , Humphrey entered the race as the establishment Democrat candidate .While Humphrey garnered support with the blue - collar base of the Democratic Party , and much of party high command , he became an anathema to the party 's \" new left .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.07842"}

Byrd ( D - WV ) met with fifteen of his Senate colleagues , asking them if Carter could win their respective states in the General Election .The only Senator who answered in the affirmative was Sam Nunn from Carter 's home state of Georgia .Accordingly , the 1980 election should have been a slam - dunk for the Republican nominee .However , in part because of his move to the right in the 1976 campaign , Carter was successful in styling Reagan as a conservative extremist .He called Reagan \" dangerous \" disturbing .\" This forced Reagan to spend much of the General Election campaign trying to assure the American people that he was in the mainstream of American political thought .There was just one debate between Carter and Reagan that year .It occurred just one week before the election .Despite Carter 's anemic job approval ratings and the hunger from the electorate for change , the election was a dead heat .During that debate , Reagan essentially won the election by proving he was not a right wing ideologue .When Carter accused Reagan of having opposed the establishment of Medicare , Reagan soothingly replied : \" There you go again .\" In his closing statement , Reagan did not delineate a wish - list for conservatives but calmly asked the question : \" Are you better off than you were four years ago ? \"Thus with enough of the electorate confident Reagan was not a reactionary , the American people got the green light to vote against Carter .Reagan did not win the General Election by appealing only to conservatives .Astoundingly , he also pocketed 48 % of the moderate voters and 27 % of the liberal voters .By contrast , in 2012 , Republican nominee Mitt Romney won just 41 % of the moderates and 11 % of the liberals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.2137"}

Foraker ( R - OH ) .Foraker was a national figure , having run for the Republican Presidential nomination unsuccessfully in 1908 .Also like Rubio , Harding used his Senate seat as a mere steppingstone to the Presidency , and spent much of his time as a Senator barnstorming the country campaigning for Republican candidates , collecting chits , and effectuating a national profile .Like Rubio , Harding served just one term in the U.S. Senate .During that time period Harding missed about two - thirds of Senate votes .Again , like Rubio , Harding served on the Committee on Foreign Relations to sure up his foreign policy bone fides for a Presidential run .Similar to Rubio , Harding became a noted orator and delivered the coveted keynote address at the Republican National Convention in 1916 .In 1920 , at the end of his Senate term , Harding won his party 's Presidential nomination and won the Presidency .Like Harding and Rubio , John F. Kennedy had an undistinguished Senate career .Kennedy also secured a seat on the Committee on Foreign Relations from which to showcase his foreign policy bone fides .Kennedy took full advantage of his position .He raised his national profile by appearing on national television discussing international affairs .He also wrote the book Profiles in Courage , which spotlighted U.S. Senators who had taken unpopular stands .However , Kennedy had few substantive Senate accomplishments .In 1960 , Kennedy ran for the Democratic Presidential nomination against four seasoned Senators with more accomplished legislative records : Lyndon B.

Truman in 1951 .The General had publicly disparaged Truman for refusing to attack the Peoples Republic of China during the Korean War .MacArthur returned home from Korea to multiple ticker tape parades .He subsequently received an avalanche of applause when addressing the U.S. Congress .Taft promised that if the ticket were elected , he would \" deputize the General to assume responsibility for the national security as a Deputy Commander in Chief in the Armed Forces and give him a voice in the formulation of all foreign policy bearing upon national security .However , the proposed ticket had the adverse effect of being a \" kangaroo ticket \" in which the candidate at the bottom of the ticket upstaged the candidate at the top .In fact , a large contingent of Republicans , led by U.S. Senator Francis H. Case of South Dakota , called on the cerebral Taft to withdraw from the race and endorse the charismatic MacArthur for the Presidential nomination instead .Taft refused , but told MacArthur that should the ticket not win on the first ballot , he would entertain the notion of endorsing MacArthur to supplant him at the top of the ticket .However , Taft miscalculated the strength of the Eisenhower forces .Eisenhower defeated Taft on the first ballot and won the nomination .A second ballot might have resulted in an epic electoral bout between the two former generals .The second example where a President announced his choice of a running mate before the nomination was settled occurred in 1976 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.20625"}

Bush .Everson later headed the Red Cross .In every presidential election there are candidates with compelling resumes who the high command of the political parties and the media rarely mention .In almost every election cycle , a formidable candidate fails to make the cut .Two Minnesotans , Republican Harold Stassen and Democrat Eugene McCarthy , both had a major impact on their party 's nomination .However , later in life the two politicians ran for their party 's nomination and both were treated as non - entities .Stassen was once a boy - wonder in GOP Politics .He was elected Governor of Minnesota in 1938 at just 31 years old .Just two years later , the rising star delivered the keynote address at the Republican National Convention .Stassen was a candidate for his party 's nomination in 1940 and was the Floor Leader for the party 's nominee Wendell Willkie .In 1948 , Stassen , now a former Governor , was an early frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination after defeating New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey in the Nebraska and Wisconsin Primaries .However , Stassen lost his momentum following a loss to U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft ( R - OH ) in Taft 's home state , and following a defeat by Dewey in the hotly - contested Oregon primary .Dewey became the frontrunner and eventually won the nomination .Stassen was a potential runningmate for Dewey but lost out to California Governor Earl Warren .In 1952 , Stassen ran as a stalking horse for Dwight D. Eisenhower against Taft .Eisenhower had not yet declared his candidacy , and 41 Republican luminaries supported Stassen 's candidacy until Eisenhower entered the race .Stassen ran for president seven more times , each time mustering less attention .Stassen went from the boy - wonder of the party to a quixotic candidate who the party and media networks did not even invite to debates and rarely acknowledged his presence in the race .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.01355"}

Bush , it is rarely a winning strategy for the opposing candidate .Most of the time when candidates from out of state lose an election , it is not because of where they reside , but because they are out of the state 's political mainstream .For Scott Brown , his major hurdle may be defining a rationale for his candidacy .It is difficult for a candidate who moves to a state to run for office to construct a compelling master narrative as to why he is motivated by more than mere electoral opportunism .However , Brown will likely benefit from the crosspollination between Massachusetts and New Hampshire .In fact , about 13 percent of New Hampshire residents cross the border every day to work in Massachusetts .Accordingly , Brown can legitimately claim that he has a vested interest in New Hampshire because he is a long - time property tax payer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.41122"}

Ross Perot issued a challenge to his supporters on the CNN program Larry King Live to get him on the ballot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia .His supporters rose to the occasion .At a time when Americans were disaffected with the partisan paralysis , Perot 's independent candidacy appealed to a widespread cross - section of constituencies .In addition to Independent voters , Perot 's economic nationalism appealed to voters who had supported Democrat Jerry Brown and Republican Pat Buchanan in the presidential primaries .Perot 's focus on deficit reduction appealed to supporters of Democrat Paul Tsongas , who had made fiscal austerity his flagship issue during the primary .A June Gallup poll showed Perot actually leading in the popular vote at 39 percent .However , Perot soon abandoned his presidential candidacy , stating that he did not want to split the vote in the Electoral College , resulting in the election being thrown into the U.S. Congress .Perot later reentered the race , explaining that the real reason he had dropped out was that a Republican operative had threatened to sabotage his daughter 's wedding .Despite this erratic episode , Perot performed well in the presidential debates and won 18.9 percent of the vote .Perot ran again in 1996 , but did not muster enough support to be invited into the debates .He garnered just 8.4 percent of the vote in that election .In 1996 , Morry Taylor , the CEO of Titan Tire Corporation , spent about $ 6 million in his bid for the GOP presidential nomination , only to pull out of the race after garnering less than 1 percent of the vote .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.73929"}

Long .Coolidge won largely because of his association as Lieutenant Governor with the popular outgoing Republican Governor Samuel W. McCall .The next year , the unassuming , low key Coolidge became a hero in conservative quarters .The Boston Police went on strike after the city 's police commissioner , Edwin U. Curtis , denied them the right to join the American Federation of Labor ( AFL ) .With the city in a near state of anarchy , Coolidge ordered the Massachusetts National Guard to supplant the Boston police officers during the strike .The Guard succeeded in reestablishing order in the city .Coolidge became a political folk hero to conservatives when his response to a letter written to him by AFL President Samuel Gompers was disseminated .Coolidge wrote to Gompers : \" There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody , anywhere , at any time .\" Similar to the recall election with Walker , Coolidge 's 1919 re - election campaign became a referendum on Coolidge 's leadership during that strike ( At the time , Massachusetts Governors were elected to one - year terms ) .Unions worked feverishly for Richard H. Long , who once again ran against Coolidge .The race became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for the unions because of Coolidge 's handling of the police strike .The Boston Central Labor Union called for voters to oppose Coolidge so as to : \" remove this menace to public safety and vindicate our cause .\" Bay State voters , however , were not singing from the same hymnbook as the unions .Coolidge was soundly re - elected as Governor .Coolidge 's handling of the police strike and his subsequent statement against the strikers , coupled with his resounding re - election as Governor against a union backed candidate , precipitously elevated Coolidge to national stardom with the Republican Party 's conservative bloodline .At the 1920 Republican National Convention , some conservatives wanted to place Coolidge 's name as a candidate for the Presidential nomination .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.904526"}

Eisenhower .In 1952 , Eisenhower , who like Carson had been a lifelong Independent , became a Republican to run for the nomination .Eisenhower ran as a non - ideological pragmatist .His main opponent for the nomination was conservative U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft ( R - OH ) .The Republican Party had not held the presidency since 1933 , and the party 's rank - and - file voters were willing to hold their noses and support the more moderate but popular Eisenhower over the ideologically impeccable Taft .Eisenhower won the GOP nomination and easily defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson in the general election .Similar to Eisenhower , two other military generals with no political experience were elected president : Whig Zachary Taylor in 1848 and Republican Ulysses S. Grant in 1868 .Grant had only voted once prior to his own election .In 1856 he voted for Democratic presidential nominee James Buchanan over Republican nominee James C. Freemont , who Grant viewed as an egotist .Grant said : \" I voted for Buchanan because I did n't know him and voted against Freemont because I did know him . \" In Taylor 's case , he had not even registered to vote until he was 62 years old .In contrast to Eisenhower , Taylor , and Grant , two other military men who were recent converts to a new political party saw their respective candidacies falter .In 1900 , the Democrats recruited Admiral George Dewey to run for their party 's presidential nomination .On paper , Dewey was a dream candidate to challenge the popular Republican William McKinley .Dewey had become a national icon for his role in defeating the Spanish during the Spanish - American War at the critical Battle of Manila Bay .When Dewey returned home , parades were held in his honor .However , Dewey did not seem to fathom that the American people had come to expect an activist president who serves as a leader , not a figurehead who is subservient to the prerogatives of the U.S. Congress .Rather than laying out his own ambitious agenda , Dewey asserted that as president he would : \" execute the laws of Congress as faithfully as I have always executed the orders of my superiors . \"In addition , Dewey came across as supercilious by suggesting that the presidency would not be a difficult job : \" I am convinced that the office of the President is not such a very difficult one to fill . \"Dewey never recovered from these gaffes and consequently abandoned his candidacy .To add insult to injury , and proving that he was not really much of a Democrat , Dewey endorsed Republican McKinley over the eventual Democratic nominee , William Jennings Bryan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.672325"}

Harding in 1923 , was challenged for the Republican nomination by U.S. Senator Hiram Johnson ( R - CA ) .Johnson defeated Coolidge in the South Dakota primary , but failed to garner much electoral traction .With the Democrats also nominating a conservative , John W.

La Follette Sr . for President and Democrat Burton Wheeler for Vice President .The ticket won a formidable 16.6 % of the popular vote .Twelve liberal Republican U.S. House members supported the La Follette Candidacy and were expelled from the Republican caucus by conservative U.S. House Speaker Nicholas Longworth ( R - OH ) .Liberals and conservatives had an uneasy cohabitation in both parties .In the South , opposition to Lyndon B.

Platt , a rival of New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt , successfully urged the Republican Party to select Roosevelt as the running mate to President William McKinley in 1900 .Platt did this to get Roosevelt out of the Governorship because Roosevelt was challenging the Platt political machine in New York .Platt thought with Roosevelt gone that Lieutenant Governor Benjamin Barker Odell Jr. would become the Governor and would be more compliant to Platt 's political machine .The thinking was that Roosevelt would be rendered inconsequential in that the Vice Presidency has little power .As circumstances would have it , President McKinley was assassinated in 1901 , during the first year of his second term in office , and Roosevelt became president .Upon hearing the news , a shocked Platt exclaimed : \" Oh God , now that dammed cowboy is president of the United States . \" To add insult to injury , Governor Odell , similar to Theodore Roosevelt , became a crusader for reform , shunning the Thomas C. Platt political machine .The name Irvine Lenroot is not exactly a household word , but had the Republican Party high command and the GOP presidential nominee had their way , he may have become president .U.S. Senator Warren G. Harding garnered the Republican presidential nomination in 1920 .Harding came from the conservative bloodline of the GOP .The Republican Party establishment wanted to balance the ticket with Lenroot , a U.S. Representative from Wisconsin and a tribune of the party 's liberal bloodline .However , conservative delegates to the Republican National Convention rebelled against the high command and nominated Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge .Coolidge was a rising star in conservative circles for his role in standing up to organized labor during the Boston Police Strike .Ironically , Harding died in 1923 , allowing Coolidge to ascend to the Presidency , winning a term in his own right a year later .Irvine Lenroot faded back into obscurity .The capstone of his career was not the Presidency , but a judgeship on the United States Court of Customs and Appeals .Enveloped in the Watergate scandal , President Richard M. Nixon resigned his office in 1974 and was succeeded by Gerald R. Ford , the only man to succeed to the Presidency without ever being elected vice president or president .But , if Nixon had his way , Ford would not have succeeded him as president .When Vice President Spiro Agnew was forced to resign his office nolo contender ( no contest ) to charges of failure to report income , President Richard M. Nixon 's first choice to succeed Agnew was Treasury Secretary John Connally .However , Democratic Congressional leaders told Nixon that they would not confirm Connally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.13016"}
