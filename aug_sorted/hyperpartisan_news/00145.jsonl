Barack Obama in the West Virginia primary yesterday , scoring one of her most lopsided victories of the long campaign even as she continued to battle overwhelming odds in her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination .Clinton 's resounding victory in a state that has slipped away from Democrats in the past two elections added fresh ammunition to her claim that she is better positioned than Obama to capture critical swing states in November .But the primary win may have come too late to have a significant impact on the trajectory of a nomination battle in which Obama has an almost insurmountable lead in delegates .Clinton advisers hoped the size of Clinton 's victory and signs of dissatisfaction with Obama among West Virginia voters would reopen a conversation about who is the stronger Democrat to take on Sen. John McCain , the presumptive Republican nominee , in the general election .They also hoped the results would tamp down talk that Clinton should consider dropping out of the nomination contest before the primaries end on June 3 to speed the process of uniting Democrats .Clinton was winning with a margin of better than 2 to 1 in the popular vote in West Virginia .With 28 pledged delegates at stake , that margin would produce a net gain for Clinton of an estimated 12 delegates .That would only partially cut into the gains Obama has made in superdelegates since he easily won North Carolina and narrowly lost Indiana a week ago .Former Democratic Party general chairman Roy Romer , who was handpicked for that job by former president Bill Clinton , announced his support for Obama yesterday .Hillary Clinton claimed victory shortly after the polls closed last night .Clinton argued that , by winning in states such as Ohio , Pennsylvania , Arkansas , New Hampshire and now West Virginia , she has demonstrated strength where it counts . \"The White House is won in the swing states , and I am winning the swing states , \" she said .Clinton also renewed her call to seat the delegations from Florida and Michigan and to include those delegates in the overall count for the nomination .\" Under the rules of our party , \" she said , \" when you include all 50 states , the number of delegates needed to win is 2,209 , and neither of us has reached that threshold yet .\"Campaigning in Cape Girardeau , Obama called this election \" a chance to build a new majority of Democrats , independents and Republicans . \"He delivered pointed criticisms of McCain 's record on taxes , Social Security and the Iraq war , asserting that the Republican 's election would create four more years of \" the Bush - McCain program .\" Obama 's campaign has said in the past that he has a greater ability than Clinton to expand the electoral map in November .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.34371"}

{"text": "It 's possible that eight years as Vice President gives him a certain gravitas that he lacked before , as well as instant name recognition .Reflecting that name recognition , most polls give him about 10 % support already even though he 's not a declared candidacy .But it also means that if he runs he automatically makes Hillary the candidate of change ( albeit not much change ! )Even though their stances on most issues do not diverge markedly ( foreign policy is a notable exception ) , it is not hard to envision Hillary portraying Biden as a candidate of the past .Of course , his candidacy would be buoyed by a media desperate to create the fiction of a competitive Democratic contest .Already the initial media reports are hinting at friction between Biden and the Big Dawg Bill Clinton , and they are framing a Biden candidacy in terms of the contrast between his strong ratings among voters on honesty and likability versus Clinton 's negative ratings on those characteristics .A Biden candidacy , goes the media narrative , would rescue the Democratic Party from the slow drip - drip of negative news stories about Clinton 's emails , money , and general lack of credibility , particularly among independents , that weaken her chances against Republicans .It would also fulfill the deathbed wish of Joe 's son Beau - another bonus in terms of media coverage .But while a Biden candidacy will undoubtedly draw favorable media coverage , it is important to remember that , among registered voters , he is not viewed much more favorably than is Hillary .Moreover , most people already have an opinion of Uncle Joe , so those ratings are n't likely to change that much .And , as with all vice presidents , Joe will have to confront the difficult task of separating himself from the Obama presidency without seeming to repudiate the President 's policies .This could lead to some awkward policy statements ( see Clinton on the Keystone pipeline ! ) from a candidate who is already well known for his verbal miscues that have made him a Youtube favorite .Nor is it likely that Joe is going to siphon much support from Sanders ' progressive coalition .In short , a Biden candidacy will undoubtedly generate quite a bit of media coverage , much of it initially positive , from a grateful media corps , but there 's no evidence right now suggesting that he could beat Clinton .At best , the current evidence indicates a Biden candidacy might create the semblance of a competitive nomination fight and push back the timetable for Clinton to clinch the race .The question remains whether that prospect is enough to persuade him to enter the fray .The answer may depend on whether Joe is willing to relinquish his time in the political spotlight , or whether , like Frank Skeffington , he wants one more shot at center stage .Will a presidential campaign be Joe 's Last Hurrah ?One of the great ironies of this presidential campaign is that President Obama , who won election in 2008 in part due to his promise to reverse his predecessor George W.

{"text": "\" There is concern among some about how successful they might be in bringing a criminal indictment against Mrs. Clinton for obvious reasons , but there is no lack of desire to do so , \" one lawyer familiar with the probe said at the time .The lawyer said the decision rested on two major points : whether there was sufficient evidence to contradict her sworn testimony and , more importantly , whether prosecutors could win the case in court .A week before the summaries were found , the Resolution Trust Corp. ( RTC ) said in a Dec. 28 , 1995 , report it had little information on Mrs. Clinton 's ties to Madison or Castle Grande .After their discovery , the agency concluded Mrs. Clinton was more involved with the two entities than was previously known .At the time , Madison was seeking help from Mrs. Clinton 's Rose Law Firm in Little Rock to fend off state and federal regulators concerned that the thrift was insolvent .Madison also wanted to jump - start a questionable preferred stock deal to pump much - needed cash into the operation and was desperate to keep the government from shutting it down .The committee released 350 pages of Madison files that said Mrs. Clinton , according to the billing summaries , had made significant claims on the thrift for legal services , and at one point was listed exclusively as the billing attorney .The summary is all that remains , since the original Rose firm billing records for Madison disappeared .Madison was closed in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of $ 70 million .Castle Grande failed at a taxpayers ' loss of $ 4 million .Another major area of concern , authorities said , was an option agreement regulators said \" facilitated \" a questionable $ 300,000 payment to Seth Ward , the Madison official to whom Mrs. Clinton had spoken about Castle Grande .The agreement was written by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Hubbell and guaranteed Mr. Ward a payoff and negated his liability in the project .While the option was never exercised , it disguised the reason for the payment and created a paper trail to justify the outlay to Mr. Ward , who was Mr. Hubbell 's father - in - law .Not truthful .According to the Dash documents on Whitewater , investigators also challenged Mrs. Clinton 's public statements on what she knew at the time of Mr. Hubbell 's March 1994 Justice Department resignation .Mrs. Clinton told reporters she thought he quit over an \" internal billing dispute \" with his former Rose firm partners that \" likely would be resolved . \"Mr. Eggleston said a finding against the firm would mean that it was \" permanently barred from any further work for the RTC or the FDIC ( and possibly other banking regulators . )He also said that while it was \" not clear \" whether the FDIC or the RTC would review the accusations under an actual conflict standard , there was the possibility of sanctions in the case , including \" criminal liability , \" the records said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.20651"}

{"text": "Her aides also sent and received classified information . \"As Reuters explained in August , when a smaller amount of classified information had already been discovered in Clinton 's email , this information could have been \" born classified \" and be considered classified regardless of whether the State Department had labeled it classified : .In the small fraction of emails made public so far , Reuters has found at least 30 email threads from 2009 , representing scores of individual emails , that include what the State Department 's own \" Classified \" stamps now identify as so - called ' foreign government information . 'The U.S. government defines this as any information , written or spoken , provided in confidence to U.S. officials by their foreign counterparts .\" It 's born classified , \" said J.

Bush administrations .Reuters ' findings may add to questions that Clinton has been facing over her adherence to rules concerning sensitive government information .Spokesmen for Clinton declined to answer questions , but Clinton and her staff maintain she did not mishandle any information .\" I did not send classified material , and I did not receive any material that was marked or designated classified , \" Clinton told reporters at a campaign event in Nevada on Tuesday .Two of the emails were previously \" top secret \" with one later downgraded to \" secret .\" Previously there were questions as to whether Clinton 's actions were intentional or if she understood enough about the computer systems to understand what was occurring .This email statement , \" If they ca n't , turn into nonpaper w no identifying heading and send nonsecure \" should end the possibility of any defense along these lines .With the FBI investigating Clinton 's email practices at the State Department , there has been growing speculation in recent weeks that she will be facing criminal charges .While this tends to be more in the conservative media , it does appear that the FBI had already stepped up its probe late in 2015 , and this latest \" smoking gun \" should increase the chances .Joe Biden said this week that he regrets his decision not to run \" every day . \"With many Democratic Party insiders appearing determined to keep Sanders from winning the nomination , it is just possible that they might offer Biden a second chance should they recognize how damaging the latest emails could be to Clinton 's election chances , or should she be indicted .The conventional wisdom was that Hillary Clinton had an extraordinary month in October , with some pundits going as far to claim she virtually wrapped up the nomination .Yet now we are in November and Bernie Sanders has hardly been knocked out of the race .He is even looking like he is on track to win the month of November .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.52886"}
