W. Bush , a popular vote plurality for Al Gore and a 53 - 46 defeat for John McCain .The odd thing about 2016 polling is that Hillary Clinton runs far above Barack Obama 's current job approval -- currently 43 percent -- while in the few polls pitting Vice President Joe Biden and others against Republicans , those Democrats run far behind .That 's odd , because we 're in a period of straight - ticket voting , and in recent Senate and House elections , Democratic candidates have won percentages highly correlated with Obama 's job approval .One reason Clinton may be running ahead of the president 's approval is the high retrospective approval of Bill Clinton 's presidency .The 1990s are remembered , largely but not entirely accurately , as a time of booming job growth , technological progress , peace and American primacy abroad .The last six years of Clinton 's presidency , when Republicans had majorities in both houses of Congress , are seen as times of bipartisan cooperation and reform .Back in 2008 , Obama said he wanted to be a transformative president like Ronald Reagan , rather than an accommodating president like Bill Clinton .Obama has operated that way , declining Clinton - style triangulating between his party 's liberals and the other party 's conservatives .Today 's low Obama approval rating and Clinton 's higher percentages suggest that many independent voters prefer the Clinton model .But if Bill Clinton is a political asset for his wife 's candidacy , he could also prove to be a liability .He has continued to be more politically active -- though not taking a harsh partisan approach -- than just about any other former president except Andrew Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt .Two other family members of presidents have been elected president while those former presidents were alive , but both forebears were politically inactive .George H.

Barack Obama will actually emerge from the process having won more delegates from Texas than Clinton , which , after all , is the way nominees are chosen .At the very least , it appears that Clinton 's win in the popular vote was offset by the caucuses , making Texas effectively a wash for her in the all - important delegate race .The most recent still - incomplete count by the Associated Press had both Clinton and Obama winning 103 delegates from Texas , with 22 still unallocated .The Houston Chronicle yesterday had Obama ahead with 108 delegates to 107 for Clinton .If he holds his lead in the caucuses , he would pick up more of the still - unallocated delegates than she would .The same thing happened in January in Nevada , where Clinton won the most votes but Obama ultimately edged her in delegates .In some ways , that does not matter that much .Politics is often more about emotion and perception than math .Clinton 's victory in the Texas popular vote , along with her triumph in Ohio the same night , gave her a powerful political boost at a time when she had gone a month without any wins .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.80095"}

{"text": "SALT LAKE CITY ( AP ) - A medical examiner has determined NFL quarterback Jay Cutler 's brother - in - law 's death was accidental , saying Michael Cavallari died of hypothermia after he crashed his car during a frigid temperatures while passing through a rocky and rural part of southern Utah .Full Story Barone : Hillary Clinton wo n't have easy ride to presidency .Will Hillary Clinton be elected America 's next president ?The polls suggest she will .Recent polls compiled by Real Clear Politics show her winning 67 percent of the vote in Democratic primaries , with no other candidate above 11 percent .General election polling shows Clinton with an average lead over various possible Republican nominees of 51 to 39 percent .But an election is n't over until it is over , and this one has n't started .For one thing , no one is sure whether Clinton actually will run .She turns 69 in 2016 ( the same age as Ronald Reagan when he was first elected in 1980 ) and she may consider that her achievements in eight years as first lady and U.S. senator , and four years as secretary of state are enough for one lifetime .Her achievements in that last office may look less impressive than they did in the first Obama term when majorities expressed approval of the president 's foreign policy .Clinton 's proudly proclaimed \" reset \" with Russia suddenly looks less like a triumph than a misfire .She 's also had health scares : a blood clot behind her right knee in 1998 and another in her skull in December 2012 .The 2016 election will be only the fourth in the last 40 years in which the incumbent president was n't running .In the previous three -- 1988 , 2000 , 2008 -- the candidate of the president 's party ran roughly in line with the incumbent 's job approval .That produced a 53 percent to 46 percent victory for George H. W. Bush , a popular vote plurality for Al Gore and a 53 - 46 defeat for John McCain .The odd thing about 2016 polling is that Hillary Clinton runs far above Barack Obama 's current job approval -- currently 43 percent -- while in the few polls pitting Vice President Joe Biden and others against Republicans , those Democrats run far behind .That 's odd , because we 're in a period of straight - ticket voting , and in recent Senate and House elections , Democratic candidates have won percentages highly correlated with Obama 's job approval .One reason Clinton may be running ahead of the president 's approval is the high retrospective approval of Bill Clinton 's presidency .The 1990s are remembered , largely but not entirely accurately , as a time of booming job growth , technological progress , peace and American primacy abroad .The last six years of Clinton 's presidency , when Republicans had majorities in both houses of Congress , are seen as times of bipartisan cooperation and reform .Back in 2008 , Obama said he wanted to be a transformative president like Ronald Reagan , rather than an accommodating president like Bill Clinton .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.33115"}

W. Bush was in a tough race against Bill Clinton , and there was active discussion regarding whether to replace Vice President Dan Quayle on the ticket .In an oral history , James Baker - who ran Bush 's presidential campaigns - alluded to Ford 's decision as one reason why Bush decided to keep Quayle on the ticket .Baker was asked whether Bush regretted choosing Quayle as Vice President in the first place .He replied : \" Maybe later .Maybe later , because the coverage was so uniformly negative for the four years that I think he would 've been pleased perhaps even to see Dan volunteer to step down in ' 92 , but that was n't to be .And he certainly could n't take the ax to him because the press would say , Hey , you dummy , the problem is not the Vice President .It 's you .That 's why you 're running low in the polls .So he could n't do that .In fact I think [ Gerald ] Ford made a mistake when he let [ Nelson ] Rockefeller go .And if it had been Ford and Rockefeller , I think they would 've won that election in ' 76 , instead of Ford and Dole . \"So Bush stuck with Quayle - and lost anyway , in large part because Ross Perot 's third party candidacy siphoned votes from Bush .Despite the negative outcome , Baker 's reasoning still seems to me to be applicable to Obama 's predicament today .He ca n't fire Biden without signaling that he knows his reelection is in doubt .And it would be even more difficult to replace Biden with Clinton for the simple reason that half of the likely Democratic voters are going to want the ticket reversed , with Clinton on the top .Now , if Biden \" volunteers \" to step down , as Rockefeller did , that may ease Obama 's problem superficially , although even then there will be the inevitable whispering campaign that Biden was asked to resign .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.29411"}

George W. Bush .The 2000 Presidential Election was the most recent election where the popular vote winner was not elected .George W. Bush , son of former President George H.W. Bush , ran on the Republican ticket against Democratic candidate , and the sitting Vice President Al Gore .Though Gore held a slim popular vote victory of 543,895 ( 0.5 % ) , Bush won the Electoral College 271 - 266 , with one Gore elector abstaining .The election was plagued with allegations of voter fraud and disenfranchisement .Rumors of illegal road blocks , unclear ballots , and uncounted votes , particularly in swing states like Missouri and Florida , were rampant .Florida became the key state as the election drew to a close .Consisting of nearly 6 million voters , Florida was officially won by a margin of 537 votes , after a process of recounting the votes and a Supreme Court ruling .Voters complained about confusing ballots and many Florida voters believed that they accidentally voted for Pat Buchanan , a conservative running on the Reform ticket , when they meant to vote for Al Gore .Another significant candidate in the 2000 election was Green Party candidate Ralph Nader .Nader attracted just under 3 % of voters with a progressive platform focused on social and environmental issues .Democratic supporters targeted Nader as being a \" spoiler \" for Al Gore .Since Nader was left - of - center , Democrats argued that most of his voters would have otherwise supported Gore .In such a close election , many believe that Gore would have won if Nader had dropped out of the race .The 2000 election resulted in numerous court battles over contested ballots and recounts .These lawsuits escalated to the U.S. Supreme Court where the final , 5 - 4 decision was made , ending the recounts and giving the state of Florida 's electoral votes to George W. Bush .In the end , Gore conceded the election publicly , though he did not hide his displeasure at the Supreme Court 's ruling .On the third Monday in February we honor those select Americans who were elected president of the United States .But we rarely , if ever , take time to honor the also - rans .Not just any old also - ran deserves to be honored , of course .Thousands of people have sought the presidency , but that does n't mean they 're especially worthy of recognition .Some candidates , though , have come within a handsbreadth of winning election to the highest office in the land , only to fall short in ways that must have added to the sting of defeat .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.545044"}

Hayes , the Republican candidate .Each vote was 8 - 7 , with the Republican majority controlling the decision .Every decision of the commission was contested by the Democratic House but was upheld by the Republican Senate .The Democrats threatened to filibuster but eventually agreed to a resolution that Hayes would withdraw federal troops from the South , ending reconstruction and the enforcement of equal voting rights for blacks .This election was clearly corrupted and has found a place in every debate over the Electoral College since .For a more complete analysis and timeline of the 1876 election , see the special website designed by Harper 's Weekly .1888 : Benjamin Harrison v. Grover Cleveland .1888 was another election in which the winner of the popular vote did not become president .Democratic incumbent Grover Cleveland had won the popular vote by a margin of 0.8 % ( 90,596 out of 11,383,320 votes ) .Despite this slim popular victory , Republican Benjamin Harrison won the Electoral College majority ( 233 out of 401 votes ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.36199"}

Richard Johnson .In the 1836 election , the Democratic - Republicans ' presidential candidate , Martin Van Buren , won both the popular vote and the electoral vote .His main competition was the Whig Party .The Whigs hoped to expose the design of the Electoral College by running several different candidates in different areas , picking individuals with a great deal of regional appeal .The Whigs hoped to win a party majority throughout the country with this method , which would then allow them to choose the individual they wished to become president .They were unsuccessful and Van Buren won the election with nearly 60 % of the electoral votes , though his popular vote total was just over 50 % .His running mate , Richard M. Johnson , did not fare so well .Upon hearing the allegation that Johnson had children with an African American woman , the 23 Democratic - Republican electors of Virginia refused to give him their votes .Without those 23 votes , Johnson did not receive a majority vote within the Electoral College .The decision was deferred to the Senate where Johnson was finally elected by a majority vote as the new vice president .1872 : Horace Greeley v. Ulysses S Grant .Horace Greeley established the Liberal Republicans ( or Democrats ) in protest of incumbent Ulysses S Grant .Greeley ran against Grant in the 1872 presidential election .Though few took Greeley seriously at first , he gained support throughout the campaign and eventually gathered 40 % of the popular vote , only 800,000 less than Grant .Greeley received a total of 2.8 million votes and would have received 86 electoral votes had he not died on November 29 , after the general election but before the Electoral College convened to cast their votes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.36328"}

{"text": "We agree Lucinschi was the correct winner ; but the fact he lost the first round demonstrates the failure of the plain plurality single - round system .Romania 1996 Presidential .In the plurality election , Ion Iliescu placed top with 32.2 % , beating out Emil Constantinescu 's 28.2 % .But then in the subsequent top - two runoff , Constantinescu won 54.4 % to 45.6 % .We agree Constantinescu was the correct winner ; but the fact he lost the first round demonstrates the failure of the plain plurality single - round system .Niger 1993 Presidential .In the plurality election , Mamadou Tandja won with 34.22 % , beating Mahamane Ousmane ( 26.59 % ) , Mahamadou Issoufou ( 15.92 % ) , and M.A.Djermakoye ( 15.24 % ) .But in the subsequent top-2 runoff Ousmane won with 54.46 % over Tandja .We agree Ousmane was probably the correct winner ; but the fact he lost the first round demonstrates the failure of the plain plurality single - round system .Cyprus(Greek ) 1993 Presidential .In the plurality election , Georges Vassilou won with 44.15 % , beating Glafcos Clerides ( 36.74 % ) and P.Pascalides ( 18.64 % ) .But in the subsequent top-2 runoff Clerides won with 50.31 % over Vassilou 's 49.69 % .We agree Clerides was probably the correct winner ; but the fact he lost the first round demonstrates the failure of the plain plurality single - round system .Estonia 1992 Presidential .Arnold Ruutel won ( 42.2 % ) , followed by Lennart Meri ( 29.8 % ) , Rein Taagepera ( 23.7 % ) , etc .But then the newly elected Riigikogu gave the presidency to Meri .Who knows ?Kiribati 1991 Presidential .Kiribati was the only country in the world to adopt the Borda Count system .It failed immediately as a consequence of massive \" strategic voting \" ( which everybody already knew was the Achilles heel of the Borda system , but this confirmed that dramatically ) .Consequently , Kiribati soon abandoned the Borda system and went back to plain plurality voting .We have no idea who \" should have \" won .We quote the pathology - description from Reilly 's paper ( pdf ) : As a result , of the four candidates nominated to contest the presidential election , \" only two were genuine candidates and actually campaigned for President : Teatao Teannaki and Roniti Teiwaki .The other two candidates ( Boanareke Boanareke and Beniamina Tinga ) simply returned to their home islands , where they remained until election day .They did not campaign and were not regarded as serious candidates .\" This process illustrates a clear case of strategic manipulation of the Borda count at work .As leaders of their respective parties , Teburoro Tito and Tewareka Tentoa were two of the more popular politicians throughout Kiribati , and their elimination from the presidential contest was a surprise to many voters .By contrast , two of the nominated contestants were comparatively not serious and together received less than 10 percent of the vote at the resulting presidential election , won by Teatao Teannaki .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.5994"}
{"text": "Kiribati later abandoned the Borda system .In this election , conducted with the instant runoff ( IRV ) system , Mary Robinson won the final round by 52.8 % versus Brian Lenihan 's 47.2 % .Lenihan , however , would have won had the election been conducted with plain plurality voting ( he got 44.1 % of the top - rank votes , while the next contender had 38.9 % ) .Robinson 's victory thus depended on vote transfers from the eliminated Fine Gael candidate A.Currie , whose supporters evidently viewed Robinson as the \" lesser evil .\" If a whole new county had magically appeared , all of them supporting Lenihan 's most - hated rival Currie and ranking Lenihan in last place ... then Lenihan would have won !If a slightly - smaller Currie - county had appeared and 12 % of Lenihan 's voters had instead voted for his most - hated rival Currie while ranking Lenihan last ... then Lenihan would have won !So , since those handicaps actually were not present - why did n't Lenihan win ?We do not dispute that Robinson was the right winner .We are including this ( a ) an interesting example of IRV improving over plain plurality by actually electing a ( superb ) third - party candidate , but only at the cost of ( b ) exhibiting several pathologies including non - monotonicity .Generally speaking , IRV leads to 2-party domination , just like plurality .And indeed , in every Irish presidential election besides 1990 , the Fianna Fail party 's candidate always won , despite the fact that Ireland as a PR country had more than two parties .This 1990 election seems to indicate that IRV , despite leading to 2-party domination , does so with somewhat less oomph than plurality voting and hence permits a third - party candidate to win in exceptional circumstances .These certainly were exceptional circumstances : .Mary Robinson enjoyed worldwide fame and respect ( winner of Nobel Peace prize ) .The FF candidate Lenihan was afflicted by two scandals : ( a ) scandal involving PM Charles Haughey and phone tapping / jamming , and ( b ) was caught lying about that on tape , .Unusually , the Fine Gael party failed to put forward a credible candidate ( both their top choices FitzGerald and Barry declined to run ; Currie had only been a member of the Dail since 1989 ) .Even all these factors together were not enough to overcome Duverger 's law to permit Robinson to win under plurality voting , but they were enough with Instant Runoff Voting .( Robinson probably would have won under Approval and Range voting too . )Peru 1990 Presidential .Mario Vargas Lhosa won with 27.61 % , followed by Alberto Keinya Fujimori with 24.62 % , L.J.Alva Castro with 10.17 % , and others .But in the runoff round , Fujimori beat Vargas Lhosa 56.5 % to 33.9 % .( Note the enormous percentage of spoiled votes . )If Fujimori was the correct winner , then still the fact he lost the first round demonstrates the failure of the plain plurality single - round system .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "123.72542"}
{"text": "Socialism is on far left of the traditional left / right political spectrum .Democratic socialism : Social ownership of the means of production , but with a democratically elected government .The formal definition is a political ideology advocating a democratic political system alongside a socialist economic system , involving a combination of political democracy with social ownership of the means of production .The adjective \" democratic \" is often added to distinguish itself from the Marxist - Leninist brand of socialism , which is widely viewed as being non - democratic .We have many aspects of democratic socialism in the United States today : Public libraries , snow removal , trash pick - up , Medicare , fire protection , police protection , and Social Security are just a handful of examples .Democratic socialism is on the left of the traditional left / right political spectrum .National Socialism , aka the Nazis : This is not socialism no matter what anyone tells you .It is a fascist - based philosophy .The formal definition is the ideology and practice associated with the 20th century German Nazi Party and Nazi state , as well as other far - right groups .It 's usually characterized as a form of fascism that incorporates scientific racism and anti - Semitism .National Socialism is on the far right of the traditional left / right political spectrum .Islamofascism : Is this really even a thing ?Formally it is defined as an ideology promoted by some Islamists , the aims of which are to establish Islamic orthodoxy and to resist western secularism .However , many critics are dismissive .Daniel Benjamin brands it as \" meaningless . \"Norman Finkelstein calls it a \" kosher - halal \" throwback version of the \" vacuous \" old leftist epithet \" fascist pig . \"Paul Krugman calls it a \" figment of the neocon imagination , \" and Angelo Codevilla states that it \" betrays an ignorance of both Islam and Fascism .\" It appears that Islamofascism is something our conservative friends made up as a bogeyman to replace the former Soviet Union .I have no idea where this made - up thing goes on the traditional left / right political spectrum .So there you have it .A very brief tutorial on some of the political philosophies that conservatives in the United States are willfully ignorant about .Next time your uncle starts raving about that fascist / communist / socialist / Marxist / Islamofascist Obama - just print this , hand it to him and walk away .It likely wo n't do any good , but , you wo n't have to waste your time trying to explain that fascism is not the same as communism .This chart was made from results of a Washington Post / Kaiser Family Foundation Poll -- done between May 21st and June 17th of a random national sample of 1,610 adults , and has a 3 point margin of error .It shows that only 60 % of women and 33 % of men say they are feminists , while 32 % of women and 55 % of men say they are not feminists .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "130.16028"}
{"text": "Talbot has pointed out on - line that the whimsical surface hides a deeper structure , as later information builds on earlier bits so as to all flow together ; and this is indeed true .But to the reader it seems wandering , not marched : Talbot takes us through a wonderland of history and fable , fact and story , bizarre coincidence and grand inevitability .Talbot 's art is a delight -- and one of the reasons that Alice in Sunderland never fails to enthrall .He uses a panoply of wildly distinct styles at various points in the book , but two modes are dominant .The other dominant style is that of collage .Talbot does not stick rigorously to his theme : like Lewis Carroll 's Alice , Talbot 's Alice is a book all about play and wonder and delight .He takes time out from his main subjects to trace out all sorts of digressions and byways and stray thoughts .Many of these are presented as separate little short stories .Other themes do not gather themselves up into a tight little ball of story , but rather unwind leisurely through the entire work , poking their heads up here and there .The most important of these is the history , and artistic validity , of Talbot 's medium : comics .( Whether the irony is more pointed or affectionate is an interesting question , although I suspect the latter . )But I admit that it might be I and not Talbot who is mistaken about this one .Talbot 's use of collage as the central artistic style of his comic is thematically appropriate , for the book itself is a kind of collage , pasting the into the same work the history of comics , the history of the Alice books and the history of Sunderland .To be sure , these go well together , overlapping naturally at many points ; that 's why the collage works .But these different threads of the work are each larger than their overlap , and are framed by the many other digressions , tales , fantasies , factoids , tidbits , jokes and other entertainments that Talbot pastes into the work atop and alongside his central motifs .Another central theme in Alice in Sunderland is the process of creation .The book is in part about its own creation , filled with scenes of him writing and drawing , comments upon his own structure , and brimming with metafictional play .Part of that latter story is the elimination of Alice 's Sunderland roots in favor of an Oxford - only version -- which ties , in turn , to the grandest origin story of all : the history of Sunderland from the deep evolutionary past right up to the present day .It 's a lecture ; it 's an old - fashioned variety show .But do not be put off .This book has it all : romance and humor , fascinating history and serious moral argument , quirky characters from monks to miners to kings , a persistent ghost and a fight with a dragon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "130.97858"}
