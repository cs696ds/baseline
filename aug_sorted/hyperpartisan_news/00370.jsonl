Fred Strahorn ( D - Dayton ) in 2010 ) .Now , you 'll notice with Oeslager , the Republicans could release every one of these Senators and still pass SB 5 .Still , it 's noteworthy that this bill is going to have bipartisan opposition and potentially may only pass narrowly by a one - vote margin .Related Stories .Amazing .I saw Mark Weaver , GOP strategist now employed by the police and fire unions , on the WCMH4 Spectrum .He mentioned two points worth noting : . - When questioned on the transparency of JobsOhio , he stated that we should not have concerns about accountability because KASICH IS RUNNING THE ORGANIZATION .No kidding .- When asked about the Collective Bargaining HB5 , he stated that police and fire deserve special consideration over other unions .Remember , he is now employed by them .Someone should remind Weaver that the unions all hang together or they will all hang separately .Is the FOP and firefighters officially adopting Weaver 's position which is essentially playing into a GOP divide and conquer tactic ?Certainly self interest is a factor albeit short sighted , but as other unions are undermined , the safety forces will be next .Or did Weaver speak out of turn and go too far ?Anonymous .The FOP has traditionally operated independently from the other unions on matters of public policy , in my opinion , this is n't anything different .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.64847"}

{"text": "- Princess , 17 .Some people like their testicles ( \" balls \" ) , perineum ( the space between the testicles and anus ) or anus stimulated .\" Tea bagging \" is a term that refers to licking or sucking testicles .Cunnilingus .Cunnilingus involves licking and sucking the vulva : the inner and outer labia , the external clitoris , and can also involve the tongue and the vaginal opening and other areas .Like with fellatio , some people also like to combine it with manual sex , too , getting their hands or fingers involved at the same time .What parts of the vulva someone likes having stimulated during oral sex and how they like that stimulation is -- I know , here we go again ! -- going to vary from person to person .For instance , while plenty of people really like having their clitoral glans and hood directly stimulated during oral sex , for others , that feels like too much stimulation and tickles instead of feeling good .And some people will prefer sucking rather than licking , some the other way around , some both : it 's all over the map .Just like with fellatio , the best way to find out what you or your partner likes is to explore , experiment and communicate , keeping each other filled in with what feels good and what does n't .Ask questions , and pay attention to body language : if your partner likes what you 're doing , that 's what you keep doing if it also feels good to you .All in all , the best sex tip anyone can give you when it comes to a technique or practice like oral sex or intercourse is to learn to communicate with your partner .There is n't anything else that can help out as much as simply learning to voice our likes and dislikes , and hear and be responsive to what our partners tell us .On that note , no matter who is doing what to who , some people have a hard time hearing what someone does n't like , and feel very upset about getting what they take to be criticism during sex .It 's a good idea to try not to take that kind of feedback personally , and to remember that someone telling us what they do n't like is one of the ways we find out what they do like .As well , sex of any kind is always a place where we might here no just as often as yes .Note : With any kind of oral sex , sometimes people can get very excited and use their hands on a partner 's head , perhaps moving them more towards the area they 'd like stimulated , or pushing a partner to do whatever they 're doing more intensely .If you or a partner are going to do this , just do n't forget there 's a person there , someone who can gag or choke , or who might not like having their head held .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.58126"}
{"text": "For some teens , seeking an abortion is terrifying enough without piling on restrictions .Furthermore , Alaska is an extremely remote place - getting to another state with better abortion access might be particularly difficult and expensive .Such laws fundamentally make a lot of assumptions about how families are structured in America .Not every family has a mom , dad , two children , and a dog .More than a quarter of American children grow up in a single - parent household .( Of those , one - quarter live in poverty . )Plenty of children have fraught or dangerous relationships with their parents .Others live in custody of their grandparents or in foster care .By making laws on the assumption of nuclear families , we 're potentially putting young people in danger .I 'm not saying that girls should n't tell their parents if they 're having an abortion .Oftentimes moms or dads can be really supportive in helping their children through difficult decisions .When I went to my first abortion speak out earlier this year , several of the women talked about how their mothers took them to the clinic and sat with them through the procedure .But mandating such an interaction by law is n't taking into account the diversity of America .We ca n't make laws assuming that children are growing up in fundamentally safe , cookie cutter families .Could someone explain the difference between \" consent only \" and \" notification and consent \" ?( I 'm sorry if this is totally obvious ; I 'm drained from exam studying . )Also , I think parental notification laws are spectacularly asinine in light of the fact that if a minor has an actual BABY , they now have legal jurisdiction over that child , but somehow not their own body ?Agreed .Parental notification laws are misleading b / c families that are functional and have good communication do n't need notification requirements and families that are not working well are not going to be improved by forced \" notification \" or confrontation .Most of the time , a girl who does not want to inform her parents has a good reason for that and even if she does n't , it 's her call in her life , not that of the government or the voters .Whenever anyone tries to pretend that they 're motivated in this solely by the desire to foster good communication between minor girls and their parents , I ask them : . \" Suppose you had a young girl who was pregnant and wanted to keep the baby .She 's afraid to tell her parents because she thinks they 'll try to pressure her into having an abortion .Would you make her tell them ?\" This is about creating another roadblock to abortion .Nothing more , nothing less .@Heather : Your question stumped me too so I went ahead and called someone over at Guttmacher , Elizabeth Nash , who has been a saint in answering questions like this for me in my reporting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.86261"}

Mark Dayton outlined in his budget - and a statewide gas tax increase .But they quickly withdrew the plans once the governor reaffirmed his opposition to a gas tax increase .The new Senate plan removed both tax proposals - in the name of equity between the metro and greater Minnesota - and the proposed investment in roads , bridges and transit that would have come with them .Advocates expressed nearly universal disdain with the stripped - down bill when it appeared in Sen.

{"text": "There 's no sure way of determining how high your risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease through fellatio or cunnilingus is , because it varies .Because how high the risk is depends on so many different factors , there 's no way to accurately say that you 're going to be safe from getting an STD during fellatio or cunnilingus without a condom .It 's Not Just AIDS Or HIV That Can Be Spread .While HIV and AIDS are probably the most worrisome of viruses that you can contract from mouth to genital sex , they 're not the only ones .There are lots of different sexually transmitted diseases and infections : .That 's a pretty long list - and while some of these diseases can be treated with antibiotics , others ca n't and some can even contribute to throat and mouth cancers later on in life .Furthermore , be aware of the fact that you may not know someone has an STD - in fact , they may not even know it .They may not be displaying any symptoms at all , so it 's best to be safe and assume that you have a risk of contracting any of these diseases through oral sex at any time .Using A Condom Or A Dental Dam During Oral Sex Will Greatly Reduce Your Risk .If you want to reduce your risk of getting an STD during fellatio or cunnilingus , using a condom or a dental dam will make it much less likely that you would take anything home that you did n't want to .Here are some tips on how to make yourself safer when giving ( or receiving ) : .Wear a condom .Try flavored condoms or a flavored lube to make things taste better ( and they smell great ) and definitely avoid condoms that have spermicide on them .For cunnilingus , make sure that you use a dental dam .If you place a dab of lube underneath the dental dam on the clitoris and vulva , it will create real feeling sensations that are just as good - if not better - than unprotected fellatio or cunnilingus .Do n't use oil based lubricant at all .Oil based lubes will break down the latex and make the condom pretty much pointless .Get a fresh condom after anal sex or vaginal sex if you 're going to have mouth to genital sex .You do n't want to be using the same condom for fellatio as you did for vaginal or anal sex .Not only does that make the condom less effective , it 's a great way to spread lots of harmful bacteria .If you do n't have a dental dam on hand for cunnilingus , you can do one of two things .You can use a nice , large square of plastic food wrap , or you can cut a condom lengthwise and spread it out over the vulva .Either way is better and safer than using nothing at all .More Posts Like This One ... .Can I Get AIDS From Oral Sex ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.13104"}

{"text": "Julian .I do believe that schools are teaching sex - ed too late , because puberty usually begins in 6th-8th grade , learning about it in 8th grade wo n't help most people .In 5th grade , we learned the basic vocab and anatomy , but everything else was just being reintroduced in the grades after .People learning about the ' big picture ' in 9th grade is too late , people need to learn it in 6th grade at the latest , because things start happening earlier than 9th grade .Kids need to know what 's going to happen before , rather than during , or even after for some .Sure , they might not be mature and laugh about things , but better they learn earlier than later .Adanya G .Sex - ed should be taught around the 4th or 5th grade with parent 's permission .This way , kids can go into middle school and have knowledge of basic anatomy , childbirth , etc .If schools wait too long to teach sex ed , kids will already have had their own ideas about sex because of their maturity .I think it works better if you mature with knowledge rather than be clueless and learn things all at once .However , when students get to be in the 8th or 9th grade there should be a separate class where they learn about relationships and decisions about abstinence , safe sex , pregnancy , etc . .Isaiah G .I believe that sex ed is being taught at the correct time .Yes children might be physically mature but that does not mean they are mentally mature .Kids at a young age will know what sex and its effects are through school .In fact they might know more than what they will find in sex ed from day to day conversations .The majority of explicit teaching will be learned in 9th grade .I think this is an appropriate time for children to learn this material .Any sooner would be useless because most children do n't begin to get this extent of interest in the opposite sex until this stage in life . mario and tommy .I believe that starting sex ed in 4th-5th grade is too early . schools should start teaching it around 6th or 7th grade to get kids familiar with their bodies and what is happening with them .because in 4th and 5th we learned basic vocab which is fine but they started to teach us the big stuff in 9th grade which is when we are at a mature stage and things will really sink in now that we are in high school .I also think it should be the students choice whether or not they want to learn it in the school or with their parents , so they are most comfortable .lastly I think that kids should learn early enough so they have some knowledge but late enough that they are mature and have understanding of it .MAC .I think that sex needs to be taught earlier and differently .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.318596"}

{"text": "The sad thing for me is that most of the people who are pushing for a reversion back to the old policy are doing it for selfish reasons and do not have the benefit of the students in mind .I 'll explain what I mean by this .Most of those who are pushing for a reversion to the previous policy of teaching Science and Math either in BM or in a student 's mother tongue ( Chinese and Tamil ) are doing so because of ' nationalist ' reasons .I say this because of a few reasons .Firstly , the results for the first batch of students who have undergone 6 years of this policy and took their UPSR exams recently , have not been announced yet .These will be made public soon , according to the Minister .They may point to anecdotal evidence for this occurring but they would not have been able to back it up with the proper statistics .Other than the not very helpful suggestion of putting more resources into improving the teaching of English itself .My sense is that these groups would not protest one iota if the they got their way on the Science and Math issue and nothing is done about improving the quality of English courses in our schools .It seems a little ironic to me that the different ' nationalist ' groups , who are usually at each other 's throats , can unite over this issue because of their aversion to the policy of teaching Science and Math in English .I have a few thoughts on this issue after having a long conversation with a friend a few weeks back .I 'll share them with you here .They will continue to remain proficient in these languages .Their job prospects in the future will not be affected because they did not study Science and Math in their mother tongue .In addition , I do not suspect that the results of any of these students in Science and Math would have been greatly affected by this policy change .My rationale for this is simple .The results of students is affected much more by their home environment firstly and by the quality of teachers , secondly , regardless of what language they teach in .Students from families which are stable , middle class and who have degrees and / or are teachers themselves are likely to do better in school and in Science and Math compared to students from families which are less financially stable .Students from urban areas are much more likely to do better in school because they are likely to have better teachers in their schools .Let me give you a more concrete example .I have a friend who 's about to graduate from Duke .His family is from a semi - rural part of Selangor and he was from a Chinese primary school and a national secondary school were the main medium of communication was Chinese even though all of the subjects were taught in BM .He was a good student ( all A1s in his SPM except for Chinese ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.63767"}

{"text": "Most of those who are pushing for a reversion to the previous policy of teaching Science and Math either in BM or in a student 's mother tongue ( Chinese and Tamil ) are doing so because of ' nationalist ' reasons .I say this because of a few reasons .Firstly , the results for the first batch of students who have undergone 6 years of this policy and took their UPSR exams recently , have not been announced yet .These will be made public soon , according to the Minister .They may point to anecdotal evidence for this occurring but they would not have been able to back it up with the proper statistics .Other than the not very helpful suggestion of putting more resources into improving the teaching of English itself .My sense is that these groups would not protest one iota if the they got their way on the Science and Math issue and nothing is done about improving the quality of English courses in our schools .It seems a little ironic to me that the different ' nationalist ' groups , who are usually at each other 's throats , can unite over this issue because of their aversion to the policy of teaching Science and Math in English .I have a few thoughts on this issue after having a long conversation with a friend a few weeks back .I 'll share them with you here .They will continue to remain proficient in these languages .Their job prospects in the future will not be affected because they did not study Science and Math in their mother tongue .In addition , I do not suspect that the results of any of these students in Science and Math would have been greatly affected by this policy change .My rationale for this is simple .The results of students is affected much more by their home environment firstly and by the quality of teachers , secondly , regardless of what language they teach in .Students from families which are stable , middle class and who have degrees and / or are teachers themselves are likely to do better in school and in Science and Math compared to students from families which are less financially stable .Students from urban areas are much more likely to do better in school because they are likely to have better teachers in their schools .Let me give you a more concrete example .I have a friend who 's about to graduate from Duke .His family is from a semi - rural part of Selangor and he was from a Chinese primary school and a national secondary school were the main medium of communication was Chinese even though all of the subjects were taught in BM .He was a good student ( all A1s in his SPM except for Chinese ) .Because he could not get a JPA scholarship ( A2 in Chinese was his ' downfall ' ) , he looked for other avenues including applying to the United World College ( UWC ) system .He got the scholarship but it was clear to him that his preparation as well as his standard of English was nowhere near those who applied and also got this scholarship .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.79875"}

Republican Party are not for the purpose of helping minorities as pretextually claimed .In addition , these plans are not being proposed even to help the Republican Party overall .Rather , these plans are being promoted by these parties for the ulterior purpose of helping certain specific individuals and certain specific areas of the State at the expense of other specific individuals and other specific areas of the State .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.90232"}

{"text": "I am not an expert , but ..... per Planned Parenthood v. Casey ( 1992 ) , before viability , a woman can have an abortion pretty much unfettered .The case also held that if an undue burden on a woman 's right to have an abortion exists then the law is invalid .A law placing an undue burden is one where the purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before viability .Personal opinions about SCOTUS abortion decisions aside , I believe that most federal judges would not have a hard time deciding that a law preventing a 19 year old from taking her 17 year old friend to another state for an abortion equals a substantial obstacle .C.A.G. .This responds to the first comment above .I 'm no federal prosecutor , but suppose that two teenage friends live a mile apart , but each on a different side of a state line .The first teenager drives over to the second one 's house , picks her up , without her parents ' knowledge , and drives her to his house , where they do their homework together .Is he guilty of violating the federal kidnapping statute ?If not , is this different from the abortion scenario ?Re the undue burden notion , consider the constitutionality of the parental notification requirement itself .Would that requirement be constitutional if enacted in Hawaii , where most minors clearly lack the resources to travel across aany state line to a more lenient state ?I ca n't imagine an analysis that goes \" Well , a parental notification requirement would be an undue burden in Hawaii , but in your state that requirement is not an undue burden because unlike a Hawaiian you can just nip across the state line .\" I imagine parental notification laws have been ajudicated and found to be constitutional .That being the case , this proposed law would not itself constitute an undue burden .\" This law is probably constitutional , unless you see the \" right to privacy \" and the \" right to travel \" as trumping the commerce clause . \"Sigh .... thus the problem with the Commerce Clause .I 'm not sure that , once the government has the power under the commerce clause to regulate interstate abortions , that any individual right here exists that would n't kill a state 's right ( reverse incorporation analysis ? ) to enforce the consent law in the first place .But its a more open question than it first appears : .The only difference is the consent law directs the doctor 's behavior , and the state has th while the federal law affects the behavior of individuals .Doctors can be regulated under the state 's ability to regulate medicine , right up to the line of Casey .Now , if one can just hop across state lines , those laws are rendered meaningless , which either is the saving grace of federalism or the need to invoke the Neccesary and Proper and Commerce Clauses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.34454"}

CASEY , ET AL : upholding state 's right to require minors to provide proof of parental consent so long as there is a judicial bypass option .But can the federal government impose a parental consent requirement , particularly one without any judicial bypass option ?Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth struck down an absolute parental consent requirement within the first 12 weeks .Correction : the parental consent requirement struck down in Danforth was not absolute ; it could be waived if a physician certified that the abortion was necessary to save the life of the mother .Full case cite : Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth 428 U.S. 52 ( 1976 ) .IT seems that Federal action to prevent one State from subverting another State 's parental notification statute places no further burden on the pregnant minor .However , a parental notification statute is unconstitutional unless there is a right to Court review .Likewise , it seems that this statute must be subject to Court review .In some areas , it is very difficult ( maybe impossible ? ) to obtain an abortion without travelling across State lines .If the minor does not have the right to appeal to a Court , which can absolve her of the need to tell her parents , it seems that the statute would be unconstitutional , at least as applied in an area where abortion services are not readily available .Assuming the act is a valid exercise of the Commerce Clause the issue is whether it violates Casey 's undue burden test .In Bellotti v. Baird , the Court upheld such consent requirements in an effort to balance parental autonomy and a minor 's reproductive autonomy .We could argue all day about how realistic a judicial by - pass procedure is , but it nominally recognizes a minor 's interest in reproductive autonomy ( albeit a very limited one ) .If this Act did not have a health exception , I think it would have failed the undue burden test since you could imagine a situation in which a minor was away from home and needed an abortion for health reasons .The health of the mother is the second of Roe 's twin aims , and the rationale for why the partial birth abortion ban was struck down in Stenberg v. Carhart .Regardless , the drafters of the Act did their homework and included such an exception .I find it unlikely that a federal law that merely requires a minor to satisfy the requirements of her home state ( which are constitutional ) will cross Casey 's undue burden threshold .As far as right to travel goes , I think the issue is whether this right applies to minors at all .My guess is that it does n't .The Court has been very deferential to parents in matters relating to upbringing of children .See e.g. Wisconsin v.

{"text": "Will senators join the House - or scuttle a bill that is anathema to urban teachers ' unions ?The House 's modest cap lift targets the state 's lowest - performing districts , allowing charter spending to increase by 5 percent over five years , starting in the fall of 2017 .The short - to - medium term effect would mean more charter school slots offered by proven providers in Boston , Fall River , Holyoke , Chelsea , Greenfield , and North Adams .Developed by House Education chair Alice Peisch and given a crucial push by Speaker Robert DeLeo , the legislation addresses several oft - invoked concerns about charters .Some opponents assert that charter students do well principally because they have knowledgeable , involved parents , as evidenced by the fact that they entered their children in the lottery for a charter slot .That claim does n't hold water ; two rigorous academic studies have controlled for the involved - parents factor by comparing the educational pr ogress of kids who won a charter slot with those who applied but did n't get a spot .Although both groups had involved parents , the charter students did significantly better over time .Still , those objections persist .Thus the lotteries for the new charter slots must include all eligible pupils ; slot winners can then opt out if they want .Such a lottery should also result in a charter - school student body with the same rough percentage of English language learners as the district schools .Alternatively , new charters could specifically target drop - outs or students at risk of dropping out .Opponents charge that charters do better through the attrition of struggling students ; the House bill includes a preference for charter operators with attrition rates that compare favorably with the traditional public schools .When efforts for a joint House - Senate bill collapsed earlier this spring , one of the big objections of Sonia Chang - Diaz , Senate chair of the Education Committee , was that the charter - school reimbursement formula has n't always been fully funded .But the Legislature has now fully funded the formula for this fiscal year .The House 's budget calls for funding it at about 77 percent next year ; Peisch says that percentage will probably increase .But again , even if it does n't , traditional schools will get a relatively generous payment , extended over six years , for students they no longer educate .By contrast , if a student leaves a charter , the charter loses all of his or her dollars the very next quarter .None of that is likely to placate the Boston Teachers Union , its counterparts in other cities , or the American Federation of Teachers , Massachusetts .Meanwhile , the AFL - CIO has warned legislators that it will be watching their votes on this issue .But it 's time to get down to brass tacks here .Clear away the fog and the smokescreens , and the real issues for the unions clearly center on self - interest .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.35814"}

{"text": "More are likely .Elizabeth Marquardt went on to look at how the global redefinition of parenthood threatens a child 's identity .She asked : .Why should we be concerned about the many rulings , laws and proposals around the world that are aimed at redefining parenthood ?A good society protects the interests of its most vulnerable citizens , especially children .Right now , the institution that is most core to children 's very survival - that of parenthood - is being fundamentally redefined with the state giving its implicit support and at times leading the way .The common thread running through many of these decisions is the adult 's right to a child .These claims are important .The desire for a child is a powerful force held deep in the soul .This desire must be responded to with respect and compassion .The claim that medicine and society should help those who can not bear children is a legitimate one .But the rights and needs of adults who wish to bear children are not the only part of the story .Children , too , have rights and needs .The authors of the convention understood several key features necessary to human identity , security and flourishing - having a name , being a citizen of a nation whose laws protect you , and , whenever possible , being raised by the two people whose physical union made you .Adults who support the use of new technologies to bear children sometimes say that biology does not matter to children , that all children need is a loving family .Yet biology clearly matters to the adults who go to extreme lengths -undergoing high - risk medical procedures ; procuring eggs , sperm , or wombs from strangers ; and paying a lot of money - to create a child genetically related to a least one of them .In a striking contradiction , these same people will often insist that the child 's biological relationship to an absent donor father or mother should not really matter to the child .Of course , there is a very real and urgent role for the state to play in defining parenthood .Some biological parents present a danger to their children .Adoption is a pro - child social institution that finds parents for children who desperately need them .It is a highly admirable expression of altruistic love , a kind of love that transcends our hard- wired tendencies to protect our blood relations above all others .But the existence of legal adoption was never intended to support the argument that children do n't care who their fathers and mothers are , or to justify the planned separation of children from biological mothers and fathers before the children are even conceived .Certainly , biology is not everything .It does not and should not determine the full extent or depth of human relationships .Biological parents are tragically capable of harming their children , and some children are better off removed from these parents .But the actions and testimony of children and adults , as well as a great deal of social science evidence , powerfully suggest that biology does matter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.09599"}

{"text": "( There 's a great post on this over on Shahrukh is Love , by the way ) .The 70s ended fairly well for Dharmendra , as I noted in my previous post in this series ... he finally married his paramour , Hema Malini , and although his output declined a little , the films he did make were modestly successful .He started out the 80s with 5 films released in 1980 : Chunaoti , The Burning Train , Ram Balram , Shalimar and Ali Baba Aur 40 Chor .( He also made a special appearance in Insaaf Ka Tarazu . )Despite the enormous expense that apparently went into making the film , it was very poorly received , but has since become something of a cult classic .Ali Baba Aur 40 Chor , based on the popular legend , was another international collaboration - this time with Russian partners .I LOVE this movie , and not just because of Dharmendra .Unfortunately , Indian audiences seem to have been less than impressed , as the film did not fare particularly well at the box office .Ram Balram , another 1980 release , was notable for reuniting Dharmendra with his Sholay co - star Amitabh Bachchan in a film about two brothers , ' ek chor , ek sipahee ' .Dharam played the crook of course , and Amitabh the cop , while Ajit played their abusive and controlling uncle .Zeenat Aman ( again ) and Rekha co - starred as their love interests .Ram Balram is really not a good film in my opinion , but I found it watchable - mostly for Ajit 's camp performance and the way Dharam and Amitabh hilariously cower away from him at the slightest threat .Quite amusing .The film is a bit boring though , the storyline is full of holes , Dharam and Zeenat 's chemistry falls a little flat , and the attempt to recreate the magic of ' Yeh Dosti ' was manful but just not good enough .For what it is though , it 's not too bad .So , although a couple of Dharmendra 's 1980 releases did not live up to their blockbuster billing , it was a good year for him movie - wise - a good start to the decade .Moving on to 1981 , and Dharmendra 's more notable releases included Aas Paas ( one of his more noteworthy romances opposite Hema Malini - also notable for having Mohammed Rafi 's last recorded song on its soundtrack ) and Professor Pyarelal , which Memsaab reviewed wonderfully here .He also had a fun , dance - y cameo in the ' John Jaani Janardhan ' song from Naseeb ( the inspiration for Farah Khan 's ' Deewangi Deewangi ' number from Om Shanti Om ) .Dharmendra 's first release of 1983 was Razia Sultan - notable for many things , one of which is the sensual ' Khwaab Bankar Koi Aayega ' , picturised on Hema Malini and Parveen Babi with hints of same - sex eroticism .It was also the last film to be written and directed by Kamal Amrohi , who also wrote and directed the classic tragedy Pakeezah .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.4515"}

{"text": "Q1 .Who led the Common Core State Standards Initiative ? A. The Common Core was a grassroots initiative initiated by state governors and Superintendents in 2007 .The nation 's governors and education commissioners , through their representative organizations , the National Governors Association ( NGA ) and the Council of Chief State School Officers ( CCSSO ) led the development of the Common Core State Standards and continue to lead the initiative .Teachers , parents , school administrators and experts from across the country together with state leaders have provided input into the development of the standards .Q2 .What are core standards ? A. Core or educational standards help teachers ensure their students have the skills and knowledge they need to be successful by providing clear goals for student learning .Standards are concepts that need to be taught , such as a ddition of fractions in mathematics , and the grade level where they should be taught .Q3 .What is the difference between standards and curriculum ? A. Standards are the required skills and concepts for the students to achieve .Curriculum include the materials and content that is used to teach the standards .Q4 .Who chooses / adopts state standards and curriculum ? A. The Utah Constitution designates to the Utah State School Board the responsibility to choose state standards .Local school boards and the Utah Legislature do not .Local school boards and schools select the curriculum , which is generally the textbook or program for delivering the standards .Local school teams and individual teachers choose the everyday lesson content .The Federal Government has no say in either standards , curriculum or everyday lesson content .Utah State Code states in 53A-1 - 402.6 .The Utah Code also spells out local school board control of materials : . \"( 4 ) Local school boards shall design their school programs , that are supported by generally accepted scientific standards of evidence , to focus on the core curriculum standards with the expectation that each program will enhance or help achieve mastery of the core curriculum standards .( 5 ) Except as provided in Section 53A-13 - 101 , each school may select instructional materials and methods of teaching , that are supported by generally accepted scientific standards of evidence , that it considers most appropriate to meet core curriculum standards .Q5 .Are the standards internationally benchmarked ?Yes .International benchmarking played a significant role in both sets of standards .In fact , the college and career ready standards include an appendix listing the evidence that was consulted in drafting the standards and the international data used in the benchmarking process . Q6 .Does the federal government play a role in Common Core standards implementation ? A. \" The Federal Government had no role in the development of the Common Core State Standards and will not have a role in their implementation .The Common Core State Standards Initiative is a state - led effort that is not part of No Child Left Behind and adoption of the standards is in no way mandatory .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.98265"}

{"text": "Will Utah taxpayers have to pay more money to implement the new Utah Core Standards ? A. The Utah State Board of Education regularly updates the Utah Core Standards .The funding for the implementation of this latest set of standards will not cost Utah taxpayers additional money .The professional development that takes place in the districts will remain at the same level it has for the past decade ; the only change will be the content focus .School districts are concerned with their ability to provide the technology and infrastructure necessary to support electronic testing associated with the new SAGE assessment of the Utah Core Standards .The Utah Legislature has not raised taxes to fund this change .Provo City School District supports the advancement of student access to technology and related programs and has been using existing local and state funding to move in this direction .Q8 .How does the local school board fit into the Common core ? A. School Board powers and duties generally , according to State Code 53A-3 - 402 . Q9 .Do these standards incorporate both content and skills ? A.Yes . \"The remaining crucial decisions about what content should be taught are left to state and local determination .In addition to content coverage , the Common Core State Standards require that students systematically acquire knowledge in literature and other disciplines through reading , writing , speaking , and listening .Taken together , these elements support a student 's ability to learn and apply more demanding math concepts and procedures .The middle school and high school standards call on students to practice applying mathematical ways of thinking to real world issues and challenges ; they prepare students to think and reason mathematically .Q10 .Do the math standards cover all the key math topics in the proper sequence ? A. The mathematical progressions presented in the Common Core State Standards are coherent and based on evidence .Part of the problem with having 50 different sets of state standards is that different states cover different topics at different grade levels .Coming to consensus guarantees that from the viewpoint of any given state , topics will move up or down in the grade level sequence .This is unavoidable .What is important to keep in mind is that the progression in the Common Core State Standards is mathematically coherent and leads to college and career readiness at an internationally competitive level .Q11 .What requirements do the Common Core State Standards give to teachers ? A.

{"text": "Yet , while listening to our leaders in Tallahassee , as well as many here locally , it seems the Constitution is rarely considered in their talk about parent rights and student rights , specifically with regard to what options and control parents have in schools . \"Specifically , I am referring to our Lee County , FL school district 's stance on parent rights to opt out of testing .\" This quote is taken directly from our district directive that further implies the only control a parent has is to choose public or private schools .I can not disagree strongly enough with this statement .This misinterpretation of the 14th Amendment infuriates me .Our Constitution is clearly defined and gives specific rights to parents which has been upheld in court precedence .To borrow from Fair Test , a national organization ran by Lee Cty local advocate , Robert Schaeffer , here is a more correct interpretation of the 14th Amendment , with regard to parenting : . \"According to the U.S Constitution , specifically the 14th Amendment , parental rights are broadly protected by Supreme Court decisions ( Meyer and Pierce ) , especially in the area of education .The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that parents possess the \" fundamental right \" to \" direct the upbringing and education of their children .Furthermore , The Supreme Court criticized a state legislature for trying to interfere \" with the power of parents to control the education of their own . \"( Meyer v. Nebraska , 262 U.S. 390 , 402 . )In Meyer , the Supreme Court held that the right of parents to raise their children free from unreasonable state interference is one of the unwritten \" liberties \" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment .( 262 U.S. 399 ) .Like the Supreme Court who criticized a state legislature for trying to interfere \" with the power of parents to control the education of their own \" , I also suggest our school district reconsider its position on parent rights .Lee County is lucky to have an active community , highly involved in our school system .And , while involvement often leads to greater accountability , it is exactly what we strive for here in Lee County .It is the true definition of local control and I know that is what Lee County residents want .It is certainly the wish of every parent : not just local control over their schools , but especially , local parental control over their children .To expect less of our community is not reasonable . \"So , as I try to always offer solutions , here are a couple .Firstly , I would solve the problem of parent concern by redrafting the district position on parent rights to fully recognize the rights of our local parents , more correctly honoring the 14th Amendment of our Constitution .Let our local parents know we understand their concerns with the overtesting and scripted curriculum .Let our parents know that we appreciate their activism and we know that only through the combined voices of board members , parents , and citizens will we get relief from the overbearing mandates from the state and feds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.29523"}

EQUAL POPULATION Equality of population of legislative and congressional districts insofar as is practicable is the goal of reapportionment and redistricting . A. Legislative districts will be drawn to achieve substantial equality of population among the various districts .As a general proposition , deviations from the \" ideal district \" population should be justified either as a result of the limitations of census geography , or as a result of the promotion of a rational state policy .In any case , the relative population deviation for any legislative district should not exceed plus or minus 2 % .B. Congressional Districts .The apportionment clause of Article I , Section 2 of the United States Constitution requires that the population of each congressional district to be as nearly equal in population as practicable to the other Congressional districts within the State .Therefore , a Congressional redistricting plan should produce districts which are mathematically equal in population or which produce the lowest overall range practicable .When the redistricting process began , the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Reapportionment adopted a + 2 % deviation standard for its legislative plans .This tolerance ensured that equality of representation was given high priority while allowing sufficient flexibility to allow for compliance with the subcommittee 's other criteria ( i.e. respecting the integrity of precincts ) .II .The subcommittee has actively sought to comply with all requirements of the Voting Rights Act .The subcommittee has drawn every electable black majority district possible .We have followed the instructions of the U.S. Supreme Court in Thornburg v.

{"text": "The Hon .DON HARWIN [ 10.28 p.m. ] : The Miscellaneous Acts Amendment ( Same Sex Relationships )Bill 2008 is aptly named because there are three quite distinct parts and I want to talk about all three .But given the time and the fact that we have heard a large number of very good speeches on the bill today I will but briefly do so .In Victoria , Western Australia , Queensland , Tasmania and the Northern Territory those protections are already in anti - discrimination or equivalent legislation .Those protections will now be available to gays and lesbians in de facto relationships in New South Wales .I refer to a particularly good publication by the Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby on this bill .At page three the paper deals with some of the consequences when there is no specific mention of homosexual de facto couples .The Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby states : . currently existing \" homosexuality \" ground can be used ( and has been used ) to provide a remedy to someone who has been discriminated against because they are in a same - sex relationship .This is because being in a homosexual relationship is arguably part and parcel of being homosexual .In many cases , discrimination against someone who is in a same - sex relationship is discrimination against the person 's homosexuality .Further down it states : .In other words , legal technicalities could stand in the way of providing sensible relief to an otherwise deserving couple who are discriminated against .Reducing the opportunities for lawyers to play legal gymnastics means that deserving plaintiffs will be treated fairly in discrimination cases at a minimal cost .Those two extracts from the excellent paper by the Gay and Lesbian Rights Lobby outlines the practical benefits for same - sex couples from these most welcome changes to the Anti - Discrimination Act , which are outlined in schedule 1 .Schedule 3 of this bill makes changes to more than 50 pieces of legislation , both Acts and regulations , in order to include same - sex couples in the definition of \" de facto \" relationship .These changes vary in both purpose and consequence , but again are of direct relevance to both gay and lesbian couples - unlike the third section of the bill , which I will come to shortly .The first and largest category either imposes obligations or requires disclosure on same - sex de facto partners by including them in the existing definition .The second category confers on a same - sex de facto partner a new right or entitlement .The affected Acts and regulations include the Sydney Cricket Ground and Sydney Football Stadium By - Law 2004 , the Drug and Alcohol Treatment Act 2007 , the Crimes ( Administration of Sentences )Regulation 2001 and , perhaps of most significance , the Industrial Relations Act 1996 .In the Industrial Relations Act the change grants same - sex de facto couples access to parental leave during the first year of their child 's life .This is the only real change in schedule 3 that has attracted much attention .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.0645"}

{"text": "Despite these findings , public opinion has consistently reflected a deep ambivalence toward the notion of providing confidential reproductive health services to minors .At the same time , surveys , polling data and voting patterns suggest that the public 's attitudes are also complex and even unsettled .Almost all parents , however , expected at least one negative consequence as the result of such a policy- with six in 10 citing increases in teen pregnancies and STDs - and approximately half expected at least five negative consequences .The more harms parents could associate with parental involvement laws , the less likely they were to support such policies .This led the authors to conclude that public education campaigns focusing on the potential outcomes of parental involvement laws are likely to broaden public support for minors ' right to confidentiality .With respect to abortion , a decade 's worth of public polling on the issue suggests that the public favors mandated parental involvement by a margin of three to one .When the issue has been put directly to the voters , however , these margins are reduced .And although two statewide ballot initiatives requiring parental notification for abortion have passed ( Colorado in 1998 and Florida in 2004 ) , an initiative in Oregon was defeated in 1990 .Recent surveys of likely voters in California reveal that the public is closely divided on a parental notification ballot initiative to be voted upon in November .Notwithstanding ambivalence among the general public , medical , public health and youth - serving organizations familiar with the research in this area have consistently come out against laws and policies requiring mandatory parental involvement for both contraceptive and abortion services .These organizations - made up of the professionals who study and work most closely with teens - include the American Academy of Family Physicians , the American Academy of Pediatrics , the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , the American Medical Association and the Society for Adolescent Medicine , among others .At the same time , however , they uniformly state that minors should not be compelled to involve their parents in their decision to obtain contraceptives or an abortion , reaffirming the right of minors to access and receive confidential care ( see box ) .What the Future Holds .To be sure , the notion of providing confidential reproductive health services to minors remains under attack at the state and federal levels .Legislators in seven states have introduced bills in 2005 requiring parental consent or notification for family planning services .Similarly , the Parents ' Right to Know Act - legislation that would require Title X - supported family planning clinics to notify the parents of any minor seeking contraceptives at least five days before dispensing a method - is pending in Congress .In California , a major ballot initiative will go before the voters in November that would amend the state constitution to require health care providers to notify parents or guardians 48 hours before they perform an abortion on an unmarried minor .( The measure includes an exception for medical emergencies and when a parent or guardian signs a waiver allowing the procedure to happen sooner . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.51401"}

{"text": "In Australia , as elsewhere , most young people who were conceived with donor sperm were never told the truth by their parents .To help offset the potential shock , the state government in Victoria has proposed a public advertising campaign warning all young adults that they could be contacted by a sperm donor father they never knew about .Meanwhile , in the United States the field of reproductive technology continues in an almost unregulated environment .All too frequently courts must decide who a child 's parents are , picking and choosing among the many adults who might be involved in planning , conceiving , birthing and raising a child .In Pennsylvania a judge recently had to decide parentage in a case in which a surrogate mother carried triplets for a 62-year - old man and his 60-year - old girlfriend .When the couple failed to pick up the infants , the hospital initiated steps to put them in foster care .In response , and eventually with the judge 's approval , the surrogate mother took the children home and began raising them as her own .But the commissioning couple continues to fight for access to the children ( and the 62-year - old man has been ordered to pay child support ) , while the college student who contributed her eggs for their conception asserted her parental rights as well .Recently the California State Supreme Court heard three cases of lesbian couples who had used sperm donors to have children and then split up .In these cases the non - biological mother figure ( none of whom had adopted the child ) was either denied access to the child or wished to have no further financial obligations to the child .The courts ruled in all three cases that the non - biological mother figure is like a child 's father and should be granted full parental status and held to the same standard of rights and responsibilities .The outcome has potentially far - reaching implications not just for same - sex couples but also for the many heterosexual couples in stepfamilies , as well as those who might use reproductive technology or temporarily raise children together without marriage , adoption or other legal arrangements .In fact , today same - sex couples , adoptive parents , singles and infertile couples using donors now routinely petition to have one or both biological parents left off the birth certificate - and even to have non - biological parent figures included without going through the process of adoption .In Quebec , when a woman in a same - sex civil union gives birth , her female partner is presumed to be the father and can be registered as the father on the child 's birth certificate .A similar ruling was recently made in Ontario .The state of California shows a \" second mother \" to be entered on the birth certificate as the child 's father .Earlier this year , Virginia issued a birth certificate to a lesbian adoptive couple that reads \" Parent 1 \" and \" Parent 2 \" , after the couple rejected having one of their names put in the blank space under \" father \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.920166"}

{"text": "It 's not impossible by any means , but public school is just not an infallible prescription for socialization .Why ?In reality , the child is likely to adopt the behaviors of the children he hangs around with the most , whether those behaviors are desirable or not .I would add that what the child learns at home from his parents influences how well the child picks his friends and therefore which behaviors he observes and emulates the most .Additionally , when the child brings a particular behavior home and puts it into practice , his parents ' reaction to it has a tremendous influence on whether that behavior is retained by the child .Furthermore , the child in public school does not get much opportunity to interact with children much older than them .How often do elementary - age children get to interact socially with high schoolers ?Of course I realize that a child can go through public school and come out perfectly socialized and able to interact appropriately with others .But I propose that those public school children who are successful at learning socialization do so mostly because of the influence of home .Why Is Homeschooling Good for Socialization ?In my opinion , homeschooling is an ideal place to learn socialization .One of the reasons is that homeschooled children are generally around adults more often .Ideally , this results in a child adopting appropriate socialization behaviors .Furthermore , homeschooling also offers the child a more limited , yet at the same time a more expanded pool of behaviors to observe .Since the child 's \" class \" is his family , he is ( ideally ) not exposed to as many of the undesirable behaviors he might have observed in a public school classroom and is therefore not given as much opportunity to emulate those undesirable behaviors .Alternatively , a homeschooled child is often introduced to a wide range of behaviors through field trips , homeschool support groups , and other outside activities .This interaction with adults and children both older and younger than himself which gives him the opportunity to observe and interact with a wide variety of people , not just children his own age as occurs in a public school classroom setting .While this may mean he is sometimes exposed to behaviors that are undesirable , the parents are often available to offer immediate feedback and to discuss the situation .As a minor example , my own children participated in a homeschool group this last year , and it happened every week that the younger kids ( 5 - 10 ) were playing with the older kids ( 10 - 14 ) and interacting just fine .There were n't any stigmas that the older kids could n't associate with the younger kids as often exist in public school .In my opinion , that 's a perfect example of well - socialized behavior .So although a child can learn socialization in a public school setting , I believe proper socialization skills can be learned more easily in a homeschool setting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.95721"}

Kenneth Donnelly , of Arlington , and Sen. Jason Lewis , of Winchester , suggested more care must be taken to study why best practices in charter schools are n't being replicated more often in traditional district schools .Jehlen said the money proposed for expanding charters would be better put towards early education , and several senators expressed concern that they could n't see the \" end game \" and worried about creating two competing public school systems .While much of the focus of the debate was on charter schools , the bills also included measures to help struggling schools on the brink of being labeled \" underperforming \" develop turnaround plans to avoid more serious state interventions .Rep.

{"text": "The belief that anal stimulation , especially intercourse , has to hurt is a persistent and dangerous myth .Just as pain anywhere in the body indicates that something is wrong , so is the same true of the anal area .With its high concentration of nerve endings , the anus can produce extreme agony when it is mistreated .Yet it can be a source of great pleasure .When a finger , object or penis is intorduced into the anus , the anal muscles go into spasm , as if fighting off an invasion .Pain will result if the partners do not wait for these muscles to relax .Under sufficient stress they will eventually collapse and the pain subside , unless further damage is done .But , any ' pleasure ' afforded from this kind of activity derives mostly from the absence of discomfort .Maximum anal pleasure requires the elimination of all pain or physical trauma from the anal experience .Self - protection on the part of the passive partner involves being ready to say \" no \" until he or she is ready to proceed .Readiness is a combination of physical relaxation , usually helped along by plenty of leisurely anal touching , and desire .Occasionally the anal muscles are relaxes , but the passive partner is still not in the mood .Stimulation should mount only in proportion to the degree of receptivity .Anal sex can be enjoyed even if it has been consistently uncomfortable in the past .Sufficient desire alone does not necessarily guarantee pleasurable anal sex .Nor is an uncomfortable previous experience always the reason for a lack of interest in or desire for anal sex .Chronic anal tension is the most common cause of anal discomfort during sex .Hemorrhoids and constipation are usually a sign of this condition .Tension can be relieved by touching the anus and becoming more familiar with it .An ideal time to explore the anal opening is while taking a shower or bath .Deep breathing also affects the anal muscles .Tensing the anus and the letting go in another way of learning to relax it .Anyone who enjoys masturbation might want to experiment with some form of anal stimulation , though he or she should stop if any discomfort occurs .For many people the turning point in anal sex is when they allow a partner to massage the anus with the understanding that intercourse will not be attempted .Then the recipient of anal caresses can concentrate solely on the pleasure that this erogenous zone is capable of generating .Two muscle rings called sphincters surround the anal opening .Each functions independently .If you insert a finger about one half - inch into your anus and press your fingertip against the side , you can clearly feel the two sphincter muscles .There is less than a quarter - inch between them .The external sphincter is controlled by the central nervous system - just like the muscles of the hand , for example .You can readily tense and relax this sphincter whenever you want .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.45764"}

{"text": "\" In my experience conversing with pro - reform academics dismayed by the pushback against their policies by practitioners and patrons , the issue of Common Core usually comes up .Even after we teachers had seen students denied high school diplomas because they could not pass college readiness exit exams , I would hear the claims by some who still believed that Common Core only applied to math and English .Later , policy people protested that very few 3rd graders have been denied promotion due to Common Core tests .In doing so , they ignore the obvious reality that it was the Opt Out movement and the grassroots anti-\"reform \" counter - attack that prevented the full implementation of Common Core high stakes tests that would have been disastrous .So , I 'd add a concrete point to Henig 's commentary .An academic who wants to help improve schools should at least see how well he fares on a Common Core GED high school equivalency math test before assuming that our positions are simplistic .Researchers involved in the Gates Foundation 's \" Measures of Effective Teaching \" study from 2009 claimed the study found that teachers are best evaluated using a formula that combines multiple measures when the research actually found no such thing .Greene links to specific misstatements issued by the Gates Foundation , but I would make a more general point .The MET methodology would have been beneficial if the Gates Foundation had acknowledged what it was actually conducting - theoretical research .It was hopelessly inappropriate for policy research .I still find it hard to believe that academics would bring no more than regression models to a real - world fight against the legacies of poverty and discrimination .Why would they assume that statistical models could capture the complexities of urban education ?Oakes cites John Dewey in urging academics to embrace \" the ' hurly burly ' of social policymaking . \"She explains that , \" Education policymaking must negotiate strongly held public perceptions and contested political terrain - factors usually far more influential than research findings .\" Oakes then encourages public scholars to \" nurture trusting and respectful relationships with policymakers and public actors .These are not one - way relationships , but reflexive . \" Rick Hess adds that there are multiple \" right way(s ) to think about education . \"Hess affirms that , \" Parents , students , community leaders , journalists , and more all have their own legitimate , valuable perspectives . \"He notes , \" This robust pluralism is the very foundation of the American project . \" Hess is correct that \" scholars have an important role to play in that democratic cacophony , though far too few play it enthusiastically or well . \"Moreover , \" public debates and decisions benefit when all of our talents are brought to the table .\" Academics must \" connect with and learn from their fellow citizens .I would add that academics need to learn from each other when they engage in policy research .For the life of me , I ca n't understand why so much faith was placed in regression models , and how scholars seemed to believe they could advance policy studies without thrashing out old - fashioned falsifiable hypotheses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.832565"}

{"text": "Recently , advocates for the parental right to kill unwanted newborns have appeared in the forms of Drs .Alberto Giubilini and Francesca Minerva , whose paper for the Australian Journal of Medical Ethics advocates \" after birth abortion . \"Giubilini 's and Minerva 's main argument consists of the relentless logic which pro - life advocates predicted would be an eventual consequence of the Roe v. Wade decision by the Supreme Court of the U.S. in 1973 .That decision essentially permitted abortion on demand throughout the entire nine months of gestation .Pro - life advocates predicted that the arguments in favor of abortion could just as easily be applied to newborns and the elderly as well as any other \" undesirable \" group of human beings .The decision set morality concerning human life tumbling down a slippery slope , they argued .If a fetus could be declared not human or deserving of rights , then newborns ' lives would also be jeopardized -- to say nothing of the elderly and chronically ill .The slippery slope argument has long been scorned by the liberal left , who adamantly denied that born human beings would also eventually be subject to death sentences handed out to the unborn .Preposterous , the left cried .A logical fallacy !Never would happen ! \"B \" does not follow \" A \" !But Giubilini and Minerva have used the slippery slope argument in favor of infanticide , thereby showing that pro - life advocates correctly predicted such a logical development .Among the arguments the doctors utilize : .A serious philosophical problem arises when the same conditions that would have justified abortion become known after birth .In such cases , we need to assess facts in order to decide whether the same arguments that apply to killing a human fetus can also be consistently applied to killing a newborn human .There are , after all , the good doctors argue , abnormalities which can not be detected until after birth .Such deformities render the child 's life \" not worth living . \"To those who protest that children with physical and/or mental handicaps can lead quite happy lives , Giubilini and Minerva reply : .None the less , to bring up such children might be an unbearable burden on the family and on society as a whole , when the state economically provides for their care .On these grounds , the fact that a fetus has the potential to become a person who will have an ( at least ) acceptable life is no reason for prohibiting abortion .Therefore , we argue that , when circumstances occur after birth such that they would have justified abortion , what we call after birth abortion should be permissible .Both doctors go on to write that the newborn and the fetus are morally equivalent .Both are human beings and \" potential persons , \" but since neither is in the position of attributing any value to his or her existence or able to articulate any aims in life , neither is a person .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.440186"}

{"text": "I must say even the bill 's title reference to \" Miscellaneous Acts Amendment \" seems lacking in courage , but it would be pointless to detain the House by quibbling that small point .In conclusion , of course I support this bill .I believe that it rights a terrible wrong .The Hon .MATTHEW MASON - COX [ 9.05 p.m. ] : I speak on the Miscellaneous Acts Amendment ( Same Sex Relationships ) Bill 2008 .I note the many contributions so far on the bill .It has been very enlightening to hear those views .The stated object of the bill is to amend certain Acts , regulations and instruments to make further provision in relation to their application to de facto relationships within the meaning of the Property ( Relationships )Act 1984 .In particular , the bill amends the Anti - Discrimination Act 1977 , the Status of Children Act 1996 and the Births , Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1995 , as well as various other Acts and instruments .The bill proposes to amend a total of 57 other Acts .Many of these amendments address discrimination experienced by same - sex couple families .Indeed , I can not in all conscience fault changes that achieve many of these practical results .Some of these amendments are long overdue .There have been similar changes in most States and at the Commonwealth level .Commonwealth amendments last year eliminated discrimination in areas such as superannuation and taxation .With respect to the Commonwealth amendments , I note the comment of the Attorney - General , Robert McClelland , who on 1 May stated : .Whilst we support a system of registration of same - sex relationships , we do n't support an arrangement that mimics marriage .We 're focusing on substance over form .We are removing discrimination from Commonwealth laws that have a real and practical impact on people in same - sex relationships .I support amendments to laws that discriminate against people in same - sex relationships in this manner .However , in my view some of the issues raised by the bill involve some of the same aspects as same - sex marriage and adoption .The bill goes further than the earlier amendments in that it moves away from issues purely of property , tax , superannuation and money into the sensitive area of what is in the best interests of children , particularly those generated by in - vitro fertilisation and other artificial fertilisation methods .In my view there is a distinct difference between justice in relation to property matters of law and the right for same - sex couples to marry or to adopt children .In particular , I have serious concerns about proposed amendments to the Births , Deaths and Marriages Registration Act that allow the biological father to be removed from a birth certificate in favour of a same - sex parent or , in this case , a second mother .The second mother can be included on the child 's birth certificate where there is a pre - existing de facto relationship and where necessary the consent of the biological father is provided .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.44687"}

{"text": "Once the female condom is placed inside of the vagina or anus , the ring at the closed end helps to keep the condom in place , while the ring at the open end acts as a guide outside of the vulva or resting above the anus .This allows for a slightly more \" roomy \" feel than the male condom .The female condom also allows for a feeling of spontaneity , as the female condom can be put in place up to 8 hours before use , avoiding having to stop and put it on directly before intercourse .Warning : it is actually less effective to double up protection .Wearing a male condom with a female condom makes both barriers more likely to break from the friction of the two rubbing together .Materials : What Are Condoms Made Of ?The three main materials for condoms - latex , polyurethane and organic ( lambskin ) - all help prevent pregnancy .However organic condoms do not protect against sexually transmited infections ( STI ) .Latex condoms are the most common and generally least expensive condom option .Latex can easily stretch without breaking , allowing these condoms to better fit the individual and preventing tears and breaks .An estimated 4 % of the population is allergic or sensitive to latex , and should not use latex condoms .Also , most types of latex are made with a milk protein , and are therefore not considered vegan .Polyurethane condoms are an excellent alternative to latex .Polyurethane does not have as much give as latex , so these condoms may have a slightly more loose fit , instead of forming to the penis .However , polyurethane is still an incredibly strong material , allowing polyurethane condoms to be thinner than latex condoms .Polyurethane is also more heat conductive , which for some people can create the illusion of not wearing a condom ( we perceive moisture by changes in heat ) .A down side , though , is that polyurethane can make a crinkling noise unlike its silent counterparts .Most female condoms are made out of polyurethane or similar non - latex materials .Organic , or lambskin , condoms are generally made from a portion of sheep intestinal lining .While more expensive , some people find lambskin condoms to feel more natural and to better transmit heat .Lambskin condoms are also biodegradable .Unlike other materials , organic condoms do not prevent against STIs , as they are porous enough to let viruses through but not sperm .Shapes and Sizes .Condoms come in different shapes , lengths , girths , thicknesses , and textures .This is not just the difference between the marked sizes of standard and XXL , but there are also slight variations in condom size from brand to brand .Latex condoms also will stretch to fit most men , so sizing is more about what is comfortable and works for you .Beyond length and girth , condoms also range in shape .Some lines such as Pleasure Plus have greatly flared heads , to allow for a looser more natural feel , some gently taper , and some provide a snug fit for both head and shaft .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.63706"}

{"text": "Its application now is tenuous .Upon review of alternative plans , it appears the splitting of existing precincts was done for the purpose of meeting the first two criteria adopted by the Senate -- one man one vote and the creation of minority districts .Alternative plans introduced in the Senate appear to properly split precincts in order to meet the two most important criteria in redistricting : \" one man , one vote \" and the effort to create minority districts where possible .These criteria are well known , originating in federal statutory and case law and also adopted as guideline in early 1991 by the Senate .The second justification for the failure to create additional districts is the maintenance of communities of interest .Upon my review of the Senate plan for maintenance of communities of interest , I have found at least four districts that certainly share little commonality or compactness . A. Senate District 26-There clearly is no commonality or community of interest between suburban Columbia and Lexington County and suburban Augusta , Georgia , in a district that is connected by a point .B. Senate District 16-York County , starting in suburban Charlotte ( and crossing a lake at a point in the process ) clearly does not share a community of interest with suburban Columbia .C. Senate District 18-There is no commonality of interest in a district that goes from Chapin in Lexington County to the Spartanburg County line near Cowpens . D. Senate District 34-There is no commonality of interest between the City of Conway in Horry County and Goose Creek in Berkeley County .By closely scrutinizing the Senate plan , one can conclude that minority districts were intentionally not drawn in order to further some political purpose -- either to support an existing voting strength for an incumbent , or to shift the balance of political power in a county legislative delegation .A concern for compactness and communities of interest is not consistently applied .Rather , it is being used to maintain the status quo by creating Senate districts that only maximize the opportunity for the re - election of some incumbents .I have little choice but to veto the Senate Reapportionment Bill .If I were to do otherwise , it would be viewed as approval of a plan that violates principles established under federal constitutional and statutory law .I am taking this action because I am convinced this reapportionment should be done correctly before the Justice Department and the federal courts reapportion the legislature .When my veto is sustained , I welcome the opportunity to discuss these specific changes in the legislation which address my concerns in an equitable manner .This discussion will include leadership of the House and Senate as well as with representatives of those minority groups that have expressed concern about the plans adopted by the House and Senate .I look forward to signing a plan that will meet the requirements of federal law .Sincerely , Carroll A. Campbell , Jr. Governor .The veto of the Governor was taken up for immediate consideration .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.886765"}

{"text": "Opt - in policies are rare , especially on the state level .In fact , only three states -Mississippi , Nevada , and Utah - have a statewide policy requiring parental permission before students can be enrolled in sex education .Most states and communities prefer an opt - out policy , under which all students are automatically enrolled in sexuality education but parents have the right to ask for their child to be removed from the class without penalty .These policies create less of an administrative burden on schools and ensure that , unless parents are strongly opposed to the material being presented , students will receive the education that policymakers and administrators have planned .Arizona actually has a split policy -classes focused solely on sexually transmitted disease ( STDs ) , including HIV , are subject to an opt - out policy , but if schools choose to provide any additional content on sexuality , students must receive permission before being enrolled .( Maryland and North Carolina also have a split policy depending on the content of the class . )Sexuality educators and advocates have long fought against opt - in policies because of the fear that putting any obstacles in the way will limit the likelihood that students will get the sex education they need .Many educators have argued that requiring written permission could lead to a situation in which students are not allowed in class simply because the permission slip got left at the bottom of the backpack or is still taped to the side of refrigerator awaiting a signature .Jodi Liggett , Planned Parenthood of Arizona 's director of policy , told the Star that many parents think their children are getting sex education when they are not .There have been some efforts to change the legislative language to fix this problem .This year , state Sen. Ed Ableser ( D - Tempe ) and Rep.

{"text": "Why should they not have the right to be named on the birth certificate of their child ?I submit there are a number of reasons and a number of matters we need to consider in this context .Firstly , a birth certificate is not evidence of ownership in the same way that car registration papers are evidence of ownership .A birth certificate is a record of the child 's birth parents and last time I looked it required both a father and a mother to give birth to a child .Secondly , a birth certificate is a unique record of the baby 's genetic parents and every child should have the right to access this information where possible .The inclusion of a second mother in place of a father deprives that child of that right .Thirdly , same - sex parents can have their rights to parenting a child recognised in other ways , including parenting plans under the Commonwealth Family Law Act 1975 .Fourthly - and this goes to the heart of the matter - this amendment in my view is in reality a subtle attack on the role of fathers and the traditional family unit .It is the so - called thin edge of the wedge .If you accept the discrimination - based , rights - focussed rationale for this amendment , then you can not argue about extending this amendment to homosexual men in de facto relationships .We would have no choice but to legalise the adoption of children by homosexual men , a situation resisted by large sections of our community .In this way the silent , subtle intention of this amendment is plain to see .Whatever happened to the presumptive right of a child to a father and a mother ?These amendments would eliminate this and the array of families with multiple parents with varying ownership rights over children would multiply .We could very well end up with four or more parents for a child with more and more complex arrangements and a plethora of rights with ever - decreasing responsibilities .Indeed this has been the experience overseas in a number of jurisdictions leading to an ever - increasing irrelevance of fatherhood .Scandinavia now has free artificial insemination at publicly funded hospitals for lesbian couples .Homosexuals can obtain children through surrogate mothers by payment of significant sums of money and adoption both intrastate and interstate as State laws change for adoption .Same - sex couples routinely petition to have one or both biological parents being left off birth certificates , as well as petitioning for non - biological parents to be put on birth certificates .I note the experience in the Australian Capital Territory in particular , with which I am familiar , where last year laws were passed to allow the adoption of children by homosexual couples .The person who has to make that decision from the responsible agency in the Australian Capital Territory has to justify their decision to both of those families .I can see the next step being that should the heterosexual couple adopt the child , the homosexual couple in this rights - focused discriminatory practising world would be off to the Anti - Discrimination Commission to challenge the decision to ensure that they get the child they so dearly want .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.791306"}

{"text": "Charlie Lynn and Reverend the Hon .Fred Nile .The Hon .MELINDA PAVEY [ 9.32 p.m. ] : A loving family unit is the best environment in which to raise a child .I believe everyone in this Chamber would agree with that statement .Too many children in this State do not have the opportunity to be raised in a loving family environment .We should support and encourage a loving family environment and ensure that all rights are available to the children living in that environment .In my opinion that is what this bill supports .Of most importance , the bill creates a range of rights for a child born by way of artificial insemination to a mother as against those of the co - parent .Children born into a family that contain two loving mothers should have the same rights as those born into a family that consists of a mother and a father .Much has been said today about the issue of birth certificates .It has been claimed that if we replace the term \" mother and father \" with \" parents \" somehow we will forever alter the foundation of our society .I do not agree .There would be countless birth certificates in New South Wales that record the name of the mother of the child only .We know of about 1,000 same - sex relationships in relation to which the name of the biological mother only is recorded because it is against the law to record the name of the co - parent .But what of the many single mothers who have decided for personal reasons , or because of circumstances not of their own making , to have and raise a child of their own ?It is not compulsory to record the name of the father on the birth certificate if the birth is the result of artificial insemination or if the father does not want to be involved .Reference has been made to studies undertaken in the United States of America that indicate that the adjustment and wellbeing of children of lesbian and gay parents do not differ markedly from that of children of heterosexual parents .A 2006 report prepared by the Department of Justice in Canada referring to children 's development of social competence across family types , concluded : .The strongest conclusion that can be drawn from the empirical literature is that the vast majority of studies show that children living with two mothers and children living with a mother and father have the same levels of social competence .In fact , a few studies suggest that children with two lesbian mothers may have marginally better social competence .I have not heard in this debate from those opposed to the changes any reference to any empirical evidence suggesting that same - sex relationships had a detrimental impact on children .As I said during my inaugural speech in this Chamber , our life experiences make us who we are - the impact of family , friendship , associations , schooling and career .In coming to a decision on this bill I asked myself the following question : How would I feel if my children had to face the level of discrimination that children of lesbian mothers face in their day to day life ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.372894"}

'Rather , participants in the debate must confront the question whether marriage , and family , have an enduring structural character that must be reckoned with before courts or legislators rush to judgement on the so - called \" rights \" question ' ( J.

{"text": "[ these ] developments in family structures have not been accompanied by equivalent legal developments .As a result , our current laws do not fully recognise the reality of many children 's lives or meet the practical needs of many families .Currently , only the birth mother is recognised as the legal parent of any children in these families .And current laws in New South Wales fail to legally recognise that children born to lesbian couples as a result of a fertilisation procedure have two parents , namely their birth mother and her partner .This legal ambiguity places children in these families at a considerable disadvantage relative to other children in New South Wales .As the Attorney explained in his second reading speech , under the New South Wales Status of Children Act there was already a presumption of parentage for the male partner of a woman who has children using donor insemination .However , there is no such presumption for lesbian couples who use assisted reproductive technologies to conceive children .The Law Reform Commission report goes on to explain that : .While the presumptions [ of parentage under the Status of Children Act ] may facilitate parenting by couples in opposite sex relationships who have a child using donor sperm , they do not take into account the existence of couples in same - sex relationships , who exercise the same choice .This means that where a child is conceived in the context of a lesbian relationship , the presumption that the sperm donor is not the child 's legal father fails to be accompanied by a presumption that the mother 's partner is the child 's legal parent .The result of this failure is that children who are conceived in the context of a lesbian relationship are denied a second legal parent , when such a parent is available .In the eyes of the law , the co - mother is a complete stranger to the child , other than in those limited areas where the functional parent / child relationship is recognised .For many children of these New South Wales families this means they may have only one legal parent .Without these amendments , a child 's relationship with one of its parents remains illegitimate in the eyes of the law .Illegitimacy leaves these children vulnerable to a number of adverse outcomes and makes it more difficult for their parents to care for them .Non - birth parents are unable to access information regarding their children 's health or to make schooling arrangements - and these children also have fewer inheritance rights .While parents can apply for a parenting order , parenting orders are limited in their application and are expensive and complex to design .They are also limited in scope .When a child turns 18 , gets married , or enters a de facto relationship , these parenting orders cease to exist .This has a significant impact on a child 's inheritance rights .Under this legislation , the presumption of parentage will be extended to children of lesbian couples .There have been many incorrect claims about this legislation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.91986"}

' ... an order providing that both parents have a full involvement in the upbringing of a child , particularly in respect of major long - term issues , and requiring that the child must spend a substantial and significant amount of time with both parents ; ' .The Bill has not progressed further and there is no sign of when or whether it will .What can a parent who wants \" equality \" do in the meantime ?How could that parent have ' full involvement ... in respect of ' major long - term issues ' and ensure that his or her children ' spend a substantial and significant amount of time with both parents ' ?a ) the upbringing of a child ; or b ) the administration of a child 's property or the application of any income arising from it , the child 's welfare shall be the court 's paramount consideration .There is no legal definition of welfare , but a helpful checklist is provided at Section ( 1 ) 3 of CA 1989 : .( 3 ) ... a court shall have regard in particular to- .These principles , along with the \" no order \" and \" no delay \" provisions are to be at the forefront of any decisions made , or what is sometimes referred to as ' what is in the best interests of a child ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.52464"}

{"text": "She said : .To be perfectly clear , the question is not whether children love the parents who raise them .Children almost universally and unquestioningly love their parents , whether their parents are married , divorced , single , gay or straight .Rather , the question is how children feel and how they make sense of their identities when their mother or father ( or both ) is absent from their daily lives .The first generation of donor - conceived children , who are now coming of age form a remarkable case study to explore this question .Most children in this first generation were conceived by married heterosexual couples using donor sperm .Anecdotally , many are now speaking out about the powerful impact on children 's identity when adults purposefully conceive a child with the clear intention of separating that child from a biological parent .These young people often say they were denied the birthright of being raised by or at least knowing about their biological fathers .They say that this intentional denial profoundly shaped their quest to understand who they are .How many people do we meet in everyday society in Australia who in their 50s and 60s are still trying to work out who they are ?These circumstances make it that much more difficult .Elizabeth Marquardt continued : .Donorconceived teenagers and adults are forming organisations , being quoted in news articles , and using the Internet to try to contact their sperm donors and find half - siblings conceived with the same sperm .They hail from the United States , Canada , Australia , Britain , Japan and elsewhere .Numbers are hard to come by , but estimates are that the number of children now born in the US each year through artificial insemination range from 30,000 to 75,000 and that about 3,000 each year are conceived using donor eggs .While the numbers arguably are small , they are growing and the stories these young people tell raise questions not only about their own experiences but about the prospects for the next generation of children .Donor conceived young people point out that the informed consent of the most vulnerable party- the child- is not obtained in reproductive technology procedures that intentionally separate children from one or both of their biological parents .They ask how the state can aid and defend a practice that denies them their birthright to know and be raised by their own parents and that forcibly conceals half of their genetic heritage .Some call themselves \" lopsided \" or \" half - adopted .\" At least one uses the term \" kinship slave . \" Some born of lesbian or gay parents call themselves \" queer spawn \" , although others in the same situation find the term offensive .No studies have been done on these young people 's long - term emotional experience .This is the point : we are not scientific beings ; we are not logical beings ; we are emotional beings - human beings .Clearly , rigorous long - term studies need to be done .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.63312"}

{"text": "But when a state is silent on the specific subject of medical records ( as most of them now are ) , the health care provider may decide whether to maintain the confidentiality of those medical records or disclose them to a parent .Thus , a state law granting minors the right to consent to reproductive health care no longer implicitly guarantees the confidentiality of their medical records .What the Research Says .There is no research that supports the notion that mandatory parental involvement requirements for either contraceptive services or abortion improve parent - child communication or facilitate conversations about sex , birth control or related matters .To the contrary , the research suggests that these policies are potentially harmful to teenagers ' health and well - being , and highlights the importance of confidentiality to teenagers ' willingness to seek care .Contraception .Surveys of teenagers in family planning clinics have found that approximately half of adolescents report that a parent knows that they were at the clinic , according to a literature review published in 2005 in Current Opinions in Obstetrics and Gynecology .Furthermore , a recent , nationally representative survey of teenagers at family planning clinics published in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) in 2005 found that one - quarter of those minors surveyed were there at a parent 's suggestion .Those who do not want to inform their parents that they are at a clinic , however , give many reasons , including a desire to be self - sufficient and not wanting to disappoint parents .In addition , research suggests that laws that require teenagers to involve their parents in their decisions to obtain birth control are likely to have harmful consequences .Significantly , seven in 10 of those whose parents did not know they were at the clinic said they would not use the clinic for prescription contraception .Furthermore , there is evidence that parental consent requirements for birth control alone would deter teenagers from seeking care for other important reproductive health services at family planning clinics , such as testing and treatment for STDs .Because of the relative scarcity of these laws - only two states and one county require parental consent for contraception in state or locally funded family planning programs - only one U.S. study has measured the actual effect of such a policy .That study , published in 2004 in the American Journal of Public Health ( AJPH ) , examined the effects of a 1998 parental consent requirement for contraceptive services provided at the McHenry County health clinic in Illinois .Abortion .As with contraception , research shows that more than six in 10 teenagers in states without a parental consent requirement say one or both parents knew about the abortion , according to a study published in 1992 in Family Planning Perspectives ( FPP ) .A similar study published in 1987 in AJPH found that the proportion of teens who inform their parents is approximately the same in states with and without such requirements .Moreover , there is no evidence to suggest that laws mandating parental involvement in a teenager 's decision to obtain an abortion improve family communication or relationships .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.86044"}

Walsh , whom Chang - Diaz endorsed in last year 's election .During the campaign , Walsh often highlighted his support for charter schools to rebut critics who said he would walk in lockstep with unions , which oppose the schools .Charter school advocates say they emerged from a meeting last week with Chang - Diaz with little hope that she will release the bill before a March 19 deadline to move it from her committee to the full Legislature .\" It was a very discouraging meeting , \" said Paul S. Grogan , president of the Boston Foundation , a nonprofit group that supports more charter schools .\" It did not appear that they were close to having a bill to put forward , and time is running very short . \"Charter schools have long been controversial because they do not need to be unionized , and are given more flexibility to set their curriculums , budgets , and staffing .Critics worry about their financial impact on local school budgets , because students who attend charter schools take with them a certain amount in state aid from their hometown districts .Supporters point to studies showing that charter schools often achieve better results than traditional public schools , and they note that 16,800 students are on the wait list for charters in Boston .Chang - Diaz said she is not philosophically opposed to the schools .She pointed out that she was among those who voted for a 2010 law that allowed more charter schools in Massachusetts .But the political dynamic was very different then .At the time , President Obama was leading a national competition , known as Race to the Top , for more charter schools , using the promise of additional federal aid to help persuade reluctant Democrats to embrace the schools .Governor Deval Patrick campaigned vigorously for the bill and celebrated the $ 250 million in federal funding that came from the Obama administration .Mayor Thomas M. Menino was also a vocal proponent .This year there is no federal money being awarded to states that allow more charter schools , and Patrick has not made the issue a top priority .And while Walsh has met with Chang - Diaz and other legislators working on the bill , he has not openly campaigned for it .\" There is n't the sense of urgency that was there \" in 2010 , said Paul S. Reville , a charter school supporter who was the state education secretary at the time .\" These are tough issues for the Legislature to approach , and I do n't know how strong the appetite is to pay the price again with another bill like this . \" Chang - Diaz said she is concerned that the state has not fully funded a program that pays cities and towns a portion of the educational costs for students who leave the local school system to enroll in a charter school .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.41443"}

{"text": "In Roe , the Court applied the right of privacy to abortion and set up a trimester framework for state regulation of abortion .In Casey , the court rejected that framework in favor of an undue burden standard -- the law would only be upheld if it did n't place an undue burden on the mother .One twist with this statute is that it directly addresses only the adult who transports the minor , but this does n't change the analysis much because it could still have an undue burden on the mother .Another twist is that the substantive abortion regulation is state law -- the law of the state in which the minor mother resides -- but the offense is federal .This law itself does n't regulate abortion .If the state of residence of the minor had no regulations on seeking an abortion , this law would have no effect .Presumably the state law is constitutional -- that is , it is not unduely burdensome .Does this law create any additional burden on the mother that might put her burden over the threshold ?Probably not .This law only affects minor mothers who live State 1 , which requires parental notification ( we 'll presume with a constitutional exception for judicial notification and the health of the mother ) , who wish to travel to State 2 , which does not have such laws .It is unclear that this law imposes any more of a burden than would State 2 passing the same law as State 1 - -thus limitting the minor mother 's travel options -- which would clearly be constitutional .If this law creates no burden at all , it probably does not have to have the correct exceptions for judicial notification and the life of the mother .If , however , the Court considers this law to impose some sort of burden , even if it 's not undue , the exception only for the \" life \" of the mother and not her health is probably narrower than what the Constitution requires .( 3 )Although it looks on its face like this law presents an issue with the right to travel , travel is not a substantive due process right but merely a fundamental right in the \" privileges and immunities \" context that only applies to state law .I 'm not trying to oversimplify here , but this law seems easily constitutional to me .If it is constitutional for a state to require parental notification before a minor gets an abortion ( and it obviously is ) , I do n't see how this law puts any further burden on the right of abortion .The minor already had to notify her parents .If a non - parental adult is trying to transport her out of state without consent , she is simply circumventing notification .It seems to me , as far as the right to abortion goes , the only thing the law does is it closes a loophole to parental notification statutes .As for the commerce clause issue , I do n't think there can be any doubt that this is constitutional on that level - we 're talking about traveling across state lines to engage in economic activity ( buy an abortion ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.61404"}

A. An additional district in the Savannah Valley region between the cities of Aiken and Anderson whereas the Senate created only influence districts in District 10 and 25 by fracturing minority voting populations in this area .B. An additional district in Georgetown , upper Charleston , Williamsburg and Marion Counties , whereas the Senate plan fractures minority voters between District 37 , 34 , 32 and 28 , thus diluting their voting strength .C. An additional district in Union , Spartanburg , York and Chester Counties , whereas the Senate plan fractures minority voters among Districts 13 , 18 , 16 and 27 .Marginal or Non - electability of certain districts identified as majority minority population districts : .Of the 11 majority minority districts in the Senate proposal , District 40 has a total black population of 51.20 % and black voting age population of only 49.226 % .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "117.173645"}

{"text": "The concluding paragraph of the submission stated : .It is absolutely critical that this language be changed before the final Bill is passed into law .Such a change of the language would not affect the legislative impact of the Bill in any way .Strongly recommended that the NSW Parliament change of their term \" partner leave \" into the term \" paternity and parental leave \" in all instances in the Miscellaneous Acts Amendment ( Same - Sex Relationships ) Bill 2008 .The reasons for the change in language are twofold : .The term \" paternity and parental leave \" accurately reflects the primary reason leave is being granted by an employer : to father or parent the child .It does this in a way that the term \" partner leave \" clearly fails to do .The term \" paternity and parental leave \" accurately reflects the fact that the vast majority of people who will take this leave are fathers .Mothers ' partners ( other than fathers ) are but a tiny minority at this point .Although it is important to value and not discriminate against them , it is also important to continue to value the very specific parental relationship that fathers ( like mothers ) have with their children .Eleven people signed the submission .Many are psychologists , clinical nurses , specialists and social workers , all who are active in the field and know what they are talking about .I hope that my foreshadowed amendment will be supported .The Australian Evangelical Alliance , which represents many churches , has also provided a submission entitled \" Same Sex Relationships and the Law \" .I have received a detailed document from the Australian Christian Lobby expressing concern about the legislation .In a press release dated 2 June , it states : .The Australian Christian Lobby today urged the NSW Parliament to reject proposed law changes which would dismiss fathers from some children 's birth certificates and also replace references to fathers and mothers with references to \" either parent \" .The Australian Christian Lobby provides reasons for its position and in conclusion states : .Society needs to be reaffirming the role of dads in families , not dismissing their very existence from some birth certificates and further marginalising them .It also seems wrong to incorporate deliberate official dishonesty to a child 's birth certificate , denying part and parcel of their biological identity .I have covered sufficient material to indicate widespread concern about the bill .This may come as a surprise to the Attorney General , who perhaps thought this bill was non - controversial .To the contrary , it has caused a strong reaction across New South Wales .Therefore , it would be prudent for the Government to accept my proposition that the bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Law and Justice .Indeed , I do not believe it is urgent and must be passed today .It is far better to pass laws that we can be proud of rather than law that has strong opposition from community and church groups across the State .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.719444"}

{"text": "Discussion .Vulnerability , responsibility and regret .For parents the diagnosis of serious illness in a child can be a shattering experience [ 3 ] .When consent is sought soon after diagnosis , parents will be making decisions when they are distressed and vulnerable [ 4 - 6 ] , whilst simultaneously trying to comfort their sick child .Being approached about a trial confronts parents with a volume and complexity of information well beyond their everyday experience and they can never be certain about what is the ' right ' decision .However , whilst they may be vulnerable , protecting their child is fundamental to the parental role and this will shape how they think about trials .Parents in one study felt personally and directly accountable for their child 's outcome on a trial and thought that giving consent for a child would be much more difficult than deciding to take part in a trial themselves [ 7 ] .The sense of responsibility that accompanies parents ' decision making about trials may paradoxically render them more vulnerable , especially to the anticipation of regret [ 9 ] .Mothers whose children were enrolled into a bone marrow transplant trial dreaded the possibility that they might have to live with the knowledge that they had made the ' wrong ' decision and this was intensified when things did not go well for the child [ 10 ] .Mothers of children with leukaemia [ 11 ] felt highly dependent on clinicians and experienced considerable unease in making decisions about trials with little grasp of the disease .People are motivated to avoid regret by making decisions that minimise its likelihood [ 12 ] and the more important the outcome , the greater the anticipation of regret particularly if the outcome is irreversible [ 13 ] .In view of the roles and responsibilities of parenthood , the anticipation of regret about potentially ' failing to protect ' one 's child may be a major influence on parents ' decisions about trials .Canvin and colleagues speculate that the sense of responsibility surrounding the trial decisions of parents of children with epilepsy was eased by the voluntary and reversible nature of the decision [ 14 ] .However , when things do go wrong , people experience more regret for acts of commission ( doing ) than for acts of omission ( not doing ) [ 15 ] , and think more about harm caused by direct action than about indirect harm [ 9 ] .Therefore , parents may hesitate to vaccinate their child even under conditions where the likelihood of a fatal side effect is only a fraction of the death rate from the disease [ 16 ] , presumably because anticipated regret looms larger for the act of vaccination .As yet no research has looked at whether parents respond in the same way to trial participation - rationalising that not participating minimises the chance of regret and is the ' safest ' option .Understandings of events can , of course , be retrospectively shaped and reconstructed to manage regret .Parents who consented their child to enter the ECMO trial [ 17 ] constructed randomisation as offering protection from responsibility should the child have a poor outcome .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "120.16542"}

{"text": "Teenagers typically detect their pregnancies later than do adults , and legal obstacles that create further impediments to timely care are likely to result in later abortions , which are significantly more dangerous to a woman 's health and more expensive to obtain .Some teenagers seeking an abortion may obtain a judicial bypass ; however , obtaining a judicial bypass can take time , inevitably delaying the abortion procedure .Other teenagers may travel to states with less restrictive abortion laws rather than involve a parent , and it can take time for an adolescent to muster the will and resources to undertake an out - of - state trip without a parent 's knowledge .A delay also can result when a teenager who is reluctant to inform her parents puts off the dreaded discussion as long as possible .There is no evidence to suggest that laws mandating parental involvement in a teenager 's decision to obtain an abortion improve family communication or relationships .In addition , forcing teenagers to inform their parents that they are pregnant or seeking an abortion may place some at risk of physical violence or abuse .The 1992 FPP study found that approximately one - third of teenagers who did not tell their parents about their decision to seek an abortion had experienced violence in their family , or feared that violence would occur or that they would be forced to leave home .Among minors whose parents found out about their pregnancy from other sources , 6 % reported physical violence , being forced to leave home or damage to their parents ' health .Proponents of parental involvement laws claim that such requirements reduce abortion and pregnancy rates among teenagers for two reasons .First , they argue that with their parents ' guidance , more pregnant teenagers will choose childbirth ( and perhaps adoption ) over abortion .Second , they claim that teenagers who do not wish to inform their parents about a pregnancy to obtain an abortion will think twice before having sex in the first place .Studies with findings that appear to support these contentions typically suffer from methodological problems .For example , a 2004 analysis by the Heritage Foundation concluded that parental involvement policies have resulted in modest declines in abortion rates .The analysis , however , ignores the possibility that some young people sought abortions in neighboring states where the laws are less restrictive .Similarly , a study published in AJPH in 1991 concluded that because abortion rates and birthrates declined among 15 - 17-year - olds in Minnesota following the enactment of a two - parent notification law , the law caused adolescent women to avoid pregnancy .This study appears to have neglected to take into account those instances where a parent accompanied a daughter to a neighboring state to receive an abortion rather than notifying the other parent .In contrast , studies published in AJPH in 1986 and FPP in 1995 demonstrate that while the number of abortions performed on minors falls dramatically in states following the implementation of parental involvement statutes , the number of abortions performed in neighboring states rises accordingly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "120.95349"}

{"text": "I also make a couple of responses in relation to matters that Ms Rhiannon raised about where we go from here after this legislation is passed , particularly in relation to male same - sex partners and their children and the other issue of surrogacy .I addressed that issue at the press conference when I announced that the Government was going to introduce this legislation .I made the point that unlike other jurisdictions , New South Wales does not have surrogacy legislation .Male same - sex partners and the rights of children in those relationships inevitably invoke consideration of surrogacy agreements and surrogacy law .At this stage , issues relating to surrogacy laws are being examined by the Standing Committee of Attorney General , which will next meet in July to further consider progress in relation to this matter .In relation to some of the other contributions in this debate I want to make a couple of things fairly clear .The issue of biological fathers has been raised by a number of members , particularly the Hon .David Clarke .These issues in relation to the non - rights of sperm donors were ventilated when this Parliament passed the Status of Children Act in 1996 .Section 14 ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) of that Act make it specifically clear that a person is not presumed to be a father , nor is a woman presumed to be a mother , simply by means of ovum or sperm donation .That is the current status of the law .Furthermore , issues were raised in this House about the rights or otherwise of access to assisted reproductive technology by lesbians .These issues were canvassed in the Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill 2007 , which was passed by both Houses without any dissent .No - one spoke against the Assisted Reproductive Technology Act , which gives rights to people to access in - vitro fertilisation .The argument that there will be some monumental change in relationships ignores the fact that the Parliament passed the Status of Children Act 1996 , which made it perfectly clear that one does not assume rights or obligations as a result of ovum or sperm donation .This Parliament also passed the Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill , which , as I said , confirms access to IVF technology by lesbian women .This debate has also generated a great deal of passion about issues that have already been resolved .The reality is that regardless of whether members like it or accept it , women in same - sex relationships have and are rearing children .That is a fact of life .The real issue in this debate is not whether that is right or wrong , because that has already been determined .The issue members must determine is whether the children of those relationships will have the same rights as children of opposite - sex relationships .If members do not support this bill , they will be saying that those children should not have those rights .That is what this legislation is about .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "121.75914"}

{"text": "Its support is drawn from an examination of the reforms from a child rights basis and on the expressed concerns of the children who come into contact with the centre .Children often challenge the centre to consider why the law fails to reflect their lived experience , including their experience of family .Clearly this is why it is supporting this legislation .The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child requires children and their families to be protected from discrimination .It calls for respect for parents and the family \" as provided for by local custom \" , and invokes the best interest of the child as the primary consideration in dealing with children .The differing treatment by the law of family structures in Australia is discriminatory .Children rightly demand that we recognise their experience of family .This requires us to ensure that the law takes account of the diversity of that experience .I believe this bill upholds that right .The proposed reforms promote the best interests of the child by providing for children in the families where parenting is undertaken by same - sex couples .The legal recognition means that both parents can act with authority on day - to - day decisions about their child .The best interests of the child will also be recognised when all families can access financial entitlements , when care is provided for in the event that one parent dies , or in circumstances where the relationship between parents ends .I will highlight some 2001 census data , where it was reported that there were at least 20,000 same - sex couple families in Australia , suggesting an increase in those willing to identify as partners in a same - sex relationship .Of these , 11,000 were gay male couples and 9,000 were lesbian couples .It must be remembered that this data is reliant on self - reporting and it is believed that these figures are in fact far higher .Not surprisingly , New South Wales had the largest reported number of same - sex couple families with 8,913 .The vast majority of them live in Sydney and , again , that is not surprising .In addition , 20 per cent of lesbian households and 5 per cent of male same - sex relationships were reported to contain children .This data demonstrates that families and domestic relationships now take many and diverse forms .Legal safeguards are necessary to protect people 's rights and to resolve disputes when a relationship breaks down , irrespective of what form that relationship has taken , and whether the parties to the relationship were married .Wherever possible , the law should not discriminate between types of relationships , but should apply a consistent approach to settling financial matters if the relationship ends .It is important to outline some discriminatory real - life situations that some families in our community face without the benefit of these reforms .A lesbian mother writes : .My name is Christy .My partner Janna and I are in our thirties , and live in the inner suburbs of Sydney .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "122.14028"}

{"text": "Many children have a very deep concern about being denied the biological truth about their parentage , and I believe that concern will be even stronger because of the way in which the birth certificate will be compiled as a result of these amendments .I have drafted an amendment to restore the rights of the father and I am seeking support for the amendment from both Government and Opposition members in their conscience vote .I imagine a conscience vote would apply to amendments as well as to the bill .Another matter of concern is that this bill will amend the Industrial Relations Act 1996 so that same - sex partners can take partner leave to act as the primary caregiver of a child of whom they are the presumed parent in the first year of the child 's life .The provision that only one parent at that time is entitled to extended parental leave is maintained .Members might wonder what is wrong with that .The Industrial Relations Act does not refer to \" partner leave \" ; it refers to \" paternity leave \" .Therefore , this legislation downgrades the father and the father 's role not only through the amendments dealing with birth certificates but also through the amendments to the Industrial Relations Act .Suddenly , paternity leave disappears ; this legislation removes it from the Industrial Relations Act 1996 .That is another example of how these amendments have legal implications .I am not sure that unions have been consulted about these amendments and that their members are happy about removing reference to \" paternity leave \" and replacing it with this vague term \" partner leave \" .The legislation should refer to \" paternity leave \" and \" partner leave \" , but I understand it deletes paternity leave altogether .The other matter of concern is the amendments to the Property Relationships Act 1984 .The legislation gives effect to a definition of \" de facto relationship \" that relies on the gender - inclusive definition .The gender - inclusive definition troubles me because I am sure many members have strong reservations about same - sex legal marriage .At the moment , marriage is clearly defined in Commonwealth law as a union between a male and a female .If we follow this path of embracing the gender - inclusive definition , all references to \" male \" and \" female \" are removed and we will refer to a \" person \" or a \" partner \" .There is no indication whether the person is a male or a female .I know the State Government would not normally try to change the definition of marriage in this State , because it is a Commonwealth matter and it is covered by Commonwealth legislation .However , pressure has been applied to State and Territory governments - such as the Australian Capital Territory Government - to go it alone and to legalise a form of same - sex marriage .Fortunately at this stage , the Commonwealth Government has opposed the Australian Capital Territory Government 's proposed legislation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "122.82729"}

{"text": "On the other hand , there are 5 approved flying schools in Malaysia today , with more to come .These are flying schools and academies that offer different training structure , environment , classroom size and aircraft types .You can become a commercial pilot by enrolling into these flying schools .Getting a license is one thing .Keeping it is another thing .To keep your current license , you need to perform a minimum of 3 take - offs and landings within a period of 3 months .The take - offs and landings must be of the type of aircraft you are entitled to fly .Additionally , you will need to take flight test which will be assessed by DCA ( Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia ) approved Authorized Examiner .This is imperative as to demonstrate your continuous level of competence and maintaining the required standard of flying .Private Pilot .Most pilots in Malaysia get the PPL ( Private Pilot License ) first , and then either stays as a private pilot or pursue licensing for commercial pilot .A full PPL license requires at least 45 hours of flying , but most of the students will go up to 70 hours before taking the test .You can enroll yourself into one of the flying clubs , where you will can apply for a Student Private License , SPL .This works just like the driving school 's ' L ' license , where you can fly instructional ( dual ) sortie with an instructor as a company .A PPL can be obtained when you reach a minimum age of 17 years old .Getting the PPL license will require you to sit down for medical , practical and written assessments .The medical assessment , which is the pre - requisite ( that means you can not get the PPL license by failing the medical test ) encompasses the general health , hearing and eyesight tests .Commercial Pilot .Currently , there are about 2500 pilots holding the CPL and ATPL licenses in Malaysia .These are professional pilots which are paid to do their flying job .They can either fly as pilot - in - command on aircraft with only one pilot , as well as a pilot or co - pilot on an aircraft consisting a number of crew .A Commercial Pilot License , CPL can only be obtained by those who have reach a minimum age of 18 years .Just like the PPL license , CPL license requires you to sit down for medical , practical and written assessments .A minimum flying hours of 200 must be met before one can take the licensing test .Qualification - wise , you will need to have at least Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia ( SPM ) with credit in English , Mathematics and a science subject .No license will be issued to those who fail this qualification requirement .A pilot with CPL may pursue getting the ATPL license by enrolling again in a flying school and meet additional flying hours and another round of assessment .ATPL license is only applicable for those who are 21 years old or above , and has a total flying hours of 1500 in an aero plane .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "123.555115"}
{"text": "This might be particularly likely where a child has a poor outcome or if a child dies .It can also be a way of making sense of a complex situation .Entering a child into a trial confers no guaranteed benefit whilst introducing an element of uncertainty into the child 's treatment .In reflecting on such a difficult decision parents might look for some positive anchor with which to justify what in some respects is a counterintuitive step .It may be that the promise of benefit to a \" future generation \" provides such an anchor [ 90 ] .It is difficult to uncover these nuances in how families make sense of trials in studies that use questionnaires .The same criticism applies to qualitative research which treats participants ' accounts as faithful descriptions of their experiences , rather than as constructions which need to be interpreted in the light of the social context and functions they serve [ 93 , 94 ] .Sharing responsibility with the child .We have argued that responsibility rather than autonomy is central to understanding the situation of parents when they are approached about trials in paediatrics .However , parents face a new set of issues when their child is old enough to have an opinion on whether they wish to participate in a trial , when the need to protect one 's child might come into conflict with the child 's wishes .The available evidence indicates that parents negotiate this by allowing the young person to have \" their say \" in the decision , whilst retaining responsibility for the final decision themselves [ 95 ] .Particularly where the child has a life - threatening illness some parents will exclude the child from the decisions about research altogether in order to protect them from distressing information , while other parents will include the child in discussions but make the final decision themselves [ 97 ] .This contrasts with studies of hypothetical trials where parents tend to report that the decision - making process was a collaboration with their child .It is likely that the degree of collaboration is related to the threat to the child [ 7 , 96 , 98 ] and to the cognitive capacity of the child [ 96 ] .Considered alongside a study examining willingness to participate in hypothetical asthma trials which suggested that adolescents were significantly more willing than parents to enrol in above - minimal risk research [ 99 ] , this raises further complexities for paediatric trialists .The parents ' move from active participant to passive observer in trial decisions as their child grows older is an important area for future research [ 7 ] .Summary .In contrast to the autonomy that typifies the situation of adults when they are themselves approached to participate in trials , when parents are asked to consider entering a child in a trial their decision might best be characterised as one that embodies an obligation of responsibility .Some parents will see trials as a threat to their child or fear regretting their decision , whilst others see trials as offering hope of better treatments for their child .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "123.75405"}

Danforth , supra , at 102 ( STEVENS , J. , concurring in part and dissenting in part ) .New York has exercised its responsibility over minors in areas falling within the \" cluster of constitutionally protected choices \" relating to sex and marriage .Ante , at 685 .It has set an age limitation below which persons can not marry without parental consent , N. Y. Dom .Rel .Law 15 , 15-a ( McKinney 1964 and Supp .1976 - 1977 ) , and has established by statute the age at which a minor is legally recognized as having the capacity to consent to sexual activity , Penal Law 130.05 ( 3 ) ( a ) ( McKinney 1975 ) .See also Penal Law 130.25 , 130.30 , 130.35 ( McKinney 1975 ) .These provisions highlight the State 's concern that its juvenile citizens generally lack the maturity and understanding necessary to make decisions concerning marriage and sexual relationships .Until today , I would not have thought it was even arguably necessary to review state regulation of this sort under a standard that for all practical purposes approaches the \" compelling state interest \" standard .390 U.S. , at 640 -641 , quoting Prince v. Massachusetts , supra , at 165 .Consequently , the \" only question remaining \" in that case was \" whether the New York Legislature might rationally conclude , as it has , that exposure to the materials proscribed by [ the statute ] constitutes such an ' abuse . ' \" 390 U.S. , at 641 .Similarly , the relevant question in any case where state laws impinge on the freedom of action of young people in sexual matters is whether the restriction rationally serves valid state interests .II .With these considerations in mind , I turn to the specific provisions of the New York statute limiting the distribution of contraceptives .A .New York has made it a crime for anyone other than a physician to sell or distribute contraceptives to minors under the age of 16 years .Educ .Law 6811 ( 8) ( McKinney 1972 ) .This element of New York 's program of regulation for the protection of its minor citizens is said to evidence the State 's judgment that the health and well - being of minors would be better assured if they are not encouraged to engage in sexual intercourse without guidance .Although I have no doubt that properly framed legislation serving this purpose would meet constitutional standards , the New York provision is defective in two respects .First , it infringes the privacy interests of married females between the ages of 14 and 16 , see ante , at 695 n. 18 , in that it prohibits the distribution of contraceptives to such females except by a physician .Consequently , the state interest that justifies a requirement of prior counselling with respect to minors in general simply is inapplicable with respect to minors for whom the State has affirmatively approved marriage .Second , this provision prohibits parents from distributing contraceptives to their children , a restriction that unjustifiably interferes with parental interests in rearing their children .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "124.05966"}

{"text": "State officials reported concerns about their states ' ability to meet the federal timelines for implementing the NCLBA teacher requirements for special education teachers .Officials from 32 states reported that the time frames were not feasible for implementing the requirements .This included 15 states that had established subject matter competency requirements for their special education certification .However , depending on the specific state certification requirements , teachers in these states may still be required to do additional work to meet the subject matter competency requirements of NCLBA .In addition , some state officials reported that their states were not positioned to meet federal deadlines because some institutions of higher education had not aligned their programs with NCLBA requirements .For example , officials in 31 states reported that that current special education teacher preparation programs hindered implementation of NCLBA requirements , primarily because these programs did not emphasize majors or concentrations in core academic subjects .Given these conditions , state officials , in 3 of the 6 states we visited , reported the need for additional assistance in identifying strategies to meet the timelines for meeting requirements .Education also noted that the challenge facing states is developing new mechanisms to make sure that all teachers of core academic subjects are able to demonstrate appropriate subject matter mastery .Some state officials and national education organizations ' leaders also cited concerns that special education teachers currently teaching might leave the field rather than take exams or return to school to take the courses needed to demonstrate subject matter competency .Thirty - two survey respondents expressed concern that the potential flight of special education teachers would hinder efforts to implement the requirements .Finally , state education officials reported uncertainty over how to reconcile requirements of the two laws that appear to be inconsistent and thus could impede implementation of NCLBA .These officials reported that they were unsure as to which act -- IDEA or NCLBA -- should take precedence in establishing personnel requirements for special education teachers .For example , under IDEA , a student 's IEP could require that he be taught mathematics at a functional level 3 years below his chronological age , and under IDEA a certified special education teacher would be qualified to provide this instruction .However , under NCLBA , a teacher might not be qualified to instruct this student without first demonstrating subject matter competency in mathematics .According to Education officials , the requirements would depend in part on the assessment level of the students being taught .At the same time , Education officials noted that NCLBA teacher requirements apply to all teachers , including special education teachers .As a result of this uncertainty , some of the state special education officials we interviewed and surveyed said that they had decided to wait for further guidance or assistance before beginning to implement any NCLBA requirements for special education teachers .Education officials reported that they were aware that some states had expressed uncertainty about how to implement NCLBA 's teacher requirements .Moreover , Education officials noted that states that wait for further guidance could hinder their special education teachers ' ability to meet the subject matter competency requirements by the end of the 2005 - 2006 school year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "126.21332"}
{"text": "Section 3 of the CA 1989 defines PR as : . ' ... all the rights , duties , powers , responsibilities and authority which by law a parent of a child has in relation to the child and his property ... ' .Other than the lack of reference to time , one would think that the type of order envisaged in the Share Parenting Orders Bill is already enshrined in law .In the case of Hewer v Bryant [ 1969 ] 3 ALL ER 578 ( considerably prior to CA 1989 ) , at 575 , Sachs LJ expressed the parent 's role as a : . ' \" bundle of rights \" , or to be more exact , a \" bundle of powers \" ...These include power to control education , the choice of religion , and the administration of the infant 's property .They include entitlement to veto the issue of a passport and to withhold consent to marriage .They include , also , both the personal power physically to control the infant until the years of discretion and the right ( originally only if some property was concerned ) to apply to the courts to exercise the powers of the Crown as parens patriae . 'Everyday issues are not thought to be situations where consent from all persons with PR should normally be obtained , possibly because by their nature , such decisions are immediate , short - term actions ( as opposed to something long - term ) and thought right for the child at that time .Obvious examples might be what clothes a child should wear or how the child is taken to school .These matters have understandably not been tested by the courts .Major decisions on important long term issues affecting the child 's welfare are different .However , for most parents where to draw the line between \" minor short term \" and \" major long term \" issues is difficult .The question of ' full involvement ' appears to be unresolved and some parents believe that a change in legislation is therefore needed .PR seems to exist more as a legal concept than in the real world , where often the perception is that one parent assumes a primary role whilst the other parent becomes of secondary significance .A whole vocabulary has evolved to describe such parents , \" Primary Carer \" and \" Absent Parent \" being the most obvious and often badly misleading descriptions .Residence and Contact What exactly does ' time ' mean in the Shared Parenting Orders Bill ?It is possible to interpret this as the child 's time that is allocated to the parents .Currently this is of course dealt with by residence and contact orders .Section 8 of CA 1989 provides : . \" a residence order \" means an order settling the arrangements to be made as to the person with whom a child is to live ; .The definitions themselves are not ideal and the distinction between residence and contact blurs and breaks down on an invisible line as the time spent with the \" absent \" or \" non resident \" parent increases .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "126.288956"}

{"text": "The worry that their child might be randomized to the less effective treatment [ 31 ] and the responsibility that they would feel if the child later deteriorated are particularly common [ 1 ] .On finding that their child has been allocated to the standard treatment arm , parents sometimes report a sense of disappointment or missed opportunity , as if the child has been deprived of a known beneficial treatment or has ' failed ' the selection process .Some mothers felt resentment that they had been asked to go through the trauma of deciding about trial entry for ' nothing ' [ 11 ] .Others viewed randomisation as a way of allocating limited resources and expressed guilt that their child had been allocated the experimental arm while others had only received conventional treatment [ 17 , 36 ] .Founded on a difficulty in accepting that there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of trial treatments or an assumption that the experimental treatment will necessarily be superior , these responses remind us that in the face of intense threat and uncertainty , parents look for hope and certainty .In such circumstances it is not surprising they find the uncertainty that is intrinsic to trials challenging both cognitively and emotionally , or that they are liable to construct trial treatments as the answer to their child 's needs .The generally high rates of recruitment to trials in neonatology [ 37 ] and childhood cancer [ 38 ] suggests the level of threat and parents ' consequent needs for hope could be important influences on how they view trials .Parents of chronically and terminally ill children stated that they were prepared to take greater risks in treatment in the hope of a cure [ 7 ] .High recruitment rates may also be testament to the importance that is deservedly placed on research in neonatology and childhood cancer by both parents and trial staff [ 41 , 42 ] .But they could also be a sign of parents ' reluctance to decline a trial where it involves saying \" no \" to the clinical team on whom their child 's care depends .By contrast parents of healthy children considering participation in vaccine research believed that children should only take part in research where the medical benefits outweigh any potential risk [ 43 ] .Work comparing what researchers say and intend when they discuss trials with parents , and what parents interpret from these discussions will yield further insights into the challenges for both parties [ 44 ] and how they co - construct their views of trials and their respective roles .In deciding about hypothetical research scenarios , parents and children were more likely to respond intuitively and emotionally to research information than to systematically attempt to consider and weight all the available information .The result was that the ' information ' participants used to underpin their decisions was often very different to the information that the researchers intended them to use [ 45 ] .Participants ' emotional responses to information were shaped by their particular life experiences .Similarly , Chantler and colleagues report that parents who received the same information about a vaccine study varied widely in their perceptions of the risks of the trial , with some seeing it as potentially dangerous while others viewed it as safe with no negative effects .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "127.04518"}

{"text": "At the same time , pregnant teenagers became less likely to marry to \" legitimize \" their pregnancies and births , and more teens began to terminate their pregnancies following the national legalization of abortion in 1973 .Meanwhile , a growing body of research demonstrated that teenagers who gave birth had worse maternal and child health outcomes than did those who postponed childbearing , and that these young women were more likely to be poor and have reduced educational and workforce achievement .Reproductive health providers and others concerned about adolescent health and well - being increasingly turned their attention to ensuring that teenagers had the information and services they needed to avoid early and unwanted pregnancy .New laws and policies at the state and federal levels began to allow teenagers to consent to reproductive health services and to ensure that services would be delivered confidentially when requested .And in the late 1970s , the Supreme Court in successive decisions extended the constitutional right to privacy to a minors decision to both obtain contraceptives and choose an abortion .These developments , however , produced a political backlash among social and religious conservatives , who contended that the very availability of confidential reproductive health services promoted sexual promiscuity among teens , undermined parental authority and interfered with parent - child relationships .They argued , then and now , that state and federal law should enshrine parents ' rights to control their childrens upbringing , and they have worked consistently over the course of three decades to legislate parental control over teenagers ' reproductive health care decisions .Public Policy .Parents generally have the legal authority to make medical decisions on behalf of their minor children , on the basis that young people typically lack the maturity and judgment to make fully informed decisions before they reach the age of majority ( 18 in most states ) .Exceptions to this rule have long existed , such as when medical emergencies leave no time to obtain parental consent and in cases where a minor is \" emancipated \" by marriage or other circumstances and thus can legally make decisions on his or her own behalf .Furthermore , some state courts have adopted the so - called mature minor rule , under which a minor who is deemed sufficiently intelligent and mature to understand the nature and consequences of a proposed treatment may consent to medical treatment without consulting his or her parents or obtaining their permission .On the basis of scientific findings dating back to the late 1970s that identified the premium that young people place on confidentiality , public policy has long reflected the reality that many minors will not seek important , sensitive health services if required to inform their parents .Today , a significant body of federal and state law explicitly guarantees confidential access to services or does so by implication .The federal Medicaid statute also requires family planning services to be provided confidentially to sexually active minors who seek them .Additionally , a host of state laws explicitly authorize minors to consent to a range of reproductive health services ( including prenatal care and delivery ) , as well as to substance abuse treatment and mental health care .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "130.76602"}

{"text": "The first is that a quality loving relationship is not limited to people of different genders .The second is that a loving supportive environment for children can be and in many cases is provided by parents of the same gender .The introduction of this bill in Parliament is a tribute to the campaign for full equality for lesbians , bisexuals , gays , transgender and intersex people , which they have conducted over many years and the campaigns they also have conducted for the rights of children .More importantly , this legislation is a measure of the maturity of the people of New South Wales who have begun finally , in growing numbers , to escape the shackles of prejudice .I can not in any substantial way add to the contributions of other members who have spoken in support of this bill .I just pay tribute tonight to the Hon .Penny Sharpe and the Hon .Helen Westwood , who have not only given us solid and intelligent reasons to support this bill but have also had the courage to share with us their own personal experiences .I also pay tribute to my colleague Lee Rhiannon , the Hon .Robyn Parker , the Hon .Trevor Khan , the Hon .Catherine Cusack and the Hon .Melinda Pavey who have given us passionate support from a human rights perspective and ample evidence for that support .In my own life , I have been delighted to watch children grow up as happy , healthy , well- adjusted kids with two female parents , and many members in this Chamber have shared an equal delight .But it is not just about our personal experiences ; there is hardcore evidence to support the proposition that children who are raised by two parents of the same gender are in no way disadvantaged .I bring to the attention of the House the 2002 fact sheet on the Evidence of Outcomes for Children of Lesbian Parents , which was endorsed by the Victorian Attorney General 's Advisory Committee on Gay , Lesbian and Transgender Issues .That fact sheet stated : .Over the last two decades increasingly complex investigations have consistently shown : . that lesbian parents and their children are as emotionally and socially well - adjusted as their heterosexual peers .children have similar gender - identity development and gender role behaviour . sexual orientation of the children shows the same distribution as the population .I would insert there , \" Who cares ? \" personal development such as intelligence , basic personality , self - esteem and moral judgment are no different . social relationships with peers and adults of either sex are no different . relationships with parents are no different .That is to say that the Attorney General 's department in Victoria , based on an extensive study of the literature , came to the inescapable conclusion that the genders of one 's parents will not determine outcomes .The Federal Parliamentary Library Research Service concluded , from an extensive literature review , that : . the existing evidence indicates that the sexual orientation of parents does not appear to be a determinant of the success of a child 's development .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "142.6305"}
{"text": "Residence and contact orders can be highly contentious as the parent with the residence order may be viewed as the main day to day carer and the parent with the contact order , as someone the child will see as and when possible .In order to readdress the balance and the failure in practice of the concept of PR , Shared Residence Orders ( \" SRO \" ) came into fashion .Shared Residence Section 11(4 ) of CA 1989 provides : . 'Where a residence order is made in favour of two or more persons who do not themselves all live together , the order may specify the periods during which the child is to live in the different households concerned ' .To have a better understanding of the situations when a SRO could be made , a closer look at the case law is needed .Historically , it was not a common order and prior to the CA 1989 , it was thought a settled home with one parent was in the paramount interests of a child ( Riley v Riley [ 1986 ] 2 FLR 429 ) .This could be the case notwithstanding the child having a settled home with one parent ( A v A ( Minors ) ( Shared Residence Order ) [ 1994 ] 1 FLR 669 ) .It is interesting to note that the court thought it appropriate to specify a justification beyond simply applying the welfare principle in Section 1(1 ) .Reference was made to shared responsibility , possibly to make the parents appear equal .However , had PR not been an issue , it is not clear whether a SRO would have been made .A more telling change in approach came about in D v D ( Shared Residence Order ) [ 2001 ] FLR 495 , where the court granted a SRO to ' reflect the reality of the children 's lives ' .In this case the court moved away from the notions of \" positive benefit \" and \" exceptional circumstances \" and went back to the welfare principle and the best interests of the child .The case did involve a high level of animosity , but despite this , where the child could be spending a substantial amount of time with each parent , the order was made .Over the following years , the concept of shared residence continued to develop beyond its statutory definition .Further examples where an SRO was made include : .The time did not need to be equal between the two homes , if the homes offered equal status and importance ( Re F ( Shared Residence Order ) [ 2003 ] EWCA Civ 592 ) .Where sole residence could be misinterpreted as enabling control by one parent , the order would show that the parents were equal in the eyes of law and had equal duties and responsibilities ( A v A [ 2004 ] 1 FLR 195 ) .Shared residence did not automatically follow equal time , or proportions approaching it .The day to day decisions would be with whomever the child was with at the time but the important decisions would be made jointly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "143.41028"}
