{"text": "Such a balance in the programs to stop sexual harassment should point out the relevance of women equally sharing the responsibility of initiating male - female relationships .Another 15 percent of these women lived with or had a long relationship with a man they met while on the job , but never married him .Because the sexes have a different role in meeting , dating , and interacting romantically and sexually , they have a different psychology with regard to the other sex .Neither sex understands very well the psychology of the other , because neither sex has spent time in the other 's shoes .That 's why the sexes are often antagonistic toward each other .It 's why Dr. Warren Farrell has for decades taught the value of role - reversal .To my knowledge , employers ' sexual - harassment prevention programs fail even to suggest women should equally share in initiating the relationships which women equally seek at work and which most employers seem to condone .( A Fortune magazine poll of 200 executives found 79 percent think office romances are not the company 's concern if the unmarried couple remain discreet . )So men feel they alone are vulnerable to charges of sexual harassment .That feeling of vulnerability will increase as more women learn that even a frivolous charge of harassment wo n't be questioned and may earn them a large sum of money from employers wanting to avoid the higher costs of litigation and a tarnished image .Most men , untutored on gender issues the way women are , are unable to articulate their vulnerability - and the unfairness - or are afraid to articulate it lest they be penalized at work for \" opposing women .If employers ' programs do not tell women they have equal responsibility for initiating workplace romance - and thus ignore men 's vulnerability and views - employers may pay a price .Some men , rather than welcome the changes promoted by diversity , may obstruct them and contribute to the workplace stress and gender alienation that a growing body of experts links to policies on sexual harassment .Other men may simply leave companies whose aggressiveness in preventing a hostile work environment for women has created a hostile work environment for men .Inevitably , the heightened sensitivity to sexual harassment has left some men feeling persecuted , and it has convinced others that the handling of sexual harassment claims can be every bit as abusive as sexual harassment itself . \" -Ellis Cose , A Man 's World .But there is a more compelling reason that employers ' sexual - harassment prevention programs should reflect an understanding of the male culture and should encourage female employees to equally share in initiating relationships .This understanding and equal sharing would curb sexual harassment and costly lawsuits .Here 's how .When women complain that men do n't take their \" no \" seriously , they imply that women do take men 's \" no \" seriously .Men 's \" no \" ?How can men say \" No \" to women if women as a rule do n't directly ask anything of them ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.21539"}

Wade in 1973 .What all of this clearly means is that it does n't matter if the morning - after pill can be definitively shown not to prevent implantation .It was never about the arbitrary line itself ; the line was drawn as a post - hoc rationalization in a largely successful attempt to dominate the narrative and distract from the actual moral issues at hand .Among those , a woman 's right to control what happens in her body ( as any man takes as practically an absolute ) , the development nature of personhood , and whether life alone has any meaning in the absence of quality of life .Their conversation , even as recounted by Ms. Stetton , does not sound even close to adultery .She does n't say he even asked her for a date , or even a phone number .It sounds like he was just talking to her and saying silly stuff .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.847275"}

{"text": "It 'll be refreshing to see an actually decent film .For 50 solid years , the majority of critics have agreed on the greatest movie of all time : Citizen Kane .Finally , this agreement has shattered , and the film that replaced it is one that undoubtedly deserves the title .Alfred Hitchcock 's once forgotten Cinderella- Vertigo ( 1958 ) - pushed through a moment of box - office shame to eventually become the most renowned movie of our time .How did this happen ?If you were born in the latter half the 20 th Century , this may be harder to grasp .I 'm one of these people , so I understand the shock .Vertigo is one of the most complex , thrilling , and haunting pieces of film ever made .It 's hard to comprehend how a generation of movie - goers could watch this movie and not be completely in love with it .This is evident if you 've ever seen the film .However , there are some major factors that can possibly explain Vertigo 's disappointment at the box office .Here are a few : .It was the 1950s .Need I say more ?American culture was dramatically different than it is now .Men were men , women were women , and blacks had to drink at different water fountains .Some people call it the Nifty Fifties .I like to call it The Land Before Reality Kicked In .This is the case with Vertigo 's release in 1958 .Audiences were too conservative to take in the amoral motives and erotic tension in the plot .They wanted a simple good guy and simple bad guy , because it 's easier to take in .I realize this is a broad generalization of people at that time , so feel free to contradict me if you were one of those original viewers in ' 58 .Sex .For the 1950s , Alfred Hitchcock was about as explicit as you could get with the sexual allusions .When Judy ( Kim Novak ) finally pulls back her newly blonde hair - and Jimmy Stewart then ravenously kisses her in the apartment - the next scene instantly cuts to Jimmy on the bed , with a satisfied smile on his face .Or maybe he just likes beds .Anyway , this was controversial in 1958 because sex was n't invented until the 1960s .The romance was n't normal .( Spoiler alert - do n't read this paragraph if you have n't seen the film ) Instead of the usual romantic thriller narrative that Hitchcock is known for , Vertigo is a love story on acid .The mysterious little blonde girl that Jimmy falls in love with , turns out to be a fraudulent ginger and accomplice to a wife murderer ( the fraudulent part of her story leads Jimmy into a sanitarium ) .And , in order for Jimmy to truly fall in love with her real ginger self , she has to completely transform back into the blonde women that he thinks is dead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.41841"}
