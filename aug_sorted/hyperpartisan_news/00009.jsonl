{"text": "But it does highlight the need for more scholarship that addresses the full , living reality of right - wing politics .A typology of fascism and more broadly of the far right or extreme right , whatever we call it , needs analytic precision , but it also needs to be flexible enough to account for variations and changes in what rightists say and do .After almost a century of debate , there 's still no agreement among scholars , or among activists , about what fascism is or what it encompasses .My own thinking on this question has continued to evolve .In 2007 , I offered a descriptive profile of fascism based on four core features : radical break with the established order , totalitarian mass politics , twisted anti - elitism , and autonomy from business control .More recently , I 've concentrated more on delineating the far right -- which arguably includes both fascists and non - fascists -- from other currents .In the context of the United States today , I use the term \" far right \" to mean political forces that ( a ) regard human inequality as natural or inevitable and ( b ) reject the legitimacy of the established political system .That covers some ( but not all ) white nationalists , the theocratic branch of the Christian right , the hardline wing of the Patriot movement , and a few other currents .But oppositional and system - loyal rightists are n't just in conflict .As Chip Berlet points out in \" Trump Bigotry , \" they also fuel each other .For example , \" the Trump candidacy and the shooting in Charleston are connected thematically by a mobilization to defend white nationalism while the racial and ethnic face of America changes hue .\" This is a complex , fluid situation , with different branches of the right both divided and interconnected , and we need a dynamic approach to understand it .Debates about terminology or definitions aside , I know that Chip and I agree about this .When a group built around right - wing conspiracy theories sends heavily armed white men onto streets filled with Black Lives Matter protesters , it makes sense to be worried .But if these are white supremacist vigilantes , why are they proposing to arm black protesters and march alongside them ?Police sharpshooter at Ferguson protests - a repressive response strongly criticized by Oath Keepers .Oath Keepers has drawn a lot of discussion and criticism for deploying men with guns to Ferguson , Missouri , last fall and again this summer .As a part of the Patriot movement , Oath Keepers ' politics are predictably right wing on a host of issues - it glorifies private property , promotes homophobia and anti - immigrant scapegoating , and accuses Marxists of making common cause with radical Islamists to destroy western civilization .But Oath Keepers does n't fit the white supremacist profile that many leftists expect .Not only has the group disavowed racism ( which in itself does n't mean much ) , more surprisingly it has also supported African Americans ' right to protest and even their right to practice armed self - defense .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.00489"}

{"text": "For this reason alone I will campaign for Donald Trump because as the saying goes ' The enemy of my enemy is my friend ' and that is doubly true if that person is viewed as an enemy by the International Jew .As these quotes suggest , even those far rightists who welcome Donald Trump 's campaign have serious reservations about him .This ambivalence is politically important and we should try to understand it .To do that , it 's important to delineate fascism clearly from other forms of right - wing authoritarianism and racism - and also to see them as interconnected .Trump campaign and fascism : distinct but interconnected One of the few Trump - related articles I 've seen that offers this kind of nuanced analysis is David Neiwert 's \" Donald Trump May Not Be a Fascist , But He is Leading Us Merrily Down That Path .\" There are points in Neiwert 's article that I disagree with - he counterposes fascism to democracy , for instance - but I think his basic approach here is sound .Rather than treat fascism as something radically separate and in a class by itself , Neiwert emphasizes that there 's a dynamic interrelationship between fascism and other forms of right - wing populism .And while \" merrily \" might be a bad choice of words , Neiwert is n't making light of the danger at all .Acknowledging that there 's no agreed - upon definition of fascism , Neiwert offers a composite sketch from definitions by several leading fascism scholars , including Stanley Payne , Robert O. Paxton , and Roger Griffin , and uses this to summarize Trump 's fascistic and non - fascistic aspects .On the other hand , Neiwert notes two key points that set Trump 's candidacy apart from fascism .First , although Trump has encouraged spontaneous violence against his critics and targets of his rhetoric , he 's made no moves to develop or ally with a political paramilitary force along the lines of the Italian Blackshirts or the Nazi Stormtroopers .Second , and more importantly , Trump \" lacks any kind of coherent , or even semi - coherent , ideology .\" While fascists are absolutists who demand ideological purity , \" Trump 's only real ideology is the Worship of the Donald . \"He is pushing a kind of gut - level hatred and paranoia , Neiwert argues , not because of his own belief system , but because it 's a way to win votes .I would extend this line of thought further , drawing particularly on Roger Griffin 's analysis of fascism .Point One : it 's true that Trump 's candidacy , like fascism , emphasizes a kind of populism , in that Trump has presented himself as an advocate of the common people against corrupt or sinister elites .But as Griffin argues , fascism is n't populist only in a rhetorical sense .Rather , both as a movement and a regime , fascism seeks to actively and permanently mobilize large masses of people through a network of top - down organizations , constant propaganda , and elaborate public rituals such as the Nazi Party 's Nuremberg rallies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.51865"}

{"text": "Today , the split in Oath Keepers indicates that some Patriot activists are willing to pay more than lip service to the idea that constitutional rights should apply to everyone regardless of race .In addition , while the Patriot movement has been predominantly white and male , it has also included a few African Americans , such as J.J. Johnson , who co - founded the Ohio Unorganized Militia and described militias as \" the civil rights movement of the 1990s .\" Johnson urged black people to join the Patriot movement and argued , \" If our ancestors would have been armed , they would not have been slaves ! \"Today , among the members profiled on the Oath Keepers website are several people of color , reflecting the group 's claim that \" Oath Keepers come in all colors , shapes , sizes , ages , and backgrounds ... \" .The emphasis on gun rights , which Oath Keepers shares with the rest of the Patriot movement , helps us understand the movement 's often muddled racial politics .In the United States there 's an organic connection between racism and guns , because an armed white male populace was historically one of the cornerstones of the whole system of racial oppression .Frontier settlers needed guns for conquering Indian and Mexican lands , and white men in the South needed to be armed to keep control over enslaved black people , who were not allowed to have guns .Armed , decentralized white power has generally served ruling elites but has also fueled right - wing populist upsurges that clashed with elite interests - such as the original Reconstruction - era Ku Klux Klan , which fought a guerrilla war against \" northern military despotism . \" And people of color and their allies , too , have invoked the right to bear arms - from anti - slavery activists to Chicano land rights defenders and the Black Panther Party .As a result , gun control has sometimes been used to enforce white rule , as when conservatives in the late 1960s advocated stricter gun laws because they were afraid of the Black Panthers .All of this history is in the mix when Patriot groups talk about the Second Amendment .And while the predominant thread of that history is about defending white privilege , other threads are sometimes visible .\" That 's why the Oath Keepers often talk about \" protecting life , liberty , and property , \" and why they initially went into Ferguson to guard businesses .Defending supposed property rights against federal government intrusion was what drove the Bundy ranch action in 2014 .For similar reasons , armed Oath Keepers and other Patriot activists have more recently protected disputed mining claims in Oregon and Montana against \" unlawful \" federal action .These Oath Keeper operations reflect a Patriot movement consensus .Capitalist individualism and racism are historically and culturally connected , but they 're not inseparable .In an era when overt racial bigotry is widely discredited , it should n't be a surprise when even hardline right - wingers want to move beyond the white supremacist legacy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.81203"}
