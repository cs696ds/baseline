Alicia Reece only local legislator listed as co - sponsor .A group of Ohio House Democrats wants Congress to move quickly and grant statehood to Puerto Rico , which has been a U.S. possession since the Spanish - American War ended in 1898 .The Ohioans do not say where the star should go on a redesigned American flag , but they said statehood would \" respect the rights of self - governance through consent of the governed of our fellow United States citizens residing in Puerto Rico .\" The chief sponsor of the resolution , H.C.R. 57 , is State Rep. Dan Ramos of Lorain , a northern Ohio city where about 25 percent of the 64,000 residents are Hispanic .Lorain is considered the most Hispanic city in Ohio , and nearly 20 percent of its population claims Puerto Rican descent .The resolution urging statehood was introduced this week in the Ohio House where it likely faces an uncertain future .The current term of the legislature is scheduled to end in December , and it has no Republican co - sponsors .The GOP controls the House , which means that Democratic proposals often get bottled up or receive short shrift .Earlier this month , a slight majority of Puerto Ricans voted in favor of statehood for the Caribbean Island .It was the first time a statehood referendum has won there , and the non - binding vote was seen as signaling that many Puerto Ricans appear ready to end the island 's status as a U.S. commonwealth .The move by the Ohio House Democrats also appears aimed at cementing the party 's support among Hispanic voters .Some 70 percent of Hispanics backed the Democrats and President Obama on Election Day , and Hispanics are emerging as a key bloc with increasing power at the ballot box .With the exception of State Rep. Alicia Reece , a Cincinnati Democrat , all of the other House Democrats backing the statehood resolution are from Columbus or further north in Ohio .The resolution urges Congress to take swift action \" towards admitting the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to the Union as a State . \" Statehood decisions are up to Congress .The Ohio resolution points out that Puerto Ricans are already U.S. citizens ( although they can not vote in presidential elections ) , and that many serve in the U.S. military .A 1917 law granted residents U.S. citizenship .There is a historical footnote involving Cincinnati in Puerto Rico 's fate .Former GOP President William Howard Taft , a Cincinnatian who went on to serve as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in the 1920s , delivered a major legal decision in 1922 that helped keep Puerto Rico separate .Taft said the congressional act that conferred citizenship on the islanders did not contemplate that they would be incorporated into the Union .He ruled the U.S. possession had never been designated for statehood .Taft gave the island a unique status that has been described as a commonwealth , or as it is said in Spanish , \" Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.281"}

President Gary Thorne .As the need for B.A.T.

{"text": "So maybe the better answer to this question is , \" Wherever Trump is . \" Ron Paul Is Not a ' Serious ' Candidate - Unlike Donald Trump .The first role of the corporate press in an election cycle is to weed out candidates who they deem nonviable .This usually means choosing not to cover candidates whose ideas that fall outside the Beltway conventional wisdom ( e.g. , Dennis Kucinich ) , or those who reporters decide have no real chance of winning the nomination .The speculation that reality TV star / mogulDonald Trump might run in 2012 flips the narrative around - and demonstrates the fact that the media can change the \" rules \" whenever they want .Trump is extremely unlikely to actually run , and his \" ideas \" mostly revolve around a long - debunked conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born where he was born .So by any normal standard he would get no coverage .But he 's perhaps the dominant feature of the early campaign coverage , making a string of television appearances that a supposedly marginal candidate would never enjoy .What gives ?Some reporters have tried to find ways to explain why this is so , or at least justify the attention .Take Dan Balz in the Washington Post ( 4/24/11 ): .The New York businessman has grabbed headlines with his provocative remarks on President Obama 's birthplace .He continues to question whether the president was born in Hawaii , despite ample evidence that he was .But what he has had to say about real issues deserves as much attention as his \" birther \" comments .I wish he were saying that since Trump 's birtherism deserves no coverage , his thoughts about \" real issues \" deserve the same .But Balz seems to be arguing that since Trump 's nutty conspiracy - mongering makes news , his other ideas deserve to make news too .All this coming from a guy no one seems to think has any intention of actually mounting a serious campaign .This is an extremely odd justification , at odds with the normal rules of Beltway journalism .Amidst this backdrop , Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas will apparently announce his intention today to run in 2012 .He was a candidate in 2008 that media mostly left out of their campaign coverage , despite the fact that he had a core of dedicated volunteers and an impressive ability to raise money ( one of the things that media normally treat as very important ) .Ron Paul is , in other words , was an actual candidate , and is likely to be one again .But will he enjoy even a tiny fraction of the coverage given to Donald Trump ?Do n't bet on it .Activism Director and and Co - producer of CounterSpin Peter Hart is the activism director at FAIR .He writes for FAIR 's magazine Extra ! and is also a co - host and producer of FAIR 's syndicated radio show CounterSpin .He is the author of The Oh Really ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.73563"}

Kasich 's administration took 26 minutes to execute a gasping , grunting convicted killer with a new cocktail of drugs that was never tried before in the United States .Based on his claims , King would oppose the state - sanctioned killing of a convicted killer , and he certainly would reject any defense that touts vengeance as a justification for killing another human being .\" Of all the forms of inequality , injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhuman , \" King said , according to Dr. Quentin Young , who attended King 's speech at the 1966 convention of the Medical Committee for Human Rights .Whether King 's quote indicates support for Democrat - backed legislation like Obamacare or other measures , such as a single - payer system , is completely unclear .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.8146"}
