{"text": "I appreciate your comments Shay , I understand the logic , but I think your points are merely made out of frustration and not considering the reality of the way our country actually works .I think that the federal government should n't be in the disaster business .I think the federal government should do everything in its power to aid the victims of hurricane Katrina .The two preceding statements are not in conflict .Let me explain .We 're in a situation that is a culmination of decades , sometimes centuries of prior decisions .You do n't just stop an avalanche in mid - fall .So the government , at all levels , should do the best job possible in pitching to aid disaster victims .At the same time , we 're not just puppets of previous generations .We can make our own decisions and part of that is to reduce the times when the government has to get called in for economic aid to disaster victims .Given enough generations committed to that ethic , we 'll find better solutions to fix the problems or , even better , prevent them from happening in the first place .An earlier post noted that federal flood insurance used to only pay out if you rebuilt on the flood plain .It does n't anymore and each time people lose a house to a flood , some move to higher ground .That 's positive change and there 's nothing heartless about it .But what if private groups ran contests for architects and engineers to invent flood mitigation technologies where houses simply did n't get destroyed by floods , or at least were damaged less by them ?Over a few decades , new techniques might be found that would reduce flood damage outlays and , in some marginal floods , eliminate the government role entirely .If we keep working with that private innovation ethic , a century from now might see the government limited in its disaster response function to its proper role , maintaining civil order .Over a few decades , new techniques might be found that would reduce flood damage outlays and , in some marginal floods , eliminate the government role entirely .This is a great idea .But it 's just one idea .There are thousands of other things to take into consideration when you give disaster duties over to private interests .But I agree we have to start coming up with better solutions .More ideas are welcome in this space .The sheer impotence of the US authorities is breathtaking .This is particularly true when one considers the fact that they knew about the hurricane in advance .If I was a US citizen I would be seriously questioning the competency of my elected officials .Graham Applin , Southampton , Hampshire .I sat stunned watching reporters talking to victims who had n't had food or water for two days .They can get reporters in but not food and water ?They can drop sandbags but not food or water ?Something is sorely amiss here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.84576"}

{"text": "It was a classy move , although obviously it went nowhere .That was about all I knew .Well , there was one more thing : over the past year I kept reading that there was a lot of controversy on the island over the issue of cabotage .This information created two problems for me .First , every time I see it I replace \" Sabotage \" with cabotage and get the song stuck in my head .Second , I have no goddamn idea what cabotage is .It seemed worth a half hour on the way to the airport to read a little .Cabotage is , \" the transport of goods or passengers between two places in the same country by a transport operator from another country .\" It is forbidden in the United States by the Jones Act , which is nearing its 100th birthday .For example , that a Panamanian ship can not stop in New Orleans and then stop in San Juan .Only an American owned , registered , and crewed ship can transport things from cities like Houston or New Orleans to the island .This is important because PR has to import nearly everything ( for reasons that are controversial , but for which the island itself deserves at least some blame ) .In short , the highly consolidated US shipping industry has Puerto Rico over a barrel .As you might expect they take every opportunity to ream them .The real tragedy is that mismanagement - both self - mismanagement and ineffective governance by colonial powers like Spain and the U.S. - has created a dependence on imports that is n't strictly necessary .The island is well suited to agriculture but grows almost none of its own food .It has some of the best conditions for a renewable commercial timber industry but instead imports wood from the U.S. and Canada .Compared to much of the Caribbean , it is underdeveloped for tourism and undercut on price by similar destinations in the region .It 's a sad state of affairs and one that is not rare around the world : a place with a lot of potential that it will never realize for political reasons .It will be an ancillary issue at best but during this election it would n't be surprising to see the candidates pressed on bailing out the Puerto Rican government as it comes closer to defaulting on its $ 70 billion in debt .I 'm no economist but at a debt - to - GDP ratio of more than 68 % , promising alternatives to a Congressional bailout are neither numerous nor apparent .Nothing makes clearer the complete intellectual bankruptcy of the NRA and its acolytes quite like the reaction earlier this week to Obama 's beyond - milquetoast executive order about background checks at gun shows and for internet gun sales .As far as \" gun control \" goes , that is just about the least you could possibly do and still qualify .That makes it about one tenth of one percent more difficult to buy a gun .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.942444"}

Bernie Sanders ( D - VT ) gave the typical pro - efficient government talking point , which is code for I support HUGE government .Not to mention , the man is a democratic socialist ; there are virtually zero areas where government should be cut for people of this persuasion .Lastly , this is the Democratic Party ; folks who believe that more centralization of federal power is good , especially in the hands of a progressive few who will bring social justice to all peoples .So , we should n't be shocked that they 're not going to minimize government 's scope in any way , shape , or form .Yet , I am a bit unnerved that some members of the Tea Party are voicing support for this left wing charade of revolution to redistribute wealth .I guess the silver linings here are that a ) those who call themselves Tea Partiers , who agree with this nonsense , were never true conservatives to begin with and b ) big government is still more feared than big business .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.98699"}

{"text": "Friday , February 12 .By Matt Vespa .Editor 's Note : This post has been updated .Yes , I know that there 's no such thing as assault weapons , but let 's just entertain this awful piece of liberal jargon for the sake of argument .Over at Hot Air , Jazz Shaw noted that it might be time for the high court to definitively rule on whether it was a constitutional right for Americans to own AR-15 rifles .Second Amendment enthusiasts were again hit with disappointment last December when the Court decided to take a pass on whether to hear oral arguments on an assault weapons ban implemented in the Chicago - area city of Highland Park .Now , on the east coast , deep - blue Maryland 's 2013 assault weapons ban is back in the legal crosshairs , with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that a stricter legal standard should have been applied to ascertain its constitutionality .It 's a tremendous decision , though the current ban remains in effect while the legal camps begin arming themselves for the fight ahead .This was applied to federal enclaves ; it was expanded to the states in the McDonald v. Chicago decision .Yet , the Court noted that this right was not unlimited , and that certain limitations on weapons considered \" dangerous and unusual \" could pass constitutional muster .Grenade launchers , rocket - propelled grenades , and atomic weapons fit this category , not AR-15 semiautomatic rifles .Yet , as Dahlia Lithwick wrote in Slate , it 's dubious whether the Supremes will get involved in Kolbe v. Hogan .It 's certainly a possibility , and it offers another legal avenue for Second Amendment supporters to make their case for a broader ruling over the entire country concerning the legality of assault weapons bans .On a side note , Ms. Lithwick , like most left - of - center publications , need to brush up on their firearms nomenclature ( of which I sometimes screw up ) right : .The 4th Circuit then argued that since handguns kill far more people than semi - automatic weapons , and that since Heller made handgun ownership constitutional , the less overall deadly semi - automatic assault weapons must not be dangerous and unusual either .Writing alone in dissent Judge Robert B. King is unequivocal : \" Let 's be real : The assault weapons banned by Maryland 's FSA are exceptionally lethal weapons of war .In fact , the most popular of the prohibited semiautomatic rifles , the AR-15 , functions almost identically to the military 's fully automatic M16 . \"He also notes that the Supreme Court specifically called out M16 rifles in Heller when defining \" dangerous and unusual .\" First , there are no weapons that are \" less deadly semiautomatic \" weapons , unless you 're referring to bolt - action rifles , commonly associated with hunting , or muzzle - loaders , of which no one has really used en masse since the 18 th and 19 th centuries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.99394"}

Earl Ray Tomblin 's vetoes on the bills that will repeal the state 's prevailing wage and make West Virginia a right to work state in votes taken during Friday 's floor sessions .The Republican - controlled Senate overrode both vetoes on an 18 - 16 party line vote while the House voted 55 - 44 to override prevailing wage and 54 - 43 to do the same with the right to work bill .Both now will become law .On July 1 , West Virginia will become the 26th state to become right to work while the current prevailing wage will be repealed in about three months .After debating the right to work bill for more than five hours last week , House members were mainly quiet before the veto override vote .DHS Employee : The Obama Administration Ordered Us To ' Scrub ' Intelligence Of Muslims With Terror Ties .Friday , February 12 .By Matt Vespa .So , in the era of fighting radical Islamic terrorism , the Obama administration reportedly told workers at the Department of Homeland Security to scrub the records of Muslims with terror ties ; information that 's been collected for years , according to Philip Haney .Haney broke his silence on the matter last week in The Hill , where he said that the president 's remarks that the intelligence community could n't connect the dots post - underwear bomber in 2009 was infuriating since these actions would remove any chance at doing so .Haney had been a DHS employee for 15 years : .Twenty - three - year old Nigerian Muslim Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab intended to detonate Northwest Airlines Flight 253 , but the explosives in his underwear malfunctioned and brave passengers subdued him until he could be arrested .The graphic and traumatic defeat they planned for the United States failed , that time .Following the attempted attack , President Obama threw the intelligence community under the bus for its failure to \" connect the dots . \"He said , \" this was not a failure to collect intelligence , it was a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence that we already had .\" Most Americans were unaware of the enormous damage to morale at the Department of Homeland Security , where I worked , his condemnation caused .His words infuriated many of us because we knew his administration had been engaged in a bureaucratic effort to destroy the raw material - the actual intelligence we had collected for years , and erase those dots .The dots constitute the intelligence needed to keep Americans safe , and the Obama administration was ordering they be wiped away .[ ... ] .These types of records are the basis for any ability to \" connect dots .\" [ ... ] .Now , this is just one account , albeit a devastating one .It shows that the Obama administration is n't doing what many feel right now - keeping the country safe .Nevertheless , we shall see if anything more comes of this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.171165"}
{"text": "An AR-15 rifle is also a semiautomatic weapon , which is why this argument that the AR-15 and the M16 are pretty much the same is so silly .An M16 rifle , the ones used by our military , can fire multiple rounds per trigger pull .There are other firearms that will continue to fire as long as the trigger is pulled ( aka automatic ) as well .That makes these weapon systems wholly different from the AR-15 , not identical .And , yes , automatic firearms for civilians are legal if you are willing to undergo the long process overseen by the ATF , wherein you pay a tax and have your weapons catalogued in a database .The background check can take up to a year or more .Given that that handguns and the civilian AR-15 rifle are both self - reloading weapons systems , will liberals honestly make the \" it looks scary \" argument ?That would be hilarious .Additionally , as Jazz noted , there is no public safety issue here .Rifles and shotguns are rarely used in criminal acts , and gun homicides have been almost cut in half since the early 1990s .The gun homicide rate has dropped by 3.9 percent from last year , according to the FBI .Yet , in the case that this comes before the Court , Lithwick aptly noted that if our side could n't muster four votes for the Highland Park case - it shows that we might have trouble regarding keeping the pro - Second Amendment wing of the Court in line .Moreover , is the Second Amendment is truly being infringed if handguns and shotguns can still be owned in areas where these so - called assault weapons are banned ?It 's perfectly legal for a handful of deep - blue states to be stupid and ban these weapon .They already have .Of course , I 'm against this argument .Law - abiding Americans should have the right to own any firearm they choose , and carry those firearms in all 50 states .I want national reciprocity , but our successes in the courts have provided a sort - of double - edged sword .There is little question regarding what the Second Amendment means in our court system ( though that does n't mean we should let our guard down ) , so it 's quite possible that nothing may come of the Kolbe case as there is nothing to be settled .There is an opening for oral arguments ; we just might be surprised .But given how SCOTUS reacted initially to Highland Park and the few petitions concerning concealed carry - we should n't hold be shocked if nothing changes .If they do decide to take up Kolbe in the future , it 's tremendous news ; if not , well , its just business as usual regarding gun rights on the Court .Yes , this is sort of a wet blanket post , but let 's not try to get overly excited .The door can once again be shut in our faces .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.85771"}
