'\" Love put us over the top .You would n't think it , because football is a game known for machismo and violence and toughness , but love is what drove our success .Just like the most epic action movies end up being love stories - ' The Matrix , ' ' Star Wars , ' ' Gladiator . 'This Ravens team is a love story .\" The story began 54 weeks ago , when a pair of late blunders doomed Baltimore to a crushing defeat to the New England Patriots in the 2011 AFC championship game .A postgame speech by Lewis helped drive the Ravens to overcome a litany of obstacles and navigate their way through internal tension that included a contentious late October meeting after the linebacker went down with what was believed to be a season - ending triceps injury .Ray Lewis ( 52 ) reacts after the defense stopped the 49ers on fourth - and - goal in the closing minutes .( AP ) .\" We had the toughest road in these playoffs , \" Suggs said Sunday night .\" We did it , baby .We did it together . \"In those 11 emotional minutes on Saturday night , Lewis reminded his teammates of all of that , and more .\" Ray said last night that he 's never felt love like this on any team that he 's ever played on in this life , \" Ayanbadejo said . \"And he included the 2000 team [ which won the Ravens ' only other Super Bowl].He said that we 're willing to do anything for each other , and that 's when you become a champion , when you 're willing to do anything for the man next to you .People were crying .He was crying .It was the last time he was ever gon na stand up in front of us .So it was an intimate , special moment that we had together .It was a night I 'll never forget .It was just a culmination of everything we believed in , 54 weeks ago when we lost that AFC championship game .As if the Ravens needed an additional emotional jolt , it came on Super Sunday .A few hours before the game , former Baltimore linebacker and current senior adviser to player development O.J. Brigance addressed the team .Once Baltimore 's players took the field at the Superdome , they felt the love of their raucous , chanting supporters .Twelve years ago at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa , in the franchise 's fifth season of existence , Ravens fans were vastly outnumbered by those of the New York Giants , a team Baltimore would dispatch by a 34 - 7 score .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.69877"}
