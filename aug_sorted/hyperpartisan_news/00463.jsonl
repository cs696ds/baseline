Nixon , whose campaign emphasized patriotism and the rule of law .In 1968 , the nation swung rightward , a shift accelerated by George Wallace of Alabama , a third - party candidate whose anti - political rhetoric outdid even Nixon 's with its attacks on elite northern white liberals , \" pointy - headed intellectuals , \" and protesters generally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.01071"}

Breggin , MD , a psychiatrist in private practice in Washington , DC , for several decades and now in Ithaca , New York .In the early 1990s I became the first physician to speak and write extensively about the new antidepressants causing violence , suicide and other abnormal behavioral reactions .I became the scientific expert for more than one hundred combined cases against Eli Lilly concerning Prozac - induced violence and suicide , and wrote many related books and scientific articles .In 2004 the FDA finally upgraded the warnings for all antidepressant drugs .The FDA 's language was virtually borrowed from one of my scientific publications ( Breggin , 2003 ) , which the agency had provided to each member of its review committee .My conclusions in this testimony are based on dozens of citations listed in the scientific paper I have written specifically for this hearing , \" Antidepressant - Induced Suicide and Violence : Risks for Military Personnel .\" My conclusions are further based on hundreds of scientific citations in my published papers and in chapters 6 and 7 of my 2008 medical book , Brain - Disabling Treatments in Psychiatry , Second Edition ( New York : Springer Publishing Company .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.05386"}

Bush .The electorate voted against Bush 's wars of choice , civil liberties abuses , executive power grabs and government secrecy , all in the name of national security .Rightly or wrongly , they also blamed Bush for a bad economy .He certainly had n't done anything to help .During his campaign , former constitutional law professor Barack Obama promised to end the wars , restore constitutional protections of civil liberties , and run a \" transparent \" administration .He promised to review every one of Bush 's executive orders and overturn any that \" trampled on liberty . \"He promised to close the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay .For the liberals , he promised to fight against the cozy relationship between multinational corporations and Washington , D.C. .Obama did wind down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , but he started several new ones , with results even more disastrous .Siding with rebels in Libya to overthrow former U.S. adversary - turned - partner Muammar Gadhafi , the Obama administration allowed the country to be taken over by much more radical Islamists .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.50214"}

{"text": "In this context of a devaluation of specialist medical skills , it is commonplace in the UK to hear non - psychiatrists - and frequently psychiatrists themselves - referring to psychiatrists as not being ' proper doctors ' .This lack of professional confidence and self - confidence contributes to the retention problems in psychiatry .The absence of such skills in other medical specialties is a common cause of patient dissatisfaction .27 Indeed , Henry Miller went one step further in emphasising this polymath function : ' the psychiatrist should not only first be a physician but ideally a superlative physician ' .To embrace this more positive and self - confident view of psychiatry would , of course , require a commitment by psychiatrists to aim for excellence in the core medical aspects of their role .This would include excellence in the prescribing of psychotropic medications as well as maintaining and developing expertise in the relevant aspects of assessment and management of the non - psychiatric illnesses that so commonly co - occur with psychiatric disorder and which are associated with decreased life expectancy of psychiatric patients .14 , 29 Although this may not appeal to some practising psychiatrists , it is interesting to note that consultants are much more likely to believe that recruitment problems arise because our specialty is ' too psychosocial ' rather than ' too biological ' .26 Whatever the personal preferences of some current psychiatrists , for the sake of the health of our patients 29 and our specialty we need to ensure that these skills are expected of future psychiatrists .All too often in British psychiatry , thinking is dominated by the need to respond to the short - term practical constraints of whatever initiative is current at the time .However , as a profession we should be thinking with a longer - term vision of the needs of patients with psychiatric illness and how those can best be delivered now and over the coming years .Such strategic thinking should inform the profession 's advice to the health service and government as well as shaping training and recruitment initiatives for the specialty .The future .It is hard to imagine that psychiatry will not assume increasing importance over the coming decades .Mental illnesses are , and will continue to be , major causes of human suffering and mortality .Mood disorders on their own are predicted to be second only to ischaemic heart disease as a cause of disability across the globe by 2020 .30 Major advances in molecular biology and neuroscience over recent years have provided psychiatry with powerful tools that help to delineate the biological systems involved in psychopathology and impairments suffered by patients .31 We can be optimistic that over the coming years these advances will facilitate the development of diagnostic approaches with improved biological validity and enhanced clinical utility in terms of predicting treatment response .We can expect that completely novel treatments will be developed based on detailed understanding of pathogenesis .With this , we need to have appropriately skilled and knowledgeable psychiatrists working within services that can accommodate the processes of diagnosis and management involved .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.875824"}

{"text": "There is a strong probability that the documented increase in suicides in the military , as well as any increase in random violence among soldiers , is caused or exacerbated by the widespread prescription of antidepressant medication .Little will be lost and much will be gained by curtailing the prescription of antidepressants in the military .The military instead should rely upon the newly developed psychological and educational programs described by Dr. Bart Billings at today 's hearing .Evidence pertaining to violence and suicide induced by the newer antidepressants has been growing for years ( Breggin and Breggin , 1994 ; Teicher et al . , 2003 ) .Recently public concern has been expressed about the increased prescription of psychiatric medications , especially antidepressants , to military personnel ( Thompson , 2008 ) .At the same time , the military has voiced concern about escalating rates of suicide among active duty soldiers ( Lorge , 2008 ) .At a military conference on combat stress , this author pointed to an association between increasing rates of antidepressant prescription and increasing rates of suicide in the military ( Breggin , 2009 ) .This paper focuses on evidence that antidepressants frequently cause suicide , violence and manic - like symptoms of over - stimulation - and therefore present a serious hazard when given to military personnel .Studies with children will be included , because they commonly involve youth up to age 17 or 18 and because medication risks for all age groups often show up first or most obviously among children .II .Research Leads to FDA Label Changes for the Newer Antidepressants . A. FDA Label Changes .Because of concerns about reported cases of suicide in association with the newer antidepressants , the FDA required a re - evaluation of all controlled clinical trials conducted on children and youth during the FDA approval process .The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) antidepressants were re - evaluated including fluoxetine ( Prozac ) , fluvoxamine ( Luvox ) , paroxetine ( Paxil ) , sertraline ( Zoloft ) , citalopram ( Celexa ) and escitalopram ( Lexapro ) .The study included 4582 patients in 24 trials ( Hammad et al . , 2006 ) .The meta - analysis found that the risk of suicidal ideation and behaviors was doubled for children and youth taking the antidepressants compared to placebo ( 4 percent versus 2 percent ) ( Food and Drug Administration , October 15 , 2004a ) .The eventual label changes , however , were applied to all antidepressants , including older ones where no new evidence was available .To illustrate the FDA - mandated label changes , the following excerpts are taken from the Zoloft ( sertraline ) label as of October 2008 ( see attachments for complete label ) .Identical or nearly identical warnings and information can be found in all antidepressants labels , most of which appear in the Physicians ' Desk Reference .A Black Box at the top of the label warns about the increased risk of suicidal behavior in children and youth , and also young adults ages 18 - 24 , which includes many young soldiers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.17232"}
{"text": "What follows is my analysis of exactly who to hold accountable in 2012 and why .I will try to narrow down the list of 45 Senators who stood against us to a select group that I think we have the most power to influence going into 2012 .Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid pulled two unexpected developments out of his pocket this fall : he became a champion of the DREAM Act in Congress , and he secured victory over his opponent by a margin that no one had foreseen .I propose that these two events were related , but not in an obvious way .Nativism Causes the Nevada Tea Party to Self - destruct .Politicians and pundits speculated that Harry Reid owed his victory over Tea Party candidate Sharon Angle in November because Latino voters were energized .Angle had run a series of anti - immigrant , anti - Latino ads which won her notoriety for running one of the most racist campaigns of the election season .One ad prompted the View 's Joy Behar to taunt Angle to come to the Bronx in one of the election season 's more memorable TV moments .Reid knew that by promoting a bill that would legalize hundreds of thousands of undocumented youth brought to the U.S. as children , he would mobilize Latino voters who could provide the margin of victory he needed against Angle .So he made a public statement of intent to bring the DREAM Act forward , knowing it would polarize the Senate and inject immigration politics into the Senate race in Nevada .In retrospect , it was a brilliant plan .Staging a public push for the DREAM Act , which many voters had never heard of before September , was like waving a red flag in front of a bull for Angle and her Tea Party supporters , driving them to embarrassing outbursts of nativism .It seemed they could n't help themselves .Rachel Maddow called the anti - DREAM Act spot the \" most overtly racist ad of this campaign season . \"These explicitly anti - Latino attacks in turn mobilized a previously disaffected Latino electorate in Nevada which had been upset with Democratic leadership for ignoring immigration reform .Latino voters came out in force and voted for Reid by a high margin -- between 68 % and 90 % depending on the source .Reid won by 5.6 % , mobilizing Latino voters to turnout in record numbers against all predictions .Perhaps it was Reid 's plan all along to pull out the DREAM Act late in the campaign to construct the \" Latino firewall \" that by some accounts saved his job .But maybe there is more to the story .It 's been hard for me to set fingers to keyboard to organize my thoughts about yesterday 's Senate vote blocking the DREAM Act .I have a lot of thoughts and emotions swirling around inside right now .Even before the vote , I felt stymied -- anxious about the bill 's prospects , angry at the obstinate ignorance displayed by opponents , and frustrated at my own feelings of powerlessness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.34624"}

{"text": "Hence , it is imperative that we take action to ensure that patients with mental illness are not disadvantaged compared with others within the National Health Service ( NHS ) .Patients have a right to expect more than non - specific psychosocial support .The drive within the NHS to improve psychosocial care for those with mental illness has been both understandable and welcome : evidence - based psychological and social interventions are extremely important in managing psychiatric illness .However , an unintended adverse effect is that there is an increasing tendency for many services to be based on non - specific psychosocial support with extremely limited therapeutic ambition .Many recent NHS changes , including , for example , those outlined within the National Service Framework for Mental Health , 11 have provided an extensive discussion of important generic issues , including social inclusiveness , stigma and access .For example , in some crisis intervention teams , the focus on the general practicalities of a crisis can lead to patients not receiving the benefit of a thorough diagnostic assessment at the time of acute illness .The effect of this may be to have a negative impact on the outcome of the acute episode .Even if the episode resolves , lack of a thorough diagnostic assessment , including physical examination and investigations , may result in inappropriate , suboptimal or ineffective management between episodes and a failure of relapse prevention .Such a scenario could have major consequences for the life experiences of the patient as well as implications for ' service costs ' .One of the great strengths of medicine , when practised well , is its focus on making a demonstrable difference for the patient and its willingness to be pragmatic in using whatever approaches are shown to be effective .We should seek to minimise the unhelpful influences of political idealism or rigid adherence to particular schools of practice or thought and must strive to ensure that the effectiveness of all therapeutic modalities is judged using similar standards of evidence .12 We must face up to our professional responsibilities to ensure that all aspects of management are as good as possible .This includes advocating the maintenance of the skills , facilities and resources to provide excellence in biomedical care for patients with psychiatric illness .Given our training and our statutory position as prescribers of medication , psychiatrists have a particular responsibility to ensure that pharmacological interventions as well as other interventions are used appropriately and according to the best available evidence .We must not contribute to stigmatising and disadvantaging psychiatric patients by denying them access to treatments that work .Patients referred by their general practitioner should be assessed by a named psychiatrist rather than an anonymous team .Psychiatry is a medical specialty .We believe that psychiatry should behave like other medical specialties .When a general practitioner is confident that a psychiatric assessment is not needed , it should be possible for a referral to be made directly to a relevant nonpsychiatric professional .However , where the general practitioner is unclear about diagnosis or treatment , the patient should be assessed by the most appropriately skilled and experienced professional on the team , the psychiatrist .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.65122"}

{"text": "\" When Rubio is asked to name his single greatest achievement in the Senate , do you hear crickets ? \" tweeted the National Journal 's Ron Fournier .Though Rick Santorum was unable to name the accomplishments of the man he just endorsed , there are indeed several accomplishments that are quite noteworthy .Below are a few of Sen. Rubio 's achievements that Rick Santorum could have identified on MSNBC this morning : .( 1 )The Rubio - Schumer Gang of Eight Bill .The Washington Examiner 's Byron York has described the 2013 Rubio - Schumer bill as Rubio 's \" signature accomplishment . \"Although Santorum seemed reluctant to mention it , Rubio 's immigration bill is probably the first accomplishment that comes to mind when anyone thinks of Rubio 's very brief career in the U.S. Senate .Rubio 's immigration bill would have tripled the issuances of green cards , doubled the dispensation of foreign worker visas , and granted citizenship - and , thereby , welfare access and voting privileges - to illegal immigrants .Reports ranging from the The National Review , to the Tampa Bay Times , to the Washington Post , to the New Yorker have all suggested that the Gang of Eight bill would have likely not passed the Senate if not for Sen. Rubio 's tireless efforts .Indeed , Rubio was the key salesman of the Obama - backed immigration agenda .As Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker reported at the time , Rubio served as \" the Gang 's official ambassador to the right , \" and was able to convince prominent conservatives to promote the open borders legislation .Lizza wrote : \" [ Democratic Senator Bob ] Menendez told me that Rubio 's role was to ' work over the conservative universe , particularly the conservative opinion - maker universe , ' in order to ' neutralize them ' and , in some cases , ' proselytize them . 'Schumer said , ' He 's the real deal . ' \" Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin told Lizza , \" [ Rubio ] has been invaluable ...He 's willing to go on the most conservative talk shows , television and radio , Rush Limbaugh and the rest . \"Moreover , Rubio was also able to successfully strike down all conservative amendments to the Gang of Eight 's proposal .As Sen. Rand Paul ( R - KY ) 94 % pointed out , \" \" Marco and Schumer basically had a secret deal to block all amendments . \"Indeed , Rubio joined Chuck Schumer in voting down an amendment offered by Sen. Thune , which would have required the completion of a double - layer border fence .He also successfully defeated an amendment offered by Sen. Vitter , which would require the implementation of an exit - entry tracking system in order to prevent foreign nationals from illegally overstaying their visas .( 2 ) Obamatrade .Sen. Rubio cast the 60th and deciding vote to fast - track the Trans - Pacific Partnership agreement .By giving President Obama fast - track powers , Rubio essentially helped to ensure the passage of not only the TPP , but all subsequent trade pacts , which are now liberated from Senate filibuster , amendment process , and constitutional treaty vote .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.63286"}

D.

E. A Broad Range of Adverse Behavioral Effects in Children and Youth .Studies of children often include youth as old as age seventeen or eighteen .There are many studies confirming suicidality and aggression in children and youth ( see earlier in this report and Breggin , 2008b ) .Also , children are often more sensitive to drugs and are more likely to display adverse effects that will also appear with less frequency in adults .Researchers at Clinical and Research Program in Pediatric Psychopharmacology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School systematically evaluated 82 charts of children and adolescents treated with SSRIs for depressive or OCD symptoms over a mean period of 26.9 months ( Wilens et al . , 2003 ) .Psychiatric Adverse Events ( PAEs ) were found in 22 percent , \" most commonly related to disturbances in mood . \" Of the 82 children , 21 percent developed mood disorders , including 15 percent who became irritable , 10 percent who became anxious , 9 percent who became depressed , and 6 percent who became manic .In addition , 4 percent of the children became aggressive .Sleep disorders afflicted 35 percent of the children , including 23 percent drowsy and 17 percent insomnia .Finally , 10 percent became psychotic !Go et al .( 1998 ) reviewed the cases of 40 youths , ages 12 - 18 , treated with antidepressants for OCD .Thirty percent ( 6 of 20 ) developed hypomanic or manic symptoms .Jain , Birmaher , Garcia , Al - Shabbout and Ryan ( 1992 ) made a retrospective examination of the medical charts of children and young men age 9 - 18 , who had taken fluoxetine at university clinic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.65445"}
