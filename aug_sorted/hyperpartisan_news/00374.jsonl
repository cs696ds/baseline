Hillary Rodham Clinton ( D - N.Y. ) rolled out Tuesday the endorsement of megastar Barbra Streisand .Streisand is being used to reclaim the political news cycle --- there 's been a lot of pondering going on in print and cable over the value of celebrity endorsements in general and Winfrey in particular .The announcement did not say if Streisand , a longtime Democratic activist who has been close to Bill and Hill for years -- would go on the stump for Clinton .Unlike Winfrey , a beloved figure who until now has stayed away from politics in order to not devalue her brand , Streisand is the star Repubublicans love to brand as a left - winger .Legendary filmmaker , artist , and Democratic activist , Barbra Streisand , today endorsed Hillary Clinton for President .Streisand cited Clinton 's ability to bring about change and the historic nature of her campaign as reasons why she is supporting Hillary 's candidacy . \"Madame President of the United States ... it 's an extraordinary thought .We truly are in a momentous time , where a woman 's potential has no limitations , \" said Streisand .\" Hillary Clinton has already proven to a generation of women that there are no limits for success .She is driven by her passion for public service and her belief in the enormous potential of our country .Smart , capable and strong in her convictions , Hillary has transcended the dictates of what is thought to be possible for our time .Hillary is a powerful voice for change as we find our country at an important crossroads .Under her leadership , our country will regain its respect within the global community .She will prioritize issues of global climate change , universal health care and rebuilding a strong economy .After 8 long years , the public will once again have faith in their government . \"Another former first lady , Eleanor Roosevelt once wrote , ' In government , in business , and in the professions there may be a day when women will be looked upon as persons .We are , however , far from that day as yet . 'More than 50 years later ' that day ' is now upon us ... and Hillary Clinton is ready to shatter through that glass ceiling for all women . \" Streisand has been working on behalf of Democratic candidates for over forty years , performing at fundraisers and participating in campaign events .In addition , the Streisand Foundation has raised millions for causes including the environment , women 's equality as well as human and civil rights and liberties .\" I 'm honored to have Barbra 's support , \" said Clinton .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.24736"}

Now , we discover time travel , and go back in time and switch them at birth .Does John now live life B and James live life A ?Or does John live life A and James live life B , even though they were switched ?I would argue that neither is quite true .John will most likely develop into a person similar to his first life , but not exactly the same .Likewise , James will also develop into a person similar to his first life , but not exactly the same .Thus you would not be able to say that John and James were equal at birth , nor would you be able to say that they were completely genetically predestined to live out their life the way they did .Both genes and environment come into play .And standardized education as an arbitrary human condition disrupted human evolution big time , when its myth on specialization is unifying the mutation process , aka divergent thinking .I went two steps further to analyze the source of DSM IV on psychopathy : Snakes in Suits : When psychopaths go to work .The book breaks down psychopathy into a sub section of APD .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.74961"}

Now , we discover time travel , and go back in time and switch them at birth .Does John now live life B and James live life A ?Or does John live life A and James live life B , even though they were switched ?I would argue that neither is quite true .John will most likely develop into a person similar to his first life , but not exactly the same .Likewise , James will also develop into a person similar to his first life , but not exactly the same .Thus you would not be able to say that John and James were equal at birth , nor would you be able to say that they were completely genetically predestined to live out their life the way they did .Both genes and environment come into play .Do n't get psychopathy all missed up with APD , you 've no idea just how serious the matter is : a psychopath manipulates others in order to get what they want , someone with APD OTOH does n't .Finally , when men and women were socialized differently due to gender ideology , it 's not hard to see why their brains developed differently .That 's completely different that your \" blank slate \" hypothesis .Natural selection is part of evolution .Evolution is comprised of two driving factors : 1 ) Natural selection and 2 ) Mutation .Natural selection weeds out undesirable genetic traits .Natural selection can act very fast , especially amongst r - strategist species where several generations of a species are produced in a short amount of time .Excessive natural selection reduces genetic diversity and can be harmful in the long run - especially if there is a sudden environmental shift .For example , it was natural selection which caused humans to become omnivores .in the process , however , we lost our ability to synthesize certain amino acids and vitamins .Now we are dependent upon eating meat , or a wide variety of vegetables in order to get the nutrients we need , where we used to be able to subsist entirely on fruits and nuts .Mutation is a source of genetic diversity , as it slowly adds new , random genes to a specie 's gene pool .Usually these genes do nothing noticeable .As for psychopathy , this term was redefined to Antisocial Personality Disorder in the 1980 's by the 3rd edition of the DSM - the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders written by the American Psychological Association .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.832016"}

Wendy Davis that grabbed national headlines .The push in Texas comes after other states have passed such bans in recent years , including Nebraska , Kansas , Louisiana , Oklahoma , Indiana and Alabama .Arkansas has a ban in place for pregnancies beyond 18 weeks , and North Dakota has the tightest restriction in the country at six weeks , when a fetal heartbeat can be detected .The press release regarding Santorum 's event comes from Patriot Voices , his grassroots conservative non - profit organization .According to Patriot Voices , the group recently launched a petition \" that has garnered thousands of signatures asking Americans to stand with life .\" The press release also states that Texas Lt .Gov. David Dewhurst , as well as state anti - abortion leaders , will join Santorum at his event in Austin .Santorum , who battled eventual GOP 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney deep into last year 's Republican primary season , is considering a 2016 bid for the White House .sound off ( 120 Responses ) .Rudy NYC .Rudy NYC I guess you do not believe in the 1stAmendment , which defines that The People shall have freedom OF religion and the government shall have freedom FROM religion .well rudy appears to have gone off the deep end .... just where in the constitution does it say the government shall have freedom from religion ?it does n't say it so please stop lying .---------------- Learn how to read .I clearly stated that it is in the 1st Amendment .I also did not quote the Amendment , either , but I will now . rs Murder is not a \" belief \" .No human being has the right to murder another one , especially an innocent , helpless baby .If the baby is far enough along to survive outside of the womb , then it is murder .Women need to start accepting responsibility for their actions and stop murdering their babies under the false pretense of \" healthcare \" ._ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _You need to grasp just how breathtakingly radical the notion is that grown women need to be have their rights held hostage by their uterus- and your somewhat sick desire to legislate what happens there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.94611"}
