Louie Gohmert ( R - TX ) appeared on the FOX Business show Money Rocks to make the case for depriving the children of immigrants of their 14th Amendment rights .Gohmert claimed that on a recent airplane trip to the Middle East , one of his traveling companions had struck up a conversation with a grandmother who described her family 's involvement in a Hamas plot to send pregnant women to the United States .Gohmert summarized the lesson for viewers this way : \" We 're bringing them over here on tourist visas , some illegally , letting them be born here and saying , ' This is an American citizen .So come back in 20 , 25 years when you 're ready to blow us up . '\" It 's a bizarre story .In particular , the five Republicans singled out Huma Abedin , a long - time aide to Hillary Clinton , in their letter to the State Department .Abedin , the letter noted , \" has three family members - her late father , her mother , and her brother - connected to Muslim Brotherhood operatives and/or organizations .Her position provides her with routine access to the Secretary and to policy - making . \" In this odd age , partisan hysteria and conspiracy theories have become a common feature of the American political landscape .But the anti - Abedin attack was too much even for fellow Republicans .To his credit , Sen. John McCain publicly declared that the letter constituted \" an unwarranted and unfounded attack on an honorable woman , a dedicated American , and a loyal public servant . \"( He also debunked its factual claims . )Ed Rollins , Bachmann 's former campaign chief , wrote an op - ed for FOX calling his old boss ' attack on Abedin \" extreme , \" \" dishonest , \" and \" vicious .\" The backlash against the Bachmann Five reassures us that there is some residual spirit of decency and fair play remaining in Washington politics .Still , many observers are left to wonder at the sheer ludicrousness of the implicit accusation against Abedin .Aside from random airplane encounters with Arab grandmothers , where did the accusers get the idea that some sort of Islamist \" stealth jihad \" is taking control of Washington from within ?And how many other Americans share this belief ?As I discovered during the research for my 2011 book on conspiracy theories , Among The Truthers , such ideas have become quite common on the right - wing side of the American political spectrum .At Tea Party events , I often heard speakers argue - usually on the basis of scattered anecdotes , like the one Gohmert related on FOX - that sharia is taking over the United States ; and that the White House itself already has become a fifth column in this insidious campaign .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.4769"}
