{"text": "Many experts see the trials as part of an election - year effort by the Bush administration to demonstrate its commitment to fighting terrorism , and many predict a surge of anti - American sentiment in the Middle East and throughout the Islamic world .Some believe that the Bush administration is using the trials to enhance the political fortunes of Republican presidential candidate John McCain , who has made the US battle against al - Qaeda a centerpiece of his campaign .\" What we are looking at is a series of show trials by the Bush administration that are really devoid of any due process considerations , \" says Vincent Warren , the executive director head of the Center for Constitutional Rights , which represents many Guantanamo detainees . \"Rather than playing politics the Bush administration should be seeking speedy and fair trials .These are trials that are going to be based on torture as confessions as well as secret evidence .There is no way that this can be said to be fair especially as the death penalty could be an outcome . \" Treatment of Detainees an Issue - While the involvement of the six detainees in the 9/11 attacks is hardly disputed , many questions surround their treatment at Guantanamo and various secret \" black sites \" used to house and interrogate terror suspects out of the public eye .Details of Forthcoming Tribunals - While the charges are being announced now , Brigadier General Thomas Hartmann , the Pentagon official supervising the case , acknowledges that it could be months before the cases actually begin , and years before any possible executions would be carried out .Hartmann promises the trials will be \" as completely open as possible , \" with lawyers and journalists present in the courtroom unless classified information is being presented .Additionally , the six defendants will be considered innocent until proven guilty , and the defendants ' lawyers will be given \" every stitch of evidence \" against their clients . 'Kangaroo Court ' - British lawyer Clive Stafford Smith , who has worked with \" enemy combatants \" at Guantanamo , believes nothing of what Hartmann says .The procedures are little more than a \" kangaroo court , \" Stafford Smith says , and adds , \" Anyone can see the hypocrisy of espousing human rights , then trampling on them . \"Despite Hartmann 's assurances , it is anything but clear just what rights the six defendants will actually have .[ Independent , 2/12/2008 ]The charges against al - Khahtani are dropped several months later ( see May 13 , 2008 ) .Jaber Elbaneh 's appearance in court .[ Source : Associated Press / Mohammed al - Qadhi . ] Jaber Elbaneh , an Islamist militant wanted by the US , comes out of hiding to appear in court in Yemen , but is not arrested .Elbaneh , a US citizen and whose family came from Yemen , had lived in Lackawanna , New York , before the 9/11 attacks .He went to Afghanistan to train at an al - Qaeda training camp along with about six other men from Lackawanna , but while the others dropped out and returned to the US , Elbaneh never returned ( see April - August 2001 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.48357"}
