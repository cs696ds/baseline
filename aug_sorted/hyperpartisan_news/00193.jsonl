Obama while his camp has taken the high road and generally refused to respond in kind .He has repeatedly stated that all the candidates are patriots while Hillary has invoked the failed terrorist attack in France to imply that the nation may be more vulnerable to terrorist attack if Obama is elected .These are Rovian tactics .We saw it again today on Meet The Press .Hillary 's implication that the outrage the African American community has voiced regarding the racially charged remarks of her campaign is some sort of manifestation of an Obama campaign strategy is almost just as insulting as her recent comments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "36.171734"}

{"text": "But we should not be surprised if doing so , in our current political landscape , turns out to be an unproductive step .What Robert Lewis Dear did was terrifying and barbaric , and it is becoming increasingly clear that his actions were inspired by the anti - abortion meme .But it is not useful to label any crazy person who does horrific things a terrorist , however much the old definitions might fit .We have to be cognizant in this debate that the global war on terror changed everything , particularly the language of terrorism .Terrorism is no longer simply a word used to describe a political tactic , but has become a moral absolute , a designation of evil .It may be that the word has lost its salience for the application to events of \" domestic terrorism \" that lack an organized , systematic framework , and to which the anti - terrorism tools and tactics do not apply .In his speech declaring the global war on terror , President George Bush assigned equal moral culpability to those who commit acts of terror and those who support them .Translated into our domestic landscape , this suggests that an acknowledgement by Carly Fiorina or Ted Cruz that their rhetoric may have inspired Dear 's actions could imply culpability for a terrorist act .Even if that is exactly what their political antagonists would love to see , it would only take us farther down a slippery slope in a year when political rhetoric has already begun to test the limits of what a democracy can tolerate .Speaking before the Council on Foreign Relations last week , Hillary Clinton established the objective that is commonly held among all presidential aspirants : ISIS must not be contained , it must be destroyed .Yet beyond that statement , despite all the fury generated on the campaign trail by the ISIS attacks and the failures of American strategy to date , there is little that any of the candidates have suggested that differs much from what we have been doing so far .Aerial bombardment , special ops and arming the Kurds , plus other stuff at the margin .Our engagement in Syria has a certain Alice in Wonderland quality to it .By all accounts , we are opposed to almost every side of that country 's civil war .Our attempts to \" train up \" our own moderate fighting force has been an expensive failure .The notion that we were going to train moderate Syrian Sunnis on Saudi soil to return to Syria to fight Sunni extremists , who were themselves weaned on Saudi - Wahhabi theology and funded by Qatari money , was from the beginning steeped in irony .Our ability to engage our Sunni allies in the region to spearhead the anti - ISIS fight has had limited success .The Saudis , who funneled money into anti - Assad rebels from early in the uprising , briefly participated in the anti - ISIS airwar , but their interests remain primarily sectarian and their focus has shifted to their proxy war with Iran in Yemen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.410973"}

{"text": "Rather , compassionately dealing with such a situation has a different meaning .When a person or group of people deals with such a situation and tries to prevent such crimes there is generally speaking two ways in which you could do that , or one could say , two motivations .One is out of confrontation , out of hatred that confronts such a situation .There is another case in which , although in action it may be of the same force and strength , but the motivation would not be out of hatred and anger but rather out of compassion towards the perpetrators of these crimes .Realising that if you allow the other person , the perpetrator of the crime , to indulge his or her own negative habits then in the long run the other person or group is going to suffer the consequences of that negative action .Therefore , out of the consideration of the potential suffering for the perpetrator of such crimes , then you confront the situation and apply equally forceful and strong measures .I think this is quite relevant and important in modern society , especially in a competitive society .When someone genuinely practices compassion , forgiveness and humility then sometimes some people will take advantage of such a situation .Sometimes it is necessary to take a countermeasure , then with that kind of reasoning and compassion , the countermeasure is taken with reasoning and compassion rather than out of negative emotion .That is actually more effective and appropriate .This is important .For example my own case with Tibet in a national struggle against injustice we take action without using negative emotion .It sometimes seems more effective .Therefore a strong countermeasure , taken out of compassion or a sense of concern for the other , is necessary .When you are motivated by that realization , then there is a sense of concern as part of your motive for taking that strong measure . . ..So , from that point of view , there is enough ground to feel compassionate toward the aggressor .TAKING AND GIVING - TONG LEN .This practice is possibly the ultimate practice in altruism .It is definitely not easy to get ourselves to genuinely do this , but if done well , it quickly undermines our selfishness .Shantideva expressed the value of this practice as follows : .\" If I do not actually exchange my happiness For the sufferings of others , I shall not attain the state of Buddhahood And even in cyclic existence I shall have no joy .There are two levels in the development of bodhicitta ; aspiring and engaging bodhicitta .A person with the aspiring intention wants to attain enlightenment to help others , but he or she is not yet prepared to engage in all of the practices and activities necessary to do so .Such a person may want to take the aspiring bodhicitta vows .On the other hand , someone who has generated the engaging altruistic intention and is prepared to joyfully undertake the Bodhisattva 's practices of the six perfections , can take the bodhisattva vows .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.162926"}

{"text": "This year 's revolt of less - educated , southern , rural and working class voters against the GOP establishment has been simmering for decades .The Republican Party establishment has long held tight control over its nomination process .As the saying goes , Democrats fall in love , Republicans fall in line .Yet along the way there has been a history of discord .In 1992 and 1996 , Nixon speechwriter and conservative herald Pat Buchanan led his Peasants with Pitchforks uprisings against the establishment candidates , winning 20 - 25 % of the primary vote against the incumbent George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole , respectively .Buchanan 's share of the vote mirrored exactly the share of the GOP electorate represented by the Wallace voters that Nixon brought into the party .The subsequent emergence of the Tea Party movement within the Republican Party demonstrated more than a decade after Buchanan 's last race that the anti - establishment , nativist wing of the GOP was alive and well .Over the past fifty years , the GOP has catered to the socially conservative views of the voters who migrated to the GOP in the wake of the Southern Strategy , but has been largely inimical to their economic interests .Pat Buchanan railed for years that the GOP was serving the interests of Republican corporate and Wall Street elites by supporting free trade and immigration policies that undermined the economic interests of working and middle class Americans .Donald Trump expanded on Buchanan 's attacks on the GOP establishment when he targeted the preferential tax treatment provided to hedge fund managers and the control of GOP candidates by mega - donors and special interests .Even as the GOP establishment is complaining about Donald Trump 's rhetoric , the rest of the Republican field has largely ignored evidence from his rise that the Republican base is mad as hell and is n't going to take it any more .As Mitt Romney famously observed four years ago , the bottom 40 % of Americans pay no federal income tax , while those in the middle quintile have an average income tax rate of only 1.3 % .In the wake of the most recent turmoil , leaders of the GOP still seem to be pinning their hopes on Trump voters falling in line , but history suggests that they wo n't .GOP efforts to shame Trump into submission -- and preferably into leaving the race -- are ill - conceived .As recent polling has suggested -- and as has been evident for months now -- Trump has his finger on the pulse of a broad swath of the GOP electorate , and those voters appear to be hunkering down in defense of their man .Paul Ryan complains that Trump is not acting as a conservative , but Ryan is showing a tin ear to the situation facing his party .The definition of being a conservative -- to say nothing of being a Republican -- has changed dramatically over the years .Richard Nixon walked away from the New England small government conservatives when he brought southern , rural and evangelical conservatives into the fold who were activists on social issues .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.42714"}
