Fox ( 2000 ) summarizes how the scene - act ratio downplays celebrity status in this way : .By now , many of you have heard my story .But , you have n't heard this story,-about a 38-year old senior editor whose PD [ Parkinson 's disease ] caused her to lose her job at a publishing house , plunging her from New York 's middle class into poverty .( para .What is important for celebrities like Fox is not their own celebrity or even their own personal struggles - they describe themselves as motivated to tell the stories of other , less visible victims .Agent is pushed aside in favor of scene .These celebrities do not argue \" I 'm here because I 'm famous\"-they argue \" I 'm here because the situation demands that someone give a voice to those who can not speak for themselves . \"Secondly , and following from this observation , the scene - act ratio creates a much nobler motive for celebrity testimony .Celebrities do not portray themselves as public relations tools of Congress : They portray themselves as good people taking a stand on important issues .Whether the problem is a disease , lack of research funding , religious oppression , ageism , the mistreatment of animals , or a host of other issues , celebrities ascribe noble motives to themselves .This finding is not necessarily surprising , but is mostly ignored by the literature on committee hearings and witnesses , which suggests that celebrity witnesses are little more than pawns to be maneuvered about for political gain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.7204"}

Novak then that Wilson , a partisan critic of Bush 's foreign policy , was sent to Niger at the suggestion of Plame , who worked in the nonproliferation unit at CIA .The disclosure of Plame 's identity , which was classified , led to an investigation into who leaked her name .The report may bolster the rationale that administration officials provided the information not to intentionally expose an undercover CIA employee , but to call into question Wilson 's bona fides as an investigator into trafficking of weapons of mass destruction .To charge anyone with a crime , prosecutors need evidence that exposure of a covert officer was intentional . \"The next day , the operations official cabled an overseas officer seeking concurrence with the idea of sending Wilson , the report said .Wilson has asserted that his wife was not involved in the decision to send him to Niger .... .The report also said Wilson provided misleading information to The Washington Post last June .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.869446"}
{"text": "But basing a 21st - century business on the selling of CDs ?Are they serious ?Tuesday , May 29 , 2007 .The Estonia - Russia Cyberwar ... .The New York Times ran an article this morning on the cyberwar between Estonia and Russia that has been going on for the past month .The New York Times assesses its significance as being \" the first war in cyberspace \" , yet the real story is why it took the newspaper over a month to report on the story while blogger journalists have been writing on it since its inception .The Russians did all of this , not by \" hacking \" into Estonian computer systems the way the mainstream public uses the term , but by distributed denial of service ( DDOS ) attacks .Basically , software bots turn computers around the world into \" zombies \" that send and request so much data from Estonian servers that they become overloaded and shut down from not being able to handle all of the traffic .It is presumed that such DDOS attacks have been previously used in the Israeli - Palestinian and Serbian - Croatian conflicts , and the New York Times makes the frightening revelation that China , Russia , the U.S. , and numerous other nations already have an \" offensive information - warfare programs \" .But the real story here is why it took over a month for this story of cyberwar to be reported in the mainstream media .Perhaps we can toss that up to the traditional press doing a poor job , or to the New Media carrying the torch of news reporting to better effect .But , regardless , after following this story for several weeks already , does anyone else find today 's Times article somewhat ridiculous ?Thursday , May 24 , 2007 .MySpace and its Treatment of Sex Offenders ... .Recently MySpace announced it would crack down on known sex offenders who use the popular website .This all seems well and good .After all , who can complain about MySpace taking steps to protect its underage users from predatory sex offenders ?Sex offenders can .Carl H. is a registered sex offender who has responded to MySpace closing his account by writing into a Wired Blog .Carl H. says that he seeks justice .He makes a valid argument in that if MySpace is going to ban sex offenders , than why not also \" for identity theft convictions , drug dealing convictions , murder convictions ?Because criminals use MySpace for these things as well . \"His prescription ...MySpace should monitor its site and kick off pedophiles , while leaving ex - offenders alone .Is it possible that Carl H. has a good idea , and yet is simultaneously misguided ?It does make sense for MySpace ( and similar social networking websites ) to monitor its site for pedophiles and behavior that is predatory .In fact , even more protections are need .That would certainly help to better protect children , and would establish people 's behavior as the basis for banning them from participation on the site .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.885284"}
{"text": "The answer to this question , of course , can be derived from the dictum that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence .When an extraordinary claim supporting the truth of an extraordinary statement , such as that there was a real Noahic flood , is made , that extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence for its support , and , thus , should be subject to the so - called \" verification principle \" .Likewise , when an ordinary claim supporting the falsehood of an extraordinary statement is made , that ordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence to refute it , and , thus , should be subject to the so - called \" falsification principle \" .When an extraordinary claim supporting the falsehood of an ordinary statement is made , extraordinary evidence is required for that ordinary claim 's refutation .When an ordinary claim supporting the falsehood of an ordinary statement is made , however , only ordinary evidence is required for the refutation of the first .When that ordinary evidence is not provided , the first ordinary claim supporting the falsehood of the second ordinary statement is strengthened .But this does not change the answer to the authors ' question , rather , it qualifies it , allowing us to understand that what scholars see now may not be what scholars see later and that our present perspective is necessarily limited .But the fact it is limited does not mean it is nonexistent .The authors , as we might expect , style themselves the true skeptics ; the skeptics of the so - called \" verification principle \" .Yet , if I say that lemonade cures all cancers , the authors would surely not use the \" falsification principle \" in response to my claim .They also ask the poor question of what constitutes \" verification \" ; needless to say , the answer is different in each case .They also point to the inevitable appearance of subjectivity of at least some historians ' judgements .Yet , the fact that subjectivity is often to be found in scholarship does not mean we can dispense with evidence .They also laugh at a consistent application of the so - called \" verification principle \" , failing to understand what I have written in the above two paragraphs .This is an astounding display of the Biblical inerrantist mind at work - it can not imagine that others do not believe in the concept of the necessary inerrancy of at least some sources .It can not imagine any sliding scale of textual reliability .It can only accept two judgments about a text , \" inerrant \" and \" not inerrant \" .Needless to say , historians should apply skepticism to all texts , not refuse its application for a privileged few .The authors continue to mock a so - called consistent application of the \" verification principle \" .The trio then go on to more thoroughly explain their belief that the distance of a historical source from the events it describes does not have any significant influence its reliability .All these rules seem good ones to me .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.022"}
