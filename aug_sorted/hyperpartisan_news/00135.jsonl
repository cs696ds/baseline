{"text": "Violence , much of it related to drug wars , has been escalating in the Pacific coastal resort for some time -- and is now beginning to spread to the tourist sector .The shooting occurred on the ground - level veranda of the Casa Inn Hotel on the main street in the city 's tourist district , about half a block from the beach .The Casa Inn is a modest hotel that is popular with older tourists on a budget and college students on spring break .According to reports , the gunman appeared not to be shooting at the tourists , but rather was targeting another man who was walking in front of the hotel .Nonetheless , the incident further demonstrates that the city 's growing lawlessness now directly affects foreign tourists .On Jan. 8 , a Canadian teenager died after being involved in an incident outside an Acapulco nightclub .Local officials said the boy died in an auto accident , though another official alleged that he was struck by a car while fleeing the club 's bouncers and local taxi drivers , who were beating him .Aside from its popularity among Canadians and other foreign tourists , Acapulco is an entry point for drugs coming from Colombia for shipment to the United States .Because of its geographical importance , Mexico 's rival drug cartels are vying for control of Acapulco , which caused violence to spike in 2006 .The increase in violence , which has included several gruesome beheadings , forced Mexican President Felipe Calderon to deploy nearly 8,000 federal troops to Guerrero state in January .Although his efforts could have some initial success , they have little chance of stabilizing the situation over the long term , and could even incite more violence as the cartels test his resolve or try to defend their operations against federal troops .This happened in 2005 when then - President Vicente Fox sent a much smaller contingent of 200 troops to the city as part of a nationwide crackdown .Although it is unclear whether this latest shooting was connected to Acapulco 's drug - related violence , it does indicate that criminals no longer consider the once - peaceful tourist zone off limits -- and that the danger level is rising .Moreover , local police , who normally would react forcefully to incidents that can affect tourist revenue , appear quite unable to prevent the violence .As a result , some Canadians are pressuring Ottawa to update its standing travel advisory regarding Mexico , and slumping sales have caused a number of Canadian travel agencies to reduce or cancel package tours to Acapulco .Acapulco 's warring drug cartels -- whose concern is securing the flow of drugs into Mexico for transshipment to U.S. markets -- have little reason to avoid inflicting collateral damage on the city 's tourist industry .With the winter tourist season in high gear and spring break crowds soon descending on the beach hotels , Acapulco 's already weak law enforcement will have its hands full -- and can not be counted on to keep the turf wars out of the tourist district .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.42858"}

{"text": "Criminal Term 's second ground for dismissal of the charges , premised upon the Daily News column and the police officer 's statement to the prosecutor , can be rejected more summarily .The court relied upon People v Pelchat ( 62 NY2d 97 , supra ) , the facts of which , however , are markedly different from those here .In Pelchat , the defendant was one of 21 persons arrested in a house to which police officers had seen marihuana delivered .The only evidence before the Grand Jury showing that defendant had anything to do with the marihuana was the testimony of a police officer listing defendant as one of 21 persons he had observed transporting the drug .After defendant was indicted , this same police officer told the prosecutor that he had misunderstood his question when testifying before the Grand Jury and that he had not seen defendant engage in any criminal activity .Although the prosecutor knew that there was no other evidence before the Grand Jury to establish the defendant 's guilt , he did not disclose the police officer 's admission , and instead , accepted a guilty plea from the defendant .Here , in contrast , Canty and Ramseur have not recanted any of their Grand Jury testimony or told the prosecutor that they misunderstood any questions .Instead , all that has come to light is hearsay evidence that conflicts with part of Canty 's testimony .There is no statute or controlling case law requiring dismissal of an indictment merely because , months later , the prosecutor becomes aware of some information which may lead to the defendant 's acquittal .Moreover , unlike Pelchat , the testimony of Canty and Ramseur was not the only evidence before the Grand Jury establishing that the offenses submitted to that body were committed by Goetz .Accordingly , the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed , and the dismissed counts of the indictment reinstated .Judges Meyer , Simons , Kaye , Alexander , Titone and Hancock , Jr. , concur .Order reversed , etc . .Footnotes .Footnote 1 : On May 14 , 1985 , Goetz commenced an article 78 proceeding in the Appellate Division seeking to prohibit a trial on the charges contained in the second indictment on the ground that the order allowing resubmission of the charges was an abuse of discretion .The propriety of the resubmission order is not before us on this appeal .As our reversal of the Appellate Division in McManus holds , justification is a defense to such a crime ( People v McManus , 67 NY2d 541 ) .Accordingly , had the prosecutor 's instructions on justification actually rendered the Grand Jury proceedings defective , dismissal of the reckless endangerment count would have been required as well .Footnote 3 : Subdivision ( 1 ) contains certain exceptions to this general authorization to use force , such as where the actor himself was the initial aggressor .Footnote 6 : The 1881 provision expanded the class of third persons for whose defense an actor could employ deadly force from certain specified persons to any other person in the actor 's presence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.26048"}

{"text": "But this would have challenged the theology that says that the inefficient state - owned oil monopoly Pemex is sacred .Mr. Calder\u00f3n apparently has decided , for now , against questioning that taboo .Instead , he chose to go after the productive private sector of the economy , where at least some large companies are known to take advantage of a complex , exemption - ridden regime to dodge tax payments .The choice has not been fruitful .As I reported in my July 2 column , Hacienda Minister ( Treasury Secretary ) Agustin Carstens , formerly of the International Monetary Fund , chose not to seek growth through lower corporate tax rates and simplification .Instead , he crafted a plan to create a corporate alternative minimum tax .The proposal raised the cost of labor on some part of the work force and complicated the code .An email I received from the Mexican office of a large multinational investment firm insisted that the plan was not biased against skilled labor .That conclusion implied that the Hacienda proposal was so complicated that even some Mexican experts could n't figure it out .When workers cost more , companies hire fewer .For a president who ran on an employment platform , it was a disappointment .If the AMT is intended , as some have speculated , to be an end run toward the goal of a single , low flat - tax , not many are buying it .Most businesses view it as a tax hike and few seem confident that a new tax , once adopted , would ever be abolished .Thus the administration , normally considered market friendly , found itself without even its natural allies in negotiations with Congress .Meanwhile some of the worst elements of Mexico 's corporatist past were preparing to extract a pound of flesh for their support .The bill that finally passed last week sets the AMT at 16.5 % , increasing it to 17.5 % in three years .Those rates are lower than originally proposed and the burden on labor has been significantly reduced .The government forecasts a revenue increase of 100 billion pesos ( $ 9 billion ) to be used for infrastructure investment and social programs for the poor .But no one expects it to spur much growth .Hacienda forecasts that without the reform Mexico would have grown at 3.5 % in 2008 and with the reform it will grow at 3.7 % , still an anemic rate for a developing country .What is yet unknown is how the tax changes might affect investment decisions .Some tax experts are already warning that for U.S. investors , paying the AMT could mean double taxation because it is not an income tax and the tax treaty with the U.S. only covers income taxes .As part of the bargain in Congress , the PRI opposition forced the government to hand Pemex what amounts to an annual tax cut of 30 billion pesos , to grow to 60 billion pesos by 2010 .A reform - minded negotiator might have asked for something in return .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.68289"}

{"text": "Also , under Mexican law , popular handguns such as .357 magnum revolvers and 9 mm pistols are exclusively reserved for the armed forces .Regardless of these efforts , the illicit arms market has been thriving for decades -- not only because firearm laws are not evenly enforced but also because criminals have found a way to circumvent efforts to stem the flow of guns .Moreover , not all illegal guns are in the hands of cartel members and street criminals .A healthy percentage of them are purchased by affluent Mexicans who are not satisfied with the selection of calibers available through the UCAM .Sources say it is not at all unusual to find Mexicans who own prohibited .357 magnum revolvers or .45 caliber pistols for self - defense against kidnappers and armed robbers .In addition to ballistic considerations , Latin machismo is also a factor -- some Mexican men want to own and carry powerful , large - caliber pistols .The Mechanics of the Gun Trade .This mixture of the historical Mexican gun culture , machismo , strong desire for guns , lax enforcement of gun laws , official corruption and a raging cartel war has created a high demand for illegal guns .Guns sold on the black market in Mexico can fetch as much as 300 percent of their normal market value -- a profit margin similar to that of the cocaine trafficked by the cartels .The laws of economics dictate that where there is a strong demand -- and a considerable profit margin -- entrepreneurs will devise ways to meet that demand .Of course , the illicit markets are no different from the legitimate economy in this respect , and a number of players have emerged to help supply Mexico 's appetite for illicit weaponry .Millions of Mexicans reside ( legally and otherwise ) in the United States , and the two countries conduct a staggering amount of commerce ( legal and otherwise ) across the border .In fact , Mexican officials say that as much as 90 percent of the illegal weapons they seize are of U.S. origin .The most obvious players in the gun trade are the cartels themselves , which not only have the financial resources to buy guns in the United States but also are in a position to receive guns in trade for narcotics from their distribution contacts north of the border .The traditional pattern for cartel operations over the past few decades has been to smuggle drugs north over the border and return with money and guns -- many times over the same routes and by the same conveyances .In addition to the problem of the notoriously corrupt Mexican customs officials , efforts to stem the flow of guns into Mexico also have been hampered by technological limitations .For example , until recently , Mexican authorities lacked X - ray equipment to inspect vehicles entering the country , and this inspection capacity still remains limited .The cartels also obtain weapons from contacts along their supply networks in South and Central America , where substantial quantities of military ordnance have been shipped over decades to supply insurgencies and counterinsurgencies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.718895"}
