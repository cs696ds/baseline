{"text": "-- steve .\" The object in life is not to be on the side of the majority , but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane . \" -- Marcus Aurelius .Failing to register or comply with the Military Selective Service Act is a felony punishable by a fine of up to $ 250,000 or a prison term of up to five years , or a combination of both .Also , a person who knowingly counsels , aids , or abets another to fail to comply with the Act is subject to the same penalties .For clarification , if a man is exempt from registering with the Selective Service System , his name is not forwarded to the Department of Justice .The federal law stipulates that names are to be submitted to the Department of Justice annually .The more immediate penalty is if a man fails to register before turning 26 years old , even if he is not tried or prosecuted , he may find that some doors are permanently closed .CITIZENSHIP .The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS ) makes registration with Selective Service a condition for U.S. citizenship if the man first arrived in the U.S. before his 26th birthday .REGISTRATION IS THE LAW .Register to be Eligible for Benefits and Programs Linked to Registration - A young man who fails to register with Selective Service may be ineligible for opportunities that may be important to his future .He must register to be eligible for federal student financial aid , state - funded student financial aid in many states , most federal employment , some state employment , security clearance for contractors , job training under the Workforce Investment Act , and U.S. citizenship for immigrant men .Men , born after December 31 , 1959 , who are n't registered with Selective Service wo n't qualify for federal student loans or grant programs .This includes Federal Pell Grants , Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants ( FSEOG ) , Direct Stafford Loans / Plus Loans , National Direct Student Loans , and College Work Study .The Workforce Investment Act ( WIA ) offers programs that can train young men seeking vocational employment or enhancing their career .This program is only open to those men who register with Selective Service .Only men born after December 31 , 1959 , are required to show proof of registration .A man must be registered to be eligible for jobs in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government and the U.S. Postal Service .Proof of registration is required only for men born after December 31 , 1959 .Once again we are reminded how unconstitutional and lawless the Obama Administration appears to be and to the everlasting shame of a politically correct Congress not demanding that Obama be impeached in the House and tried in the Senate for violating his oath of office .Not to mention the conspiracy to obstruct justice .Anyway , if our next President follows the law , we might have found another solution to the problem of illegal alien men being granted amnesty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "124.51391"}
