Gibb seem to me both paternalistic and deferential in a manner that would be unthinkable for a serious scholar of Christianity .Currently ' visible ' academics like John Esposito , Juan Cole , and Edward Sa\u00efd have continued in this tradition , albeit often with more sophisticated postmodern maneuvering around the absurdity of defending what they agree is a false belief system .Further in the shadow of Sa\u00efdism , brazen Orientalism remains alive and well so long as it romanticises Islam as some majestic counter to the ' Christian ' West .Menocal 's \" The Ornament of the World \" stands out as an exemplar of this problem from an academic and with Karen Armstrong being the most noxious ' popular ' acolyte .An attendant to this romantic view is the overemphasis on more liberal ' pluralities ' ( another postmodernism ) within Islam at the expense of denying the overwhelming conservative orthodoxy .Becoming morally blind with shades of grey is apparently preferable to a ' monolithic ' critique of Islamic misogyny or use of corporal punishment .In any case , I hope thinkers such as yourself continue to speak freely on the subject and defend the Enlightenment tradition .\" When does criticism become bigotry ?The line is crossed when criticism of Islam , of ideas or beliefs , become transposed into prejudice about people ; or when critics demand that Muslims are denied rights , or be discriminated against , simply because they happen to be Muslims . \" Around 40 % of British muslims say they want \" sharia law \" .We see from the way that sharia law is implemented in countries like Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Pakistan , Malaysia , etc . that it leads to discrimination against people just because they happen to be non - muslims .This indicates that by your own definition , around 40 % of British muslims can be classed as bigots .In countries where muslims are more numerous , the proportion who are to be classified as bigots is far higher .The debate we should be having is not about islamophobia , but about how islam is founded on kuffarphobia .That is what needs to be explained : what kind of religion produces devout followers who behave worse than \" violent thugs \" from the EDL ?Those of us who have read the Koran with the surahs arranged in the proper chronological order know that Mohammed went from preaching tolerance to ending his life preaching apartheid , discrimination and genocide .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.26278"}

'What seems to have taken place is therefore a tragic conflation of certain primitive , religiously based attitudes towards women and unbelievers - and the degraded way in which certain white girls behave .For in this debauched British society , highly - sexualised behaviour by even pre - teens is ignored , excused , condoned or encouraged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.08734"}

{"text": "Earlier this month , James Bloodworth wrote a blog for the Independent comparing Islamophobia to a type of Orwellian doublespeak , \" PR jargon \" , designed to shut down public debate .He joins a chorus of voices on the Left who reject the term on grounds of the ' freedom to criticise ' Islam .This particular argument is disconcerting in that Islam is regularly subjected to the sort of scrutiny rarely if ever , afforded to other faiths , and many of those who seek to counter islamophobia , myself included , have been equally committed to defending free speech .The term ' islamophobia ' is many things , but it is not an attempt at muzzling critical inquiry .Some on the Left have gone further still , joining voices on the Right in denouncing Islam on the grounds of its alleged anti - liberal tenets .Paul Hockenos argues that \" the left and liberals have largely capitulated , unable to address the issue of Islam and the Muslims among us in a constructive way .\" There have been many attempts at defining islamophobia and debates rage over its Orientalist or Post-9/11 emergence and the appropriate response to it ( legislation vs. education ) .However , despite the frequently erected straw - man of stifling free speech , countering islamophobia is not about limiting discussion of the faith itself .It is about ensuring a largely socially , economically and politically disenfranchised minority is not stigmatised , stereotyped , further marginalised and consequently left open to hate crimes .A personal bugbear is the suggestion that Islam or the Quran ' says ' - Islam does n't speak - people speak in the name of Islam , filtering the texts through their experiences and drawing on interpretive traditions .Islamophobia is when influential figures like Tonybee or others define Islam in a public sphere where Muslims struggle to make themselves heard , over and above how Muslims themselves understand their faith .In other words , it is to ascribe meaning to Islam which most Muslims do not .The reification of faith by public figures with prominent platforms , assumes that , unlike other religious traditions , Islam is monolithic and can be gleaned from a brief perusal of sacred texts .It ca n't .To do so is to misrepresent Islam , the faith of over 1.3 billion people in the world , and to leave its practitioners open to the accusation of complicity in a depraved hate cult .What 's more , despite a clear ontological distinction between race and religion , it can not be ignored that Islam is associated with racialized minorities - South Asians in the UK , Arabs in France , Turks in Germany .When critique of religion overlaps so significantly with a particular racial group within society , and is often used as short - hand for that racial group , the line between religion and race becomes obscured .The Daily Mail 's choice to use the term \" muslim gang \" to refer to rapists who plied young girls with alcohol and raped them , is one such example .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.26649"}

He admits that \" some ulema argued that blasphemy was a forgivable offence and some even said that the ruler could award a lesser punishment than death \" .The FSC ruled in October 1990 that the alternative punishment should be deleted as it was repugnant to Islam .The court further directed the federation to add a provision to the effect that any act of blasphemy upon other prophets should also be punishable with death .The government was told to amend Section 295-C by April 30 , 1991 .The federation filed an appeal against the FSC verdict but it was withdrawn .Fears that Section 295-C could be abused were expressed from the very outset , by Mr Ismail Qureshi himself .He wrote : \" In my opinion , this Section 295-C needs to be further amended because it is necessary to bring it in accord with Quran and Sunnah ( emphasis added ) .In the present form it could create ambiguity and legal complications . \"He then emphasised that proof of intent was necessary to secure conviction ( a point also made by the FSC ) and that the sentence of death should be based on ' tazkiat - ul - shahood ' ( unimpeachable evidence ) .To give effect to a part of the FSC verdict ( relating to the deletion of the alternative punishment ) the Nawaz Sharif government moved the Criminal Law ( Third Amendment ) Bill 1991 .In its report on the bill the Senate Standing Committee , headed by PML - N leader Senator Zafarul Haq , expressed reservations about the definition of the offence .It said : . \"The Standing Committee on Law and Justice after detailed deliberations decided to recommend the proposed deletion of ' or imprisonment of life ' from Section 295-C of the Pakistan Penal Code .The members , however , observed that there was a need for a more specific definition of the offence under Section 295 PPC which the members were of the considered opinion was in the present form very generalised .It was only during the early days of Benazir Bhutto 's second government that the amendment bill was finally adopted .Again the government was in a hurry to push the bill because the house was about to be prorogued .@Proud Christian : I strongly believe that NO CHRISTIAN can blaspheme against the Holy Prophet ( PBUH ) because this is against our Holy Bible teaching to desecrate other religions or to hurt anyone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.66594"}

Bill Ketron said it \" deals solely with a single part of Sharia that is strictly political in nature , \" and \" in no way inserts itself into the religious laws of Islam .The language was nearly identical to that of similar bills considered in other states , some of which were thinly disguised in terms of protecting against \" the application of foreign law .All of this anti - Sharia activity has come despite the complete absence of evidence of the unconstitutional application of foreign or religious law in our judicial system .It has also come with a great deal of political handwringing - and myth making - about the threat of Sharia overtaking this country .This has led , in turn , to a false perception among a growing number of Americans that Sharia is a very real threat to our way of life and constitutional freedoms .In fact , these legislative efforts are the proverbial solution in search of a problem .The separation of church and state embodied in U.S. and state constitutions prohibits our courts from applying or considering religious law in any way that would constitute government advancement of or entanglement with religious law .But the anti - Sharia bills are more than a matter of unnecessary public policy .These measures are , at their core , predicated on prejudice and ignorance .They constitute a form of camouflaged bigotry that enables their proponents to advance an idea that finds fault with the Muslim faith and paints all Muslim Americans as foreigners and anti - American crusaders .It is true that Sharia is being used elsewhere around the world in dangerous ways .While Sharia law can address many daily public and private concerns , it is nonetheless subject to radical interpretation by individuals or groups who subscribe to a more puritanical form of Islamic jurisprudence .Some individuals try to interpret Sharia law for their own radical agendas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.69846"}

{"text": "This claim is a recurring one amongst critics of Islam and so its foundation \u200edeserves close scrutiny .Critics allege that Aisha was just six years old when she was betrothed to Muhammad , himself in his fifties , and only nine when the marriage was consummated .They base this on a saying attributed to Aisha \u200eherself , and the debate is further complicated by the fact some Muslims \u200ealso believe this to be a historically accurate account .Although most \u200eMuslims would not consider marrying off their nine year old daughters , \u200ethose who accept this saying argue that since the Quran states that \u200emarriage is void unless entered into by consenting adults , Aisha must \u200esimply have been an \" early bloomer \" .They refer to the much shorter life \u200eexpectancy in 7th century Arabia and to the custom , widespread across \u200emany cultures , to define adulthood according to the onset of puberty .Indeed what defines ' adulthood ' is often contentious .In his book , \" The \u200eInvention of Childhood \" Hugh Cunningham traces the historically \u200econstructed notion of childhood and its variation across time .There have \u200ebeen epochs , including in European history , where puberty equated to \u200eadulthood .Indeed , five centuries after Islam , King John of England was 44 \u200eyears old when he married 12 year old Isabella of Angouleme .Interestingly , of the many criticisms of Mohamed made at the time by his \u200eopponents , none focused on Aisha 's age at marriage .According to this perspective , Aisha may have been young , but she was no \u200eyounger than was the norm at the time .Other Muslims doubt the very idea \u200ethat Aisha was nine at the time of marriage , referring to historians who \u200ehave questioned the reliability of historical narrations concerning Aisha 's \u200eage .In a society without a birth registry and where people did not \u200ecelebrate birthdays , most people estimated their own age and that of \u200eothers .Aisha would have been no different .What 's more , Aisha had \u200eactually been engaged to someone else before she married Mohamed , \u200esuggesting she 'd already been mature enough , by the standards of her \u200esociety , to consider marriage for a while .It seems difficult to reconcile this \u200ewith her being nine or younger even .In addition to this , some modern Muslim scholars have cast doubt on the \u200everacity of the saying , or hadith , used to assert Aisha 's young age .In Islam , \u200ethe hadith literature ( sayings of the Prophet ) is considered secondary to the Quran .While the Quran is considered to be the verbatim word of God , the hadiths were transmitted over time through a rigorous but not infallible methodology .Taking all known accounts and records of Aisha 's \u200eage at marriage , estimates of her age range from nine to nineteen .Because \u200eof this , it is simply impossible , many argue , to know with any certainty \u200ehow old Aisha was .What we do know is what the Quran says about marriage : that it is valid only between consenting adults , and that a woman has the right to choose her own spouse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.85431"}

{"text": "Again , I apologize to every person I ever dissed for their talk of clown masses .My former colleague , Representative Todd Russ , recently passed a piece of legislation , HB 1125 that would move issuance of Oklahoma marriage licenses from court clerks to clergy or judges .Under Oklahoma law as it presently stands , court clerks , who are elected officials , issue marriage licenses .I think that the bill is a response to lawsuits against court clerks around the country who have not issued marriage licenses for gay marriage due to their religious belief .It appears to be an attempt to remove that pressure from court clerks .According to both the author and representatives who opposed the bill , court clerks have not objected to the legislation .During floor debate , Democratic Leader Scott Inman raised the question of whether or not the bill would , as an unintended consequence , open the door for \" marriage \" of any type , including group marriage , polygamy , marriage between humans and animals , etc .Rep Russ answered that HB 1125 does not change regulations as to what constitutes legal marriage .I think that Representative Russ made an attempt to deal with a problem .I do n't think that this piece of legislation does what he hopes .It has huge holes in it .It also transfers the potential for court challenges and judicial pressure from court clerks to the clergy .There is no definition of clergy in the bill .This piece of legislation , by creating a whole new legal responsibility for clergy , needs a definition for what constitutes clergy that is specific to the legislation .As it stands now , the only requirement in the law is that the clergy be \" ordained .\" That leaves the definition of what constitutes clergy for the purposes of performing this government function entirely in the hands of the religious body of which they are a part .Since \" ordained \" is not defined in the bill either , any person could , for the purposes of this law , \" ordain \" themselves .I am aware that there are definitions in other places in the statutes .But since this creates a new kind of clergy that is part government functionary and part religious leader , a new definition is called for .Another serious problem with the legislation is that it does not define what relationship the clergy would hold vis a vis the government .Are they now government officials , rather than clergy ?That is a legitimate question , since they are now charged with enforcing state law concerning marriage so far as it pertains to the issuance of marriage licenses .America has kept the issuance of marriage licenses and the definition of marriage as a legal construct entirely under the auspices of the government for over 200 years .The idea of transferring this to clergy is a radical change with many unintended consequences .One unintended consequence would be the massive impact that this change would have on arguments concerning religious freedom .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.38349"}

{"text": "Special Editor Neil Verma .In October 1934 , the Washington Post published a feature about Elder Lightfoot Solomon Michaux in which it boldly declared that the \" radio evangelist extraordinary , is the best known colored man in the United States today .\" At the time , Elder Michaux , known as the \" Happy Am I \" Preacher , had a national radio show on the CBS network that broadcast his ministry of happiness and holiness to over twenty - five million listeners each week .Like many popular evangelists of his era , Elder Michaux promoted his image as one of God 's prophets , presciently envisioning that radio could revolutionize the purview of modern evangelicalism .Michaux first used portable radio equipment to broadcast his holiness revivals in the mid to late 1920s in his hometown of Newport News and these religious programs were among the first of their kind in the United States .By 1929 , Michaux moved to Washington , D.C. in the hopes of expanding his mission .As an African American , Michaux initially had difficulty convincing local D.C. radio outlets to put him on the air .Eventually , he persuaded James S. Vance , local owner of WJSV , to broadcast his weekly revivals .When the CBS network bought WJSV in 1932 , the budding evangelist achieved a national audience in the millions .The key to Michaux 's success was his ability to combine his preaching with snappy , upbeat gospel songs that reminded listeners that a holy life leads to a happy life , a message that resonated with Americans navigating the economic trials of the Great Depression .By the late 1930s , the BBC invited Michaux to broadcast his program on its network and listeners around the globe soon began to tune into his WJSV broadcasts in via shortwave hookup .These opportunities allowed the charismatic preacher to reach a vast international radio audience that extended from Europe to Africa , South America , and the Caribbean .That Michaux 's broadcasts , like his story , have disappeared from radio history has impoverished our sense of the role of race in the soundscape of the era .My current book project examines Michaux 's extraordinary life and career as a radio evangelist .In spite of his many accomplishments , Elder Michaux has been largely overlooked in the histories of religious radio and African American religion .Scholarship on religious radio from the 1920s and 1930s tends to focus on figures such as Father Charles Coughlin and Aimee Semple McPherson with only passing mention of African American preachers such as Michaux .In the history of African American religion in the 1930s , Michaux tends to be overshadowed by scholarship on other major figures such as Father Divine and his Peace Mission Movement and Sweet Daddy Grace and his United House of Prayer .Although Michaux 's ministry was often categorized as a religious cult in the popular press of the time , his Gospel Spreading Radio Church of God was firmly a part of the black Holiness movement and continues to have ten active congregations today .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.16389"}

Smith , spearheaded by Justice Antonin Scalia - enacted into law a conception of religiosity as interiorized , intellectualized , and privatized .It favored majoritarian notions of religious free exercise such that dissenting - or noisy - religious practice by minority religious subjects risked criminalization .As a result , the granting of religious exemption from preclusive noise ordinances was left not to the courts to decide , but rather to the political arena .Potentially disruptive religious free exercise was no longer constitutionally protected .It now required approval from a political body .The last case study , then , does not deal with legal proceedings .Rather , it examines the public debates and media spectacles that surrounded al - Isl\u0101h Islamic Center 's petition to broadcast the call to prayer in Hamtramck , MI , in 2004 .Al - Isl\u0101h was ultimately granted exemption from the local noise ordinance .But over the course of an exasperating six months of debate , Weiner demonstrates , formerly unvoiced identity politics that residents invested into the city 's sonic territories were brought to light in highly contentious ways .Weiner identifies three rhetorical - discursive tropes that various parties used to debate changing the city 's noise ordinance to accommodate the call to prayer .One of them , pluralism , will likely be of most interest to readers ( the others are exclusivism and privatism ) .The pluralist debaters envisioned the public sphere as a neutral space in which the particularities of religious difference were accommodated , but only according to an ideal of \" agonistic respect .\" Against this idealistic backdrop , pluralists interpreted the call to prayer not as broadcasters intended it to be heard , but rather as a symbol for the \" potential for interfaith harmony . \"( 186 ) Weiner argues that the hearings refigured - effaced , even - the call 's meaning , since the Muslim community 's political recognition was achievable only by way of the discourse of pluralist forms of tolerance .In other words , if pluralist discourse takes the form by which Muslim faith can express itself , then Muslim faith itself risks effacement as a result of such \" accommodation . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.29281"}

Murray Schafer called the \" historical soundscape \" - faced unprecedented scrutiny as the symbolic status of noise began to change .Likewise , city governments challenged congregants ' rights to occupy acoustic territory .In the burgeoning clamor of the modern city , noise meant progress and prosperity , for some listeners , but , for others , the stylized noise of religion practiced \" out loud \" signified a kind of regressive primitivism .Noise thus occupied both sides of the evolutionist coin that Weiner suggests ideologically underpinned religious self - understandings of the time . \" St. Mark 's Church Philadelphia \" by Flickr user Library Company of Philadelphia .Weiner further explores the progressive / primitive duality in his first case study - Harrison v. St. Marks of 1877- in which Weiner quite brilliantly unravels how both perspectives were articulated in legal discourse .According to Weiner , complainants challenged the long - presumed public - acoustic prerogatives of Philadelphia 's fashionable St. Mark 's Protestant Episcopal Church .( 60 )From the complainants ' perspective , noisy religion signified backward , immature religion .The court sided with this position , treating church bells as it would any other \" extraneous \" public noise .Yet in so doing , it ironically reinforced the cultural dominance of Protestantism .In the second section , Weiner shifts his focus from acoustic territorialization to noisy religiosity as a form of dissent .He details how noise abatement legislation in the early twentieth century harkened a \" new regulatory regime \" that suppressed the activities of religious practitioners for whom \" making noise was not merely incidental to their work ; it was their work \" ( 80 ) .The Salvation and Army and the Jehovah 's Witnesses , Weiner shows , aggressively challenged norms of community outreach through provocative exhibitions of religious devotion in public spaces .However , while exercising freedoms of speech , religion , and public assembly , such groups turned unsuspecting citizens into \" captive audiences , \" and thus infringed upon rights to privacy .The style of practicing some liberties , as many scholars and critics have suggested , has throughout history limited the enjoyment of liberties by other parties .Moreover , as Weiner rightly suggests in his second case study , Saia v. New York of 1946 , civil liberties have always been carefully regulated by the state .Samuel Saia , a Jehovah 's Witness , drove around the city of Lockhart , NY , and used loudspeakers to broadcast inflammatory sermons from his car .He loudly exercised his first amendment rights through what Weiner calls \" sound car religion .\" Yet the city managed to treat the sermons ' noisiness as extraneous to Saia 's religion , rather than acknowledging the practice as partially constitutive of it .Lockhart 's noise abatement ordinance thus infringed upon his right to religious free exercise .To that end , Weiner repositions McLuhan 's famous \" the medium is the message , \" framing religion as media , as opposed to religion and media as separable concepts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.28439"}

{"text": "The role of the professional body must be understood within the wider policing landscape and , in particular , the transformation in accountability that the introduction of police and crime commissioners will bring .It will need to reflect that shift in how it is constituted , in what it delivers and in how it delivers that .Its most important role will be to act in the public interest .Key to that , and reflecting the move towards greater accountability , will be the way in which the professional body is structured .It will be chaired by someone independent of the police service , and its board will have an equal balance of police service and non - police service representatives , including police and crime commissioners .It will be open and transparent .In taking its work forwards , it will need to take into account public need in setting and inculcating standards among officers and staff .It will also need to take into consideration the cost of any changes it recommends to develop professionalism .That will form a crucial part of its ability to enhance the British model of policing by consent .Many criticisms have been made today of the accountability and transparency of decision making by senior police officers .There are , however , clear examples of where the police have responded impressively to the need for change .This is one public service whose leaders generally recognise the difficult economic times and understand the benefits that reform can bring .Greater Manchester police , for example , have saved \u00a3 62 million a year from their support functions , releasing 348 police officers from those roles so that they can get back to front - line work .Surrey police have carried out a significant restructuring , which has allowed them to commit to increasing constable numbers by up to 200 over the next four years .Some forces are going even further , moving beyond restructuring and outsourcing , to building strategic relationships with the private sector .This is not about .privatisation ; policing will remain a public service .However , by harnessing private sector innovation , skills and economies of scale , forces can transform how they work and improve the service they provide to the public .As well as saving money , our reforms are about making policing better .We are rebuilding the link between the police and the public .In November , the first elections for police and crime commissioners will take place .Elected by local people , commissioners will have the democratic mandate to set their local police force budget , and they will respond to local people 's concerns by setting the force 's priorities .The direction of police reform provides a clear basis for the way in which the police professional body will operate .The police service is becoming more open , more transparent and more accountable to the public , and it is right and proper that that is the case .In \" Policing in the 21st Century \" , we said that we expect chief police officers to continue to play a key role in advising the Government , police and crime commissioners and the police service on strategy and best practice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.01218"}

{"text": "Friend the Member for Warwick and Leamington ( Chris White ) successfully navigated through Parliament the Public Services ( Social Value ) Act 2012 .It requires local authorities , when they enter into procurement contracts , to give greater consideration to economic , social and/or environmental well - being during the pre - procurement stage .That is hugely welcome , and it is extremely important that councils are made fully aware of the Act 's provisions , and the potential benefits for their areas .I firmly believe that it is incumbent on councils to take into consideration the impact that their procurement can have on their local economy , and the success or otherwise of local businesses , especially small ones .Local government procurement can be beneficial in . giving local businesses the ability to grow and expand .That creates jobs , skills and investment in areas throughout the country , particularly those that are badly in need of investment .However , a negative effect can be created as easily , and can go beyond having a direct impact on a local business .It can spread into the wider community , lowering employment , and preventing money from being recycled through the local economy , leading to less money being invested in businesses in that area .It is clear how local government procurement has the ability to create a much less vibrant and successful local economy very quickly .I want to be parochial for a moment .In 2010 , the university of Cumbria produced a paper entitled \" The Impact of Local Authority Procurement on Local Economies , The Case of Cumbria \" .It found that increasing pressures on local authorities to be efficient and effective in their use of public resources may contradict the need to support local communities , particularly during a period of economic downturn .The findings suggested that many small and medium - sized enterprises throughout Cumbria relied on local authority contracts for business stability .Those interviewed throughout the county confirmed that when a more formal approach to public procurement is taken , coupled with a more defined definition of \" value for money \" , SMEs become more vulnerable .To its credit , Cumbria county council 's procurement strategy aims to increase the proportion of suppliers based in the county from 60 % in 2010 to 65 % in 2012 .Collectively , the Cumbrian authorities have an annual procurement spend in excess of \u00a3 300 million , more than half of which is spent locally .That sort of money can have a profound effect on any local economy , so I want to ensure that local authorities have the appropriate power and tools to ensure that they can promote and support local business through their individual procurement policies .I therefore ask the Minister to consider three key issues .Finally , what measures does the Minister intend to pursue to help with the issue and to ensure that local authorities have policies that truly benefit their own locality ?I want Carlisle to have a vibrant , local economy , creating jobs and prosperity for local people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "122.8887"}
