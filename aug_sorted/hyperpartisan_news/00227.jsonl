Sampson .This is where previous agency heads have had an advantage over Dr. Weinstein as they have trailed less baggage .What are the core values of the agency Dr. Weinstein may come to head ?Here is a clue .I recently received an off - List message from a university archivist , who wrote to me that : .\" I have thoroughly enjoyed your generous insightful comments and observations about the nomination of Allen Weinstein for Archivist of the US .You display a thoughtful , non - partisan , intelligent consideration of the topic and subject at hand that must come with your experience working at NARA in the past .\" There can be no nicer compliment to the National Archives - and no better illustration of what is at stake here .Jerry Sternstein - 4/16/2004 .As I recall , when \" Perjury \" came under attack by Navasky and other Hiss defenders , Weinstein announced that he would be happy to deposit his notes in an archive so that scholars could have access to them .He was in the process of doing so when a group led by Navasky showed up unannounced at the door of his home in Washington , D.C. shortly after he made that offer and demanded immediate access to them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.95112"}

{"text": "Essentially , the 2 other witnesses and I revealed hidden pressure by Nixon to have sections deleted from Watergate tapes , an action that the senior NARA official had tried to present to the court as deriving solely from the independent review of archivists .Only through our testimony in 1992 did it become known that Nixon was the source of the deletions the Archives made to the Watergate tapes in 1989 .NARA made the deletions to tapes that Judge Sirica already had deemed pertinent to Watergate but did not admit to the public it had made the cuts at Nixon 's behest .There is a regulatory process in place to consider objections by Nixon ( now his heirs ) to NARA 's proposed historical releases .The senior official bypassed that regulatory process in 1989 and accepted Nixon 's deletion list quietly , instead .In an effort to protect NARA from just this type of action , Congress had set up regulations requiring pubic notice of requests for withholding , etc .Officials simply bypassed it .We archivists protested in 1989 , to no avail .In fact , one of my supervisors was made the subject of a punitive transfer because she courageously joined us in our pleas that regulations be followed .I left my job at NARA over this issue , taking a job as historian elsewhere in the government in 1990 .Because my testimony about Nixon 's hidden role did not comport with the senior NARA official 's seeming attempt to shield it , the Department of Justice 's lawyers gave me no support , without warning me they had a conflict of interest .( They also represented the senior official , as the same DOJ lawyers represent NARA as an entity in such litigation . )I had to answer questions from President Nixon 's lawyers for two days with no legal representation .I did fine relying only on my own wits but it is not a something you would wish on any archivist or scholar .I have fought hard to keep the colleagues that I left behind from being placed in a similar position .Everyone at the Archives knows what happened to the Nixon tapes archivists between 1989 and 1992 .The Archives was forced to admit to the court ultimately that indeed Nixon was the source of the deletions , rather than its own archivists .NARA never criticized the senior official publicly , but some of his supporters did try to castigate the archivists who had revealed the story of the hidden deletions .So , no , the Archives definitely does not have enough protection , then or now .No matter how fine a scholar , I have to wonder how well prepared a Weinstein or a Kutler would be to protect his subordinates from political pressure , legal abandonment , punitive transfers , etc .Even more than good scholarship , the Archives needs a chief with plenty of political savvy , lots of integrity , and a very strong backbone .But , you may have a point in your assessment of the administration 's strategy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.86656"}
{"text": "Such questions are particularly hard to answer since digitization also undercuts our sense of who owns such materials and , thus , who has the right and responsibility to preserve them .Consumers ( including libraries ) have traditionally purchased books and magazines under the \" first sale \" doctrine , which gives those who buy something the right to make any use of it , including lending or selling it to others .But most digital goods are licensed rather than sold .Because contract law governs licenses , vendors of digital content can set any restrictions they choose - they can say that the contents may not be copied or can not be viewed by more than one person at a time .Adobe 's eBook reader even includes a warning that a book may not be read aloud .But if libraries do n't own digital content , how can they preserve it ?The problem will become even worse if publishers widely adopt copy protection schemes as they are seriously considering doing for electronic books .Even a library that had the legal right to preserve the content would have no reason to assume that it would be able to do so ; meanwhile , the publisher would have little incentive to keep the protection system functioning in a new software environment .In general , digital rights management systems and other forms of \" trusted computing \" undercut preservation efforts by embedding centralized control in proprietary systems .\" If Microsoft , or the U.S. government , does not like what you said in a document you wrote , \" speculates Free Software advocate Richard Stallman , \" they could post new instructions telling all computers to refuse to let anyone read that document . \"Licensed and centrally controlled digital content not only erodes the ability of libraries to preserve the past , it also undercuts their responsibility .Why should a library worry about the long - term preservation of something it does not own ?But then , who will ?Publishers have not traditionally assumed preservation responsibility since there is no obvious profit to be made in ensuring that something will be available or readable in a hundred years when it is in the public domain and ca n't be sold or licensed .The digital era has not only unsettled questions of ownership and preservation for traditional copyrighted material , it has also introduced a new , vast category of what could be called semi - published works , which lack a clear preservation path .The free content available on the web is protected by copyright even though it has not been formally registered with the Library of Congress Copyright Office or sold by a publisher .That means that a library that decided to save a collection of web pages - say , those posted by abortion rights organizations - would technically be violating copyright .19 The absence of this \" process \" is the most fundamental problem facing digital preservation .Over centuries , a complex ( and imperfect ) system for preserving the past has emerged .Digitization has unsettled that system of responsibility for preservation , and an alternative system has not yet emerged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.70765"}

P. Morgan had in 1902 engaged Charles F. McKim to build a library to the east of his Madison Avenue brownstone as his collection had already expanded beyond what his study could hold .To manage his collection he hired Greene as his personal librarian in 1905 , having been introduced to her by his nephew , Junius Spencer Morgan II , a Princeton student .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.4245"}

{"text": "In the twenty - five years since Allen Weinstein published Perjury , his masterful analysis of the Hiss - Chambers case , no one has been able to challenge his conclusion that Whittaker Chambers told the truth and that Alger Hiss was a Soviet spy .The only other full - length scholarly study of the case , Sam Tanenhaus 's Whittaker Chambers , reached a similar conclusion .Professor Sandilands repeats the canard that Chambers was a \" fantasist , \" a lie first leveled by Hiss 's lawyer , the late John Lowenthal , suggesting that Chambers made up out of whole cloth his story of involvement in Soviet espionage .Professor Sandilands and a handful of other espionage deniers have frantically tried to discredit the Venona decryptions that made crystal clear the work done for the KGB by such American spies .He claims that \" few scholars now accept the official NSA [ National Security Agency ] line that ALES was \" probably Alger Hiss \" in one of the telegrams .He is wrong .And his reliance on Major General Julius Kobyakov is strange .General Kobyakov has stated his nostalgia for the days of Soviet power and his disapproval of the partial opening of KGB archives in the early 1990s ( ended by 1995 ) .Why are Kobyakov 's undocumented statements acceptable while the documents that Weinstein 's collaborator , also an ex - KGB officer , Alexander Vassiliev , located in the KGB 's archives during its partial opening - documents quoted in The Haunted Wood - dismissed by Sandilands ?Would Professor Sandilands similarly accept the unsupported word of a unrepentant Nazi intelligence chief about the files of his agency ?If Ales is not Hiss , why does n't Kobyakov tell us who Ales , this high - ranking State Department employee who spied for the Soviet Union , really was ?Kobyakov once directed Soviet espionage against the United States .He has chosen not only to stonewall about what he knows but to attack those who attempt to bring to light the facts of Soviet espionage in the United States .In the meantime , we are pleased that Dr. Weinstein , a distinguished scholar and writer , has been honored by this nomination to be Archivist of the United States .Maarja - Krusten - 4/19/2004 .My own , original title for this piece was \" Aggressive Advocacy Haunts the Nixon Foundation .Being vocal on such issues is soooo not a Republican characteristic , there 's got ta be something behind it !Maarja - Krusten - 4/18/2004 .Mark Safranski correctly points out that on the face of it , it does not seem fair to assume that Dr. Weinstein will not act properly .The real problem lies in the fact that the worst controversies surrounding archival records occurred during past Republican presidencies .The Nixon tapes deletion controversy to which I was a witness , and which I described in my PRESIDENTIAL STUDIES QUARTERLY article cited above , occurred while G.

{"text": "The life expectancy of digital media may be as little as ten years , but very few hardware platforms or software programs last that long .Indeed , Microsoft only supports its software for about five years .The most vexing problems of digital media are the flipside of their greatest virtues .But the ones and zeros lack intrinsic meaning without software and hardware , which constantly change because of technological innovation and competitive market forces .Thus this lingua franca requires translators in every computer application , which , in turn , operate only on specific hardware platforms .Compounding the difficulty is that the languages being translated keep changing every few years .The problem is still worse because of the ability of digital media to create and represent complex , dynamic , and interactive objects - another of their great virtues .Even relatively simple documents that appear to have direct print analogs turn out to be more complex .Printing out e - mail messages makes rapid searches of them impossible and often jettisons crucial links to related messages and attachments .In addition , multimedia programs , which generally rely on complicated combinations of hardware and software , quickly become obsolete .Nor is there any good way to preserve interactive and experiential digital creations .Preserving hypertextually linked web pages poses the further problem that to save a single page in its full complexity could ultimately require you to preserve the entire web , because virtually every web page is linked to every other .While these technical difficulties are immense , the social , economic , legal , and organizational problems are worse .Digital documents - precisely because they are in a new medium - have disrupted long - evolved systems of trust and authenticity , ownership , and preservation .Reestablishing those systems or inventing new ones is more difficult than coming up with a long - lived storage mechanism .How , for example , do we ensure the \" authenticity \" of preserved digital information and \" trust \" in the repository ?Paper documents and records also face questions about authenticity , and forgeries are hardly unknown in traditional archives .The science of \" diplomatics , \" in fact , emerged in the seventeenth century as a way to authenticate documents when scholars confronted rampant forgeries in medieval documents .But digital information - because it is so easily altered and copied , lacks physical marks of its origins , and , indeed , even the clear notion of an \" original\"-cannot be authenticated as physical documents and objects can .We have , for example , no way of knowing that forwarded e - mail messages we receive daily have not been altered .In fact , the public archive of Usenet discussion groups contains hundreds of deliberately and falsely attributed messages .14 Digital media , tools , and networks have altered the balance .\" It took centuries for users of print materials to develop the web of trust that now undergirds our current system of publication , dissemination , and preservation , \" notes Abby Smith , a leading figure in library and preservation circles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.93078"}

{"text": "Fan and \" mirror \" sites appeared with some embellishing on the \" Bert Is Evil \" theme .After the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 , sites in the Netherlands and Canada paired Bert with Osama bin Laden .This image made a further global leap after September 11 .When Mostafa Kamal , the production manager of a print shop in Dhaka , Bangladesh , needed some images of bin Laden for anti - American posters , he apparently entered the phrase \" Osama bin Laden \" in Google 's image search engine .The Osama and Bert duo was among the top hits . \"Sesame Street \" being less popular in Bangladesh than in the Philippines , Kamal thought the picture a nice addition to an Osama collage .But when this transnational circuit of imagery made its way back to more Sesame Street - friendly parts of the world via a Reuters photo of anti - American demonstrators ( see Figure 2 ) , a storm of indignation erupted .Children 's Television Workshop , the show 's producers , threatened legal action .On October 11 , 2001 , a nervous Ignacio pushed the delete key , imploring \" all fans [ sic ] and mirror site hosts of ' Bert is Evil ' to stop the spread of this site too .\" Ignacio 's sudden deletion of Bert should capture our interest as historians since it dramatically illustrates the fragility of evidence in the digital era .If Ignacio had published his satire in a book or magazine , it would sit on thousands of library shelves rather than having a more fugitive existence as magnetic impulses on a web server .Although some historians might object that the Bert Is Evil web site is of little historical significance , even traditional historians should worry about what the digital era might mean for the historical record .U.S. government records , for example , are being lost on a daily basis .Although most government agencies started using e - mail and word processing in the mid-1980s , the National Archives still does not require that digital records be retained in that form , and governmental employees profess confusion over whether they should be preserving electronic files .3 Future historians may be unable to ascertain not only whether Bert is evil , but also which undersecretaries of defense were evil , or at least favored the concepts of the \" evil empire \" or the \" axis of evil . \"Not only are ephemera like \" Bert \" and government records made vulnerable by digitization , but so are traditional works - books , journals , and film - that are increasingly being born digitally .As yet , no one has figured out how to ensure that the digital present will be available to the future 's historians .But , as we shall see , tentative efforts are afoot to preserve our digital cultural heritage .If they succeed , historians will face a second , profound challenge - what would it be like to write history when faced by an essentially complete historical record ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.85151"}
