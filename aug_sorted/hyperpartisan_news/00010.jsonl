{"text": "However , victims say it takes much longer to get a response from the company when things go wrong , and have questioned whether the speed of approvals and the way loans are set up make it a soft target for fraudsters .When a loan is taken out from a traditional lender or credit card provider , the borrower will give current account details for the loan to be paid into .A direct debit is also set up to make repayments : the debit is normally deducted from the same account that receives the loan money .Some banks , including HSBC , insist this is the case .With Wonga and other payday loans a debit card is given for repayments , and the borrower grants the lender continuous payment authority , which allows them to take payments at any time during the month .It is less obvious whether this card is linked to the account receiving the money , although Wonga said it does require both accounts to be held in the same name .One victim , Nadia Mounsey , said she knew nothing about the fraud until she spotted two debits to Wonga from her HSBC current account .On each occasion about \u00a3 500 was debited .Another victim , John Young , told us he became aware that his Bank of Scotland account details had been given to Wonga for repayments when he received an automated phone call from his bank asking to verify seven payments totalling \u00a3 765 made on his debit card .His sister fell victim to a separate fraud , which she discovered when she received a letter from Wonga demanding payment for a loan she never had .None of the victims had ever taken out a Wonga loan .Some of the viewers had taken loans with the lender before , and suddenly received letters several months later about new amounts that had been borrowed and paid into different accounts .Others had never had dealings with the firm .Wonga denies it is more susceptible to fraud than traditional lenders , saying it does n't allow loans to be repaid from accounts not held in the borrower 's name .It added that the cases brought to the Guardian were instances of identity fraud , which it said were not unique to Wonga .However , its website suggests that it does allow repayments by a third party in some cases .In the help section it says : \" You can have someone make a payment on your behalf .You need to call our customer service team and have the card holder present so they can give authorisation to use their card .\" The figures do not include payday loans but , like Wonga 's , do include \" first party \" fraud where a borrower uses their own account details but lies about some aspect of their circumstances to secure the loan .According to Experian , fraudulent applications for credit cards is higher at 0.14 % .Wonga said it had \" a zero tolerance policy on fraud \" , and that cases of criminals targeting it were \" extremely rare \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.30589"}
