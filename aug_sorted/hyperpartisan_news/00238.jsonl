{"text": "disclosed .Rose partner Webster L. Hubbell , now the Associate Attorney General , says he informed the FDIC about the firm 's representation of Madison on the preferred stock offering , though FDIC officials say they have no recollection of the disclosure .But the agency says the earlier work would n't be an issue in any event .An internal FDIC memo says the stock offering \" was not substantially related to the lawsuit against Frost and would not be considered a disqualifying conflict .\" More of an issue to some FDIC insiders was the fact that Hubbell 's father - in - law was an executive of the thrift 's real estate arm and had won a judgment against the FDIC that was on appeal -- a link Hubbell disclosed , according to FDIC records .While some FDIC staffers wanted the Rose firm replaced , April Breslaw , the FDIC official in charge of the case , defended the firm .Hubbell was involved only in an indirect way , Breslaw said in an internal 1989 memo , and his kinship was not a reason to take a case away from a law firm \" that has obtained fine results for me on other matters .\" --Small - business scam .David Hale , a Little Rock businessman , alleges that McDougal and Clinton asked him in 1985 to make a $ 300,000 loan to a marketing company owned by McDougal 's wife .Hale , who ran a government - backed investment company , says the money was actually used to bolster Madison 's finances .At one point , according to Hale , the money ended up in Whitewater 's account .If true , obtaining the loan under false pretenses might be illegal .But Clinton and McDougal deny the conversation ever took place .Heuer , McDougal 's lawyer , notes that at that time , Madison Guaranty was undercapitalized by $ 8 million , and the $ 300,000 loan would not have been much help .But more important , Hale 's background may make him a slender reed to hang charges on .He did n't reveal the conversation until last fall , shortly before he was indicted on unrelated charges of defrauding the Small Business Administration of $ 800,000 .A trial is expected soon .Hale also may have an ax to grind : Five years ago , Madison foreclosed on a 1986 loan for $ 300,000 on which Hale had n't made payments .Neither Hale nor his lawyer returned calls seeking comment .It could take years for the special counsel to sift through all this .And the Clintons have not helped their case by appearing to have something to hide .There could be a bombshell in their files , though the chances at this point seem slim .\" We do have some embarrassment here , \" says Representative Jim Leach ( R.-Iowa ) .\" But I do n't think we have an episode that is of Presidency - toppling proportions .\" All the same , the White House will have to inhale a lot of smoke before the special counsel decides whether there is a fire here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.87477"}

Barack Obama , had compared Clinton 's distortions to the dirty tricks campaigns run by the infamous Republican operative Lee Atwater .After an event on Wednesday in South Carolina , Yellin approached the former president and asked him to respond to Harpootlian 's remarks .Clinton let loose on camera , chastising the reporter for asking him about political conflict rather than the substance of the meeting he had just held .\" You 're asking me about this , you sat through this whole meeting .Not one single , solitary soul asked about any of this .And they never do .\" Referring to the Obama campaign , Clinton said : \" They are feeding you this because they know this is what you want to cover . \" As Clinton 's aides tried to steer him out the door , he continued to scold back in Yellin 's direction : \" Shame on you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.74913"}

Vartanian , a former senior thrift regulator under several administrations .The Clintons have denied wrongdoing .One major reason for skepticism is that the government has already looked into many of the dealings of Whitewatergate 's central figure , James B. McDougal , the Clintons ' partner in Whitewater and majority owner of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan .Madison was taken over by the government in 1989 at a cost of $ 50 million .Although McDougal and Madison have been investigated by five federal agencies , prosecutors have come up empty - handed .Four years ago , for instance , the feds took McDougal to court on fraud charges stemming from two sales of largely undeveloped real estate in south Little Rock to Madison insiders , including brothers of McDougal 's wife Susan .According to the government , McDougal and Madison engaged in various sham transactions to inflate his pay , since McDougal received a bonus tied to sales from Madison 's real - estate arm .The trouble for the government 's case was that McDougal never cashed out any of the more than $ 100,000 in bonuses he accrued from Madison 's real - estate sales , some of it from these transactions .And McDougal 's attorney , Sam T.
