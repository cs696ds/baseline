{"text": "Yet , here the judge seems to think that any weak inference that the execs at Megaupload knew that their service was used for infringement implicates them in a criminal conspiracy .That seems incredibly problematic .Similarly , as the DOJ did in its indictment , the Judge focuses a lot on the \" incentive \" program that Megaupload put in place , whereby users who post files that get a lot of downloads could profit from those downloads .The claim by the DOJ , and totally accepted by Judge Dawson , is that this is proof that they were encouraging infringement .But , again , such a program could just as easily be useful for non - infringing purposes as well .If you were a singer and wanted to give away your music for free , but still profit from it , you could see how this could be a compelling business model .In fact , some major recording artists , such as Busta Rhymes , were excited about using Megaupload in just this manner .Yes , obviously some would use this to post infringing files , but again the fact that some users could misuse the service does not mean the company 's execs are criminals .For example , the court uses the fact that Ortmann and Van Der Kolk messaged each other about how uploaded files in the program are \" not yet \" being \" audited for copyright violation \" as evidence that the program was designed to drive infringement .But there is no requirement under the law to proactively monitor the content for infringement .Later the judge uses the fact that the incentive program was purposely designed to \" attract new users \" and to reward \" huge uploaders \" as evidence that \" this was not cyberlocker activity but mass distribution of illicit content . \"Again , this presumes that the only possible use for a cyberlocker is to store personal data , and not to use it to distribute and share files ( many of which may be perfectly legitimate ) .Again , some of the other statements may cross the line -- including discussions about specific users where the defendants appear to recognize that certain files are infringing .There are also discussions about whether to cut off incentive payments in cases where they know a user is uploading infringing material ( where they do n't cut off those payments ) .Those may be the most damning .But , again , straight up copyright infringement is n't supposed to be an indictable offense .And it 's all this other stuff that the judge uses to argue some wider \" conspiracy to defraud . \"Also , as has been pointed out time and time again , there is no such thing as \" secondary \" criminal copyright infringement .That is , it 's not a criminal offense if your tool is used by someone else to infringe .But all that basically gets ignored .There 's a lot more in there , and it 's worth reading through and looking at all of the arguments and evidence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.50183"}
