{"text": "Another problem related to terminology arises because sexual abuse of male children by adult men 2 is often referred to as \" homosexual molestation .\" The adjective \" homosexual \" ( or \" heterosexual \" when a man abuses a female child ) refers to the victim 's gender in relation to that of the perpetrator .Unfortunately , people sometimes mistakenly interpret it as referring to the perpetrator 's sexual orientation .To avoid this confusion , it is preferable to refer to men 's sexual abuse of boys with the more accurate label of male - male molestation .Similarly , it is preferable to refer to men 's abuse of girls as male - female molestation .These labels are more accurate because they describe the sex of the individuals involved but do n't implicitly convey unwarranted assumptions about the perpetrator 's sexual orientation .The distinction between a victim 's gender and a perpetrator 's sexual orientation is important because many child molesters do n't really have an adult sexual orientation .They have never developed the capacity for mature sexual relationships with other adults , either men or women .Instead , their sexual attractions focus on children - boys , girls , or children of both sexes .Over the years , this fact has been incorporated into various systems for categorizing child molesters .For example , Finkelhor and Araji ( 1986 ) proposed that perpetrators ' sexual attractions should be conceptualized as ranging along a continuum - from exclusive interest in children at one extreme , to exclusive interest in adult partners at the other end .Typologies of offenders have often included a distinction between those with an enduring primary preference for children as sexual partners and those who have established age - appropriate relationships but become sexually involved with children under unusual circumstances of extreme stress .Perpetrators in the first category - those with a more or less exclusive interest in children - have been labeled fixated .Fixation means \" a temporary or permanent arrestment of psychological maturation resulting from unresolved formative issues which persist and underlie the organization of subsequent phases of development \" ( Groth & Birnbaum , 1978 , p. 176 ) .Many clinicians view fixated offenders as being \" stuck \" at an early stage of psychological development .By contrast , other molesters are described as regressed .Regression is \" a temporary or permanent appearance of primitive behavior after more mature forms of expression had been attained , regardless of whether the immature behavior was actually manifested earlier in the individual 's development \" ( Groth & Birnbaum , 1978 , p. 177 ) .Regressed offenders have developed an adult sexual orientation but under certain conditions ( such as extreme stress ) they return to an earlier , less mature psychological state and engage in sexual contact with children .Some typologies of child molesters divide the fixation - regression distinction into multiple categories , and some include additional categories as well ( e.g. , Knight , 1989 ) .For the present discussion , the important point is that many child molesters can not be meaningfully described as homosexuals , heterosexuals , or bisexuals ( in the usual sense of those terms ) because they are not really capable of a relationship with an adult man or woman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "36.2125"}

{"text": "There have been repeated attempts to link homosexual orientation with pedophilia .Each attempt has failed miserably .They have even gone as far as to test the arousal patterns of gay men and compared them to the arousal patterns of straight men : .In yet another approach to studying adult sexual attraction to children , some Canadian researchers observed how homosexual and heterosexual adult men responded to slides of males and females of various ages ( child , pubescent , and mature adult ) .All of the research subjects were first screened to ensure that they preferred physically mature sexual partners .In some of the slides shown to subjects , the model was clothed ; in others , he or she was nude .The slides were accompanied by audio recordings .The recordings paired with the nude models described an imaginary sexual interaction between the model and the subject .The recordings paired with the pictures of clothed models described the model engaging in neutral activities ( e.g. , swimming ) .To measure sexual arousal , changes in the subjects ' penis volume were monitored while they watched the slides and listened to the audiotapes .The researchers found that homosexual males responded no more to male children than heterosexual males responded to female children ( Freund et al . , 1989 ) .In other words , gay men are no more likely to be sexually attracted to children than straight men .Another important thing to understand about a pedophile is his inability to gender differentiate when it comes to sexual arousal .Those who prefer mature partners have arousal patterns that demonstrate gender differentiation consistent with preferred gender , pedophiles have difficulty with this : .Pedophiles differentiated erotically between females and males less than males who erotically preferred physically mature partners .It is important to note that studies of bisexual males show that bisexuals gender differentiate in their arousal patterns .The only group that has difficulty gender differentiating with arousal patterns are pedophiles .Conclusion .Our guts and personal experience tells us that gay men are n't any more likely to molest children than heterosexual men .So , we tend to just shake our heads when we hear the likes of Fischer spouting off about gay men being pedophiles .But it is important to know exactly why he is wrong .For example , you might run into someone who has read something like what Fischer has had to say and innocently think he 's right .How do you convince them that he is wrong ?Well , the sites I link to here give you the scientific explanations for why he 's wrong .Human sexuality is complex .Sexual abuse , assault , and rape confuse the easy and finite sexual orientation continuum we have been taught .Sexual abuse is n't about sexual attraction .Pedophilia is n't about gay or straight or bisexual .Abusers abuse those they have access to .A high number of boys are molested , not because molesters are disproportionately gay or bi , but because men typically have more access to boys than to girls .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.73383"}

{"text": "Over the years , this fact has been incorporated into various systems for categorizing child molesters .For example , Finkelhor and Araji ( 1986 ) proposed that perpetrators ' sexual attractions should be conceptualized as ranging along a continuum - from exclusive interest in children at one extreme , to exclusive interest in adult partners at the other end .Typologies of offenders have often included a distinction between those with an enduring primary preference for children as sexual partners and those who have established age - appropriate relationships but become sexually involved with children under unusual circumstances of extreme stress .Perpetrators in the first category - those with a more or less exclusive interest in children - have been labeled fixated .Fixation means \" a temporary or permanent arrestment of psychological maturation resulting from unresolved formative issues which persist and underlie the organization of subsequent phases of development \" ( Groth & Birnbaum , 1978 , p. 176 ) .Many clinicians view fixated offenders as being \" stuck \" at an early stage of psychological development .By contrast , other molesters are described as regressed .Regression is \" a temporary or permanent appearance of primitive behavior after more mature forms of expression had been attained , regardless of whether the immature behavior was actually manifested earlier in the individual 's development \" ( Groth & Birnbaum , 1978 , p. 177 ) .Regressed offenders have developed an adult sexual orientation but under certain conditions ( such as extreme stress ) they return to an earlier , less mature psychological state and engage in sexual contact with children .Some typologies of child molesters divide the fixation - regression distinction into multiple categories , and some include additional categories as well ( e.g. , Knight , 1989 ) .For the present discussion , the important point is that many child molesters can not be meaningfully described as homosexuals , heterosexuals , or bisexuals ( in the usual sense of those terms ) because they are not really capable of a relationship with an adult man or woman .Instead of gender , their sexual attractions are based primarily on age .These individuals - who are often characterized as fixated - are attracted to children , not to men or women .Using the fixated - regressed distinction , Groth and Birnbaum ( 1978 ) studied 175 adult males who were convicted in Massachusetts of sexual assault against a child .None of the men had an exclusively homosexual adult sexual orientation .83 ( 47 % ) were classified as \" fixated ; \" 70 others ( 40 % ) were classified as regressed adult heterosexuals ; the remaining 22 ( 13 % ) were classified as regressed adult bisexuals .Of the last group , Groth and Birnbaum observed that \" in their adult relationships they engaged in sex on occasion with men as well as with women .However , in no case did this attraction to men exceed their preference for women ....There were no men who were primarily sexually attracted to other adult males ... \" ( p.180 ) .Other researchers have taken different approaches , but have similarly failed to find a connection between homosexuality and child molestation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.164818"}

{"text": "What About Claims That Scientific Research Proves Gay Men Are Likely To Molest Children ?Some conservative groups have argued that scientific research strongly supports their claims that homosexuality and pedophilia are linked .The Family Research Council has produced what is perhaps the most extensive attempt to document this claim .It is an article by Timothy J. Dailey titled Homosexuality and Child Abuse .With 76 footnotes , many of them referring to papers in scientific journals , it appears at first glance to be a thorough and scholarly discussion of the issue .On further examination , however , its central argument - that \" the evidence indicates that homosexual men molest boys at rates grossly disproportionate to the rates at which heterosexual men molest girls \" - does n't hold up .In the following section , the main sources cited by Dailey and the FRC to support their claim are reviewed .The papers are listed in the same order in which they are first cited by the FRC article .Freund et al .( 1989 ) .Heterosexuality , homosexuality , and erotic age preference .Journal of Sex Research , 26 , 107 - 117 .This article is discussed above in the \" Other Approaches \" section .As the FRC concedes , it contradicts their argument .The abstract summarizes the authors ' conclusion : \" Findings indicate that homosexual males who preferred mature partners responded no more to male children than heterosexual males who preferred mature partners responded to female children . \"Silverthorne & Quinsey .Sexual partner age preferences of homosexual and heterosexual men and women .Archives of Sexual Behavior , 29 , 67 - 76 .The FRC cites this study to challenge the Freund et al . data ( see the previous paper above ) .However , the methodologies were quite different .Freund and his colleagues used a sample that included sex offenders and they assessed sexual arousal with a physiological measure similar to that described below for the 1988 Marshall et al . study .Silverthorne and Quinsey used a sample of community volunteers who were asked to view pictures of human faces and use a 7-point scale to rate their sexual attractiveness .The apparent ages of the people portrayed in the pictures was originally estimated by Dr. Silverthorne to range from 15 to 50 .However , a group of independent raters perceived the male faces to range in age from 18 to 58 , and the female faces to range from 19 to 60 .In either case , it appears that none of the pictures was rated as \" very sexually attractive \" ( a rating of 7 ) .Rather , the highest average ratings were approximately 5 .They rated the 58-year old male faces 2 , on average .A serious problem with this study is that the researchers did n't control for the possibility that some of the faces pictured in the photos might simply have been more or less physically attractive than the others , independent of their age or gender .The researchers explicitly acknowledged this shortcoming , speculating that the women 's faces in the 25-year old group might have been more attractive than women 's faces in the other age groups .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.437374"}

{"text": "Consequently , they may not accurately describe child molesters who have never been caught or have not sought treatment .A second problem is that the terminology used in this area is often confusing and can even be misleading .We can begin to address that problem by defining some basic terms .Pedophilia and child molestation are used in different ways , even by professionals .Pedophilia usually refers to an adult psychological disorder characterized by a preference for prepubescent children as sexual partners ; this preference may or may not be acted upon .The term hebephilia is sometimes used to describe adult sexual attractions to adolescents or children who have reached puberty .Whereas pedophilia and hebephilia refer to psychological propensities , child molestation and child sexual abuse are used to describe actual sexual contact between an adult and someone who has not reached the legal age of consent .In this context , the latter individual is referred to as a child , even though he or she may be a teenager .Although the terms are not always applied consistently , it is useful to distinguish between pedophiles / hebephiles and child molesters / abusers .Pedophilia and hebephilia are diagnostic labels that refer to psychological attractions .Not all pedophiles and hebephiles actually molest children ; an adult can be attracted to children or adolescents without ever actually engaging in sexual contact with them .Child molestation and child sexual abuse refer to actions , and do n't imply a particular psychological makeup or motive on the part of the perpetrator .Not all incidents of child sexual abuse are perpetrated by pedophiles or hebephiles ; in some cases , the perpetrator has other motives for his or her actions and does not manifest an ongoing pattern of sexual attraction to children .Thus , not all child sexual abuse is perpetrated by pedophiles ( or hebephiles ) and not all pedophiles and hebephiles actually commit abuse .Consequently , it is important to use terminology carefully .Another problem related to terminology arises because sexual abuse of male children by adult men 2 is often referred to as \" homosexual molestation .\" The adjective \" homosexual \" ( or \" heterosexual \" when a man abuses a female child ) refers to the victim 's gender in relation to that of the perpetrator .Unfortunately , people sometimes mistakenly interpret it as referring to the perpetrator 's sexual orientation .To avoid this confusion , it is preferable to refer to men 's sexual abuse of boys with the more accurate label of male - male molestation .Similarly , it is preferable to refer to men 's abuse of girls as male - female molestation .These labels are more accurate because they describe the sex of the individuals involved but do n't implicitly convey unwarranted assumptions about the perpetrator 's sexual orientation .The distinction between a victim 's gender and a perpetrator 's sexual orientation is important because many child molesters do n't really have an adult sexual orientation .They have never developed the capacity for mature sexual relationships with other adults , either men or women .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.201233"}

{"text": "Furthermore , Cameron 's rationale for selecting particular sources appears to have been completely arbitrary .He described no systematic method for reviewing the literature , and apparently never reviewed the voluminous literature on the sexual development of children and adolescents .His final choice of sources appears to have slanted his findings toward what Cameron described as \" the relative absence in the scientific literature of heterosexual teacher - pupil sexual events coupled with persistent , albeit infrequent , homosexual teacher - pupil sexual interactions \" ( p. 1232 ) .A subsequent paper by Cameron and others ( Cameron , Proctor , Coburn , Forde , Larson , & Cameron , 1986 ) described data collected in a door - to - door survey in seven U.S. cities and towns , and generally repeated the conclusions reached in Cameron ( 1985 ) .Even Cameron himself admitted that his conclusions in this study are \" based upon small numbers of data points \" ( Cameron , 2005 , p. 230 ) .As before , male - male sexual assaults were referred to as \" homosexual \" molestations ( e.g. , Abstract , p.327 ) and the perpetrators ' sexual orientation apparently was not assessed .This study also suffers from fatal methodological problems , which are detailed elsewhere on this site .Not only did Cameron again make the fallacious claim that all male - male molestations are committed by homosexuals , he also made the same claim about female - female molestations .Once again , he had no data about the actual sexual orientations of the molesters .Cameron continues to produce reports that essentially repeat the same inaccurate claims .Perhaps one of the best indicators of his diminishing credibility in this area is that his work was not cited in the 2004 FRC report discussed in detail above .Conclusion .The empirical research does not show that gay or bisexual men are any more likely than heterosexual men to molest children .This is not to argue that homosexual and bisexual men never molest children .But there is no scientific basis for asserting that they are more likely than heterosexual men to do so .And , as explained above , many child molesters can not be characterized as having an adult sexual orientation at all ; they are fixated on children .The survey was conducted under the auspices of the Kinsey Institute ( Klassen , Williams , & Levitt , 1989 ) .( return to text ) .Sexual abuse by women occurs but has not been well documented .Perhaps it is not surprising , therefore , that the child molester stereotype is applied more often to gay men than to lesbians .( return to text ) .On the front page their is an article about Bryan Fischer who claims that gays are pedophiles .Of course serious people know better .But I think it is important to know why we know better .I followed the link from the front page article about Fischer .The first thing I will do is show you Fischer 's reasoning .The next thing I will do is show you why experts on human sexuality disagree with Fischer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.93725"}

' ) .Then we came to an interesting disjunction .He argued that the basis of persecution of homosexuality was bound up with concepts of choice : the idea that gay men and women choose to be gay , and could choose normality if they were n't so contrary and perverse .That , in other words , the religious right ( say ) do n't attack gay people as gay people , but as people who could have followed their God - given straight - ness but who had perversely ' chosen ' to be gay instead .He insisted that there had never been a moment in his life when he sat down and said to himself , ' so , which way shall I go ?Gay or straight ? 'From as early as he had been aware of sexual feelings he had been aware that they were focussed on men .Sean Connery , he said , was one of his first crushes .And Rolf Harris .De gustibus indeed .This made sense to me , of course ; not that he fancied Rolf Harris , but that he did not find himself at any point consciously or otherwise ' choosing ' to be gay .But I wonder if systematic homophobes do indeed predicate their animus on choice ?Does an acceptance of the fact that gay people do n't ' choose ' their sexual orientation draw the fangs of the homophobic hater ?Is n't it more likely that the homophobic hater is quite happy to accommodate the notion that gays do n't choose to be gay , in the same way that the racist is n't bothered by the fact that black people do n't choose to be black ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.643875"}

{"text": "\" But wait ! \" You might begin .\" If men molest boys are n't they necessarily gay ? \" The answer is no .Because , for one , sexual orientation is n't about behavior alone .For example , when Governor Jim McGreevy feigned heterosexuality most of his life and formed a heterosexual family , and presumably engaged in heterosexual behavior was he a heterosexual all of that time ?Or was he simply a closeted gay man ?Behavior is n't always consistent with sexual orientation and attraction .Pedophiles are attracted , primarily , to children .The sex of those children matter less than that they are children .The sex of victim has more to do with access than sexual orientation .We do not find a connection between homosexual identity and the increased likelihood of subsequent abuse from the data that we have right now ...It 's important to separate the sexual identity and the behavior .Someone can commit sexual acts that might be of a homosexual nature but not have a homosexual identity .From the same article : .In the book Mental Disorders of the New Millennium ( 2006 ) , author and psychology professor Thomas Plante writes : .Although the majority of clergy abuse victims are males , homosexuality can not be blamed .First , many of the pedophile priests report that they are not homosexual .This is also true of many non - clergy sex offenders who victimize boys .Many report that they target boys for a variety of reasons\u00c2 that include easier access to boys ... pregnancy fears with female victims ... homosexuals in general have not been found to be more likely to commit sexual crimes against minors compared to heterosexuals .Sexual orientation is not predictive of sex crimes . . .Even Pope Benedict XVI , not exactly a liberal gay rights activist , has said the same thing : .Typologies of offenders have often included a distinction between those with an enduring primary preference for children as sexual partners and those who have established age - appropriate relationships but become sexually involved with children under unusual circumstances of extreme stress .Perpetrators in the first category - those with a more or less exclusive interest in children - have been labeled fixated .Fixation means \" a temporary or permanent arrestment of psychological maturation resulting from unresolved formative issues which persist and underlie the organization of subsequent phases of development \" ( Groth & Birnbaum , 1978 , p. 176 ) .Many clinicians view fixated offenders as being \" stuck \" at an early stage of psychological development .By contrast , other molesters are described as regressed .Regression is \" a temporary or permanent appearance of primitive behavior after more mature forms of expression had been attained , regardless of whether the immature behavior was actually manifested earlier in the individual 's development \" ( Groth & Birnbaum , 1978 , p. 177 ) .Regressed offenders have developed an adult sexual orientation but under certain conditions ( such as extreme stress ) they return to an earlier , less mature psychological state and engage in sexual contact with children .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.53"}

Jung that has been crucial in my accepting myself as a gay man .Jung is writing about what he calls \" a man with a mother complex . \"Like Robert Hopke , whose writing led me to this passage , I believe what Jung is describing is a man who is close to his inner feminine , regardless of whole notion of a \" mother complex .\" I believe this passage describes many , maybe most , gay men .Jung says such a man \" may have a finely differentiated Eros instead of , or in addition to , homosexuality .( Something of this sort is suggested by Plato in his Symposium . )This gives him a great capacity for friendship , which often creates ties of astonishing tenderness between men and may even recue friendship between the sexes from the limbo of the impossible .He may have good taste and an aesthetic sense which are fostered by the presence of a feminine streak .Then he may be supremely gifted as a teacher because of his almost feminine insight and tact .He is likely to have a feeling for history , and to be conservative in the best sense and cherish the values of the past .Often he is endowed with a wealth of religious feelings , which help to bring the ecclesia spiritualis into reality ; and a spiritual receptivity which makes him responsive to revelation .This passage led me to see that my homosexuality is not an entity unto itself .It is part and parcel of a larger framework of personality , and one can not and should not expect to extract this one part of the framework believing that the rest can stand on its own .So for me , the question , do I want to be rid of my homosexuality became : Do I want to be rid of my deep capacity for friendship ?Do I want to be rid of my teaching gifts ?Do I want to be rid of my feeling for history ?Did I want to be rid of my spiritual receptivity ?I have come to see the whole thing as a gift .I realize psychoanalytic theory does n't hold much weight in most discussions of psychology today .But I think here at least , Jung got it right .Teresa . @David Pickup , much of what you said in your Comment , I think , is quite wonderful for those men you 've helped .However , I have a several questions for you concerning Reparative Therapy ( RT ) .Are you operating under the assumption that homosexuality is solely caused by poor parenting when a child is very young ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.57092"}
