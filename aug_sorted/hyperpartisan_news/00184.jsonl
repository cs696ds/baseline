Petraeus .Although Kerry is thought to covet the job of secretary of state , senior administration officials familiar with the transition planning said that nomination will almost certainly go to Susan E. Rice , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations .John O. Brennan , Obama 's chief counterterrorism adviser , is a leading contender for the CIA job if he wants it , officials said .If Brennan goes ahead with his plan to leave government , Michael J. Morell , the agency 's acting director , is the prohibitive favorite to take over permanently .Officials cautioned that the White House discussions are still in the early stages and that no decisions have been made .Petraeus 's resignation last week after revelations of an extramarital affair have complicated what was already an intricate puzzle to reassemble the administration 's national security and diplomatic pieces for Obama 's second term .Rice , one of an inner circle of aides who have been with Obama since his first presidential campaign in 2007 , is under particular fire over the Benghazi incident , in which U.S. Ambassador J.
