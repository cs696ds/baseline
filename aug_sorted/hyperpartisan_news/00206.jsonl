{"text": "At the time of the Dunblane tragedy in 1996 , shooting organisations claimed that pistol shooting was the fastest growing sport in the country .It was thus perfectly reasonable to believe that we were following the American trend in guns as we do in so many other aspects of society .The problem with guns in America is that there are too many of them .They have simply become a part of life .40 % of households contain guns and around 35,000 die every year from gunfire . instruments of violence in private hands .They respond by asserting that the problem is the prevalence of illegal weapons not legal ones .Here the example of Switzerland is often cited .Switzerland has high levels of legal gun ownership but low levels of crime .However , in a ground - breaking study in 1993 , Professor Martin Killias of the University of Lausanne pointed out that although crime in general may be lower in Switzerland , gun homicides were almost six times higher than in the UK and gun suicides were 15 times higher .Since the correlation holds for other countries he studied , the connection between levels of legal gun ownership and gun violence is manifest .Notwithstanding the Swiss figures , the notion that the source of gun violence is a shadowy illegal market divorced from the legitimate firearms market retains its currency .But it is not sustainable .We know that there is significant slippage from the legal to the illegal market through theft , reactivation of deactivated weapons and through the activities of dealers .We know very little about the provenance of guns used in crime in the UK but the American experience may be instructive .In February 1999 the federal government of the US issued figures which indicated that 40 % of all crime handguns traced by the police were sold brand new by a licensed dealer less than three years earlier .If the situation is even remotely similar in this country , it is clear that the legal and illegal markets are inextricably linked .So , to summarise the argument : . there is an underlying current tending towards the proliferation of guns .the extent of legal gun ownership is connected to the rate of gun violence .the illegal gun market can not be separated from the legal market .These tenets lead us logically to the conclusion that if we want a safer society we need to be progressively restricting the availability and desirability of legal and illegal guns , and we should certainly be seeking to discourage young people from developing an interest in guns .There are several measures which would contribute to this .First , we need a minimum age limit of 18 for the use of all guns ; this would send out a clear message that guns are lethal weapons , not toys for children .If at the age of 18 a young man or woman wishes to take up shooting then that is the time to embark on the training that is advocated by the shooting organisations .Second , we should recognise the lethal nature of airguns and register them as such .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.09313"}

{"text": "Whenever I get into discussions about gun control , I always mention two academic books by John R. Lott and Joyce Lee Malcolm .Here is a paper by Dr. Malcolm that summarizes one of the key points of her book .Excerpt : .Tracing the history of gun control in the United Kingdom since the late 19th century , this article details how the government has arrogated to itself a monopoly on the right to use force .The consequence has been a tremendous increase in violent crime , and harsh punishment for crime victims who dare to fight back .The article is based on the author 's most recent book , Guns and Violence : The English Experience ( Harvard University Press , 2002 ) .Joyce Malcom is professor of history at Bentley College , in Waltham , Massachusetts .She is also author of To Keep and Bear Arms : The Origins of an AngloAmerican Right ( Harvard University Press , 1994 ) .Upon the passage of The Firearms Act ( No . 2 ) in 1997 , British Deputy Home Secretary Alun Michael boasted : \" Britain now has some of the toughest gun laws in the world . \"The Act was second handgun control measure passed that year , imposed a near - complete ban on private ownership of handguns , capping nearly eighty years of increasing firearms restrictions .Driven by an intense public campaign in the wake of the shooting of schoolchildren in Dunblane , Scotland , Parliament had been so zealous to outlaw all privately owned handguns that it rejected proposals to exempt Britain 's Olympic target - shooting team and handicapped target - shooters from the ban .And the result of the 1997 gun ban : .The result of the ban has been costly .Thousands of weapons were confiscated at great financial cost to the public .Hundreds of thousands of police hours were devoted to the task .But in the six years since the 1997 handgun ban , crimes with the very weapons banned have more than doubled , and firearm crime has increased markedly .In 2002 , for the fourth consecutive year , gun crime in England and Wales rose - by 35 percent for all firearms , and by a whopping 46 percent for the banned handguns .Nearly 10,000 firearms offences were committed .[ ... ]According to Scotland Yard , in the four years from 1991 to 1995 crimes against the person in England\"s inner cities increased by 91 percent .In the four years from 1997 to 2001 the rate of violent crime more than doubled .The UK murder rate for 2002 was the highest for a century .I think that peer - reviewed studies - from Harvard University , no less - should be useful to those of us who believe in the right of self - defense for law - abiding people .The book by economist John Lott , linked above , compares the crime rates of all U.S. states that have enacted concealed carry laws , and concludes that violent crime rates dropped after law - abiding citizens were allowed to carry legally - owned firearms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.823605"}

{"text": "Like the sponsors , I believe there is some preemptive and deterrent value to deploying a national missile defense system to defend against limited -- I emphasize ' limited'--missile attacks even before the threat , certainly the rogue nation threat , has fully emerged .To understand the unwarranted cost of delay in deploying a limited national missile defense system , I think we need only look at the difficult situation today in the theater missile defense area .Our theater missile defense systems arrived well after the short - range missile threat in the Middle East had emerged .When the Persian Gulf war began , Iraq had hundreds of short - range ballistic missiles at its disposal , while we had a very limited antimissile capability essentially grafted onto the Patriot air defense system .We were grateful for what we had .We are still playing catchup ball in the theater missile defense area , and we continue to do so today .Mr. President , there are three parts to the threat that encourage us , from my perspective , to move forward on a prudent basis on a national missile defense system .First , there is a potential at some future time for deliberate , long - range missile attacks from rogue nations .You can debate whether that is going to be in 5 years , 10 years , 2 years , 4 years .We all know that if certain powers in the world decided they wanted a rogue nation to have a missile and a nuclear warhead , it could happen overnight .I do not think that is likely because I do not think it is to Russia 's benefit or China 's benefit , or anyone else that is a nuclear power , to deliver a missile delivery system or a nuclear warhead to a rogue nation .The second threat is the threat of accidental launch from existing nuclear powers .That accidental is exactly what we are talking about here .We are not talking about deliberate in the second threat , but accidental .There is a threat of unauthorized launch from existing nuclear powers .The cost of that deployment can be viewed as a very reasonable insurance premium , if it is a prudent program against the catastrophic damage , the unimaginable loss of life that would result from even a single accidental or unauthorized nuclear missile aimed at an American city .I must add , however , the caution that everyone contemplating an insurance policy has to weigh the cost of the insurance premium against the risk of loss .Then you have to decide whether the risk warrants the premium .That is the way you have to decide a number of things , both in everyday life as well as in the defense arena .Today , as the CBO report makes plain , the cost of the Dole - Gingrich bill 's insurance premium for national missile defense is quite high .Therefore , these have to be weighed carefully , each , in my view , separately but also collectively .For all of these reasons , Mr. President , I have some sympathy for some of the underlying concepts of the Dole - Gingrich bill .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.22609"}
