Riggs .Hello E.W. - I do n't think we need to worry about folks ending up in the Episcopal church .Of course he was n't Orthodox , but my take on why C.S. Lewis is here is because he is much loved by many Orthodox Christians .Hopefully , in time , this article will highlight his relationship with Orthodoxy and what Orthodox people have said about him , explaining his relevance to Orthodox folks .About the dualism you mentioned , I do think that The Great Divorce shows pretty clearly that he held to a \" privative theory of evil \" which is basically universal among classicly Christian theologians .He does mention Orthodoxy a number of times in his books .Given his time and place , he did n't enter in very far , but he was evidently quite interested in what he saw .Maybe these passages would be good to include here , to highlight his relationship to the Orthodox Church . -Fr .John .An Anonymous Orthodox ?I appreciate the comments by User : Gavril_Berkowitz and I definitely think they 're going in the right direction .Maybe this will help the folks who have voiced some concerns understand why this section is here and why Lewis is included in OrthodoxWiki .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "121.89125"}
