{"text": "Even if she just meant to scare the girl off , it was a horribly reckless gesture .I think most drivers tend to forget just how dangerous cars are : it 's several tons of metal moving at speed , if mishandled it could very well kill someone , driver included .I 'm not saying cars are some sort of dormant bloodthirsty monsters a la Christine , but in the end they are machines : they are only as smart as the person using them .I 'm against any kind of saving in store parking lots .I would not jump out and stand in a spot for anyone .Not because I fear being run down but because I think it 's incredibly stupid and rude to go and stand in a parking spot in a crowded lot to prevent anyone else from parking there .And then there of course there are people like this crazy woman who would actually run a person down .I deal with parking lot battles by immediately disengaging .I wo nt fight over a space ever .Does n't matter if I was in the right .Maybe I 'm too passive but it 's not worth getting my blood pressure up over .Driving in a crowded parking lot is stressful enough without these little altercations .There are spots for those who are disabled or pregnant up front .Otherwise you can drop anyone off in front who might have trouble walking so far and then go park the car .Better to walk a little distance then to engage in this kind of nonsense .Huh .For once , admin , you and I are in complete agreement on a topic .To reiterate what you said : the victim DID NOT deserve to be hit .No one would have , no one ever will .Beyond simply being dangerous , I additionally feel that that attempting to save a good parking space is rude beyond measure .The very nature of parking lots ( at least parking lots for public locations such as a mall or Walmart ) is that they are a first come , first serve situation .Attempting to save a spot sends the message that you feel entitled to it above and beyond everyone else .What I really ca n't get over is how many spaces are available in that parkinglot !Why are people fighting for this space when I can see literally dozens of other spaces !It 's very odd that the girl would be asked to hold a space when they could have parked anywhere ( and those other spaces are n't even all that much further ) .I also wonder if the woman really meant to hit the girl or if it was like when someone drives through the front of a store ; as in she thought she was in reverse or something and went rocketing forward accidentally .I 'm not really defending her , it just seems so weird that someone would hit a person with their car when they could park , like , four spots down .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.898026"}

{"text": "Does that make sense ?My father was very tight budgeted when my accident happened a few months ago , so if your family is too , it may take a little time for everyone to get over it and move on .Trust me , your family is so grateful you are ok and now it is time for them to deal with the aftermath , such as , dealing with insurance and getting a new car or repairing the other one .This is unfortunately a growing experience , like the officer on the scene of my accident told me , car accidents are rites of passage for many drivers .Forgive yourself and give your parents some room to accept and deal with everything ( if they seem like they need it ) .I can tell by how you told your story that you have a deep soul and you are not a careless person .I 'm sure your parents know that .Everything will be ok .Time will move on and this will become in the past .Forgive yourself , it was a mistake and just learn for it .Please keep in mind that everyone makes mistakes .Even the most cautious and experienced drivers are capable of this , and so are you .Hopefully the girl will be alright and the driver can take a lesson from this .That is all we can hope for at this point .I am sure that the paramedics will take great care of the girl and that if she was conscious that there is a good chance that she will be okay .Everyone makes mistakes , and the most important thing is that you learn from them , which you seem you have .Everything happens for a reason , whether we know the said reason or not .I know the feeling of being afraid to drive again after an accident , as I was very nearly involved in one not too long ago , and also witnessed one happen right in front of me .It is a reminder that these things happen very fast and can happen to anyone .The best thing you can do is to make an effort to be more aware of your surroundings and to approach situations on the road with a good amount of caution .You will be okay , but it will take a little bit of time .I do hope you get support and are able to deal with this terrible tragedy .People 's point of reference come from their experience with pain and suffering .The callous judgment from some show little life experience and wisdom .God gave us free will and we put ourselves in situations that can be dangerous , even fatal .Can he keep us from harm ?Of course .But we are not meant to understand His reason .Why are we safe ?Why do some die ?That is faith - accepting what we can not understand .Terrible accidents happen .God forgives us if we ask for forgiveness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.801346"}

{"text": "Maybe you would think differently if it was you or a close relative of yours who was hit and left to die on the street .She ran after killing someone .Joe B .I do n't think it 's useful to argue about sentences for drivers who kill .In fact , I think that concentrating discussion on their sentences is harmful , because it distracts us from proposing solutions that might actually significantly decrease dangerous driving .Only a ( relatively ) small number of people ever kill someone from behind the wheel .But a huge number of people drive dangerously .Even if we forbade drivers who kill from ever driving again , we would n't make a dent dangerous driving because most killers are n't repeat offenders .In order to stop dangerous driving , we need to address ALL dangerous drivers , not just those who kill .Some argue that long prison sentences for killers would deter other dangerous drivers .But I do n't think there would be much of a deterrent , because most dangerous drivers do n't think they 're ever going to actually kill somebody .The only way we 're going to make a dent in dangerous driving is by de - normalizing it .One way to begin de - normalizing dangerous driving is to begin consistent enforcement of traffic laws that ban dangerous behavior .Conduct well - publicized saturation patrols in small areas , with the goal of convincing drivers that if they do something dangerous in that area , there is a very good chance that they will be caught .Once they understand that and they begin driving safely in that small area , that frees up police resources to do the same thing in another small area .Eventually drivers will get tired of keeping track of where they can and ca n't drive dangerously , and will avoid driving dangerously everywhere .Kenny Easwaran .I 'm not trolling .I sincerely think that prison is an awful thing , and that we overuse it and abuse it in this country .The only purpose it serves is appeasement of our baser human desire for revenge .Step up enforcement , revoke licenses , impose harsher penalties and fines , but do n't expand the use of prison .I had the pleasure of speaking with Mario Lopez last Saturday night when I spoke at the Bicycle Film Festival .Justice for cyclists is evasive , especially when a killer can plea her way out of stiffer sentence .Peace , Josh .David Haddox .Not addressing the sentencing at all ....What 's wrong with giving her a bus pass and a bicycle after she is released , and telling her to \" figure it out \" ?Surely she does n't deserve to drive ever again .Its dumbfounding that she will get behind the wheel anywhere .That should be the long run punishment .An eternity of public transit , braving the roads on bike , and begging rides from friends .She has shown she ca nt be trusted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.627914"}

{"text": "With Barbara Streisand .Barbara repeats the line and Ryan O'Neal , in a beautiful moment of self - parody , responds , \" That 's the dumbest thing I 've ever heard !\" I could n't agree more .If anything , real love should make us more ready to say \" I 'm sorry .\" Real love is a choice , not a feeling .It 's a choice that we make once , accepting the reality that we will have to make that same choice again and again for the rest of our lives .A big part of choosing love over fear ( in marriage , church , work , or family ) involves our willingness to seek and offer forgiveness when things go wrong .It 's easy to talk about love when everything is going great , but it 's something else entirely to love someone when everything has gone wrong .The process of seeking and offering forgiveness is more broadly referred to as reconciliation .Reconciliation is love in action .It 's what happens when the rubber meets the road in real life and real relationships .Anyone who has really experienced it can tell you that reconciliation is the single most miraculous event that can happen in any human relationship .I have a hunch that that 's why the ancient Jews and Christians zeroed in on reconciliation as their primary metaphor for describing what happens in the relationship between God and creation .They called it redemption or salvation .The early Christians thought of this relationship as taking place in and through this person named Jesus .Jesus was more than just an inspirational philosopher to them .They saw something unique in him that they identified with the God of their Jewish ancestors .This identification was so strong that the early Christians would say that to look at Jesus was to look at God .If you want to understand what God is like , they said , just look at Jesus .They used all kinds of poetic metaphors to describe the relationship between God and creation that was happening through Jesus : it was like being healed from a sickness , raised from the dead , or freed from captivity .It was like being blind , and then being able to see .It was like being hopelessly lost , but then finding your way again .These were all valid metaphors for describing their experience of the relationship between God and creation that was happening through Jesus .But the mental image they used most often was that of reconciliation .This was and is a beautiful thing .Christians to this very day tend to think of their relationship with God in the same way .The only problem is that , when forgiveness and reconciliation becomes the only metaphor for describing our relationship with God , it can easily become twisted into something it was never meant to be .The sole emphasis on forgiveness as a metaphor for salvation led , over the centuries , to an obsession with guilt and sin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.42618"}

{"text": "For example if you constantly dream about animals , or being chased - maybe falling , flying or other things , she gives you an explanation of why you might be dreaming about these things .There are actually quite a few dream symbols explained in the book from the very basic things people dream about often , to a few very odd things .Rebecca says that lucid dreaming is like \" taking a creativity pill \" and I have to agree with her once again !You can do anything and everything while you 're inside a lucid dream .She also teaches you : . how to stay in lucid dreams longer .It 's AMAZING how much you can do when you have a lucid dream - that I was not aware of before .In fact I did NOT know that you could talk to your subconscious mind while you were lucid dreaming .I guess as the author of \" Directed Dreaming - Success from The Subconscious , \" I should have considered that option , but it just never occurred to me that you could get into your subconscious while you sleep , as well as when you lucid dream !Later on in the book she gives you a few more challenges to do - but she does n't just challenge you to fly with perfect control or run through walls !There are actually 10 challenges that she goes through step by step and tells you exactly how to complete them .This is from her own personal experience ( she 's been lucid dreaming since she was 14 ! )You can bet if you try to do the things like she 's done them you will have better success in not only doing these things , but in creating your own new adventures .I suppose this review would n't be complete without telling you that she does have a section on lucid dreaming sex also .It appears that a lot of people do n't have success with having sex in lucid dreams , and there 's a good reason for that .Get her book today and you 'll know why this may be happening to you , and how to fix it !This is just a handful of things that you 'll find in her book - but that 's not all you get with this system .There 's also a hypnotic recording which is a Guided Meditation MP3 .This meditation piece not only goes through a sleep process , but it also walks you into inducing a lucid dream , and getting into the dream .So while you 're listening to the MP3 , you 'll actually practice lucid dreaming and GET INTO this suggested dream !This is exciting because once you 've actually gotten into a lucid dream - even if it 's one that 's being suggested to you - you 'll know what to expect and again , be able to more easily get into your own dreams .If you REALLY want to have a lucid dream , my advice is to do the MP3 a few times and get a feeling for how it 's done .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.77079"}
{"text": "Another way to appreciate this is to imagine having a panic attack as like standing on a cliff 's edge .The anxiety seemingly pushes you closer to falling over the edge .To be rid of the fear you must metaphorically jump .You must jump off the cliff edge and into the anxiety and fear and all the things that you fear most .How do you jump ?You jump by wanting to have a panic attack .You go about your day asking for anxiety and panic attacks to appear .Your real safety is the fact that a panic attack will never harm you .That is a medical fact .You are safe , the sensations are wild but no harm will come to you .Your heart is racing but no harm will come to you .The jump becomes nothing more than a two foot drop !It 's perfectly safe .Anxiety causes an imbalance in your life whereby all of the mental worry creates a top - heavy sensation .All of your focus is moved from the center of your body to the head .Schools of meditation often like to demonstrate an example of this top - heavy imbalance by showing how easily the body can lose its sense of center .The key to overcoming panic attacks is to relax .That 's easy to say but difficult to do .A good way to do this is to concentrate on your breathing making sure it is slow and steady .One of the first signs of a panic attack is difficulty breathing , and you may find yourself panting to catch a breath .When you focus on making those breaths even , your heart rate will slow down and the panic will subside .Breathing more slowly and deeply has a calming effect .A good way to breathe easier is to let all the air out of your lungs .This forces your lungs to reach for a deeper breath next time .Continue to focus on your out - breath , letting all the air out of your lungs and soon you 'll find your breathing is deeper and you feel calmer .Ideally , you want to take the focus off the fact that you are having a panic attack .Try to press your feet , one at a time , into the ground .Feel how connected and rooted they are to the ground .An even better way is to lie down with your bottom near a wall .Place your feet against the wall ( your knees are bent ) and press your feet one at a time into the wall .If you can breathe in as you press your foot against the wall , and breathe out as you release it , it will be more effective .You should alternate between your feet .Do this for 10 - 15 minutes or until the panic subsides .Use all of your senses to take full notice of what you see , hear , feel , and smell in your environment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.8064"}

{"text": "In other words , it 's all about getting back on God 's good side so that nothing bad will happen to us after we die .Christians began to think of themselves as \" sinners in the hands of an angry God \" .Theirs was an unhealthy obsession with guilt and fear that , I think , led to a gross distortion of who God is and what salvation is really all about .I do n't think we 're \" sinners in the hands of an angry God \" .I think our ancestors in the faith took the most beautiful moment in a human relationship and applied it to their relationship with God .If we 're going to recover reconciliation as our primary metaphor for salvation , I think we need to let go of our baggage of guilt and fear .We need to remember that reconciliation begins with God , whose love is unconditional .Our trust in that love is what gives us the strength to be honest about who we really are and what we need to work on .That 's why we confess our sins at the beginning of worship each week .It 's not about guilt and fear ; it 's about honesty and trust .Knowing that we are loved ( no matter what ) is the key to owning up to our faults .We have nothing to hide and nothing to be afraid of .As this great love gives us the power to make peace with ourselves , we are also commissioned and ordained as peacemakers in the world .Once we have experienced that love for ourselves , we are called upon to pass it on .Have you ever noticed how the passing of the peace in our service is supposed to happen right after our prayer of confession ?That 's no coincidence .We receive God 's love and then we immediately give it away .Love begets love .Grace begets more grace .Jesus took the idea of reconciliation quite seriously .For him , it even trumped the importance of a worship service .\" This call to peacemaking and reconciliation is so important that Jesus was even willing to interrupt a worship service for it .Real love should be able to say \" I 'm sorry \" and \" I forgive you \" .This is love in action , not just feeling .It 's worth mentioning that this peacemaking is not always easy .It gets complicated .Nowhere is it more difficult than it is for those who find themselves in physically or psychologically abusive situations at work or home .The call for forgiveness can too often be manipulated by abusers who merely want to maintain power over their victims . \"C'mon , \" they say , \" ca n't you just forgive me ?Do n't you believe in forgiveness ?What would Jesus do ?\" They might even quote scripture to back up what they 're saying .If you 're dealing with that kind of person : get out of the relationship .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.024574"}

{"text": "However , here are some things to try that have been known to work for a variety of people .The first thing you should do is make sure that your depression is n't being caused by a medical condition .Things like low thyroid function , low progesterone , or low blood oxygen can cause depression , as can bad eating habits , lack of sleep , and no exercise .All of these things can make a person feel more depressed than they normally would .That being said , a few things that you can take away from the above information is that if you 're not currently exercising , get started !Even if you just walk around the block you will release some of the natural \" feel good \" chemicals in your body ( called endorphins ) .You might have to push yourself at first , but soon you will look forward to that natural high as well as the fresh - air and getting to know your neighborhood a little better .Getting enough sleep is also important .If you have problems sleeping , try a few simple things : Make your routine more - well - routine !Never watch TV in bed .Instead , do the same things ( at approximately the same time ) each night to get yourself ready for bed ( wash your face , brush your teeth , etc . ) .You need to let your body know that after you do these things , it 's time to sleep .You might also try a meditation tape or the more advanced Brainwave Entrainment CD 's to calm your brain down and help stop those negative thoughts that are keeping you up at night .Use the techniques where you can lay down and relax , not something you listen to while on the computer .It 's not a good idea go get on the computer before you go to bed .Reading about other people 's problems on Facebook , or Twitter is NOT going to help your mind calm down !And , speaking of negative thoughts , watch out for them and stop them whenever possible !Negative thoughts can creep in and feed off each other and soon , even if you were in a good mood earlier , now you 're just thinking of all the negativity in your life .I have a simple method that I use as often as I need to when I feel like I 'm talking too much crap to myself .As negativity is going through my head and I recognize it - I scream ( to myself ) STOP !Then try to think of something more positive .If the thought starts to creep in again , I say STOP again .And same as before try to think of something positive .I sometimes have to do this a few times , but that mental action combined with changing the activity I 'm doing will soon put me in a better mood and get me to thinking about something more positive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.67125"}

Also another big recommendation is healthy eating and serious fitness plan , start running daily , lifting weights a few time a week , and take this new fitness plan seriously .You have no idea how a healthy body can turn a sick mind into a healthy one .Most importantly call on God and humbly ask that he give you strength and ask that he take the fear away and you will see that if you believe it , than it will happen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.197235"}

{"text": "Forgiven .Restored .The shame and stigma washed away .And Jesus was n't just making it happen for the first time either .He was announcing a reality that had already come true .She was already loved , forgiven , and clean .Jesus ' words were only sealing the deal and making it real to her .She was a person with a name and dignity , no matter how hard society might try to take that away from her .Almost as soon as Jesus had said this , the room erupted into theological debate over who has the authority to announce such forgiveness .The religious machinery was hard at work , already pumping out Bible verses and quoting rabbinical commentaries on the matter .Jesus just rolled his eyes , shook his head , and looked back at her smiling .And then , leaning down to whisper in her ear while the debate raged on around them , Jesus spoke her name again and said , \" Your faith has saved you ; go in peace .\" This woman , whose name has been lost to history but was known to Jesus , was not the only one who experienced such wholeness at the feet of Jesus .There were other women among his disciples as well .We read about some of them this morning : Mary Magdalene , Joanna , and Susanna .They were an integral part of his ministry , contributing a vital part .There were men too , of course .I 've been invited by my friend Jodi Haier , a Methodist pastor , to contribute a column to a soon - to - be published group study book on Forgiveness .I have permission to publish my contribution here as a foretaste of the upcoming book .I 'll let you know when the whole study comes out .Thanks !I 've been asked to write this meditation on the subject of Forgiving God .I have until the end of the month to finish it , but I want to get it done today , not because I 'm efficient like that , but because today is April 16 , 2013 , the day after the bombing of the Boston Marathon .The main religious question that arises in times like this is : How could a loving , all - powerful God allow something like this to happen ?On days like today , it seems that God owes us an explanation ( if not an outright apology ) for standing by , silently , while some person(s ) blew up the Boston Marathon .As bizarre as it may sound , I 'm going to argue that what we need to do in this moment is forgive God .What I mean by this is that we need to adjust some of our ideas about who God is and how God works if we 're going to make sense of situations like the bombing of the Boston Marathon .Now , it just so happens that I am both a pastor and a philosophy professor , so I 'll construct my argument from both of those perspectives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.59085"}

{"text": "\" The call to Christian peacemaking is a call to trust that forgiveness is much more foundational to the fabric of the universe than retribution .We might even say that forgiveness lies at the very heart of God .Therefore , when we mere mortals choose to walk the hard road of forgiveness , we are n't just laying the foundation for greater peace in our hearts and justice in the world , we are drawing near to God .In fact , I would venture to say that we are never closer to God than when we find it in our hearts to forgive those who have sinned against us .Forgiveness is the single hardest , yet most worthwhile , calling of the spiritual life .While I was preparing for this sermon , I came across the story of Rais Bhuiyan , a gas station attendant from Bangladesh , living in Texas in 2002 .One day , he was working behind the counter when a man came in and pointed a shotgun at his face .The man with the gun asked him , \" Where are you from ? \" Before Rais could answer , the man shot him in the face at point blank range .Miraculously , he survived , although he was horribly scarred and lost his right eye .The man with the gun , Mark Stroman , had already killed two other men in the same way .Mark called himself \" the Arab Slayer \" and claimed to be carrying out these killings as vengeance for the 9/11 terrorist attacks .While he was recovering in the hospital , Rais Bhuiyan promised Allah that he would make a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca if he was allowed to live .As it turned out , Rais lived and made good on his promise to Allah .During his pilgrimage , Rais came to the conclusion that God was calling him to forgive the man who shot him .From then on , Rais formed a relationship with Mark Stroman and tried to stop his execution .\" This campaign is all about passion , forgiveness , tolerance and healing .In response to this , Mark Stroman had this to say , \" \" I tried to kill this man , and this man is now trying to save my life .This man is inspiring to me .Here it is , the attacker and the attackee , you know , pulling together .The hate has to stop - one second of hate will cause a lifetime of misery .I 've done that - it 's wrong , and if me and Rais can reach one person , mission accomplished .Ultimately , Rais Bhuiyan 's attempts to stop Mark Stroman 's execution failed and Mark was put to death by lethal injection .The article I read was published on the day he died and I was shocked when I looked up at the date it was published : July 20 , 2011 .Exactly one year to the day before James Holmes opened fire on a movie theater full of people in Aurora , Colorado .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.93708"}

{"text": "\" Sometimes I still do n't know how to take it , \" he says , \" because I have n't totally forgiven myself yet .\" No one can serve two masters , Jesus tells his audience .We ca n't serve the master of revenge while we seek to do a jig of justice .Breathe deeply .What Mary Johnson and Oshea Israel are doing is something called \" restorative justice .\" It 's a form of justice where both the victim and their offender work together to come to some point of restoration and wholeness for both of them .Will this form of justice undo what 's been done ?Right a wrong or bring back a dead family member ?No , of course not .The murder , the theft , the assault , whatever the crime is , can not be undone .But , by coming together in dialogue , the offender begins to understand the harm he has caused , while the victim , and the community or family hurt by the crime , can come to a point of closure , healing or at least understanding .Not all cases end like Johnson 's , where a killer is welcomed like a family member , but studies have shown that it can reduce fear and anger on both sides of the offense .Like the manager and the master both discovered , true peace - true justice - only comes through forgiveness - even when that forgiveness is unmerited - and even if we do n't really have the authority to bestow it .Because , what this parable teaches us is this : when we forgive , we are forgiven .The master - if he , indeed , represents God in this parable - backs us up when we forgive others .Remember , Jesus taught us to pray for God to forgive our debts , as we forgive the debts of others .We can not be truly forgiven unless we make that first move and forgive others .In that moment of forgiveness , as the Upanishads tell us , \" all separateness will fall away , \" because in forgiving we realize we are all one - all contained in that Self of the Holy .We all exist as part of the same ground of being , and forgiveness is how we heal our broken relationships to one another .Forgiveness , though , is n't easy - even if the crime committed against us is n't as horrible as a murder .We often find it hard to forgive even the smallest transgression against us .But , as this parable tells us - forgiveness really is n't a choice - it 's a necessity .We have to be able to live peaceably in this world - and we can only do it through true justice - through forgiveness .Holding on to our feelings of vengeance and refusing to forgive , however , is like caressing the table on death row - we make it all harder than it has to be .Hoping to see those who have offended us get their comeuppance is like taking rat poison and hoping the rat dies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.06726"}

{"text": "So , while the basic principle of retributive justice tends to work pretty well for most people , most of the time , it does have its limits .There comes a point when we need to go beyond it in order to serve the causes of real peace and justice .For example : what do you do when a perpetrator commits a crime so heinous that no amount of retribution can restore the balance of fairness ?I think we 're all finding ourselves in just such a situation this weekend as headlines pour in about the massacre in Colorado .12 people are dead and dozens more wounded .Even if James Holmes ( the shooter in Colorado ) was to receive the death penalty , there 's no way for him to be killed 12 times .It 's just not possible for the balance of fairness to ever be restored through retribution in a case like this one .Here is another example : what do you do when retribution brings no peace ?Larry Whicher , whose brother Alan was killed in the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995 , was present for the execution of Timothy McVeigh , the man responsible for that attack .After it was over and McVeigh was dead , Larry said , \" I expected more of a sense of closure and relief than I had .It was weird . \"\" An eye for an eye \" was not enough to serve justice and bring peace to Larry Whicher .Jesus seemed to have an inner sense that retribution was not enough to right all the wrongs of this world .In defiance of his own culture and religious tradition , he called upon his followers to move beyond the \" eye for an eye \" principle of justice .He seemed to indicate that something more is needed if people truly want to find peace in the wake of injustice .What could that \" something more \" be ?Desmond Tutu ventures a guess , drawing on his own cultural traditions .He says : .We have a had a jurisprudence , a penology in Africa that was not retributive but restorative .In the traditional setting , when people quarreled the main intention was not to punish the miscreant but to restore good relations .For Africa is concerned , or has traditionally been concerned , about the wholeness of relationship .That is something we need in our world , a world that is polarized , a world that is fragmented , a world that destroys people .It is also something we need in our families and friendships , for restoration heals and makes whole while retribution only wounds and divides us from one another .The end - result , the goal , of the justice process , according to Desmond Tutu , is not punishment but forgiveness .Justice is served and peace is found when genuine friendship between victim and offender is able to emerge .This is difficult .Forgiveness is far more difficult than mere punishment .Some might even call it impossible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.870155"}

{"text": "its actually a area with a lot of space that can fit a stadium and some parking lots .the other plan was to make the olympic / nfl stadium in flushing on top of the old shea stadium .either way both stadiums would be super accessible by public transport / foot / bike .the flushing queens location probably has the best of both worlds with large parking lots / the 7 train / easy access by foot from corona park ( which is still beautiful ) and access from major highway easily .i think soldier field , where the bears play , is a NFL stadium that is in the city , chicago , and also blends in nicely .I think it 's well established that when people can walk to the stadium , they will walk to the stadium .I think it 's well established that when people can walk to the stadium , they will walk to the stadium .That person would most likely take a cab ; and I doubt very seriously if too many SuperBowl tickets holders are likely to walk a couple miles to anywhere , least of all to a game at the Meadowlands or at Yankee Stadium .That person would most likely take a cab ; and I doubt very seriously if too many SuperBowl tickets holders are likely to walk a couple miles to anywhere , least of all to a game at the Meadowlands or at Yankee Stadium .I do n't know about all that , but like I said before , ( and you of course scoffed at ) when the game was at Ford Field , many out of town ticket holders walked from their hotels through the beautiful streets of downtown Detroit .Those who were staying at suburban hotels , many of them drove to cheaper and easier parking on the downtown fringes and took the People Mover to the game .Even rich people like to save money !Many people say that Americans do n't like to walk .I think it 's true only because in most cases we do n't have a decent place to walk .Like it said in one of the articles ( I think the one you posted ) , New Yorkers like to walk .And New York is a lovely city to walk in .Wealthy people in New York walk .Jackie O. used to walk to work .Bloomberg -- one of the ten wealthiest people in the world -- takes the subway and walks .The article says that people in New Jersey hate to walk , but most parts of New Jersey , especially around meadowlands , are lousy places to walk .all I 'm trying to say is that people everywhere are pretty much the same .Their behavior in large part is determined by the environment they live in , and especially by the infrastructure they have to deal with .The best way to change the behavior is to change the environment .Put in some sidewalks , shade trees and benches .Make the destinations closer together by eliminating some of the parking lots .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "124.92582"}
