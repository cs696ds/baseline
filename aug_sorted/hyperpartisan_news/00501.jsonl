{"text": "The Serbian government replaced local Albanian police officers with special police units from the Serbian Ministry of the Interior ( Ministarstvo Unutrasnjih Poslova ) , or MUP .The Serbian government ran Kosovo as a police state for the rest of the 1990s , with political trials , police abuse , deaths in detention , and discrimination in health care , education , and employment .Throughout the 1990s , the Kosovar Albanian community responded by creating their own parallel political structures .Under the leadership of Ibrahim Rugova , the ethnic Albanian population initially rejected a violent response to the abusive and discriminatory treatment inflicted upon them .This began to change in 1997 , when a hitherto little - known group called the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) demanded Kosovo 's independence and began to ambush and attack police patrols in various parts of Kosovo , especially in the central Drenica region .The group gradually increased its armed actions , which prompted a rapid and sometimes brutal response by the Serbian police .The first major police operations occurred in late February and early March 1998 when , after attacks by the KLA in the area , Serbian special police forces attacked three villages in Drenica , killing eighty - eight women and children .The atrocities galvanized the ethnic Albanian community , and quickly turned the KLA into a sizable , although still disorganized , military force .It was from this time on that the fighting in Kosovo became an internal armed conflict for the purposes of international law , making Common Article 3 and Protocol II of the Geneva Conventions applicable .Throughout 1998 and early 1999 , there was ongoing fighting between the KLA and Serbian and Yugoslav forces that involved serious violations of international humanitarian law by both sides .The government conducted two major counterinsurgency offensives : in May and June 1998 along the border with Albania , and July through September 1998 throughout most of central and western Kosovo .An estimated 2,000 people were killed during the year , the majority of them ethnic Albanian civilians .Throughout this period , cases of rape were also reported .By the time the bombing began in March 1999 , Sevdie Ahmeti , a human rights activist working for the Pristina - based Center for the Protection of Women and Children , had documented thirty - six incidents of rape committed by Serbian police and Yugoslav Army soldiers .9The Humanitarian Law Center also received reports of two rapes in Decani committed by Serbian police .10 OSCE - KosovoVerification Mission ( KVM ) human rights officers , who were deployed in Kosovo from November 1998 to March 1999 , also reported twenty - three rapes committed prior to the NATO intervention .In December 1998 , Human Rights Watch conducted research into rape by both the KLA and government forces .Evidence collected by Human Rights Watch , the Center for the Protectionof Women and Children , and the OSCE - KVM human rights officers suggests , however , that Serbian security forces committed rapes and other forms of sexual violence throughout 1998 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.58278"}
