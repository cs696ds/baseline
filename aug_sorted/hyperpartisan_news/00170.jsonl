{"text": "# 29 Do n't take criticism of sexism personally if you are n't sexist .Question : Why are n't more women actively involved in the skeptical community ?Answer : Because of this and this , which is sexist .Exclamation : How dare you call me sexist !I 've never done that !You are too rude to listen to .It is apparently impossible for some people to hear general advice given to a group without explicit , upfront statements that reassure them that of course they 've personally done nothing wrong and it only refers to other people in very specific ways .To have their points of view and their thoughts considered , women are asked to walk on eggshells around the feelings of men who - by their own admission - are not the people who the remarks are about .It 's a very mysterious phenomenon .Somehow it is possible for the exact rhetorical device to be employed in other contexts without individuals taking offense at having to hear it .For example , the following statements have been uttered in the skeptical community without anyone not intended to receive the advice taking offense : .Do n't drink and drive .Do n't use hand sanitizer .Do n't buy kittens from pet stores .Do n't get an adjustable rate mortgage .Do n't make claims without citing your sources .You know what does n't happen when someone who works in finance tells people to not get adjustable rate mortgages ?People with fixed rate mortgages do n't take it personally .Why not ?Because it is n't about them .They understand that the advice is for other people who have performed that behavior , and they move on .They do n't react with shock that anyone would offer the advice to not get adjustable rate mortgages without first excusing all the people who have gotten fixed rate mortgages or no mortgage at all and then complimenting those fixed rate / no mortgage people for being so wise and rational .They do n't claim to be sorely offended by being lumped in a group by the finance person with all those people who got adjustable rate mortgages .They do n't demand apologies from the super - rude financier before listening to the arguments about why adjustable rate mortgages are undesirable .They do n't suggest that if the financier wants to be taken seriously he or she better be much more polite to all those people the financier was n't talking to .The financier was n't talking to people with fixed rate mortgages .People who get fixed rate mortgages do n't have to change their behavior .Nobody assumes that the financier was talking to people who get fixed rate mortgages when the financier said to not get adjustable rate mortgages .Of course not !Because it is n't about them , and because the usage of the phrase \" people , do n't do that \" is never assumed to be directed at anyone who is n't doing that , with one exception : women telling men to change their behavior .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.81642"}

{"text": "I know this is an old thread , but I thought I 'd make a comment .I , too , have been repeatedly frustrated by this issue when my wife wanted to vent and I tried to offer advice - leading to anger and resentment on her part , and confusion on my part .There 's a fantastic short film on this called \" It 's not about the nail \" - google it and watch it if you want a great laugh .I had 2 comments : First is that , according to neurochemical studies , women 's and men 's brains respond differently to conversation .Women 's brains release oxytocin when having emotional conversations with friends - this hormone leads to feelings of bonding and closeness .Men 's brains do NOT release oxytocin upon emotional conversation - hence our confusion about why women love to talk so much , and women 's confusion of why men do n't , generally , like to talk so much .Women , in general , feel bonded due to emotional conversation , men do NOT ( in fact , we may feel somewhat nonplussed / repelled by it , in some cases ) .For those who are unfamiliar with the system , being a \" thinker \" does not mean that one does not feel , nor does being a \" feeler \" mean that one does not think .It just means which process tends to dominate our decision - making process most of the time .Now , it just so happens that , statistically , more women are primarily \" feelers \" and more men are primarily \" thinkers \" - though the reverse can also be true .Hence there is no need for the offence shown by some of the posters here that \" not all women are like that .\" Of course they are n't .But most are .Not because they are women , but because their personality type is \" feeler \" .To summarize , a woman whose personality is a \" feeler \" will likely need to vent emotionally , both due to her personality and due to her enjoyment of venting from oxytocin release .A man who is primarily a \" thinker \" will hate being on the end of that venting because he has no innate \" feel \" for emotional conversation , nor does he feel bonded afterward ( lack of oxytocin ) .Thus , the best advice I can give women who need to vent is to call your female friends - they will be better listeners and will enjoy the conversation more ( unless they are \" thinkers \" ) .Or maybe find a man who is a \" Feeler \" - though he is unlikely to be the alpha male most women are attracted to .If you go to a man who is a \" thinker \" he will try to offer you a solution , because he will think that that is why you are coming to him , and because , to him , ti is the logical thing to do .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.521126"}
