{"text": "A good vice president is loyal to his boss even when he thinks his boss is wrong .Does any of that sound like John McCain ?No way .McCain says what he wants , and does what he wants , and he says it and does it publicly .Bush wants the same kind of vice president that Ronald Reagan had : a man who neither said nor did anything memorable in eight years in office .In other words , George W. Bush wants his father .If George W. Bush were president and John McCain were his vice president , Bush would never be able to leave the White House : He 'd always be afraid that when he got back , McCain would have changed the locks .Then consider this : Why would McCain want the job ?Right now , he is one of the most sought - after personalities in America .That would end if he became vice president .Right now , even though he is a staunch Republican , he has somehow assumed the image of being \" above \" politics .And he does it by saying and doing things that politicians never do .Take his flip - flops on whether the Confederate flag should fly atop the South Carolina Statehouse .During the primary campaign in January , McCain said the flag was \" offensive \" and a \" symbol of racism and slavery . \"The next day , however , he issued a statement to South Carolina reporters reversing himself and saying the flag was a \" symbol of heritage .\" The day after that in New Hampshire , McCain said the flag was not a symbol of heritage , but , \" My forefathers fought under the Confederate flag ( and )I believe they believed their service was honorable . \"George W. Bush at least was consistent , though not courageous on the subject : He refused to get involved saying it was up to the people of South Carolina .This Wednesday , however , McCain took what may be his final position on the matter .In a speech in Columbia , S.C. , he said : \" I believe the flag should be removed from your Capitol .\" True , McCain made his statement only after the state senate voted to remove it last week , but the removal still faces opposition in the house and McCain 's opinion might have some small effect on the outcome .But why did McCain not state his true feelings during the primary ?\" I feared that if I answered honestly , I could not win the South Carolina primary , \" McCain said .\"So I chose to compromise my principles .I broke my promise to always tell the truth . \"And for good measure , McCain ( who lost the South Carolina primary anyway ) also said his ancestors \" fought on the wrong side of American history \" when they fought for the Confederacy .John McCain is a politician who talks about his mistakes , is willing to embarrass himself and is willing to tell people that he lied .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.74597"}
{"text": "The biggest is illegal immigration .McCain has a competing bill , co - sponsored with Ted Kennedy -- it is generally not a great idea for candidates seeking the Republican presidential nomination to be closely identified with the senior senator from Massachusetts -- which would allow those illegals to stay here during the process .With some justification , McCain 's opponents call it an amnesty bill , and McCain will undoubtedly pay a political price among voters who believe the real answer to the problem is stricter border enforcement .On the other hand , no other candidate will be able to please all sides on the issue , either .Another possible problem is the question of judicial nominations .\" The whole issue of judicial nominations is very , very important to Republican activists and Republican primary voters , \" the strategist says .\" I think there was a sense of betrayal among Republican activists when they saw those seven Republicans join those seven Democrats to head off the nuclear option .\" The strategist is right about the importance of the judges issue , but wrong about the Gang of 14 compromise .Yes , McCain and others agreed to preserve the Democrats ' right to filibuster .But , in return , they forced Democrats to back down on their most hated nominees : William Pryor , Janice Rogers Brown , and Priscilla Owen .And the GOP members reserved the right to break any future Democratic filibuster .That probably wo n't hurt McCain .And , with so much of the political spotlight on national security , McCain 's charisma and war record often allow him to bowl over even those Republicans who do n't like all his positions .\" While I disagree vehemently with him on many policy issues , it is thrilling to sit in his presence , \" wrote Moore . \"He is a genuine American hero and patriot in an age when heroism and patriotism have gone out of style .\" More than any other senator , McCain seems like an executive branch leader ; among the Republican field , his only real rival on that score is Rudy Giuliani .One inside - baseball indicator of McCain 's status with the Republican establishment is the fact that his campaign might -- in a development that would have been unthinkable a few years ago -- attract a few members of the Bush team .Media consultant Mark McKinnon , for one , leaves no doubt that he wants to work for McCain .\" I consider myself a friend , \" McKinnon tells me .\" I told the senator , as I told the president , that if anybody from the president 's inner circle runs -- that is , Jeb or Condi -- then I would want to support them .But , if they did n't , then I would support him .\" Of course , it 's just 2005 , and there 's no way to know what issues will be most important in 2008 or whether those issues will be friendly to McCain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.88348"}
