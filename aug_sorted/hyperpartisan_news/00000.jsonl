{"text": "University of Johannesburg professors rejected propsal , endorsed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu , to cut ties with Ben - Gurion University .University of Johannesburg professors rejected calls to sever ties with an Israeli university Wednesday , but called on Ben - Gurion University to work with its Palestinian counterparts .The South African university 's faculty senate met Wednesday to vote on the proposal , which had been endorsed by anti - apartheid icon Archbishop Desmond Tutu , but instead accepted a compromise without a vote .They asked Ben - Gurion University to work with Palestinian universities on research projects , and to start the collaborations within six months if it wants to maintain ties with the University of Johannesburg .UJ Vice Chancellor Adam Habib said the compromise reflected his institution 's values .\" We believe in reconciliation , \" Habib said .\" We 'd like to bring BGU and Palestinian universities together to produce a collective engagement that benefits everyone .\" The universities have joint research projects and academic exchanges on biotechnology and water purification .Relations between Ben - Gurion University and Rand Afrikaans University , a formerly all - white university under South Africa 's apartheid system , began in 1987 .The University of Johannesburg , created in 2005 , took over various campuses including Rand Afrikaans University and a university in the black township of Soweto as part of efforts to ensure higher education was transformed with the rest of South Africa after the end of apartheid .Israel officially opposed apartheid , but its ties with the white government were seen as close .South Africa 's post - apartheid government has been a sharp critic of Israel 's Palestinian policies .The late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was among the guests at Nelson Mandela 's 1994 inauguration as South Africa 's first black president .Tutu and more than 200 prominent South African academics had supported ending UJ 's links with the Israeli institution .Academic boycotts of Israeli universities have been inspired by boycotts of South African institutions during apartheid .Elvis has left the building .I have yet to make my mind up about the BDS ( Boycott - Divestment - Sanctions ) option against Israel .It seems like I have a different opinion about it every other day .What I do feel lately , though , is that it 's just not time yet for BDS , especially when no real effort to put political\\diplomatic pressure has ever taken place , neither by Europe and particularly the U.S.This route , in my opinion , should be exhausted first , and if and when this fails -- it may be time to think about BDS .As some of you may know , Elvis Costello recently cancelled his gig in Israel .I did n't buy a ticket for this one , but I can understand a lot of the anger out there .It 's not cool to book a concert , sell every ticket , and then cancel for political reasons .Then again , the occupation is n't too \" cool \" either .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.78824"}
{"text": "For the time being , mainstream Israeli figures are condemning both boycotts .\" Culture is a bridge in society , and political disputes should be left outside cultural life and art , \" Israel 's minister of culture and sport , Limor Livnat , said in response to the theater boycott .The latest boycott call came after several Israeli theater companies announced plans to stage productions at a new theater in Ariel , a Jewish city of 20,000 in the West Bank .The $ 10 million cultural center in Ariel , which was built partly with government funding , is scheduled to open Nov. 8 .It will be the first major theater in a Jewish settlement , most of which are smaller bedroom communities .As the theater schedule came to light , nearly 60 Israeli theater professionals signed a petition last weekend saying they would refuse to perform at the new venue or in any West Bank settlement .On Tuesday , about 150 academics and authors signed a letter supporting the petition .\" We will not take part in any kind of cultural activity beyond the Green Line , take part in discussions and seminars , or lecture in any kind of academic setting in these settlements , \" the letter said .\" My contract with the theater says explicitly that I am obligated to perform within the State of Israel - and Ariel is not part of the state , \" director and actor Oded Kotler , a boycott petition signer , told Army Radio .The Ariel boycott call follows on the heels of a call to boycott Ben - Gurion University issued by the campus group I m Tirtzu , which says that professors in the university 's department of politics and government harbor anti - Zionist biases and are silencing students ' Zionist viewpoints .Neve Gordon , the head of the university 's department of politics and government , has called for a \" social , economic and political boycott of Israel . \"University President Rivka Carmi condemned Gordon 's call but has not dismissed the department chief .\" The fact that I condemn his statements does n't mean I can fire him , \" she told the Jerusalem Post .\" You can not fire someone for their political opinions . \"University spokesman Amir Rozenblit said that the university complies with the quality and content requirements of the Israeli Council for Higher Education , and that it hires faculty members based solely on their professional and academic qualifications , not political opinions .I m Tirtzu 's threat to approach Ben - Gurion University donors for failing to dismiss its \" anti - Zionist \" staff prompted some I m Tirtzu supporters in the United States to rethink their support for the organization .Meanwhile , Ben - Gurion University condemned the boycott call by I m Tirtzu .\" Just as university president Prof. Rivka Carmi harshly condemned those who called for an international boycott of Israel , so too the university denounces any group that calls for a boycott of any Israeli university based on the opinions of its academic faculty members , \" Rozenblit said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.95041"}
