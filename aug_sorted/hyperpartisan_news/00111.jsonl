{"text": "The entire experience of working with photographers and filmmakers has confirmed my belief in the value of collaborative anthropological research projects , which draw on the skills of people from all kinds of backgrounds .Before last week I was hesitant about conducting research that involved taking photos and making films , but now I honestly ca n't imagine doing research without it .I have passed the 10 month point in fieldwork where I am perhaps getting a bit too comfortable with being in Trinidad .Like hundreds of thousands of Trinidadians this month , all my responsibilities and commitments have come second to the greatest show on earth : Carnival .Although Carnival is the height of the Trinidadian calendar year , it is experienced by Trinidadians is different ways .It 's a strategy that has worked , thousands of tourists come each year paying up to \u00a3 6000 to ' play ' mas with the biggest and most popular groups , or as they 're locally known , bands .There were elements of theatre , Amerindian ritual and African dancing and drumbeats and costumes were embodiments of political commentary that mocked upper classes or foreign influences such as American seamen who were based in Trinidad in the Second World War .Many people tend to agree that mas had political potential and social commentary .But what of it today ?February has been a rich month for fieldwork as everybody has an opinion on Carnival .Common discourse and normative values emphasise that contemporary Carnival is vulgar , it 's not really Trinidadian , all the wining ( a dance where the main movement is gyrating the hips ) and carrying on is indecent .A lot of women agree with this view , but it is undeniable that each year , hundreds of thousands of Trinidadian women play mas .I have been discussing this with Dr Dylan Kerrigan at the University of the West Indies , a fellow anthropologist who has expertise on gender , masculinities and Carnival .We agree that Carnival has retained fractions of its potential for political subversion , perhaps now , not along the lines of race and class , but along the lines of gender .Carnival is the month of the year when a woman of any background , age and race can be extremely scantily clad , dance with whoever she likes and you do n't hear a peep from male onlookers or spectators .Yet , purchasing the space for freedom has an explicit economic dimension , paying for the pre - Carnival parties ( fetes ) and to play mas with big bands with their own food , drinks , portable bathrooms and security is an investment for a fun ( safe ) time .The demarcation of expensive fetes and bands makes sure that people of certain levels of society remain in their respective groupings .The one big contradiction to the prestige of going to expensive fetes and playing with big bands is that at this time of year , banks give special loans just for Carnival .People save money over a year ( or two ) or take out loans to visibly occupy spaces they do n't the rest of the year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.50607"}
