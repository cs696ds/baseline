{"text": "But now , as we see another attack initiated , President Obama has held back , unlike the past candidate Obama .So why ?My view is that Obama does n't believe Biden picked the best fight in the best time .In a time where the Oval Office is already juggling domestic and international congressional problems , as well as the new policies trying to are trying to implemented , most of the official word coming out of the White House has been positive .And because of this , the right wing is more or less starved of talking points to get out into the press - as they would be taken second stage to the President 's news , which is essentially flowing out in a more of less politically healthy way .So now that something has indeed come out as an attack , I was n't exactly surprised to see a response from the unofficial GOP within the day .Karl Rove , whether himself or a PR coordinator , sensed that this was the loophole that was exactly what they needed and politically pounced on it .And it was in fact a good idea .Vice President Biden does in fact have a reputation of both sides of the aisle of stretching the truth , and I am more than assured that this alleged \" conversation \" did not exist .And because of this exaggeration and Rove 's seasoned ability to pounce , he has created a handle for the White House in the GOP - Joe Biden 's mouth .But again , there are many ways to play something like this , so I 'll open this up to the commenters : Where was Obama in this exchange , and why did he stay out of it ?November 1 , 2008 .On the morning of August 20 , Barack Obama and John McCain were in a virtual dead heat for the White House .Obama was five days away from the Democratic Nation Convention , where his campaign hoped to put in a press swing that would ride him through the GOP 's Convention .He was also riding up attention for his extremely anticipated Vice Presidential decision , as his anxious base and the country alike stood at a standstill .But as the infamous truth holds , none of this essentially played out - Sarah Palin was standing in the way .Blanketing world news , Palin 's entrance to the global stage both wiped clean any and all publicity from Obama 's historic convention and in doing so started a \" press wildfire , \" exploding into the media for weeks , then months .But now , as we look back on late August , the daunting shadow in our minds looms between McCain , the press , and the oval office - the polls .Gone from a dead heat to a widening eight point Obama lead , McCain 's promising late August media swing has seemed to backfire .And as early ballots begin storming in , the McCain campaign finds themselves in a run against the media , the independents , and finally , against Sarah Palin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.11096"}

'Nevertheless , Congress and the Supreme Court have concluded that embarrassment - related concerns must give way to the greater interest in allowing aggrieved parties to pursue their claims .Courts have long recognized the difficulties of proving sexual harassment in the work place , inasmuch as improper or unlawful behavior often takes place in private .To excuse a party who lied or concealed evidence on the ground that the evidence covered only ' personal ' or ' private ' behavior would frustrate the goals that Congress and the courts have sought to achieve in enacting and interpreting the Nations 's sexual harassment laws .That is particularly true when the conduct that is being concealed -- sexual relations in the workplace .between a high official and a young subordinate employee -- itself conflicts with those goals .Second .The second limit was imposed when Judge Wright required disclosure of the precise information that is in part the subject of this hearing today .A federal judge specifically ordered the President , on more than one occasion , to provide the requested information about relationships with other women , including Ms. Lewinsky .The fact that Judge Wright later determined that the evidence would not be admissible at trial , and still later granted judgment in the President 's favor , does not change the President 's legal duty at the time he testified .Like every litigant , the President was entitled to object to the discovery questions , and to seek guidance from the court if he thought those questions were improper .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.65694"}
