Marshall 's 1950 work , Citizenship and Social Class , in which he traces the development of citizenship from an emphasis on civil , to political , and finally to social rights by the twentieth century .25 Despite the confusion in terms , what Marshall defined as social rights were the driving force behind the civil rights movement of the fifties and sixties , with its push for social equality to accompany legal enfranchisement .The movement decried the hypocrisy of a system that purported to be equal while denying rights to many based on race and ethnicity .Rogers M.

{"text": "Key to this was the belief of both independentistas and mainland civil rights activists that their struggles were two components of a much larger battle against U.S. imperialism in the developing world .This belief led to expressions of solidarity with anti - colonial and Third World national liberation movements around the world , but it also helped to establish and strengthen ties between the two halves of the Puerto Rican population .The close ties forged between the two camps at the time were predicated upon the understanding that the experience of both groups was rooted in the island 's colonial status and the second - class citizenship that it conferred .Independentistas rejected citizenship that was fundamentally limited by the inability to vote .Denied a say in matters of state , they questioned the legality of their obligation to participate in a war for which they had never given consent .The draft became a tool by which they denounced their citizenship , presenting it as further 112 evidence of their colonial condition .Mainlanders were able to vote , but their struggle was no less about citizenship : their fight for social rights was a fight to define what it meant to be an American citizen who was denied the benefits of that citizenship .They asked the same question as civil rights leaders , black power activists , and Puerto Rican independentistas : What was the meaning of citizenship that was inherently unequal ?The Puerto Rican experience speaks to the complexities of citizenship .It reminds us of the continued relevance of classic interpretations while also giving weight to new perspectives .The traditional interpretation views conscription as an obligation of citizenship , a duty performed in exchange for rights .Using Marshall 's theory of citizenship as a set of civil , political and social rights , it is clear that on neither the island nor the mainland was the pact of citizenship fulfilled .In neither case was the sacrifice of Puerto Ricans rewarded with full rights .The draft thus provides evidence that Puerto Rican citizenship was , in fact , second - class .To the independence movement , it was more than that : it was further evidence of their colonial status .It is also useful to apply Suzanne Oboler 's definition of citizenship as a lived experience - an experience shaped by different contexts .While citizenship on the island was most clearly experienced as a legal and political institution , those in the continental United States experienced their citizenship in more informal ways .The discrimination they suffered was not legal , but it was enacted by people on a day - to - day basis .But perhaps citizenship was experienced most profoundly by those who were drafted to fight in Vietnam .They lived their citizenship every day that they were in the war , subject to discrimination by the same state that obligated them to fight .Racial discrimination was a key part of the Puerto Rican experience during the war .For those on the mainland , it was part of everyday life , and it became that for many of the Puerto 113 Rican soldiers who fought in Vietnam .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.28154"}

{"text": "As I say in the book , I find heterosexual culture quite distasteful and I would never , ever want to be straight .So if some men who have sex with men want to identify as straight , I hardly think that allowing them to stew in the juices of heteronormativity is a reward .How does whiteness / white privilege function for your argument and for the men you write about ?Does whiteness offer greater permission for them to have sex with other men without losing their status as straight ?JW : Yes , this is precisely what I argue in the book .In the last fifteen years or so , social scientists , public health workers , and journalists have been quite interested in straight men 's homosexual encounters , but this interest has centered almost entirely on Black men .Black men \" on the down low , \" regardless of their own self - identifications , have been characterized as closeted gay or bi men who lie to women about their sex with men - and therefore represent a serious public health threat .Many commentators have suggested that when straight - identified Black men have sex with men , it has everything to do with race .Most often , the argument is that Black culture is so hyper - homophobic that Black men can not be honest about their ostensibly real sexual orientations .Many scholars working in Black queer studies , like C. Riley Snorton and Jeffrey McCune , have offered brilliant critiques of this discourse .I hope my book adds to those critiques by pointing to the ways that white men have completely flown under the radar of these discussions about sex between straight - identified men .Psychologists and sexologists have been much more generous and forgiving with their interpretations of straight white men 's homosexual encounters , allowing for the possibility that they are developmental , circumstantial , and compelled - and therefore not indicators of straight white men 's sexual essence .And certainly no one has suggested that when straight white men have sex with men , these encounters might be happening in racialized ways that are specific to white culture !But of course , they are , and I offer numerous examples .Does your book show that straight men 's sexuality is more flexible than commonly thought ?JW : It seems straight men will never be tired of the girl - girl fantasy , and I think that 's precisely the point .We are inundated with images of straight women in sexual scenarios with other women because these images appeal to many heterosexual men .So it 's generally much easier for people to see how girl - girl sex might , in some cases , be about heterosexuality more than it is about lesbianism .But mention the possibility of straight dude - on - dude action , and you 're met with guffaws .Straight men deny that it happens , and gay and bi men seem to want to claim that even a single sexual fantasy about another man signals a tortured life in the closet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.97666"}

{"text": "Human variability does not admit of either clarity or precision , yet it structures our social relations and causes , or excuses , oppression .And miscegenation has not always led to an elimination of categories of difference , as much Latin American history reveals , but more often to their proliferation into more variegated maps with hierarchies intact .Conclusions .So what can be learned from the debate over ethnic differences within the category of blackness and from Richard Rodriguez ' ruminations on brown identity ?Several observations can be made .Perhaps most obvious is that we are living through a cultural moment of profound transformation in the way our society thinks about , conceptualizes , and categorizes racial and ethnic identities .The black / white binary is undergoing deconstruction , the assumed homogeneity of blackness is undergoing transformation , and the way in which Latino identity relates to either ethnicity or racial categories is up for debate .Obviously , the epiphanies people are having about the complexity of all these categories are not equally shared : some groups have been thinking and living these complexities for some time , while others are new to the whole discussion .Yet the fact that the current moment is one of debate , transformation , and no small amount of confusion means that perhaps philosophers might make a real world difference if we can use our skills to help clarify the options .A second observation is that the weight of old ideologies can be seen pulling heavily on the attempts at new thinking and new categories .Rodriguez may look as if he is queering brownness , or using brownness to queer race , and thus providing a sophisticated new take on the postmodern fluidity of identity formations .However , what I have tried to show in my reading is that white supremacy still structures his aesthetic .Whiteness as the freedom to forget the past , and to ignore its effects on the political economy of the present , is the only ideal he can imagine .But this is not an equal opportunity ideal .I would also suggest that the sort of concern about who is benefiting from affirmative action that motivated the first half of this paper - the concern that would circumscribe reparations within a nationalist framework that stops at the border - is also weighed down by old ideologies .Nonwhite third world peoples coming to the United States out of economic desperation have a long and complicated historical tie to the United States government and multi - nationals ; very few are genuinely new to the adverse effects of this orbit of power .What I ultimately want to argue for , then , may appear to go against the grain of much common sense thinking , but I think it is our best plan .What I want to argue for is identity proliferation , which is what some people see as analogous in its harm to nuclear proliferation .Would n't it be better , some think , to stem the tide of identity categories , if not immigration , and adopt either a racial eliminativism or some pan - national or otherwise amorphous category like \" brown \" under which we can all be subsumed ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.79341"}

Georas have analyzed the way in which Caribbean immigrants negotiate the racial categories of the U.S. after their arrival to the New York metropolitan area .Their study indicates how U.S. racial categories can erase the otherwise salient ethnic differences among people of color , but also how various ethnic identities can offset the impact of certain kinds of racisms .Thus , they show how the available categories of social identity can have real material effects .For example , they argue that . \" In many instances the racism experienced by Afro - Puerto Ricans is more profound than that experienced by lighter Puerto Ricans .This highlights the social rather than biological character of racial classifications .\" Their claim here is that the ethnic ( or national ) category \" Puerto Rican \" has become racialized in the sense that it has come to signify shared essential and inherent traits .Certain negative traits are essentialized across the identity category of \" Puerto Rican \" in the same way that so - called \" racial traits \" are essentialized across racial groups .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.66137"}

{"text": "While panic over juvenile delinquency had already taken shape by the 1950s , it was the 1959 case of Salvador \" Capeman \" Agron that helped to solidify the image of Puerto Ricans as urban gangsters .Agron , a Puerto Rican teen of questionable intelligence , stabbed two white teens to death on a New York City playground after mistaking them for members of a rival gang .The highly- sensationalized case seemed to confirm the most damaging misconceptions about Puerto Rican youth .171 Following the Capeman murders , two films were produced that helped to further cement the image of the Puerto Rican youth as gangster : West Side Story and Young Savages , both released in 1961 .The films marked the evolution of the bandido figure to the urban gangster , who favoured the switchblade over his gun .172 It is hard to overstate the significance of West Side Story in constructing the popular image of Puerto Ricans in the United States .The film won ten Academy Awards and remains a classic of American cinema to this day .It was also one of the earliest depictions of Puerto Rican characters in U.S. pop culture .Earlier figures can be found , such as Morales in Blackboard Alexandria Brown , \" Delinquent Citizens : Nation and Identity in Chicano / a and Puerto Rican Urban Narratives \" ( PhD diss . , Ohio State University , 1998 ) , 62 .170 Bender , 4 & 11 - 14 .172 Bender , 5 .58 Jungle , whose struggles with the English language relegate him to the traditional role of the buffoon , but West Side Story was among the first - and easily the most widely watched - films to feature Puerto Ricans as prominent characters .Although its popularity is undeniable , the film has failed to achieve consensus among Puerto Rican critics , who remain divided over its impact on their image in American society .Supporters of the film claim that it is a tale about overcoming racism and violence .A modern take on Romeo and Juliet , the story revolves around the young and beautiful Maria , recently arrived from Puerto Rico , and Tony , a former gang member who has recently gone straight .Maria is the sister of Bernardo , the leader of a Puerto Rican gang called the Sharks , who just so happen to be the rivals of Tony 's former gang , the Jets , which is composed of an amalgam of other ( white ) immigrant groups .Maria and Tony 's love transcends the racial tensions that are rampant on the west side of Manhattan , but ultimately it is not enough to overcome the violence of their neighbourhood streets .In Immigration and American Popular Culture , Rachel Rubin and Jeffrey Melnick point out that the \" cross - the - tracks \" love story has been a popular device in American culture to confront social tensions , promoting the idea that such problems can be overcome by love .173 Yet , the emphasis on interracial love and the melodrama that surround it have failed to deter many of its critics from arguing that West Side Story is an essentially racist tract .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.940254"}

{"text": "Pressing the question of difference within a category might be motivated by either ontological or moral or , what is most likely , both types of considerations .Of course , one might ask whether the law is a fine enough instrument to be able to parse out such distinctions as might be necessary if we want to achieve more ontological adequacy and moral fairness .The law seems more like a blunt instrument , handy and dangerous in equal measure .Further , I would argue that the questions of social ontology and moral significance - although they are conceptually distinct questions - cannot be completely disentangled , given the normative implications that follow from our formulation of the ontological tasks before us .How hard we will want to work the distinctions of social ontology , for example , will mostly depend on their moral implications .Let me make one further preparatory note : I am going to approach the ontological questions primarily through considerations of sociological positionality and political practice , which is something philosophers rarely do and requires some explanation .I believe we can discern the contours of our present day social ontologies precisely through this lens of empirical based practical analysis and sociological ethnographies .3 Given that ethnicity and race only figure as social kinds of entities , I suggest that we can learn about what they are from how they operate in communities and what effects they have on practice .In other words , given that their only locus of existence is the social realm , which includes practices , structures , and beliefs , we must look to find them here , and not in an imagined pre - social realm through intuition or conceptual analysis .4 Empirical based analysis may not yield an exhaustive or completely adequate account , but it is indispensable in order to draw out important aspects of the social ontology of race , ethnicity , and their interrelations .I will not take up here the general ontological questions about whether \" race \" or \" ethnicity \" are legitimate or meaningful categories , since I have addressed each of these questions in previously published work .All of this is true despite the fact that race is a historically variable phenomenon and subject to change .But changing the meanings of race is not susceptible to individual agency , only collective .( An individual might try to surgically alter their appearance , but this in itself does nothing to alter racialized categories , and probably simply reinforces their power ) .In contrast to race , I will take ethnic terms as principally referring to groups that are demarcated by historical events , cultural practices , and structural formations , rather than by the phenomenological experience of identities that are marked on the body .Ethnic terms signify a group 's relationship to historical experiences and cultural practices , and they are indicated more by practices than by physical appearance .Ethnic identities are \" real \" despite the fact that such narratives and practices are endlessly subject to reinterpretation and change .6 I.

{"text": "The lesson of Huntington is that Mexican ethnicity is really a race : it is unchangeable and has set features that have to be left behind because they can not be reformed .Both of these lessons support the claim of Grosfoguel and Georas that at least some ethnic categories are racialized , subjecting all members of the group to racial essentialism .What does this merger of race and ethnicity indicate in regard to our two questions about the social ontology and moral significance of differences within racial and ethnic categories ?It suggests , oddly , that some ethnicities experience racism .This would mean that the difference that ethnicity makes within a race ( as in Afro - Puerto Rican or Jamaican ) may not always remove or decrease racism because racism is attached to the ethnicity itself .Such a locution requires an account of racism that would not make all racism supervenient on anti - black racism , but that would understand racism as the idea that essentialized traits are traceable to a variety of physical features or to genealogical origin .That is , although \" Puerto Rican \" is a nationality and an ethnic term of identity , operationally , it signifies race in a way that is not the case for all other ethnic terms , such as \" French \" or \" Danish . \"Thus , before the biological conception of race emerged ( some say , with Kant ) with an explanation of the intractability of traits , cultural identity groups carried the weight of these claims of inherence .Now let me return to the Grosfoguel and Georas study for a different , and what might seem , an opposing argument .18 Grosfoguel and Georas thus argue overall that , \" The Jamaican 's community 's strategy was to emphasize ethnic over racial identity .The fact that Jamaicans were not subsumed under the categorization ' African American ' avoided offsetting the positive impact of their skilled background .\" Here we have a different lesson about difference : that ethnic differences can help some groups to alter their class or labor market position and to offset anti - black racism .Perhaps Jamaican ethnicity is still being racialized , but in a different way than non - Caribbean African - Americans are racialized .Of course , the empirical studies of Grosfoguel and Georas that I 've cited ( which are only a small part of their larger empirical work ) are meant to be more illustrative than conclusive .How far can we generalize from the case of Jamaicans in post-1965 New York ?Certainly , their success in altering their class position in New York may not be replicable in every part of the country , say , just to make a wild guess , Mississippi .This would again need empirical study , but in some contexts anti - black racism may simply trump every other group or individual feature .Also what is clearly important in this case study is the class status of this particular immigrant generation , without which the difference of accent alone may well have been insufficient to maintain an ethnic distinction in the eyes of white or non - black employers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.71581"}

Lacy and Kent A. Ono , scholars seek to examine the complicated and contradictory terrain of racial rhetoric , critiquing our depictions of race in innovative and exciting ways .In the powerful first chapter , Michael G. Lacy and Kathleen C.

After that , the British took control of what had once been Herero lands .This was the first genocide of the 20 th -century .If the Herero genocide is more obscure today than the Armenians ' , it may be because of race , location , and geopolitics .It is wonderful that we have , in the Armenian case , monuments and memorials commemorating white people who were targeted for extermination partly because the Turks wanted their land .At the same time , we should remember these black people who were targeted for extermination because Germany wanted African land .Genocide denial comes in many forms .We are familiar with the brazen dismissals of Holocaust deniers .We are also familiar with Turkish insistence that their country did nothing but \" relocate \" the Armenians .A more subtle but equally insidious form of erasure is genocide denial by default - by inadvertence or ignorance .Unfortunately , the Pope 's claim that the Armenian genocide was \" the first genocide of the 20 th -century \" marginalizes and ignores the near - extinction of the Herero .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.4949"}

{"text": "If more people build multiparent families , the idea that a child can have no more than two legal parents may shift , unevenly , as more legal challenges emerge and as the law catches up to social reality .In fact , a couple of years ago , California passed a law that family courts can ( but are not required to ) recognize more than two legal parents of a child if they think it will protect the child from detriment .That 's a big , if cautious , change in the law .I 'm not a great prognosticator , but I think it will be a long time before legal recognition of multiparent families really takes hold , partly because it calls up the specter of polygamy , around which the prohibition still seems to be very strong .Social class stratification casts a dark shadow on the process of who is an egg donor ( young and educated ) versus who is the gestational carrier ( often poorer and less educated ) , and on who can access assisted reproduction technologies .How can we ensure that this new form of family making does not take advantage of financially disadvantaged women and serve only economically privileged people ?In the narrower realm of family and reproductive policy , and in the shorter term , I think we need greater regulation of assisted reproduction markets - the sociologist France Winddance Twine advocates for a transnational regulatory agency .To equalize access to assisted reproduction technologies , we need government policies that subsidize costs of those technologies for people who can not afford them .Many states and countries give priority to married , heterosexual couples during the process of adoption .Yet there are many women who wish to be single mothers and gay singles and gay couples that wish to adopt .Your book includes the moving story of a woman who had to hide the fact that she was in a lesbian relationship to adopt her child internationally .What reasoning leads to this discriminatory practice and how can we enact change ?Besides some degree of good , old - fashioned anti - gay and anti - woman animus , I think the reasoning behind this kind of discrimination is the belief that the best situation for a child is to be raised by a man and a woman in a stable , intact household .So women pursuing parenthood solo ( and men , too , though there are fewer of those ) and same - sex couples face the same stigma : they are n't making the kind of family other people think kids ought to have .Adoption policies and agency practices , everyday disapproval , and sometimes also the decisions of birth mothers , reflect this belief .It feels to many people like common sense , but it turns out that the research on children of single parents and same - sex parents refutes it .So part of the regulation of international and domestic adoption ought to be rooting out such discrimination .If people are genuinely concerned about the fate of children their energy should go towards policies that support rather than stigmatize parents - such as affordable childcare , minimum wage increase , paid family leave , and the like .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.156906"}

{"text": "It also seems that when people know our story , it opens up the conversation because we embody some mix of biological and social that does n't fit with their ideas of what constitutes real kin .What do you think about the commercialization of family formation ?Does building a family through commercial exchanges - paying egg donors or gestational surrogates , paying adoption agencies and lawyers - represent the encroachment of a market mentality into aspects of intimate life that had previously been insulated from commercial forces ?Short answer : Yes .That can be troubling and sometimes creepy .In many places , in fact , commercial surrogacy is banned outright as \" baby selling , \" but it 's pretty rare to find people treating family formation like a trip to the supermarket .As the stories in Modern Families attest , commercialization can also be the means of access to family - making for people that would otherwise be excluded , to make the process more legible to all its participants , and to facilitate new sorts of kinship relationships .The bigger problem , I think , is that market - based family formation is under - regulated , leaving too much room for abuse and exploitation , and that access is still restricted to the few who can afford it .You write that your baby , like every other baby , \" was a creature of a particular political moment .\" What do you mean ?What I mean is that although making a family feels to many people like a private activity that is outside of power relations , it never is .For instance , women 's decisions about reproduction - whether , how , when to have a child - are shaped by their access to contraception , abortion , health care , and so on , all of which are themselves shaped by gender and race politics and by government actions .Access to assisted reproduction technologies is , at this point , restricted mainly to the economically privileged , and surrogacy is subject to a patchwork of contradictory laws .International adoption is structured by global economic inequalities , and intra- and inter - country politics , and domestic adoption by social class inequaly and family policy .Anti - gay prejudices , bias against single people , and racism continue to inform both government and private agency policies .These are the unavoidable - though changeable - political structures in which we all make family .The idea that people who choose to get married , make a family , or both - gay or straight - are somehow more deserving than those who do n't needs to be addressed head - on and resisted .We need a more expansive understanding of kinship , more expansive kinship structures , and more reproductive freedom , not just new versions of old hierarchies .Institutional structures and legal reality dictates that a child can have no more than two legal parents .Do you think society and the law will start recognizing multiparent families ?Actually , I think society already recognizes some multiparent families without really calling them that : families in which parents have divorced and recoupled , so that the kids wind up with three or four parents raising them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.73358"}
