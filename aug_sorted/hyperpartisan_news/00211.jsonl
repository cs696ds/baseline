Chuck Graham , who is wheelchair - bound , to \" stand up . \"Also during the 2008 presidential campaign , he called Obama the first \" articulate and bright and clean \" African American man to run for president .Biden also botched Obama 's last name , introducing him as \" Barack America , \" at his first rally as Obama 's running mate .Later he handed John McCain one of his main anti - Obama talking points when he suggested that Obama would face an international crisis in the beginning of his presidency .During a 2010 St. Patrick 's Day celebration at the White House , Biden asked for God 's blessing for the Irish prime minister 's late mother - even though she was very much alive .Creeping on women : Biden is known for his enthusiasm for campaigning and pressing the flesh .This has occasionally been a problem when it comes to women .For example : .Anita Hill and the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings : In 1991 , Biden , as chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee , presided over the controversial confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas , nominated by President George H.W. Bush to sit on the Supreme Court .Law professor Anita Hill alleged that Thomas sexually harassed her when she was one of his employees , and this charge became a central focus of those hearings .Biden was widely criticized for his treatment of Hill during the sessions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.13123"}

Burwell , of course , can be considered \" liberal , \" which clearly shows why I can not really consider myself to be either \" conservative \" or \" liberal .\" I see the King decision as misguided , while the Obergefell decision as a positive step forward in granting rights to an often - denigrated group of people .So my reaction to these two \" liberal \" decisions is quite different .First of all , this decision does not - as many opponents claim - \" redefine marriage .\" Marriage is still the union of two people who love each other into a household .All that changed is that couples who were denied that right now have it .And second , this decision does not infringe on anyone 's religious freedom .( Many rabbis , of course , do perform same - sex weddings , as well as interfaith ones ; Jewish positions on both of these vary .But those who will not , may continue to refuse . )As to bakers , florists , etc . , I wonder how many of them insist even now that the people to whom they provide services be legitimately married .Do they check the marriage licenses of the couples ?If anyone wanted to order a wedding cake from a baker , would the baker refuse to provide one if the customer is not really getting married ?I doubt it .I doubt that he would even check if a couple that happens to be too closely related , in violation of the Bible , ordered a wedding cake , or even if a man and woman who really do not seriously intend to marry do so .Yesterday the Supreme Court ruled on King v.

{"text": "Actually , the key there is whether this is a change .I would maintain that , since the Constitution does not have a definition of \" natural born citizen , \" Congress is acting within its rights , merely clarifying the Constitution 's specification of eligibility .But , as Williamson points out , \" shall be considered as natural born citizens \" is not the same as \" are natural born citizens .\" But why say \" shall be considered as \" rather than \" are ?\" If the statute were to read , \" And the children of citizens of the United States ... are natural born citizens , \" then no question would remain about Cruz 's eligibility .Does this statute create a \" naturalized at birth \" citizen separate from a \" natural born \" citizen , with the one being \" considered as \" the other ?Is there a distinction there ?Or does \" shall be considered as \" equal to \" are , \" relegating the concept of \" naturalized at birth , \" in an instance such as this , to mythology ?In fact , this is a question that could only be settled by the Supreme Court .And the Supreme Court never gives advisory opinions .A court case would have to be raised , and this could only take place after Cruz were nominated and elected , because the Court does not rule on hypotheticals .This in turn raises a question : who would raise a case ?Some might say the Democrats .But in that situation , even if Cruz were ruled ineligible , this would simply make his vice - presidential nominee the President - not a very satisfactory outcome for a Democrat !In any case , even if a Court case were to be set up , what would the Court do ?Chief Justice Roberts went on to say that the penalty for failing to carry insurance met the criteria for a tax .Because of the court 's duty to defer to the elected branches when possible , the mandate must be upheld , he wrote .Neither the label of \" penalty \" nor the fact it was intended to influence behavior mattered , he wrote .The penalty functioned like a tax - and other taxes , such as those on cigarettes , are enacted principally to create incentives rather than raise revenue , he said .Note the words \" the court 's duty to defer to the elected branches when possible .\" I believe that in a challenge to ine eligibility of Ted Cruz , Congress 's right to define \" natural born citizen \" would be upheld .So the question of Cruz 's ineligibility is really a non - starter .I see him as a very poor choice , though if he is nominated against Hillary Clinton he will get my vote in November , mostly because his direction for the country is closer than hers to what I would like to see .He has no political experience ( which his supporters see as a positive ! and seems not to understand the Constitution ( based on some of his proposals ) , and thus I see him as really poorly qualified for the office of the Presidency .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.89828"}
{"text": "\" The medieval Church kept everyone in line , monarchs and people alike , as firmly as it could .It did exercise a brake on the powers of the secular rulers .( One famous example : King Henry II of England felt that he had to submit to the humiliating punishment imposed on him by Pope Alexander III for letting his knights murder Archbishop Thomas Becket in 1170 . )But it is also true that the secular rulers exercised a brake on the power of the Church .There was a long sustained secular - papal power struggle ( manifested notably , for instance , between the Pope - supporting Guelphs and the Emperor - supporting Ghibellines in Italy , a struggle that lasted from the 12th to the 15th centuries ) .The Church or the belief in a Heavenly Judge had nothing whatever to do with English kings accepting that the law was above them .Magna Carta held them to it , and it was issued by King John in 1215 without any help from the Church .Mandel seems to be trying to build a case - which he touches on by mentioning the Founders , but then wanders off it - that the liberty - enshrining Constitution of the United States was a product of the religiousness of those who framed it .The Constitution itself said no such thing .Individuals among the framers may have thought they were carrying out their God 's will when they wrote it - who can know ?But what is certain is that they were inspired by the secular ideas of the Enlightenment - ideas which broke the power of the Churches forever .With all due respect to Edmund Burke - it was especially in post - French Revolution European and American politics that religion had no significant role .If rulers are to be restrained by anything , it must be by the people they rule : by the democratic process that Mandel himself refers to .\" God \" is superfluous to democracy , to justice , and to freedom .In his - ie the Church 's - long reign over Europe , there was no democracy , no justice , and no freedom .And wherever else religion dominates to this day , there is only oppression , injustice , subjugation and fear .The imperial Presidency has overturned Congress and the law again .Not content to stop at rewriting immigration policy , education policy and energy policy , yesterday , President Obama 's Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) released an official policy directive rewriting the welfare reform law of 1996 .The new policy guts the federal work requirements that were the foundation of the Clinton - era reform .Welfare reform replaced the old Aid to Families with Dependent Children with a new program , Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) . ...The whole point was that able - bodied adults should be required to work or prepare for work as a condition of receiving welfare aid .This reform was very successful .TANF became the only welfare program ( out of more than 70 ) that promoted greater self - reliance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.87014"}
