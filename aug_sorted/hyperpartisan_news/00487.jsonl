'People of non - monotheistic faiths , pagans , or atheists were simply to be exterminated .Dhimmis were excluded from public office and armed service , and were forbidden to bear arms .They were not allowed to ride horses or camels , to build synagogues or churches taller than mosques , to construct houses higher than those of Muslims or to drink wine in public .They were not allowed to pray or mourn in loud voices as that might offend the Moslems .The dhimmi had to show public deference toward Moslems , always yielding them the center of the road .The dhimmi was not allowed to give evidence in court against a Moslem , and his oath was unacceptable in an Islamic court .To defend himself , the dhimmi would have to purchase Moslem witnesses at great expense .This left the dhimmi with little legal recourse when harmed by a Moslem .Dhimmis were also forced to wear distinctive clothing .In the ninth century , for example , Baghdad 's Caliph al - Mutawakkil designated a yellow badge for Jews , setting an odious precedent that would be followed centuries later by Nazi Germany .By the twentieth century , the status of the dhimmi in Moslem lands had not significantly improved .H.E.W. Young , British Vice - Consul in Mosul , wrote in 1909 : . \" The attitude of the Muslims toward the Christians and the Jews is that of a master towards slaves , whom he treats with a certain lordly tolerance so long as they keep their place .Any sign of pretension to equality is promptly repressed .\" The concept of jihad is not something now discarded by Islam as a quaint belief appropriate to the distant past .On the contrary , it is a cardinal belief in the 21st century for Moslems based upon Koranic injunctions .The extermination and genocide of Christians in the Middle East - just like the Turkish genocide against the Christian Armenians in 1915 - is happening now : even as you read this .Jihad is believed in by millions of Moslems around the Third world , as much as by Moslems living in America , Britain , Europe , Australia , New Zealand , and Canada .It is a belief , passionately held , that one day the entire world will be forced to accept Islam and the will of Allah .It is vital , therefore , that the general public in every non - Moslem country be made aware that Moslems consider themselves in a perpetual state of war , however outwardly peaceful they may sometimes appear to their non - Moslem neighbors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.20794"}

Bush administration period , the Muslim Brotherhood already had achieved an information dominance that , in coming years , would only intensify .Not only did figures associated and identified with the Muslim Brotherhood achieve broad penetration at senior levels of U.S. policymaking , but voices that warned of their true agenda ( such as Stephen Coughlin 's ) were actively excluded .That information dominance has contributed to startling consequences , most evident in the U.S. policy towards the al - Qa'eda and Muslim Brotherhood - dominated revolutions that many call the \" Arab Spring , \" but which in fact are more accurately termed an \" Islamic Awakening .The infiltration of individuals such as Magid , Hussain , and Abedin , to name just a few , with such close Muslim Brotherhood identifications , to positions of influence at the highest levels of U.S. policymaking must be considered , at a minimum , a contributing factor .Clare M.

Roosevelt 's presidency and was resumed thereafter by a Constitutional amendment .It also marked a leadership transition as the country turned from a military / civilian leader , Washington , to a purely civilian leader , Adams .Indonesia , following its recent divisive election , is at a similar cross - roads moment in the strengthening of its own democracy .President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ( SBY ) , a military / civilian leader , will step down after two terms this October and relinquish power to a duly - elected civilian , Joko Widodo ( Jokowi ) .This is a historic , critical step in the development of Indonesia 's democratic traditions .Indonesian democracy developed out of the dark days of violence in the wake of the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 - 98 .The implosion of Indonesia 's rupiah occurred along with the dismantling of the autocratic and corrupt Suharto regime .Since that time , Indonesia has re - invented itself in a little over a decade and a half , repaired a devastated economy , and has emerged as a robust democracy in Southeast Asia , with a vibrant media , and strong voter participation .It is impressive progress in a relatively short amount of time .The recent presidential election campaign was a hard - fought battle , but free from violence .And , although religion is never absent from Islam 's foremost democracy , this was a contest fought overwhelmingly over secular issues .Jokowi represents a marked departure from Indonesia 's past .He started out as a small business owner , a humble furniture seller , and became a pragmatic , uncorrupt mayor .He is not from the usual clutch of political and business dynasties and their cronies .The 53-year - old is the first of a political generation reaching the national stage since popular protests in the late 1990s toppled Suharto .Jokowi 's rise would have been inconceivable without the radical political decentralization that is perhaps the outstanding success of Indonesia 's democratic journey .He began his political career as mayor of Solo , a medium - sized city in Java , the most populous island , before becoming an immensely popular governor of Jakarta , the capital , in 2012 .There he forged a reputation for competence and clean government that won the admiration of many and propelled him into the presidential race .Jokowi has a good record of dealing with the concerns of ordinary Indonesians : clogged traffic , poor sanitation and petty , bribe - taking bureaucrats .He is more comfortable working with Christians or ethnic Chinese than most Indonesian politicians .Indeed , his opponents tried to turn his hostility to religious intolerance against him by claiming that he was a Christian .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.27724"}

{"text": "Under his leadership , Surakarta experienced significant changes and progress .One of his big achievements was negotiating several meetings with street vendors in Banjarsari and relocating them almost without incident to allow the revitalization of open green land .Moreover , Jokowi required investors to consider the public interest when doing business in the city and did not hesitate to dismiss those who were against his principles of leadership and the interests of the people .Jokowi 's achievements were widely reported by the national and international mass media and even documented by numerous academics and published in several academic and peer - reviewed journals .Similarly , Jokowi 's running mate , Basuki Tjahaja Purnama , better known as Ahok , can also be categorized as an example of a positive leader with his no nonsense character , clean track record and good performance as the regent of East Belitung .In addition , the quick counts results showed that Jokowi and Ahok were able to attract voters from outside their political base .This is partly because of their positive character and performance , as well as the fact that their rivals , including the incumbent , do not wield strong influence .Jokowi 's and Ahok 's down - to - earth persona , their clean track records , their willingness and tireless efforts to meet people from different socioeconomic backgrounds in Jakarta played a crucial role in attracting voters , including undecided voters .In contrast to Jokowi , Fauzi was one of the candidates with the least number of public appearances .He also decided to not use his time to meet supporters during the official campaign period , relegating the task to running mate Nachrowi Ramli .This was seen by the people as elitism , arrogance and a reluctance to meet and to listen to the people 's needs and problems - a common characteristic shown by the majority of government officials and politicians .Finally , the results of the quick counts indicated not just a popular thirst for positive leaders such as Jokowi and Ahok , but also people 's distrust in Fauzi 's capacity and leadership .The writer is a lecturer and researcher at Hasanuddin University , Makassar .Tag Archives : Sunni Islamic hatred in Pakistan .The nation of Pakistan faces many internal problems and minorities reside in fear because political leaders have been in self destruct mode .This applies to the role of Pakistan in fostering and spreading radical Sunni Islam to regional nations .At the same time the internal legal system is openly espousing hatred and creating mayhem by maintaining the blasphemy law .This was clearly visible when Christians were burnt alive by radical Sunni Islamists , therefore , now is the right time to eradicate this dangerous law which is sowing discord and hatred .Both internal and external pressure is needed in order for Pakistan to start afresh .The same applies to crushing radical Sunni Islamic institutions and networks which are causing mayhem .However , will the current leadership deal with this crisis and tackle rogue elements within both the political system and military ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.06708"}
