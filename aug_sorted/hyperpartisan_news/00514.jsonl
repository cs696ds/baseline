{"text": "Eminem 's fifth album .Who Is Eminem ?Eminem aka Slim Shady , real name Marshall Mathers , is a 38 year old rapper from America .Eminem grew up in Detroit , an area with a bit of a name for itself ( gangsters , shootings etc ) .Eminem 's dad left him and his mother when Eminem was just 18 months old , and his mum raised him by herself .His mum , Debbie , is very well known by Eminem 's fans because he mentions her so much in his songs .How sweet does that sound ?Well , it 's actually not that sweet , and the things he says about her are quite .well i 'll just say nasty , and somewhat disturbing .His daughter is also mentioned in a few songs , which is very sweet and you can tell he really loves her to pieces .Eminem began performing amateur raps and participating in freestyle contests at the age 14 .I was quite suprised when I found this out as because he 's so talented I assumed he 'd gotten into rap when he was much younger then 14 .In his teens , before Eminem began his successful solo career , he was part of a rap group called Bassmint Productions , who later changed their name to Soul Intent .The band did n't have enough money for studio time , and only lasted a couple of years .He also has thirteen Grammy Awards and is known world wide for his rapping abilities .Encore Encore is Eminem 's fifth studio album .It was released in late 2004 and in the first three days of it release sold 710,000 copies .9 months down the line , worldwide sales stood at 11 million copies , which I think is amazing and it really reflects how popular and talented Eminem is .The album was certified quadruple platinum in America in December 2004 , just one month after it was released .The album , like all of Eminem 's other albums , is a rap album .Despite this though , I still love the album , and although some of the songs are silly , over the top and slightly ridiculous , they 're still humerous and the lyrics still speak a majority of truth .The album produced five Singles , which came highly in a number of charts , including Billboard Hot 100 and UK Top 40 .The album generally recieved a positive reception however critics were quite harsh on the fact that the album was slightly toned down compared to his previous releases .I first came across this album when I was in my early teens .Before then I had n't really heard of Eminem , nor had I really been interested in his music .My boyfriend at the time introduced me to the album and bought me a copy for Christmas as I became to really enjoy Eminem 's music .The Encore album for me holds lots of memories , I pretty much grew up listening to it and I am still not sick of it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.29538"}

{"text": "Often consisting of bizarre soundscapes and vivid lyrics , abstract hip - hop has developed , largely in the underground .Music outside of the United States has taken the rap style and blended it with completely different elements .Japanese dance music , for example , often uses rapping to complement or break up the singing parts , with lyrics containing upbeat themes set to energetic rhythms and clean , warm synths .Rap was instantly popular in the United Kingdom , perhaps building on the great popularity of dub and reggae toasting .MCs also became a fixture at Jungle and UK Garage events , whilst a recent offshoot of garage , dubbed Grime , has focused on rapping , making stars of rappers such as Dizzee Rascal and Wiley .The importance of rhyme Undoubtedly , the most important element of rap lyrics is rhyme .In other forms of poetry , rhymes that span many syllables are often considered whimsical but in hip hop , the ability to construct raps with large sets of rhyming syllables is considered a sign of intelligence and achievement .For the same reason , rap music is sometimes referred to as \" street poetry \" or \" street rhyme \" .To accomplish rhymes of this sophistication , rappers can use single rhyming words ( intellectual / ineffectual ) or they can use multiple words whose constituent syllables rhyme ( octoroon / Doctor Dooom ) .Rap lyrics often contain long series of lines each of which rhyme with each other .Occasionally , entire songs are composed in this fashion where all lines rhyme with each other .Of course , the more intricate the rhymes are , the more abstract the song becomes .This is because the more focus given to impressive rhyming , the harder it becomes to write coherently .Battle raps can be written with complex rhyming techniques easier than raps that tell a story or convey a message because a battle rap can employ a vast array of metaphors to conjure images of rapper to rapper combat .Rhyme is also integral to Freestyle battles .These contests pit two rappers together to lyrically insult and intimidate each other with impromptu lyrics .The ability to construct clever rhymes to insult the opponent \" off the top of the dome \" ( dome being slang for head ) is a critical skill to winning these contests .Different types of rhymes Not all rhymes used in rap are clear cut .Often , consonance , assonance , half rhymes , and internal rhyme schemes are employed .Making a distant word with similar sounds at some points sound like a rhyme is sometimes considered a sign of a good rapper .An example of a rapper who makes heavy use of assonance is Eminem .Importance of various techniques Although rhyme is the essential required element of all raps , there are other literary techniques that are often employed .To use many of these techniques while still maintaining a meaningful rhyme is considered by most rap listeneres to be signs of a good rhyme .Cadence Cadence is the overall balance of a rhyme in relation to the beat , as far as emphasis and speed ( and in some cases , changes in melody ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.60072"}

{"text": "Eminem said it himself in an interview .Mekhi Phifer even said that he did n't want to do the movie because he thought it was about Eminem 's life and that Hollywood was just trying to take advantage of a rising star , but this is n't the case .Even though there are certain things in the movie that relate to Eminem 's life ( e.g. 8 Mile Road , ) this is certainly not an autobiography .The film probably appeals more to the audiences that listen to Eminem 's music but I think it can also be enjoyed by others .The music and rapping is great .Some of the acting is n't the best but overall it is very watchable and entertaining and has an inspring feel to it .Comments .Great music and entertaining viewing .Watch this ! 8 mile is one of those films you might want to poke at with a stick from a distance .Rap star Eminem in a movie about a guy trying to become a rapper .Sounds a bit dubious but you would be wrong .Strong acting from Eminem and good directing by Curtis Hanson leaves you with a rather good movie .Eminem plays Bunny Rabbit a troubled kid who lives in a trailer with his mum Stephanie ( Kim Basinger ) whose best friend Future ( Mekhi Phifer ) runs rap battles at a hip hop club .Rabbit does have a talent for it but the film opens with him choking and subsequently booed off stage .The film does have a Karate Kid feel to it with Rabbit and his friends going on a journey , fighting the odds and believing in himself .It 's not as clich\u00e9 as it sounds , honest .Like every film there has to be a girl and this comes in the form of Brittany Murphy who plays Alex .Not really sure what purpose she really served but she performed well in this film .I ca n't say there have been many films that have been improved with the presence of a rapper , take Ja Rule 's appearances for example .However , Eminem really does make this movie particularly with his strong rapping ability .This has a brilliant soundtrack and some amazing rap battles , especially the final one .Powerful stuff and compelling viewing this is a gritty movie with good acting and a strong presence .A must see .B.

{"text": "Cadence plays an especially large role in the raps of West coast hip - hop .Many hip - hop listeners find Snoop Dogg to be an example of a rapper with varying -- but always strong -- cadence in his raps .He is seen this way because of his ability to ride slow , fast , melodic , or hardcore beats equally well .Prosody Unlike many other forms of poetry , rappers typically do n't think about metre and feet very heavily .Instead , the goal is to unconciously develop a flow .A good flow is a metre that does n't drag along , but rather , draws the listener into the words .Big Boi of OutKast is considered to have a good flow by many fans .It is important to note that rappers sometimes do use forms such as iambic pentameter .Enunciation Speaking clearly is important because rap is said outloud unlike many other forms of poetry .Enunciation in rap is sometimes exaggerated to a cartoonish level , which is actually a sign of skill .Ludacris is considered an example of a good enunciator .Speed To some , the speed of a rapper 's words are an example of skill .A rapper who can rap quickly and coherently is considered skillful .However , rapping slowly does n't necessarily mean a lack of skill , nor does rapping fast mean quality ; some raps become incomprehensible when performed at a high tempo .An example of a fast rapper is Twista , who is considered both fast and skillful in his rhymes .Wordplay Wordplay include double entendres , alliteration , and all forms of playing around with your words .Wordplay is subjective -- whether it 's done well or poorly is up to the listener .Other techniques There are several other techniques used in rapping , such as : enjambment and hyperbole .The message Wordplay shows skill , but the message of a rap is more important .A rapper who talks about nothing with excellent wordplay does n't show as much skill as one who has a message , because his or her creativity has no frame around it .The message can be about one 's life , about politics , about philosophy , about bragging , and anything with meaning .It can tell a story or show imagery that occurs in the rappers everyday life .Nonsense or dadaist rappers such as Aesop Rock are often looked down on by the purist HipHop fans for not having a real soulful message , and for \" watering down the sound of the ghetto \" ( Kool Keith ) .Traditional forms In many traditional cultures there exist lyrical forms that could loosely be described as rapping .Examples of these include : .Mor lam in Laos Chastushka in Russia Tsiattista in Cyprus Enka Slamta in Ethiopia Tassou in Senegal Rhapsody in Ancient Greece Gstanzl in Bavaria and similar traditions in Austria and Switzerland .Urdu Rap from Pakistan Kuai ban in China .A genre of music spawned in the early 70 's in various ghetto s throughout the U.S.", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.87148"}
