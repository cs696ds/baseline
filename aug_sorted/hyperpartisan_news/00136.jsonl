Smiths and the players fault .Fairness does not apply in this case ( as unfortunate as that is ) .What was agreed upon and the remedies determined by the judicial system does count .For all the fans that state that the NFL has been ruined , etc . , you are truly missing the big picture as it relates to RG and the NFL .RG is appointed at the behest of the owners ( all 32 ) , and they act / vote as a majority rules organization .If the majority agree with RG , he will stay as the commissioner .The NFL has steadily increased their revenue over the last decade , and are expected to continue to do so ( I think it is supposed to double in the next several years with new TV contracts , etc ) .Pretty impressive with a recession .RG and the owners know that the hardcore fans will complain and cry conspiracy / or anti - conspiracy ( depending on what you believe ) but still be there come September .Just like you have been there every year for decades .It is the new blood , the general fan that the NFL is looking to attract .And they do that by appearances ( likely minus the facts that the Saints fans are clamoring for ) .And the other owners ( as well as Benson ) whom are raking in $ $ $ hand over fist will continue to keep RG as commissioner as long as that continues to happen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.55737"}

{"text": "the nfl prepared a statement for them to read that was not their actual words .The NFL shaped their statements to what they wanted it to sound like and then told the coaches that if they cooparate then he might go easy on them .So they pretty much just had to go with it .The way that they \" let it take place \" is because they did not do their job and moniter things the way they should have .they allowed it to happen by not keeping an eye on things .Learn the facts before you post .Everyone seems so tied up on this evidence that 's been leaked .Let me ask you this .If you had appeal hearings but knew those who were going were likely going to walk out or disregard the process and take the case to court , would you leak the best evidence for the appeals that mean nothing ?No you would save it for the trial if it gets that far .I am not saying this is what the NFL is doing but they seem to be doing everything else right where as the players are making mistake after mistake .I 'm betting the NFL does have a smoking gun but would rather not release it til I have to .So yes the NFL is looking bad by not giving out all the evidence but is being smart in the process .Goodell is saying that what these two men are saying - and , to me , is confirming - is the truth and it does n't matter because they have \" other \" witnesses .hmmm .... let me guess who those two other witnesses are ?Gregg and Blake Williams ?Time to speak up ... .Oh , and another thing , the reason that the Saints were originally invesitigated was because Brad Childress went to the NFL after a player told him that another player told that player that Hargrove told him there was a bounty on Brett Favre .The supposed player who was told by Hargrove of any such bounty vehemently denies ever having any such conversation with Hargrove .RG1 is an attorney ; not a flashy attorney , but a corporate type .That type is well - known for being able to keep their mouth shut to support a strategy . \"-tniceman .No , he 's none of the above .He 's the son of a U.S. Senator from NY , with a bachelor 's in economics , who joined the NFL one year after graduation .First , this favorite son was an intern FOR Tagliabue , then a P.R. flack , who has since spent 31 years at the league 's HQ .He 's a career bureaucrat who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth , for crying out loud .Gale Sayers is furious about bounties .Pro Football Hall of Famer Gale Sayers became surprisingly emotional when asked about the Saints ' bounty program in a TV interview , showing anger and sadness and even suggesting that those involved should go to prison .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.741394"}
{"text": "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .It 's like everyone is on Earth and you 're on Pluto .What the HELL you rambling about brother ?Gale Please fill us in on who exactly had their career ended by the Saints players ?How many injuries came on dirty plays ?How many fines and flags for illegal hits were thrown on the Saints ?Please fill us in because Lord Roger certainly does not want to show any of us his evidence .Wow , let the Legend speak his OWN mind .They did n't ask all of you haters the question , they asked HIM his opinion .Not everyone is going to agree about this situation , especially the Saints fans/ players .This is football and we all know that most players , when they hit someone they are trying to take them out .I played semi - pro for years and there was not a tackle / hit that I was not trying to put someone 's ass to sleep on .The only real issue is that the Saints were getting paid extra for it .This is a sport of hits , if you do n't want to get hit DON'T PLAY ! ! !Wow .Very sad to see that practically most people on here , with the exceptions of a very few people have little , or no respect for the older players such as Sayers whose contribution to the game we are watching today was tremendous .He played in an era where the defense was allowed to hit the QB .Many people mentioned Ditka , and someone mentioned Deacon Jones .Those two would be thrown out of the NFL by Lord Goodell if they tried to play like they did in today 's NFL .Gayle , I am sure is aware of the head hunting , and all of that .That is why I am guessing he said what he said .My point is , even if you DISAGREE with the man , there is no reason for a lot of the cheap shots at him .( no pun intended ) .The man is a legend .He deserves respect .Two little known ( or at least discussed ) issues about the \" bounty \" scandal : The league defines any hit , legal or not , that results in injury and is rewarded by coaches monetarily is called a \" bounty \" .it does not have to be ( nor is it being alleged by Goodell ) an intended result . in other words , it is not being charged that the players were going after players with intent to injure for financial gains .Roger Goodell ( now ) claims that the only wrong doing is monetary rewards for unintended results of plays levied by the coaching staff , which is illegal .This is not at all what was originally claimed by the nfl .the second point : I do n't know how many of you know who Scott Fujita is , but he was the olb for the saints for one year ( 2009 ) and is also on the NFLPA executive committee .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.200714"}
