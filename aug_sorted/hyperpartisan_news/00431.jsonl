{"text": "So that means that a rather significant number of the 150,000 on - duty officers , mentioned above , are not dedicated to general police work , but to \" special tasks \" .But , even those numbers are inflated .Many cities , like Houston , have large , dedicated traffic task forces , that do not fall into that \" Special Jurisdiction \" category , yet who are dedicated to special tasks .Not only are such groups dedicated to special tasks , but they most often operate on a different radio frequency than regular patrol officers , so they wo n't even hear your emergency call .What this boils down to is that the number officers on the street , to respond to 911 calls , is much lower than the 150,000 , cited by the Bureau of Justice Statistics .They just did n't break it down that way .The fact is that policemen just ca n't be everywhere at once .There just are n't enough of them .But , here 's the real kicker .The police are not required to protect you , as an individual !In fact , I challenge you to think of just one case where the police have actually prevented a crime .When you think about it , the actual job of the police is not to prevent crime , but to investigate crime , catch the perpetrator and bring the perpetrator to court - ALL after the fact .Think about how the police work .They try to take the bad guys off of the street .How do they know who the bad guys are ?They know , because the bad guys did something bad ( past tense ) .So , by putting the bad guy in jail , you can argue that the police prevented potential crime , protecting the public at large .But the act that put the bad guy behind bars was a real crime , with real victims .But , it is not the job of the police to protect individuals .That is a pretty powerful statement and deserves some support .There is , in fact , so much support for that statement that I could write a book on the subject .Fortunately , Richard W. Stevens has already done that .His very excellent book is \" Dial 911 and Die .\" I encourage you to get the book and read it .Then , if you do n't already own a gun , buy one and learn how to use it .Your life could very well depend upon it .In fact , the courts , including the Supreme Court , have ruled consistently that the police are responsible only to the public at large and not to individual citizens .This means that even when police do their best , the courts recognize that there may be some individuals who they just ca n't to get to in time .It happens all too often .When it does , the citizen is left to fend for himself until the police arrive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.632034"}
{"text": "Imagine their distress when they learned that they had to wait 15 days to get a gun .Armed Citizens Make Fewer Mistakes Than Police .Do n't think that just because the police are trained in the use of firearms that they are less likely to kill an innocent person .A University of Chicago Study revealed that in 1993 approximately 700,000 police killed 330 innocent individuals , while approximately 250,000,000 private citizens only killed 30 innocent people .Do the math .That 's a per capita rate for the police , of almost 4000 times higher than the population in general .OK , that is a little misleading .Let 's just include the 80,000,000 gun owning citizens .Now the police are down to only a 1200 times higher accidental shooting rate than the gun - owning population in general .That still sounds high .So let 's look at it in a different light .According to a study by Newsweek magazine , only 2 % of civilian shootings involve an innocent person being shot ( not killed ) .The error rate for police is 11 % .What this means is that you are more than 5 times more likely to be accidentally shot by a policeman than by an armed citizen .But , when you consider that citizens shoot and kill at least twice as many criminals as do police every year , it means that , per capita , you are more than 11 times more likely to be accidentally shot by a policeman than by an armed citizen .That is as low as I can get that number .This is not meant to be an indictment of the police .In fact , because police often live on the edge , they naturally tend to shoot first and ask questions later .Although they are trained to repress this instinct , it does not always work , as evidenced by the number of innocent people killed by police .Also , since they are generally better marksmen , they tend to kill , rather than wound or totally miss their target .The Kleck study shows that police shoot and kill around 600 criminals each year .Yet the University of Chicago study shows that police killed 330 innocent individuals in 1993 .That means that for every two criminals killed by police , one innocent citizen is killed by police .Although I have the greatest respect for the police and how they must respond under pressure , I think that I would much rather trust an armed populace .Is a picture beginning to develop here ?The sources quoted above are impeccable and the picture that these facts paint is clear .Even if you do n't own a gun , the mere fact that you or others around you might own a gun significantly reduces the likelihood that you will become the victim of a violent crime .The chances that you will be killed or severely injured as a result of a violent crime drop even more if you do own a gun .The remarkably low incidence of gun related accidents is overwhelmingly offset by the significantly reduced likelihood that you might some day become a death statistic on this page , because you or another citizen close to you may be armed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.64574"}

Menino .Many guns found in Massachusetts travel only a short distance : 133 crime guns were traced to New Hampshire in 2011 , and 79 to Maine , according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives .Those states alone accounted for nearly one - third of the 669 crime guns traced to states outside of Massachusetts .New Hampshire and Maine , unlike Massachusetts , do not require a permit or license to buy a gun , although weapons bought at federally licensed gun shops are subjected to a background check .\" If you 're a kid in New Bedford and you had a beef with somebody , what do you do ?You drive three hours to Maine to buy a gun , \" said New Bedford Mayor Jonathan Mitchell , a former federal prosecutor in Boston , who appeared with Menino and other Massachusetts mayors last week to press for stricter gun laws .Despite the threat posed by out - of - state guns and the increase in firearm deaths , Massachusetts still had the second - lowest rate of such fatalities in the nation in 2010 , according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , or CDC .But calls to crack down on out - of - state guns , sometimes bought by straw purchasers who resell them illegally to criminals in Massachusetts , have become more urgent as gun crimes and injuries have increased .In 2011 , Massachusetts recorded 122 murders committed with firearms , a striking increase from the 65 in 1998 , said Fox , the Northeastern professor .Nationwide , such murders increased only 3 percent from 1999 to 2010 , the CDC says .There were increases in other crimes involving guns in Massachusetts , too .From 1998 to 2011 , aggravated assaults with guns rose 26.7 percent .Robberies with firearms increased 20.7 percent during that period , according to an FBI analysis conducted for the Globe .The rise in Massachusetts shootings extends beyond crime .All gunshot injuries not resulting in death , including accidents but excluding suicide attempts , increased 20 percent from 2001 to 2011 , according to the state Department of Public Health .Across the country , the rise was 18 percent , the CDC reported .The increases have occurred despite gun - control laws , passed in 1998 , that state officials describe as among the nation 's toughest , with a ban on semiautomatic assault weapons , more stringent licensing requirements , and a mandate that firearms be stored safely .To gun rights advocates , those laws were misguided .The debate over gun control has been stoked by the recent shooting deaths of 20 first - graders and six educators in Newtown , Conn.", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.25044"}

{"text": "Like all experiences , television shapes the mind of a child .The violence in these shows can cause children to become more aggressive , and the images full of fighting , weapons , and explosions can be traumatizing .It has become so commonplace that we hardly even realize that our children are exposed to it so regularly .His study showed that watching violent cartoons leads to higher aggression in children .There are several reasons that children are more susceptible to television violence .Before age seven , children do not make the connections needed to fully understand a story from beginning to end , and also can not understand a plot .Instead , they see individual scenes .Children also remember physical action more than emotional scenes or conversation , so the violence makes more of an impression on them .Before age five , children can not differentiate between fantasy and reality , and may lead them to not understand that violence has real - life consequences .Children who are naturally more aggressive sometimes turn to television because they are outcast by their peers , which leads to even more violence .Programs such as The Simpsons and South Park , although they are intended for adult viewers , attract children simply because they are animated .These shows are full of person - to - person and casual violence .In The Simpsons , Nelson beats up Bart daily .The character Kenny on South Park dies every episode .In the mind of a child , the fact that Kenny miraculously comes back to life every episode makes the consequences of violence seem petty .Cartoon violence is different from real violence because no one is ever seen in pain or anguish .The only parts of the violent act portrayed are the initial act , and the outcome ; therefore , children do not see the pain and suffering that violence causes .Violence on television is also an issue in sitcoms .While violence may not be as widespread in sitcoms , it has a great impact , especially on children , because many sitcoms are based around normal family and life behavior .The problem is sitcoms lies in the fact that while portraying real life they conveniently leave out key details of the real world .When children watch these shows constantly it distorts their view of reality .Once this happens and they are forced to deal with situations that are not always happy and easily resolved , then they can have violent and aggression reactions due to frustration .Another big issue is the acts of violence seen in sitcoms .Since these TV families are related to real life family many acts of violence shown in them people , especially children , consider acceptable behavior .Also youngsters who watch a lot of television are more likely to feel that the world is a mean and dangerous place .By accompanying this feeling against the world with the aforementioned frustrations with the real world , TV has created a formula for violent and aggressive behavior .In 1992 , TV Guide conducted a study of a typical 18-hour TV broadcast day to determine levels of violence on TV .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.867195"}
