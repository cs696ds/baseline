A. Unlike a ballistic missile , which is fired on a fairly simple high - altitude arc like a cannonball , a cruise missile does most of its flying horizontally at low altitude , like an airplane or a drone .The missiles can trace a complex flight paths , and some , like the Kalibr , are believed to accelerate to supersonic speeds as they approach their targets , making them hard to detect and intercept .Depending on their guidance systems , cruise missiles can be highly accurate , compared with ballistic missiles .But they are single - use weapons and are relatively complicated and expensive to manufacture .Q. How was the strike launched ? A. The Defense Ministry said the missiles were fired from four ships in the Caspian Sea and flew across Iran and northern Iraq to reach their targets .Russia has maintained a naval flotilla in the Caspian - which is landlocked from the rest of the world 's seas - for nearly 300 years .The flotilla currently has no aircraft carriers or other large capital ships , but it has frigates and Buyan - class missile corvettes , including two that were commissioned just last year , the Grad Sviyazhsk and the Veliky Ustyug .Those two ships reportedly fired cruise missiles at sea targets during a major naval exercise last month .Q.

Bush 's approval ratings soared after the United States ' victory in the Persian Gulf War .Democrats ' high point came in 2008 , in the final year of George W. Bush 's administration and the year Barack Obama was first elected president .However , the three - point Democratic advantage for all of 2014 obscures the change that occurred during the year .On a quarterly basis , Democrats started out 2014 with a five - point edge , similar to their advantage in 2013 .That dipped to two points by the third quarter .In the fourth quarter , likely in response to Republicans ' success in the 2014 midterm elections , Republicans held a slight advantage of one point .Since 2008 , Americans have been increasingly reluctant to identify with either the Republican or Democratic Party , and now a record 43 % claimed political independence in 2014 .Given historical trends , 2015 could bring a new record , as the percentage identifying as independents typically increases in the year before a presidential election , averaging a 2.5-point increase in the last six such years .Although Democrats typically have an advantage in partisanship , that edge shrunk in 2014 and in the last months of the year the parties were essentially on equal footing .With each party controlling part of the federal government - Democrats the presidency and Republicans the Congress - they each will have a say in how the nation addresses its major challenges in the coming year .However , in recent years divided control of government has more often than not resulted in partisan gridlock , and Americans ' frustration with the frequent political stalemate is evident .Continued frustration with the government would likely encourage more Americans to identify as independents this year .Survey Methods .Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted January - December 2014 , with a combined random sample of 16,479 adults , aged 18 and older , living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia .For results based on the total sample of national adults , the margin of sampling error is \u00b11 percentage point at the 95 % confidence level .All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting .Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 50 % cellphone respondents and 50 % landline respondents , with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region .Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random - digit - dial methods .New Emails Reveal Obama White House Worked on Concocting Benghazi Lie DURING the Attacks .The still classified Obama State Department email , according to Issa , shows that the Obama White House rushed to settle on the false narrative of the anti - Islamic YouTube video instigating the attacks , which was completely at odds with the conclusions reached by reports from the ground .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.81328"}

Bush 's approval ratings soared after the United States ' victory in the Persian Gulf War .Democrats ' high point came in 2008 , in the final year of George W. Bush 's administration and the year Barack Obama was first elected president .However , the three - point Democratic advantage for all of 2014 obscures the change that occurred during the year .On a quarterly basis , Democrats started out 2014 with a five - point edge , similar to their advantage in 2013 .That dipped to two points by the third quarter .In the fourth quarter , likely in response to Republicans ' success in the 2014 midterm elections , Republicans held a slight advantage of one point .Since 2008 , Americans have been increasingly reluctant to identify with either the Republican or Democratic Party , and now a record 43 % claimed political independence in 2014 .Given historical trends , 2015 could bring a new record , as the percentage identifying as independents typically increases in the year before a presidential election , averaging a 2.5-point increase in the last six such years .Although Democrats typically have an advantage in partisanship , that edge shrunk in 2014 and in the last months of the year the parties were essentially on equal footing .With each party controlling part of the federal government - Democrats the presidency and Republicans the Congress - they each will have a say in how the nation addresses its major challenges in the coming year .However , in recent years divided control of government has more often than not resulted in partisan gridlock , and Americans ' frustration with the frequent political stalemate is evident .Continued frustration with the government would likely encourage more Americans to identify as independents this year .Survey Methods .Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted January - December 2014 , with a combined random sample of 16,479 adults , aged 18 and older , living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia .For results based on the total sample of national adults , the margin of sampling error is \u00b11 percentage point at the 95 % confidence level .All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting .Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 50 % cellphone respondents and 50 % landline respondents , with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region .Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random - digit - dial methods .New Emails Reveal Obama White House Worked on Concocting Benghazi Lie DURING the Attacks .The still classified Obama State Department email , according to Issa , shows that the Obama White House rushed to settle on the false narrative of the anti - Islamic YouTube video instigating the attacks , which was completely at odds with the conclusions reached by reports from the ground .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.01389"}

Kennedy .But it looks as though Clinton and Sanders are leaving the Granite State with the same number of delegates in their pockets because Clinton has the support of New Hampshire 's superdelegates , these party insiders .What do you tell voters who are new to the process , who says this makes them feel like it 's all rigged ?Wasserman Schultz : Well , let me just make sure that I can clarify exactly what was available during the primaries in Iowa and in New Hampshire .The unpledged delegates are a separate category .The only thing available on the ballot in a primary and a caucus is the pledged delegates .Those that are tied to the candidates that they are pledged to support and they receive a proportional number of delegates going into , going into our convention .Unpledged delegates exist really to make sure that party leaders and elected officials do n't have to be in a position where they are running against grassroots activists .We are as a Democratic Party really highlight and emphasize inclusiveness and diversity at our convention and so we want to give every opportunity to grass roots activists and diverse , committed Democrats to be able to participate , attend , and be a delegate at the convention .And so we separate out those , those unpledged delegates to make sure that there is n't competition between them .Tapper : I 'm not sure that , that answer would satisfy an anxious young voter but let 's move on .Sanders won 15 delegates and Clinton nine based on the New Hampshire primary results , but Clinton picked up six superdelegates to tie Sanders , despite being blown out by the voters .The Associated Press calculates that Clinton currently has 361 superdelegates - elected Democrats and other party pooh - bahs committed to her as of Jan. 30-and Sanders has eight .There are 712 superdelegates in total , but unless Sanders wins the remaining primaries by a substantial margin - which is n't very likely - they will undoubtedly play a crucial role in giving the nomination to Clinton , even if Democratic voters felt otherwise .In his \" Let Me Finish \" editorial segment on Wednesday 's Hardball on MSNBC , Chris Matthews indicated that his support for Hillary Clinton may be wavering .He said the only way to \" take down \" Bernie Sanders was to find a candidate who is better than Bernie at defining the Democratic agenda : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.911125"}

{"text": "Here 's what Rejali says , to put this question to rest for all time .Over 12 years of research , Rejali examined the use of torture in the U.S. , Great Britain , Nazi Germany , Soviet Russia , South Vietnam , and Korea .He looked at torture inflicted during the French - Algerian War , as well as at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and at Guantanamo Bay .His research found that there is no record of any successful use of torture to gather intelligence , not even in totalitarian states .The full article is worth reading as it contains many of the usual reasons discussed , such as the livelihood of receiving false information , along with reasons based upon the nature of pain : .Causing someone pain is not like turning a dial on a stove .Greater damage to the body often translates as less pain , since the body , in shock , shuts down the pain system ( as victims of car accidents or shootings can often attest ) .Going too far , too fast with torture can simply desensitize people or cause them to black out .Furthermore , different people have different thresholds for pain , and they use certain types of pain to mask other ones .As a result , even with technological assistance , it is simply impossible to torture in any scientific , reproducible way .Torturers understand this , and so are drawn to two blunt techniques : 1 ) apply maximum allowable pain , so as to push past all limits and 2 ) vary the torture methods widely to exploit as many phobias and specific weaknesses as possible .One perverse result of this is that there will be constant pressure to ignore limits set by the law in favor of a maximum diversity of pain .Cooper also discussed additional problems with torture such as that \" torture badly corrodes organizations that practice it \" , \" torture directly undermines traditional intelligence - gathering \" and that \" what little information is produced under torture is extremely unreliable . \"Detainees with a score to settle may falsely rat out old enemies , hoping they will be tortured instead .Detainees with no information will sometimes try to appease their torturers with lies , making interrogators waste time and effort chasing false leads .The CIA did just this , in fact .The Senate report documents at least one instance in which the CIA tortured a detainee , who gave them bad information , which led to more innocent people being detained .Even when prisoners say true things , the interrogators very often do not believe them .This happened to John McCain when he was tortured in North Vietnam .Formal studies show that torturers can not reliably distinguish truth from falsehood .He also addressed the \" ticking time bomb \" scenarios often raised by supporters of torture : .That brings us to the ticking time bomb thought experiment , where someone is known to have information about an imminent attack but will not talk .This is the centerpiece of the pro - torture case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.317726"}
