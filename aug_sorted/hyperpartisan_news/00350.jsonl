{"text": "With every passing day , the rhetoric in Iraq -- on both sides -- takes on a sharper sectarian tone .The Institute for the Study of War , which closely follows the Iraqi conflict , says that so far Shiites have shown limited appetite for revenge killings . \"However , the ISIS threat to the [ Askari ] shrine will unravel that restraint and trigger retaliatory attacks against the Iraqi Sunnis , \" the Institute says .\"Destruction of any of these shrines would bring on full scale ethno - sectarian civil war with violence meeting or surpassing 2006 levels .\" The Sunni - Shiite divide began in the seventh century , essentially over the legitimacy of the successors of the Prophet Mohammed .One of its most fateful battles took place in Karbala ( now an Iraqi city ) in 680 AD , when the army of Hussein , Mohammed 's grandson , was defeated and massacred by the Sunni Caliph , and he was beheaded .Shiites still mark Hussein 's death every year in the ritual of Ashura .MUST WATCH .JUST WATCHED .MUST WATCH .The sectarian fault - line has since caused many more massacres and institutionalized repression , in contemporary Iraq and beyond .The Shiites have seen themselves as an oppressed majority or minority in places such as Lebanon , Bahrain , Saudi Arabia , parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan -- and Iraq .In the aftermath of the first Gulf War in 1991 , and the eviction of Iraqi forces from Kuwait , Shiites in southern Iraq revolted against Saddam Hussein .Clinging to power and with his army in disarray , Saddam ordered the brutal suppression of the uprising .The Republican Guard carried out mass executions , even tying civilians to the front of their armored vehicles .Tens of thousands of Shiites fled into the marshes around Basra , and were hunted down over the following months .Their nemesis would finally be routed 12 years later .The U.S.-led Operation Iraqi Freedom brought a sense of liberation to the Shiites , but the new order was a threat to Sunnis .Newly - formed political parties largely followed sectarian lines .Maliki 's moves .Over the past three years , the Maliki government has played to its Shiite base and deepened the resentment of Sunni tribes , who believe they have been victimized and starved of resources .To many observers the turning point was the arrest last December of a prominent politician in Ramadi , the Sunni heartland , and a military operation against an anti - government protest camp in the city .Maliki had described it as an al Qaeda base , infuriating local sheikhs .After ISIS took control of much of the Sunni city of Fallujah in January , Iraqi airstrikes further alienated local people .It is difficult to see how ISIS could have made such stunning advances without at least tacit support from the Sunni tribes .Zarqawi 's AQI over - reached with its arbitrary and vicious punishment of Sunnis who failed to accept its militant Salafism .But ISIS , despite quickly declaring Sharia law in towns and cities it has taken , does not appear to have alienated mainstream Sunnis -- yet -- and has instead focused its brutality on Shiites .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.29083"}
