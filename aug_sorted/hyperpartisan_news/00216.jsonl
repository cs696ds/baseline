'position - he may have been na\u00efve in believing the assurances from other EU leaders that they 'd back him .But his starting point has been to do something unusual in Brussels : to say what he means , and mean what he says .And if that leaves him in a minority of one , it 's a matter for national pride .( Polls show that voters back him about 3 - 1 on Juncker . )Unlike Blair , Cameron has no ambitions to run a continent - and he wo n't give away any sovereignty to buy him brownie points in a complex Euro game that the voters do n't want him to play .Cameron may drive many CoffeeHousers up the wall for many reasons - but here , he is being brave and bold and deserves support from those of us who criticize him when he is neither .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.230423"}

{"text": "The English , French and American revolutions all revolved around tax questions .The nearest we came in Australia to a violent rebellion was the Eureka Stockade , which was a tax revolt .Surely the people should have a direct say in relation to tax laws .There is one area in which I would argue that a federal CIR system should not apply , and that is in foreign affairs .I do not mean treaties necessarily .I think that perhaps treaties should be subject to people 's veto , but not foreign affairs generally .First of all , it is the primary function of government to protect the nation from external threats .Secondly , and I think this is more conceptually important , in foreign affairs the Government often has to act on information that is not generally available .It has to act on secret intelligence information and various pieces of information it gets from diplomatic posts which can not be made public because it could sour relations with other countries and create international tension .Ordinarily , foreign affairs is probably not an area suitable for this because the public are not in a position to make an informed judgment .In all other areas I do not see why they are not in a position to make an informed judgment .Questioner , I have two points , one of which concerns voting systems .It is possible for the federal parliament to change the methods of voting .For instance , it could introduce certain forms of so\u2011called proportional representation into the House of Representatives , although that would be extremely difficult with the Constitution .It could mess around with the voting system and deprive the citizens of a power that they do not realise they have , the power of getting rid of a member of parliament by putting him or her last on the preferential voting ballot .In the last two elections , the sitting member could have been put last and the other major parties ' candidates second last .Under those circumstances , except in the Northern Territory at the latest election , there would not have been an ALP representative , a Liberal or a National Party representative in the House .This is a power which is very much neglected because it has not been taught in schools .Do you think that there should be further constitutional restrictions other than those in the Constitution at the moment about electoral powers ?My second point is more of an assertion than a question , but I would like you to comment on it .The introduction of a republic in many forms would leave the Prime Minister as virtually a three\u2011year dictator and that effect is one of the reasons for opposing it .I think it is also important that , in 1988 , the various referenda which had the effect of concentrating power and decision\u2011making in Canberra were defeated throughout Australia , except in the Australian Capital Territory .Do you think that is a danger of misuse of the constitutional referendum procedures ?Professor Walker , The tendency of Australian voters to reject referendum proposals that have or may have the effect of concentrating more power in Canberra is deplored by some constitutional writers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.15373"}

{"text": "Matt Qvortrup in his ' Supply - side Politihics ' ( Centre for Policy Studies 2007 ) argues that this led to a disuse of the New Zealand device .While three petitions were launched in 2007 , there was only one in 2004 and 2005 , and none in 2006 and 2008 thus far .Only one of these have yet achieved the necessary signature target to force a vote , the overwhelming result ( 87 % opposed ) of which was largely ignored by the government .[ citation needed ] However , according to the New Zealand Election Study [ 1 ] , 77 percent of voters believe that the citizen initiated referendum make the politicians more accountable .Trust in politicians has grown by almost 20 percent since the introduction of the device , although that can be more plausibly attributed to the change in electoral system that occurred at the same time .In most referendums it is sufficient for a measure to be approved by a simple majority of voters in order for it to be carried .However , a referendum may also require the support of a super - majority , such as two - thirds of votes cast .In Lithuania certain proposals must be endorsed by a three - quarters majority ( among them , any proposal to amend article 148 of the Lithuanian Constitution , which states , \" Lithuania is an independent and democratic republic \" ) .In some countries , including Italy , there is also a requirement that there be a certain minimum turn - out of the electorate in order for the result of a referendum to be considered valid .This is intended to ensure that the result is representative of the will of the electorate and is analogous to the quorum required in a committee or legislature .Approval in a referendum is necessary in order to amend the Australian constitution .A bill must first be passed by both houses of Parliament or , in certain limited circumstances , by only one house of Parliament , and is then submitted to a referendum .Due to the specific mention of referendums in the Australian constitution , non - constitutional referendums are usually termed plebiscites in Australia .Referenda are rare in Canada and only three have ever occurred at the federal level .The most recent was a referendum in 1992 on a package of proposed constitutional measures known as the Charlottetown Accord .Although the Constitution of Canada does not expressly require that amendments be approved by referendum , some argue that , in light of the precedent set by the Charlottetown Accord referendum , this may have become a constitutional convention .A referendum can also occur at the provincial level .The 1980 and 1995 referendums on the secession of Qu\u00e9bec are notable cases .In conjunction with the provincial election in 2007 , the province of Ontario voted on a mixed - member proportional representation electoral system and British Columbia held two consecutive referendums on BC - STV in 2005 and 2009 .There have been three plebiscites and one \" consultation \" in Chilean history .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.219574"}

{"text": "For example , one study was done on the CIR system in the city of Los Angeles .It involved twelve million people , which is nearly as big as Australia in population terms .They examined samples of a couple of thousand ballot papers ; to be exact it was 1,500 .Not one of those ballot papers had been marked in accordance with the recommendation of the Los Angeles Times or the local dominant television station .That referendum had been the subject of a saturation campaign by the media .Proposition thirteen , which put a cap on property taxes in California , and it has since been reaffirmed a number of times , got a two\u2011thirds majority , despite almost unanimous media opposition , except from one evening paper in Los Angeles .I can not remember the name of it .All the other media , television , radio and press , were against it , yet people decided that they had just had enough .Their property taxes had trebled in a period of five years and they thought that was enough .I think that although the influence of the media certainly can not be discounted , if I were involved in a public debate , I would much rather have the media on my side than against me , it is not insuperable either .Once people have made up their minds , once public opinion has gone through the three stages that Yankelovich mentions , it does not matter what the media say .Your other point was about people having more reservations about the initiative system than the veto system .It is true that a lot of people who are very favourable to the voters ' veto system are much more wary of the initiative system .In fact , as far as the voters ' veto system goes , it is almost impossible to develop an argument against it that is not also against democracy .In relation to the initiative system , it is easier to develop arguments against it .I do not think they are supported by the evidence .Because of the ordinary human experience that it is easier to strike down something that is bad than to build something that is good , you can understand that people would have reservations , that they might fear excessive numbers of propositions , and so on .But it does not seem to have worked out that way .You hear in the media reports about Californian voters having to vote on thirty - seven referendum propositions , and it is true ; they do .There is only an average of two citizen measures per ballot , even in California , which is a very big user of the system per election .It has an election every two years .So that fear does not seem to have been borne out .Occasionally , a period of intense ferment and controversy will occur in some state or country as there will be up to ten citizen measures on the ballot paper .I would rather see those get onto the ballot paper and be resolved by the people than have them seized upon by pressure groups , extremist groups and all sorts of people over whom you and I have no control .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.60741"}

{"text": "Direct democracy through the initiative and referendum system has been publicly advocated in Australia since the 1890s .It was one of the main objectives of the Australian Labor Party and remained so , at least nominally , until 1963 .Between 1914 and 1919 a number of bills for the introduction of the system were introduced by the Queensland ALP government , but were delayed in the then upper house and eventually abandoned .After World War I , the ALP lost interest in the idea and it remained forgotten until the late 1970s , when the Democrats in the Senate began introducing a series of bills for a constitutional amendment to provide for the system .In 1988 the Queensland government prepared a comprehensive CIR bill , but it was dropped only days before it was due to be introduced .There are two main forms of direct legislation .The first is the legislative petition referendum , or ' people 's veto ' .This allows a specified number of voters ( usually between two and five percent ) to petition for a referendum on a bill that has passed through parliament in the normal way but has not yet taken effect .When a petition signed by the prescribed number of voters is presented to the government , the statute 's operation is suspended until the voters have had the opportunity to approve or reject it in a binding referendum .In Switzerland this mechanism also extends to the ratification of treaties .This type of voters ' veto has not been seriously advocated in Australia because of the political resistance to the idea of suspending the effective date of legislation .This terminology is slightly confusing because the initiative obviously involves the holding of a referendum in the ordinary sense of the word , while the legislative petition referendum incorporates an element of citizen initiative , in the sense that the petition is launched by voters of their own motion .In Australia the term ' CIR ' is widely used to denote both forms .The initiative may also be used to propose amendments to the constitution ; in this case it is called the ' constitutional initiative ' .This was the particular form of CIR supported by the Centenary Constitutional Conference .The arguments for and against CIR I have canvassed in my 1987 book Initiative and Referendum - The People 's Law ( Centre for Independent Studies , Sydney ) .As public dissatisfaction with the political scene has certainly not decreased , support for CIR has quietly followed .The result is that in every state and territory of the Commonwealth except Victoria there are , or have recently been , draft CIR bills in existence or in preparation .Another factor that may add intellectual impetus to moves for direct democracy is the growing understanding of public opinion and the way in which people reach judgments on public affairs .Public opinion , he argues , improves in quality as it moves from snap opinion to public judgment , as people hear the other side of the argument and become aware of the consequences of their preliminary opinions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.948166"}

{"text": "It is a form of direct democracy .The measure put to a vote is known in the U.S. as a ballot proposition or measure .The word plebiscite comes from the Latin plebiscita , which originally meant a decree of the Concilium Plebis , the popular assembly of the Roman Republic .Referendums and referenda are both commonly used as plurals of referendum .However , the use of referenda is deprecated by the Oxford English Dictionary , which advises that : .Referendums is logically preferable as a plural form meaning ballots on one issue ( as a Latin gerund , referendum has no plural ) .The Latin plural gerundive referenda , meaning things to be referred , necessarily connotes a plurality of issues .In the United States a plebiscite is typically known as an initiative when originating in a petition of ordinary citizens , and as a referendum only if it consists of a proposal referred to voters by the legislature .A plebiscite can be considered a kind of election and is often referred to as such in the U.S. ( an election literally means a choice ) .In other countries the term election is often reserved for events in which elected representatives are chosen .Procedure and status .A referendum can also be facultative , that is it can be initiated at the will of a public authority ( President of the Republic in France and Romania or the Government / Parliament in Greece or Spain ) or at the will of the citizens ( a petition ) .It can be binding or non - binding .A foundational referendum or plebiscite may be drafted by a constituent assembly before being put to voters .In other circumstances a referendum is usually initiated either by a legislature or by citizens themselves by means of a petition .The process of initiating a referendum by petition is known as the popular or citizens initiative .In the United States the term referendum is often reserved for a direct vote initiated by a legislature while a vote originating in a petition of citizens is referred to as an \" initiative \" , \" ballot measure \" or \" proposition . \"In countries in which a referendum must be initiated by parliament , it is sometimes mandatory to hold a binding referendum on certain proposals , such as constitutional amendments .In countries , such as the United Kingdom , in which referendums are neither mandatory nor binding there may , nonetheless , exist an unwritten convention that certain important constitutional changes will be put to a referendum and that the result will be respected .By nature of their effects , referendums may be either binding or non - binding .A non - binding referendum is merely consultative or advisory .It is left to the government or legislature to interpret the results of a non - binding referendum and it may even choose to ignore them .This is particularly the case in states that follow Westminster conventions of parliamentary sovereignty .In New Zealand , for example , citizen - initiated referendum ( CIR ) questions are broad statements of intent , not detailed laws .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.919235"}
{"text": "Professor Walker , I think that is a very constructive idea and it is available .I have not been able to go into the complexities of various types of CIR arrangements .In California , if a petition for a new law qualifies , a proposition qualifies , and is going onto the ballot paper , the legislature can put a competing proposal on the ballot paper .So people can choose between two different approaches to the same problem .Of course , they can also urge people to vote no to the original proposal and not put forward an alternative .The problem with the Californian approach is that people can not vote preferentially .They have to choose one or the other .Our practice of preferential voting in Australia is very much admired in the United States .I was there last year during the presidential election campaign .When it became apparent that there would be three candidates , I told them about our system of numbering one , two or three and they thought that was a brilliant idea .Normally , they have not had more than two candidates so the question has not arisen much .A preferential system is a very desirable arrangement .It gives the legislature the power to put forward a compromise proposal or perhaps a proposal in which something has been thought of that was not thought of previously .In the broader sense , I am not so sure that all problems are , at bottom , so complicated .Acts of parliament are complicated when you look at them because there is so much machinery , so much need for definitions and so many consequential matters to deal with .But the basic principle behind most acts of parliament is simple ; for example : ' Do you want income tax or do n't you ? ' ' Do you want a Goods and Services Tax or do n't you ? 'The basic principle does lend itself to voting yes or no and , in fact , that is what the Parliament does ; it votes yes or no once the proposal is formulated .That is what the High Court does when a matter comes before it in which there may be merits and equities on both sides .At the end of the day the court still has to decide yes or no .Although in one sense matters are complicated , life would become impossible if ultimately all problems of government were complicated .At bottom , I think they basically have a certain simplicity .Questioner , Firstly , when some people first hear about CIR , they are concerned that we will be having a lot of referendums on a lot of issues .Secondly , and this goes to the point that was brought up earlier , some people who are in favour of the legislative veto are very concerned about the initiative of new legislation because of the power of the media .Do you have comments on those two issues ?Professor Walker , The power of the media argument comes up when the result turns out the same way as the media want it to .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.15416"}

{"text": "Under that standard , there has to be a compelling government interest to classify on the basis of race , and the classification has to be narrowly tailored to fit that interest .Most laws reviewed under strict scrutiny do n't pass constitutional muster ; it 's a high constitutional bar .Sex - based classifications are reviewed under intermediate scrutiny .Under that standard , the government 's interest has to be \" important \" , and the classification has to be substantially related to that interest .This standard is less stringent than strict scrutiny , but importantly , it still forces the government to justify its classification .The request for briefing addressing the level of scrutiny , according to the report , is a consequence of the Supreme Court 's decision in United States v. Windsor in June .The Court struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) , writing that it violates due process and equal protection principles found in the Fifth Amendment .The panel requested briefing on the decision 's impact , and on whether or not the decision applied a heightened level of judicial scrutiny .( Justice Kennedy 's majority opinion did n't directly address the level of scrutiny , except for a few passages in which he referred to \" careful \" review of anti - gay laws . )The opposing side had filed a brief suggesting that heightened scrutiny , and considering sexual orientation a \" suspect classification \" would be a prerequisite to a challenge to the striking of the juror .If the Ninth Circuit finds more backing for application of heightened scrutiny , it could eventually be applied .Today 's ruling holds that heightened scrutiny does apply , because of the implications of the Supreme Court 's decision last June in United States v. Windsor : .In sum , Windsor requires that we reexamine our prior precedents , and Witt tells us how to interpret Windsor .Under that analysis , we are required by Windsor to apply heightened scrutiny to classifications based on sexual orientation for purposes of equal protection .The Ninth Circuit looked at the Windsor decision and ruled that the Supreme Court applied heightened scrutiny , without naming it directly : .Windsor review is not rational basis review .In its words and its deed , Windsor established a level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation that is unquestionably higher than rational basis review .In other words , Windsor requires that heightened scrutiny be applied to equal protection claims involving sexual orientation .Because the Windsor decision analyzed Section 3 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) under heightened scrutiny , that standard will now apply in the Ninth Circuit without rehearing the case en banc .The Windsor Court , the opinion notes , reviewed the actual purposes and justifications for the law , whereas under the more lenient rational basis standard , any conceivable rationale is enough to sustain a law .Secondly , the Windsor Court shifted the burden from the same - sex couple to the government when it wrote that the government has to \" justify disparate treatment of the group .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.89513"}

Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) withdrew his budget autonomy bill when it became clear that it would not pass without riders undermining the Council 's Home Rule prerogatives .Riders similarly doomed bills that would have given the District 's Delegate a vote in the House of Representatives .These riders have become the fatal obstacle to congressional action that would otherwise advance DC democracy .This is not to say that such efforts on the Hill should not continue .However , it 's time to explore other strategies that might produce a \" clean \" bill advancing DC democracy .The budget autonomy referendum is such a strategy .New strategy has many benefits .There are several clear benefits to the budget autonomy referendum .First , it gives DC residents a meaningful role in achieving greater democracy and makes use of the city 's broad authority under the Home Rule Act to make changes to that Act .The referendum also offers DC residents an opportunity to make visible to Congress the importance of this issue to the people of the District .Second , the referendum will itself be the \" clean \" budget autonomy bill the District is seeking .And under the Home Rule Act itself , Congress is not permitted to amend the referendum by adding riders ; instead , it must either approve it by doing nothing , or disapprove it by joint resolution .Finally , the Home Rule Act makes it hard for Congress to disapprove the referendum .Under that Act , the referendum giving the city budget autonomy will automatically become law unless both Houses of Congress disapprove it within 35 days and the President signs that disapproval .Even if both houses could pass the disapproval resolution , it seems highly unlikely that the President would sign it .When he decided to put DC 's \" Taxation Without Representation \" license plates on his inauguration vehicles , President Obama issued a strong statement declaring his \" willingness to fight for voting rights , Home Rule and budget autonomy for the District . \" DC should move forward despite concerns .Some have raised concerns that the referendum is beyond the District 's authority , or that it will undermine the city 's relationship with Congress , or that it does not bring us full democracy .None of these concerns should keep the residents of the District from fully supporting the referendum .First , no proposal for greater DC democracy has ever been or will ever be a \" slam dunk \" legally or politically .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "117.42323"}
