{"text": "What would happen if principals facing extensive discipline problems in conventional public schools suddenly curtailed their use of out - of - school suspensions ?That 's not a rhetorical question .In fact , it has already been answered in a forthcoming study in the journal International Economics Review .4 In that study , Rochester University professor Joshua Kinsler discovered that cutting out - of - school suspensions in schools with many disruptive students lowers overall student achievement .Why is that ?As we know , out of school suspensions do no good for the suspended student academically , but Kinsler found that they do appear to benefit the rest of the school , presumably by making it easier for teachers to teach the non - disruptive children .Professor Kinsler 's findings reminded me of an essay I came across recently , dealing with school violence .It reflects on bullying suffered by the author when he was a boy , and how it was dealt with by his school .I 'd like to share a brief quote with you : .It was hard that school year ....I look back at those fights and how the principals ... separated us and wanted to know who started it ....They wanted to know if someone was a bully ....And ...The bully was disciplined .Zero Tolerance policies as applied in most schools today punish both kids for fighting , and oftentimes there are no inquiries into whether it was mutual combat or a primary aggressor situation ....A Zero Tolerance attitude among school administrators runs the risk of punishing the victim as well as the bully .\" It runs the risk of becoming blind to the evils of bullying . \"Zero Tolerance policies are contrary to our fundamental right to self - defense .... many kids are assaulted in schools every day and punished for fighting back , or in fear of being punished do not fight back and are beaten .These reflections were written by Judge Teske .He makes an eloquent case that adults in our school and justice systems must defend innocent children from bullies .His argument is compelling , and it applies just as much to children 's education as to their physical safety .Yes , out - of - school suspensions are far from the ideal disciplinary strategy .But until superior strategies , like those of the AIM model , have been widely adopted , curtailing out - of - school suspensions will likely have the perverse result of compromising the education of millions of innocent children .There is a bitter irony here .A key concern with Zero Tolerance policies is the harm they do to African American children , because African American students are more likely to be referred to the principal 's office and , as a result , more likely to be suspended .But only a small fraction of black students are actually suspended .The vast majority are not disruptive .They are simply trying to get an education .They are , like the victims of bullying described by Judge Teske , innocent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.14312"}

UConn ... will miss the NCAA Tournament next year ... for breaking a rule ...THAT DIDN'T EXIST WHEN THEY BROKE IT ! ! !", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.3927"}

{"text": "So these 60 schools were special cases of schools with children entirely enrolled in non - tested grades .By assigning these schools a ranking based on the test results of other schools in the same district , CT SDE quietly patched up another hole in the test machinery .But this patch opened up another hole in the story we are told that all kids need to be tested every year in all schools , or else !This patch is difficult for CT SDE to defend .It busts a hole in the claim that tests are needed to tell parents how their children are doing in school .And this quick fix comes as more evidence surfaces that CT SDE has actively suppressed parents ' rights to refuse the tests , or opt out , as protest towards better education policy and practice .The concept of more holistic accountability of schools is defensible , including periodic testing of a representative sample of the students in a district or school to get a picture of basic academic skill development .This is how the NAEP has worked for decades - testing a representative sample of kids in a handful of grade levels , not every kid , every year , in every grade .This is similar to how public opinion polls and the U.S. Census or American Community Survey work .Remember , the dominant story says , \" Testing is doubly important for low - income , Black , and Latino kids so they can learn .Without the testing , how can we know the kids are learning ?How can parents know how their children are doing ?\" How was it that these more advantaged schools communicated children 's academic progress without high - stakes tests every year ?There are drastic differences in power between parents and schools in white compared to communities of color .So this testing business can play out differently in schools .Periodic testing might be used as check - in and provide data that can empower low - income , people of color .But annual high - stakes testing ( HST ) is n't designed to erase historic inequities .Instead , high - stakes testing more often exacerbates those inequities .( Valenzuela , 2004 ) .Take Hartford , CT , where I live and I 'm on the school board .About half of Hartford is Latino or Puerto Rican , a third of the population is Black ( with many West Indian families ) and 10 - 15 % white folks .The testing that supposedly offers parents more power is often disempowering .How ?Occasionally , parents speak about the test data to get attention , then their concerns pivot to mismanagement , mistreatment , under- or selective investment , and miseducation .Parents have power and agency , but testing does n't erase the differences in institutional power that they face .Instead of help in Hartford , the schools often get more tests .The State already claims that schools are excelling , progressing , and transitioning without testing .A stale vision for public schools might call for more , better tests and more data .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.80409"}

{"text": "My second observation on the way forward begins with a question .What kind of school is most likely to implement a successful discipline policy ?As you can imagine , a lot of factors are involved , but there 's good evidence that a cornerstone of these successful schools is consistency .When students understand that the expectations for their behavior are the same from grade to grade and from classroom to classroom , that everyone in the school is on the same page , it has been shown to lead to more studious , orderly schools .7 Consistency is a hallmark of discipline policy at the American Indian Model schools .Wonderful as it is to know that , it begs the further question : how do you cultivate such consistency and build a strong sense of shared mission and understanding among school staff .There 's actually good evidence on this question as well , reaching back decades .One study , published in the journal Sociology of Education , compared the attitudes of teachers in two different groups of schools .8 Their results are reported in Figure 1 , and reveal that teachers in Group A schools were substantially more positive about their school 's atmosphere in every one of the nine areas measured .Group B teachers , she found , were \" offend perplexed \" by the same questions about their schools ' culture and values .A typical Group B teacher responded that his school \" probably does have some unifying culture and I 'm just not aware of it . \" Apparently not seeing the irony in that statement .Here 's how professor Johnson summed up her findings : .The prominence of cultural bonds in [ Group A ] schools aand their virtual absence in most [ Group B ] schools can be ex plained by differences in their organizations .Neither of the soociological studies I 've mentioned attributed the differences between Grroup A and Grroup B schools to the students they served .Instead , they attributed them to the organizational structure of those schools .As some of you have no doubt already guessed , what I 've called Group A and Group B are in fact private and public schools .For decades , education economists have reported findings consistent with those of their sociologist colleagues .Controlling for student and family background , graduation and college acceptance rates are higher in independent schools than in public schools , whereas crime rates are lower - especially for urban African American students .10 The District of Columbia 's own school voucher program , overseen by Congress , has a significantly higher graduation rate than the district 's vastly - higher - spending public schools .From a policy standpoint , these findings are problematic .Under our present system , the people with the least access to independent schools are low - income families - precisely those who are more likely to live in higher crime neighborhoods with troubled public schools ; the very people most desperately in need of better , safer alternatives .I do not present this evidence to encourage Congress to enact nation - wide private school choice legislation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.48762"}
