Bernie Sanders ' ( D - VT ) numbers , given that young voters are overwhelmingly backing him in this primary .The publication added that there would be something of a \" political earthquake \" if either Sanders or Trump should lose .The chances of that , albeit very slim , is more on the Republican side , though that still does n't mean that people will be watching who will be the runner - up in the GOP contest .The historic high turnout could also help the anti - establishment wings of both parties , and if Christie , Fiorina , Carson , Kasich , and Bush do poorly tonight , they should all consider doing something else than running for president .Top Clinton Aides Abedin and Sullivan Sent Classified Info on Personal Email Accounts , Too .Tuesday , February 9 .By Katie Pavlich .The rest , she reassured , was turned over to the Department as required .Considering the Inspector General reviewing the case had to obtain special clearance to handle a number of Clinton 's emails because of the high level of sensitive material contained within them , the answer to that question is likely no .Judicial Watch today released nearly 70 pages of State Department records that show that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides , Deputy Chiefs of Staff Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan , received and sent classified information on their non - state .gov email accounts .gov email account ) to print two March 2011 emails , which were sent from former British Prime Minister Tony Blair ( using the moniker \" aclb \" ) to Jake Sullivan on Sullivan 's non - state .gov email account .The Obama State Department redacted the Blair emails under Exemption ( b)(1 ) which allows the withholding of classified material .The material is marked as being classified as \" Foreign government information \" and \" foreign relations or foreign activities of the US , including confidential sources .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.07092"}
