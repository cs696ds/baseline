{"text": "\" Expanding background checks at gun shows will not prevent the next shooting , will not solve violent crime and will not keep our kids safe in schools , \" the NRA said Wednesday in a brief statement .Supporters counter that expanding background checks does nothing to limit the ownership of guns -- except for those already prohibited from possessing them .\" I do n't consider criminal background checks to be gun control ; I think it 's just common sense , \" Toomey said Wednesday as he unveiled his bill in the Capitol .\" The worries that we hear sometimes about background checks leading to an erosion of our Second Amendment rights , it simply has n't happened .\" It 's unclear if Toomey and Manchin have the 60 votes they 'll need to pass their amendment through the upper chamber .While 16 Republicans voted in favor of moving to debate the proposed gun controls , many of those are expected to oppose final passage of the individual reforms , all of which will require 60 votes to get across the finish line .Thompson , meanwhile , is readying his own background check bill , which he expects to offer later this month with Rep. Pete King ( R - N.Y. ) .It 's unclear how many House Republicans are ready to join King in support of tougher gun laws .Toomey , a former House member , said Wednesday that he 's been in discussions with some of his former colleagues in the lower chamber , and that a \" substantial number \" back the notion of expanded background checks .\" There are definitely Republicans in the House that support this , \" Toomey said .But House GOP leaders , historically opposed to tougher gun laws , have approached the debate very cautiously , committing only to look at what the Senate can pass , but not promising any action on it .Thompson said he and King are talking with \" about seven or eight \" House Republicans in hopes of rallying their support for the bill .With polls showing that public support for expanded background checks tops 90 percent , Thompson warned GOP leaders that they ignore the issue at their own peril .\" If they for a minute think they can throttle this [ and ] put it on the back shelf or lock it away in the back room , they 're going to be incredibly surprised by what happens across this country , \" Thompson said .Behind Thompson , a group of military veterans gathered at the Capitol on Thursday to urge Congress to expand background checks surrounding gun sales .The vets highlighted a new poll , commissioned by the liberal Center for American Progress Action Fund and VoteVets.org , showing that 91 percent of veterans back universal screenings .\" I 'm a supporter of the Second Amendment , but I know that that support must include keeping guns away from criminals and other dangerous individuals , \" said Joe Accardi , the GOP mayor of Roselle Park , N.J. , and a veteran .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.30296"}

{"text": "I think banning this or that gun or limiting clip size is n't going to do much , some lives will be saved , but statistically insignificant IMO .Nearly everyone agrees that background checks are necessary for sales through a licensed dealer , why the resistance for non - dealer sales .The act itself is the same , transferring the ownership of a gun .By not requiring it for all gun sales , you defeat the entire purpose , which is legally selling a gun to someone who ca n't legally own one .Why does the NRA have such issue with it .To me it 's like having to transfer a title on a car , but only if you buy it from a dealer .The NRA states background checks for all gun sales is \" a stepping stone for gun control advocates seeking to ban all private sales , even among family and friends .\" Imagine if someone tried to use that argument for not transferring all titles to all vehicles , it 's ridiculous .Not the best analogy , but to me it makes no sense to have a background check law for some guns .It 's like verifying someone is 21 to buy alcohol , but only done at liquor stores and not at bars .Seems like the bars might be where one would go if they are n't 21 .Ditto for guns , if you ca n't pass a background check , you do n't buy it from a licensed dealer .Is there another example of a product bought and sold in which the legal requirements to make that purchase depend on who is selling it ? \"Data from a national survey of inmates indicated that nearly 80 percent of those who had used a handgun in a crime had acquired it through a transaction with an individual who was not a licensed gun dealer . \"LINK .I do n't understand how someone can claim that requiring background checks on all gun sales wo n't lesson gun violence , my question is how can it not ?You 're asking how can more laws not stop law breakers from breaking laws ?Laws do in fact reduce the frequency with which the proscibed behaviors is undertaken .Particularly laws which regulate transactional behaviors as opposed to impulsive behaviors .If it became illegal for any person to transfer a firearm without following certain mandated procedures , the number of transfers undertaken without those procedures being followed would decline .Now that does n't mean they would be eliminated or that a prospective purchaser could not with enough persistence find a seller willing to break the law but it would make a difference .Where the \" wrong \" is something very conswequential such as death and serious injury , more of a burden on the \" innocent or trustworth purchaser should be tolerated than if the wron to be reduced is something less serious like evading a regulatory fee .There are people who would likely think that a tremendous burden on individual and considerable amount of money cost to society as a whole is a fair trade - off for a very small number of deaths avoided .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.603455"}
