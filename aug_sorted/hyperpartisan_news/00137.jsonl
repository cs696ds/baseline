Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , has backed New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly , a 69-year - old former top Treasury law enforcement official who some believe would rather run for mayor of New York .The FBI Agents Association has recommended Michael Mason , a 23-year bureau veteran who ran the Washington field office and became executive assistant director in charge of the bureau 's criminal investigative division .Mason would be the FBI 's first black director .One possible candidate with a strong background fighting terrorism who served in the Bush administration : Michael J. Garcia , the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York .Earlier in his career , Garcia successfully prosecuted the mastermind in the first World Trade Center bombing case in the mid-1990s .Garcia also headed Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in the Department of Homeland Security , an agency of 20,000 employees .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.409004"}

David Petraeus for espionage for keeping secret and top - secret documents in an unlocked drawer in his desk inside his guarded home .It alleged that he shared those secrets with a friend who also had a security clearance , but it dropped those charges . \"Napolitano contends that the bar for prosecution is low , and can be based on negligence .That is , the government need not prove that Clinton intended to reveal state secrets - only that she did so through carelessness .SAP information can include the names of intelligence assets , for instance , and other highly sensitive information .To date , some 1,340 \" classified \" emails have been discovered amongst those stored on Clinton 's server .Clinton argues that those communications were not so designated at the time .Undermining her defense is a series of emails exchanged with aide Jake Sullivan in which she appears to order him to get around security protocol and simply cut and paste sensitive information to be faxed to her .The compromising communication was amongst those released in a recent Friday night \" dump .\" In the exchange , Sullivan reports that staffers have \" had issues sending secure fax .They 're working on it . \" Clinton answers , \" If they ca n't , turn into non - paper w no identifying heading and send non - secure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.947792"}
