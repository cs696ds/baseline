{"text": "The partisan impact of immigration is relatively uniform throughout the country , even though local Republican parties have taken different positions on illegal immigration .Although high immigration may work against Democratic policy goals , such as raising wages for the poor and protecting the environment , it does improve Democratic electoral prospects .The latter point is critical , because this is where the Republicans can make some serious inroads among immigrants .Once these immigrants become \" mainstream taxpayers , \" they are no longer reliable residents of the Democratic plantation .The Republican Party must figure out how to appeal to them .You seem to believe that today 's immigrants are becoming \" mainstream taxpayers , \" which is patently false .They are mostly unskilled , low paid , and uneducated and are taking more from the system than they are contributing .57 % of immigrant headed households with children are on welfare .25 % of the adults lack even a high school degree .Every year we are bringing in thru our legal immigration policies hundreds of thousands of high school dropouts .Immigrants and their children accounted for one - fourth of all persons in poverty .Educational Attainment .The decline began well before the current economic downturn .Progress Over Time .However , on average even immigrants who have lived in the United States for 20 years have not come close to closing the gap with natives .And most of the 40 million immigrants living in the US today ( now one in 8 residents of this country compared to one in 21 in 1970 ) not counting their American born children favor Dems by two to one .I 'll take it one step further , too .The GOP must figure out a way to build on this .Most of the immigrants coming to this country are natural Democrats as they have been historically .In the past immigrants had higher levels of education compared to the native born and that goes back to the early 1900s .Today , that is not true .And we now have the welfare state .Households headed by a high school dropout receive three dollars in public benefits for every dollar paid in taxes and it does n't matter if they are immigrants or the native born .87 percent of the 1.2 million legal immigrants entering annually are minorities as defined by the U.S. Government and almost all of the illegal aliens are minorities .By 2019 half of the children 18 and under in the U.S. will be classified as minorities and by 2042 , half of the residents of this country will be minorities .Generally , immigrants and minorities vote predominantly for the Democrat Party .Hence , Democrats view immigration as a never - ending source of voters that will make them the permanent majority party .Since the 1965 Immigration Act , our pro - population growth immigration policies have fueled major demographic changes in a very short period of time .In 1970 , non - Hispanic whites comprised 89 percent of the population ; today they are 66 percent ; and by 2042 , they will be 50 percent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "32.020214"}
{"text": "Clearly , many other foci and/or combinations of foci are possible within a broadly liberal democratic form of government .Moreover , it remains to be seen whether the notion that scientific progress will bring progress in other dimensions of the human endeavor such as ethics and political arrangements has any lasting vitality .Although I acknowledge the possibility , I do not in these pages consider the more sobering challenge that liberal democracy , in combination with modern capitalism and modern technology , eventually causes a nation to lose its soul and slide into some form of tyranny within an autocratic state .The key point is that public policies and priorities have an impact on universities .In these essays I have assumed not only that liberal politics will survive , but that whatever its future path , our particular version of liberal politics will continue to have a decisive influence on key aspects of American higher education .Needless to say , the impetus for change in higher education may also be internal , arising from developments on the scholarly and educational frontier .In contemporary times , a university education is almost a requirement of a fully expressed citizenship .The university is an essential supplier of products and services on which the society is highly dependent , such as advanced training , expertise of various types , and new ideas .However , the capacity of the university as we know it to maintain such a central role will always remain uncertain and depends on the university 's adaptability , its capacity for leadership , and the evolving nature of other key cultural and political ideas and institutions .The difficulty is that change and adaptation inevitably bring in their wake anxiety , loss , and controversy .Meaningful change generates not only winners and losers , but also a reconfiguration of the values and commitments of the university .There are always constituencies , internal and external , that think that the existing configuration is optimal .Thus , even thoughtful change creates controversy .It always requires courage and commitment from within the university leadership , whether at a department , a school , or a university .At the same time , errors are certain when selecting new paths , and leaders need both the courage to take risks and the wisdom to identify when a mistake has been made .Making the right choices in higher education is something like trying to understand which aspects of avant - garde art are simply different and transitory , and which aspects represent a more permanent addition to our cultural patrimony .I recall with mixed feeling two initiatives , one at Princeton and one at Michigan .In the late 1970s and the early 1980s , as Michigan 's manufacturing sector faltered ( after the \" second energy shock \" ) , the state of Michigan and the University of Michigan faced a serious financial crisis .At the University of Michigan we developed a response to this situation that could be loosely characterized as \" smaller but better .\" The idea was that , given external circumstances , the only way we could continue to enhance the quality of our programs was to have fewer of them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "32.083836"}

{"text": "As might be expected , many of the supported policies include suggestions for removing the illegal status from people who have come to the US , or who plan to come to the US , without going through the current immigration process .One of the higher ranked policies , however , is \" increasing border security , \" although such an increase is apparently not desirable if it comes in the form of \" aggressive steps to seek and deport undocumented immigrants .\" What on earth does that mean ?One possibility , backed up somewhat by a Pew Research poll , is that the approval of increased border security reflects the presumptive acceptance of a compromise in which immigration policy is made easier , but is then enforced according to its terms .Says Pew , \" Some 46 % of Latinos and 43 % of the general public say both better border security and enforcement and a path to citizenship should be given equal priority when it comes to dealing with illegal immigration . \"Indeed , such a compromise is a common theme in many of the comprehensive immigration reform proposals I 've heard come and go for the past several years .It 's a compromise that makes a lot of sense on paper , but which conservatives rightly resist due to the near certainty that promises of stronger enforcement will not be kept .Another , more cynical possibility is that tighter border security is seen as a way to protect the current batch of immigrants from future immigration .I have n't seen any data suggesting this understanding , although it does have a certain logic .Hispanics who are in the country legally - even those who have been here for generations - are harmed somewhat by illegal immigration .Political rhetoric focuses on Hispanic people who are in the country illegally and tends to neglect people who have immigrated legally or who are citizens born and raised here as Americans .Even Democrats - who are seldom charged with racial insensitivity - spend most of their time talking about people who are in violation of the law but deserve a second chance , and very little time talking about people who have broken no laws at all .This paints a black cloud over the legal Hispanic population which certainly does them no favors .If there is a sincerity behind Hispanic interest in increasing border security , then Resurgent Republic is right in thinking that the border security issue may ultimately bode well for Republicans .It seems , however , that there is a great deal more context which needs to be considered and which tends to undercut the potential for conservative benefit .Either way , the idea that Hispanics would support greater border security at all falls well outside the usual political discourse .If that result is real , it 's certainly something worth pondering .Continuing to ponder my colleague 's comments about the Republican and Democrat parties , his statement that Republicans are about money and Democrats are about peace raises an important point about the current state of political messaging .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "38.826035"}

{"text": "Therefore , it is hardly surprising that there is ongoing controversy regarding the appropriate shape of the curricula and scholarly commitments of the institutions of higher education .Nor is it astonishing that these controversies are most heated in societies , such as ours , characterized by rapid change and a rapidly accumulating knowledge base , in which higher education has become almost a requirement to be eligible for a full set of opportunities .Given the current pace of change and the complex contemporary mission of the American research university , certain continuing pressures on these institutions are inevitable , including the tensions between and among : .Current circumstances and aspirations .The university 's role as educator ( requiring closeness and responsiveness to society ) and critic ( requiring distance from and skepticism of the status quo ) .Specialization and integration .The demands for scholarship , the demands for education , and the demands for other services the university provides .Demands for diversity and independence vis - \u00e0 - vis rising mands for social solidarity , responsiveness , and community .The \" right \" profile of any university will vary by institution and geography , but in all cases will remain elusive and controversial .In a sector as heterogeneous as contemporary U.S. higher education , the idea of civic purposes must be understood as requiring different responses from differently situated institutions .However , none of these institutions should be misconstrued as institutions designed to preserve a portfolio of special entitlements granted to students , teachers , and scholars , yet withheld from other citizens .The special freedoms and privileges enjoyed by university communities , whether public or private , must be seen as mechanisms to enable universities to meet their responsibilities more effectively and more equitably .The intellectual and educational autonomy granted the university and the privilege of tenure are hardly ancient rights or rites , but rather instruments through which the university can more effectively pursue its public purpose .Tenure , for example , is an instrument to protect the faculty from inappropriate interference with the freedom to pursue their intellectual and educational agenda .Correspondingly , it is the faculty 's responsibility to use this freedom to critically reexamine our current set of beliefs and commitments in their areas of expertise .Lapses in fulfilling this responsibility undermine the future of this idea more , in my judgment , than the occasional misinformed critique of tenure as simple job security .The intellectual and educational autonomy of the university and the faculty should be viewed in a similar fashion , not as an ancient right that must be defended but rather in terms of its current public purpose .That is , in what way does the autonomy of universities and their faculty serve and promote the underlying civic responsibilities of higher education ?There are compelling reasons for society to continue to support these so - called privileges , but they are seldom publicly articulated .Moreover , in the evolving world environment , the civic functions or public purposes of universities are perceived by many to have crossed national boundaries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "40.10912"}

{"text": "Perhaps the current disciplinary organization of the biomedical sciences should be abandoned .I have some sympathy for the idea that developments across the scientific frontier require the reorientation of a good deal of science and science education .Nowadays more and more scientists need to feel at home with biology , mathematics , and computation as well as the physical sciences .Moreover , substantial aspects of our research efforts in biology now require cooperation and participation as well with the social sciences and even philosophy .Contemporary developments in genetics , after all , may not only change our understanding of the notions of human identity , human equality , and human freedom , but cause us to rethink the standards and norms through which we organize our society .All these matters certainly need to be informed by science , but must also be informed by resources from other areas of human understanding .It is claimed by some that the rapidly increased sponsorship of research by for - profit companies at the nation 's academic health centers threatens to undermine the faculty 's academic freedom in biomedical science .Some suggest that the research agenda of the university faculty has become dominated by purely commercial considerations as opposed to intellectual values and the public good .Whether the public welfare is best served by a research agenda shaped by contemporary market forces or by the scholarly priorities of a relatively independent professoriate is an open issue .I am convinced that there are social benefits to a mixed strategy that retains a role for both .Although the impact of these factors can be exaggerated , it is clear that academic medicine , for example , is no longer as autonomous as it once was .Academia 's relationship with for - profit enterprises now extends well beyond the individual scientific investigator to include a large cohort of important university decision makers , including presidents and trustees .Nevertheless , there are few rules , regulations , or well - established precedents to provide appropriate oversight to the inevitable financial conflicts of interest for both institutions and institutional decision makers .The question remains : Are these changes , on balance , a good or a bad thing ?From one perspective , this increase in collaboration is a good thing in that it more fully integrates the nation 's biomedical and other resources in a joint effort to combat disease and otherwise improve the human condition .From another perspective , it creates a virtual flood of conflicts of interest within academic institutions , where it becomes less and less clear whose interests are being served by the collaboration .Certainly , the new alliance undermines traditional notions of faculty and university independence , the full participation of faculty in the intellectual commons , and the role of university faculty as disinterested creators and arbiters of knowledge .It may ultimately undermine the reputation of universities for independence and openness and eventually reduce public trust in the entire university enterprise .Indeed , as more and more scientists occupy roles in both academia and industry , the public , increasingly concerned about possible sources of bias in \" expert \" opinion , has become less certain where to turn for truly disinterested opinions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "41.638935"}

{"text": "On the other hand , the nation 's universities are understandably loath to give up their connection to a popular American enthusiasm .It seems clear to me that it is becoming harder and harder to distinguish intercollegiate athletics from professional athletics .Increasingly coaches and players are being recruited from a common pool , and intercollegiate athletics is increasingly governed by the values and needs of the commercial entertainment industry .Past history suggests that America 's universities will opt for as strong a continuing association with athletics as they can muster .They will continue to pursue increased commercial revenues , making the compromises needed to achieve this objective , with a simultaneous if less focused effort to achieve certain \" reforms \" that might limit the most serious compromises of academic values .Such reforms include attempts to limit practice times , increase revenue sharing between winners and losers , shift the structure of athletic scholarships , stiffen admissions requirements somewhat , and occasionally limit the expansion of season lengths in particular sports .Although such reforms are certainly useful , over time they will probably have a very limited impact and will be overwhelmed by the desire to win and to raise more revenue .Moreover , I would predict that both the cost of tickets and the level of institutional subsidy will increase substantially as efforts to contain costs prove ineffective .The NCAA has performed and continues to perform many extremely valuable services for intercollegiate athletics , but as I have already noted , the courts now allow the NCAA rather limited authority to act on commercial matters and intercollegiate athletics is decidedly a commercial activity .Perhaps the existing structure could be \" saved \" if the NCAA received an exemption from antitrust regulation ; this development appears quite unlikely .More likely is that an individual conference of like - minded schools would pursue new strategies .This would necessitate giving up on the idea of national champions that seems to underlie a good deal of the commercial revenues enjoyed by intercollegiate athletics .Nevertheless , I believe that if we restricted our aspirations to regional or conference - based championships , we might have many more happy fans , and even the media might have more fun trying to decide just who was best .In such an environment there might be six or eight teams who thought of themselves as national champions .I fail to see what harm would come from this .Failing such a proposal , which may strike many as naive , I return to the idea of greater transparency .At least that way , all constituencies can understand better the costs and benefits of the entire enterprise and either continue to support current trends or push for a realignment of values and aspirations .Social institutions have a complex array of privileges and responsibilities to the society that they serve and they are often required to compromise certain values in the pursuit of larger , but not purely self - serving objectives .Universities do this all the time as they search for a position of uneasy equipoise among the competing objectives that they wish to pursue .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "41.952217"}

{"text": "A : Universities need to begin by appreciating the particular challenges economically disadvantaged students face .One reality is that often low - income students can not afford to stop working to go to college .The cost of a college education , especially for a young person with dependent family members , is not only tuition and books , but also foregone wages .Although colleges have adapted somewhat to students who work , they are still often extremely resistant to meeting the demands of this group .In addition to changing the format of education to accommodate working students , universities need to pay attention to the practical and emotional barriers to college attendance low - income students face .First - generation college students often also confront a greater adjustment problem in college .I found in my study adjustment issues when attending college fell into three main categories or domains of experience : personal , family and structural .The individual or personal level was filled with stories of students going through identity formation transitions .In many ways this first domain is less controllable and is a place where social realities become apparent .The family sphere gets us into the cultural issues which are in many ways the most powerful influence on the experience of low - income college students .Finally , the larger unequal socio - political environment provides a context for the family and personal student experiences .I was surprised by the tension and conflict I heard expressed from students in interviews about their parents .Those especially talented students who make it to college often suffer from extraordinary pressure to succeed because in a concrete way the fate of their families rests with them .Q : What legislative strategies -- at the local , state and/or federal levels -- should be considered in order to increase the enrollment and retention of low - income students ?A : Changes to the funding of higher education and the way we regard institutions serving low - income students are central to a public policy agenda .I would n't be the first to point out that the funding system for public higher education in America is n't sufficient .On the international level , the United States ' lower comparative tax rate means that public education is less supported than most comparable nations .In this way , there is a lessened effect of redistribution of wealth and the encouragement of social mobility through public college opportunities for the poor in America .If public funding does n't increase , then we must have more flexibility in how public institutions can operate , perhaps borrowing methods from the independents while trying to maintain core mission priorities .In addition , it is increasingly expected that universities redouble efforts to find ways to operate more efficiently .We undervalue those institutions that often facilitate the greatest change in students .Let 's identify and reward institutions that serve students from low - income families .The competition by universities to climb over each other in the U.S. News & Report rankings has had a negative impact on low - income students because the quality measures work against them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "43.62664"}

{"text": "As a result , maintaining strength and quality in each of higher education 's sectors contributes to the strength of every component of the system .In my judgment it would be a mistake for each of these different sectors to lose their distinctiveness by , for example , becoming too much like one another or trying to emulate the so - called elite institutions .Although this tendency is understandable , I believe it should be resisted as a matter of public policy at both the state and the federal level .The American university continues to be enriched by the flow of talent and ideas from abroad , and it increasingly depends on it , just as talent and ideas from abroad increasingly depend on us .The health and vitality of American higher education will remain unfulfilled if our counterparts abroad are not prospering .In these lectures , however , I will focus primarily on the American research university , because this is an area of higher education in which I have spent my entire academic career and to which I have given my most careful consideration .Within this sector , however , I will not distinguish between the private and public research universities because their differences , which are significant , are not central to the particular issues I have chosen to address .My view is that despite some significant contrasts , private and public research universities have an enormous amount in common .Most important , they are members of a common educational and scholarly community .Moreover , they are quite dependent on one another , and faculty , students , ideas , and even academic resources move quickly and relatively freely among them .For the most part , faculty and students who move from one to the other can adapt easily because the basic nature of their work will be largely unaffected .Though senior administrative officials need to relate to somewhat different constituencies , many constituencies , such as students , faculty , alumni , and the federal government , are the same .Of course , one key difference is the special relationship of university officials and trustees of public universities with state government officials .As I reflect on my own experience first as president of the University of Michigan and then at Princeton , many obvious distinctions come to mind -- their differences in size , their relative commitments to professional education , their different but overlapping constituencies .Less noticed , but equally important and interesting , were two important distinctions relating to presidential leadership and overall governance .As a result , the university 's objectives and exactly what the university was and who it should serve were always in the process of negotiation .At Princeton the analogous challenge of mobilizing the university 's constituencies was somewhat different .By and large , the broader Princeton community shared a common set of objectives .Thus the board 's discussions -- or any intrauniversity negotiations -- were more likely to focus on strategy as opposed to objectives .On the governance front , there were at least two interesting differences .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.073795"}

{"text": "CONCLUSION .In an environment that is changing , the university will inevitably be the subject of debates about the relationship of its existing programs ' connectedness with its commitments to the changing needs of society .We must not avoid such discussions .In particular , we can not view such an ongoing dialogue as undermining our traditional values and autonomy .Rather , it is through this dialogue that our most important traditional values , such as autonomy , can be reinforced .Indeed , autonomy implies a level of responsibility and thoughtful responsiveness that make such a dialogue imperative .Such a dialogue can also help reach a social consensus on the structure of the scholarly and educational agenda and the appropriate use of our ever - expanding knowledge base .In addition , such dialogues support the university 's continuing role as both society 's thoughtful but responsive servant and society 's thoughtful but demanding critic .In this regard it is also important to recall that any institution of education gains social legitimacy only by fulfilling the specific responsibility of providing the next generation with the capacities , beliefs , and commitments thought necessary to ensure society 's goals .The nature of the particular array of institutions of higher education that society supports at any moment reveals a great deal about that society 's views .Little wonder , therefore , that controversy -- often socially productive controversy -- usually surrounds these institutions .In one critical respect universities must assume the leadership in the much - needed dialogue or conversation with other parts of society .In particular , it is up to the leadership of the research universities to sustain support for the notion that the research university can not fully meet its responsibilities if its intellectual independence is lost or compromised .What gives human beings their distinctiveness is not simply their desire to know , understand , and give shape to their place and time on this planet , but also their complementary desire to give their efforts greater meaning .The university 's intellectual independence comes with responsibilities not only to the world of scholarship , but also to the cultural and social aspirations we have for ourselves and our descendants .In this context , universities will need to define their own role in enabling our increasingly interdependent and diverse societies to define themselves in constitutional , political , and socioeconomic terms .The distinguished university , like the biosphere , is in a constant state of evolution characterized by an ever - changing kaleidoscope of both opportunities and constraints .Change may appear to be unnecessarily risky , but universities need to maintain a certain anxiety or uneasiness regarding whether or not their programs are continuing to meet their responsibilities in education and scholarship .Such anxieties and the honest self - examination they ought to occasion are essential ingredients in a university 's capacity to build and maintain its excellence .In the decades ahead , anxiety , courage , energy , adaptation , leadership , and change are the price of continued distinction and relevance in higher education .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.79948"}

{"text": "As a result , the flow of money to investigators and universities has increased , creating incentives for ever more vigorous pursuit of intellectual property rights .Understandably , this has increased the desire of many faculty and their universities to increase the likelihood of financial gain from their participation in the biomedical arena .Reinforcing these trends is the diminishing capacity of academic health centers to finance their own faculty 's research .One result of all this is an incentive for university - based investigators to make overly optimistic claims about real and potential discoveries .Another , more important one is the refusal of faculty to share material with colleagues , the sale of licenses becoming the primary vehicle to share knowledge .The biomedical enterprise , in other words , is undergoing a general retreat from the very idea of the commons of the mind , which for decades had defined both it and the university .This retreat has become serious enough to provide a number of serious academic based efforts to reopen the scientific literature and promote the greater sharing of intellectual and other scientific resources .For example , the Public Library of Science is a recently formed nonprofit organization of scientists now publishing its own journals and committed to making new scientific ideas , methods , results , and conclusions freely available to the public .There is widespread recognition that the vitality of the scientific enterprise requires access to the evolving knowledge base .Indeed , in 1992 the International Network for the Availability of Publication was formed to support such access on an international basis .Other forces , however , continue to pull in the opposite direction .In the public policy arena , for example , the U.S. government is using legislation and trade agreements to strengthen patent and copyright protection even further .Given the character of current research practices , the necessity of disentangling individual versus community claims to intellectual property has become ever more pressing .We often forget that even the idea of personal property is historically and culturally contingent , and may or may not be just .Our notions of personal property , of what we consider private , and of what we consider public matters are not culturally or economically neutral .Similarly , the notion that ideas can be appropriated as private intellectual property is also historically and socially contingent .As with personal property , it may be either a productive or an unproductive social concept .A good deal depends on our objectives .My own view is that the development of new knowledge is for the most part a collective social enterprise and we should use caution in assigning personal property rights in this arena .In any case , as with all new ideas developed as joint projects , it remains difficult to assign relative weights to the various property claims .Still , reasonable solutions should be available if we can keep our attention focused on the needs of the academic community and society as a whole .We should understand that these basic problems arise because the teaching and research activities of the faculty are now perceived to have substantial monetary value to interests outside the university .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.279633"}

{"text": "For good or ill , however , their support base has remained much more local .It is the responsibility of the university community to exert the moral and intellectual energy necessary to convince its local supporters that this transformation serves everyone 's interests .The historical record makes clear that eventually no facet of higher education is exempt from the impact of social change .The institutional history of American higher education reflects at its very base the need for a continuing examination of the relationship between the polity and the educational institution .Unlike many of the great European universities , the first American colleges were established not by independent groups of faculty and students or by royal initiative , but by private and public communities , and they were meant to serve important civic purposes .This was , perhaps , the first of the distinctively American contributions to the social structure of higher education .One key characteristic of the American research university that I believe must be retained whatever the changes that lie ahead is its dual role as both society 's servant and society 's critic .These universities must , therefore , continue to provide programs that the society itself has identified as important as well as raising those questions and issues that society does not want to address .In some ways , universities can meet their responsibilities only by being a nuisance to the existing order of things .Given that for the research university there are no uncontested ideas , it may well be inevitable that it will continue to exist in an unresolved state of anxiety with the status quo .The university will need to continue to provide those programs demanded by the society that supports it , while resisting the temptation to simply mold the younger generation in the image of its elders .Inherent in such a concept is the belief that the future is a carrier of new possibilities for humankind .RETAINING OUR SPECIAL ROLE : THE CHALLENGE OF NEW PARTNERS , NEW SPONSORS , NEW ARRANGEMENTS , AND COMMERCIALIZATION .One of the more serious issues many universities now face is the growing sway of private for - profit entities in the worlds of education and scholarship .Perhaps the most notable sources of this influence in recent years have come from the increase in joint ventures between universities and for - profit enterprises in engineering , biomedical research , and , increasingly , teaching .These alliances have also been facilitated by institutional developments and/or speculative environments in capital markets of the 1990s that allowed early - stage ideas to be transformed into hard cash rather quickly .Finally , there is the cautionary tale of \" big time \" intercollegiate athletics , which has become a thoroughly integrated component of the nation 's commercial entertainment business .Indeed , in certain areas we in higher education are experiencing an almost relentless growth in the commercialization of education and scholarship .This development has many interrelated causes .In part it is a result of the growth of for - profit institutions of higher education that have found educational niches that do not require direct subsidization , although their students are often dependent on the availability of federal and state financial aid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.108227"}

{"text": "In the last two decades , for example , industry 's sponsorship of the nation 's research and development has grown from a share of less than half to more than two - thirds .Within the university , the share of research sponsored by corporations has almost doubled during this same period .This increase is partly a result of explicit public policies aimed at the elimination of barriers between academic and industrial research , and partly a result of the increasing commercialization of intellectual property .In the period 1995 - 2000 , industrial expenditures on research and development grew almost threefold while university expenditures for research and development grew by only one - third !This commercialization is creating both new opportunities and new barriers to free and open communication among members of the scientific community .Substantial disagreement remains as to where , as a matter of principle or social utility , to lodge the ownership of new ideas .Does it belong more with society at large or with individual proprietors ?The resolution of this matter depends in part on whether or not the private ownership of new ideas , in either copyright or patent form , is defined as a temporary or quasi - permanent privilege .Finally , the greater presence of for - profit enterprises within the academy results from the never - ending quest of both faculty and administrators , acting in isolation from each other and from colleagues at other universities , to multiply the resources at their disposal .For any university acting alone it is a relatively straightforward matter to define expected costs and benefits .Such calculations ignore , however , the costs for higher education as whole .This is especially the case in a radically decentralized higher education system such as ours .As a result , important collective goods that are central to the ability of the academic community as a whole to meet its responsibilities to the worlds of education and scholarship could be compromised or lost .There is nothing wrong in principle with joint efforts between universities and for - profit enterprises .Indeed , substantial societal benefits may result from such cooperation .Nonetheless , however , seductive these activities may be , we must examine them carefully , because although the short - term costs are minimal , the possible long - term costs are easy to overlook .For good or ill , the increased presence of for - profit entities in education and research has altered the incentive structures in an arena where until recently universities had been enjoying a quasi monopoly of sorts .Of course new ideas have always come from a variety of sources and there have always been a variety of venues for advanced training .The problems with these new arrangements however , go beyond the natural controversy about the just distribution of costs and benefits between partners in a joint venture .There are reasons why for - profit and not - for - profit institutions were set up under different arrangements : either because their social roles were different or because the incentives of private markets were not thought to be appropriate to the public purpose of certain entities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.441124"}

Page of Princeton and Northwestern Universities respectively , we are no longer living in a democracy .The U.S. has already become an oligarchy .Sure we knew that already , but now we have confirmation from a scientific study .From BBC News : .[ T]he two professors have conducted exhaustive research to try to present data - driven support for this conclusion .Here 's how they explain it : . \"Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organised groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on US government policy , while average citizens and mass - based interest groups have little or no independent influence . \"In English : the wealthy few move policy , while the average American has little power .The two professors came to this conclusion after reviewing answers to 1,779 survey questions asked between 1981 and 2002 on public policy issues .They broke the responses down by income level , and then determined how often certain income levels and organised interest groups saw their policy preferences enacted .because of the strong status quo bias built into the US political system , even when fairly large majorities of Americans favour policy change , they generally do not get it .Americans do enjoy many features central to democratic governance , such as regular elections , freedom of speech and association and a widespread ( if still contested ) franchise .But we believe that if policymaking is dominated by powerful business organisations and a small number of affluent Americans , then America 's claims to being a democratic society are seriously threatened .These study 's results reinforce Larry Bartels ' findings about the tendency of white Americans to support the goals of the super rich even when it is not in their own best interest .Another quote from the study via Gawker : .The central point that emerges from our research is that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy , while mass - based interest groups and average citizens have little or no independent influence .Our results provide substantial support for theories of Economic Elite Domination and for theories of Biased Pluralism , but not for theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy or Majoritarian Pluralism ... .The theory of Economic Elite Domination is fairly self - explanatory .The theory of Biased Pluralism holds that policy outcomes \" tend to tilt towards the wishes of corporations and business and professional associations .\"The study notes that the position of the median American and the position of the affluent American are often the same ; therefore , regular people tend to think that their political interests are being represented when they see the triumph of some political position that they agree with .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.47359"}

Roosevelt failed to follow through on the promises he 'd made in the 1936 campaign ( though he neglects to point out that FDR was blocked by a conservative Congress ) .Go back earlier , and there 's a rich tradition of many Kansans voting Democratic for decades - people who understood the invaluable role of government .Dig deeper into the work of Frank and Wuthnow , though , and you 'll find a more nuanced view of Kansans .Through the 1950s , their powerful spirit of community was centered on home and church , where life made sense to them and they felt safely sheltered .They saw the nation 's borders , too , as sheltering walls , which had to be buttressed against potential invaders .Then the upheavals of the Vietnam war era left them confused and shaken , afraid that their personal , communal and national life would never again be secure .Since then , that fear has only grown deeper .Kansans still crave a life built on unassailable cultural foundations - \" the solid rock of certainty , \" as Frank puts it .But they ca n't find certainty because they feel that life has \" gotten too far away from the natural order of things \" ; the world has \" forsaken the true and correct path , \" leaving \" civilization in decay . \"So , they feel like \" helpless pawns caught in a machine ... victims besieged by a hateful world , \" driven by huge forces that seem to know no restraint , erasing every last shred of predictability and control .There 's a growing body of scientific evidence to explain the conservative mind and its plight .Conservatives are generally more easily frightened than liberals .They tend to have more trouble than liberals tolerating ambiguous situations and unstable systems .They are less open to new ( hence , unpredictable and unstable ) experiences , which is all that the world seems to throw at them anymore , as far as they can tell .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.50316"}

Coalition to Defend Affirmative Actio n ( 2014 ) .Race also matters because of persistent racial inequality in society - inequality that can not be ignored and that has produced stark socioeconomic disparities . \"And she added , \" the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race , and to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination .From a colorblind , post - racial perspective , America is viewed as having attained a state in which race , ethnicity , gender , and other ascriptive characteristics no longer play a significant role in shaping life opportunities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.908672"}

{"text": "The Brazilian government spends about 20 times per student in the public university , which is dominated by whites , compared to public K-12 , where nonwhites are disproportionately represented .Finally , the argument about uncertainty in racial classification is overblown in Brazil .A small percentage of the Brazilian population might straddle the white / nonwhite distinction since race is based strictly on appearance in Brazil but for the vast majority , there is no doubt .The presence of some ambiguity should n't be used to invalidate these policies , which are finally putting a dent in Brazil 's severe racial pyramid .Interestingly , Brazil 's anti - quota media has dug very deeply to find a handful of these cases .Around the world , children from ethnic , racial and linguistic minorities are being left behind in the quest for universal education , according to Lauren Feeney , multimedia producer for PBS 's documentary television series , Wide Angle .Feeney explains that the United Nations Millennium Development Goals , a set of targets for international development agreed to at the turn of the millennium , call for universal primary education by 2015 .While some progress has been made towards that goal in the last decade - today , nearly 90 percent of children are enrolled in primary school , compared to 85 percent in 2000 .Even as that is a victory to celebrate , there remain 75 million children are still out of school ; and of those , the majority are children from racial and ethnic minority groups .Although the U.N. does n't track progress based on racial or ethnic criteria , but a new report from Minority Rights Group International estimates that between 50 and 70 percent of out of school children are from minority and indigenous populations .This kind of racial inequality exists around the globe , in Latin America , in Australia , in Africa , in India and in Europe .As Joe wrote here recently , the treatment of Roma in Europe is one that is steeped in racism that few are willing to face .Indeed , speaking out about their treatment prompted crowds to boo pop - icon Madonna for speaking out in support of them .When it comes to the treatment of the Roma , and how Roma children are doing meeting the Millennium Development Goals , it 's difficult to tell .Fenney writes that most reports on the Millennium Development Goals do n't bother to track progress in highly developed countries such as those in the European Union , which Romania joined in 2007 . \"As for the goal of universal primary education , only 31 percent of Roma in Romania complete primary school , and Roma comprise between 2 and 10 percent of the population ( depending on who 's counting ) , so the goal is unlikely to be met .\" It 's an issue of mathematics , \" says Bokulic .Extrapolating from the non - data - collection on Roma in Europe , I assume that these reports are not being collected on indigenous and racial / ethnic minority groups here in the U.S. either .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.62301"}
{"text": "Furthermore , there is a sense that students have different college experiences , especially those from economically disadvantaged families .In terms of public policy , this has led to a hardened attitude towards the funding of higher education and financial aid policies .Starting with President Reagan , funding for public higher education in America was significantly shifted towards a reliance on loans .The argument was made that investment in college aid had been excessive .George H.W. Bush further cut federal grants to low - income students during his period in office .In the Clinton years , the New Democrats took the centrist strategy of targeted tax relief for middle - class families with children attending college .While at the state level funding has been up and down , the general pattern of flat funding for higher education has been continued up to the present .Loans are often not attractive to economically disadvantaged students because of practical and cultural hesitations to taking on loan debt .The numbers indicate that low - income students tend to take out loans less often and for lower amounts than middle and upper - class students .Q : You write that \" some institutions , especial[ly ] for - profits , opt out of the [ rankings / prestige ] competition and instead focus on meeting student needs directly .\" Do you see the burgeoning popularity of for - profits as generally a good thing for low - income students ?A : My research on for - profit and nontraditional universities , which was published five years ago in Lessons from the Edge , prompted me to look more closely at the experience of students from low - income families .Although the for - profit sector covers a diverse group of institutions , in general it disproportionately serves first - generation and lower - income students .Some point to this fact with alarm , as one sees in the current federal legislative discussions considering stronger controls , while the for - profits claim they are filling a gap in service that neither public nor independent institutions are sufficiently meeting .Regardless of how one interprets the work of for - profit institutions , the higher education community needs to ask what could be done to better serve students from low - income families so that these students have alternatives .The public universities with their access missions have a special responsibility to serve students from low - income families , and can gain from observing the for - profits .Many of the for - profits pay special attention to providing clear pathways for first - generation college students both in terms of psychological self - esteem issues and the practical aspects of attending college while working and raising families .That said , one needs to look critically at the practical impact of a college degree ( from any institution ) on students from low - income families because it clearly varies depending on the institution attended , major , and other factors such as access to post - graduation social networks .Additionally , for - profit colleges vary greatly among themselves with one of the biggest differentiators being regional accreditation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.66658"}

{"text": "Copyright and patent policies of universities are not completely coherent or consistent because they have been shaped by \" historic rights \" of quite different sorts .I have already outlined the policy with respect to textbooks .The policy with respect to patents has quite a different form , because historically universities have claimed ownership of this form of intellectual property .The property claim with respect to patents stems from the university 's role as the legal entity that receives funds from external sources and serves as a kind of trustee on behalf of both sponsor and researcher particularly in the area of scientific and engineering research .Thus we live with two polar solutions : In the case of books and other copyrightable materials , the individual faculty are granted ownership of the intellectual property , whereas in the case of patents , ownership is presumed to fall to the university itself .Given these remarkably different approaches plus the ambiguity concerning whether software is copyrightable or patentable , it is clear that university policies regarding copyright and patent as well as conflict of commitment / interest may now need clarification , reinterpretation , and/or modification .For example , existing policies that limit the amount of teaching faculty can do outside the university need to be clarified in relation to \" distance or Internet learning . \"Also , do these policies apply to teaching outside the academic year ?As with all new situations , I believe we should approach these and associated questions in a flexible manner ; although we may not yet fully understand the issues , we should not be paralyzed while awaiting fuller understanding .For example , it may be useful to ask ourselves which of these nontraditional faculty teaching activities require mere disclosure to departmental leadership and which require a more formal agreement between the university and the faculty member involved .Similarly , we need to clarify how to apply the university 's copyright and patent policies to \" distance teaching , \" especially when such programs require some ongoing interaction with faculty and/or students , or to \" courseware \" more generally .In addition , we may need to broaden our definition of teaching if we are to be confident that these new activities support rather than undermine the university 's core mission .Regardless of the technology used , the mere fact that a university faculty member teaches elsewhere potentially undermines demand for the institution 's campus - based offerings .Perhaps the key dividing line with such \" conflicts of commitment \" is whether faculty interaction and feedback is required to carry the instruction forward .With respect to copyright ownership of the materials , perhaps the key distinction is whether the university has made a specific additional commitment of resources to that particular project .When it has not , ownership of copyright would remain with the faculty member(s ) .In either case , appropriate recognition of the joint nature of the product should be recognized by some type of formal agreement and/or policy .Meanwhile , the university should remember that asserting even partial ownership claims over materials such as books , in which the faculty has enjoyed certain \" historic rights , \" is much more difficult than asserting copyright claims where new technologies are involved .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.686035"}

{"text": ".. it would be a mistake to think that because the US is a less racist , sexist and homophobic society , it is a more equal society .In fact , in certain crucial ways it is more unequal than it was 40 years ago .No group dedicated to ending economic inequality would be thinking today about declaring victory and going home .In 1969 , the top quintile of American wage - earners made 43 per cent of all the money earned in the US ; the bottom quintile made 4.1 per cent .In 2007 , the top quintile made 49.7 per cent ; the bottom quintile 3.4 .And while this inequality is both raced and gendered , it 's less so than you might think .White people , for example , make up about 70 per cent of the US population , and 62 per cent of those are in the bottom quintile .Progress in fighting racism has n't done them any good ; it has n't even been designed to do them any good .More generally , even if we succeeded completely in eliminating the effects of racism and sexism , we would not thereby have made any progress towards economic equality .True ; and one perhaps not irrelevant fact that leaps to mind here is that Martin Luther King Jr. was not assassinated until he started talking about economic injustice faced by all citizens in a militarized state waging unjust wars around the world .Michaels continues : .An obvious question , then , is how we are to understand the fact that we 've made so much progress in some areas while going backwards in others .And an almost equally obvious answer is that the areas in which we 've made progress have been those which are in fundamental accord with the deepest values of neoliberalism , and the one where we have n't is n't .We can put the point more directly by observing that increasing tolerance of economic inequality and increasing intolerance of racism , sexism and homophobia - of discrimination as such - are fundamental characteristics of neoliberalism .Hence the extraordinary advances in the battle against discrimination , and hence also its limits as a contribution to any left - wing politics .The increased inequalities of neoliberalism were not caused by racism and sexism and wo n't be cured by - they are n't even addressed by - anti - racism or anti - sexism .My point is not that anti - racism and anti - sexism are not good things .It is rather that they currently have nothing to do with left - wing politics , and that , insofar as they function as a substitute for it , can be a bad thing .American universities are exemplary here : they are less racist and sexist than they were 40 years ago and at the same time more elitist .The one serves as an alibi for the other : when you ask them for more equality , what they give you is more diversity .The neoliberal heart leaps up at the sound of glass ceilings shattering and at the sight of doctors , lawyers and professors of colour taking their place in the upper middle class .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.13621"}

{"text": "What we are headed towards , whether Republican elites like it or not , is a nation that is mostly multiracial and where whites are irrevocably becoming a numerical minority .I do n't think many Republicans have really taken that fact in , perhaps because it is hard to imagine in a nation that has been run by a white majority for centuries .But it 's happening , and evidence of the implications of this were even present in the last election .While some commentators like to pretend that Obama 's election is indicative of the fact that we 're past \" all the racial stuff \" , the reality is that most whites did not vote for Obama .It took a multiracial coalition of African Americans , Latino / as , Asian Americans , and a small but important minority of whites to get Obama into the White House .Ultimately , however , he won without the support of most whites , because there are finally enough Americans of color to have a significant , determining impact on electoral outcomes .Had Obama not had the foresight to appeal to a broad variety of racial groups , we would be dealing with President McCain and Vice President \" I Can See Russia From My House \" right now .Republicans would do well to think about how this dynamic plays into their \" more moderate or more conservative \" dilemma .What I think it means is that if they want to \" stick to their roots , \" that in itself needs to involve a fundamental paradigm shift .Of late , the Republican roots have n't just been small government and tax cuts , those roots have also included appealing to white racism and demonizing groups of color .Even though he broke with his party to champion immigration reform , McCain paid the price for his party 's thinly veiled anti - Latino / a sentiment when they went decisively for Obama .If Republicans want to stay relevant in an America that looks less and less like their base , they need to consider strategies that will endear them to the voters they 've been excluding from that base .Suggesting that these voters carry swine flu or are responsible for the housing crisis is not the way to do this .This does mean Republicans will have to make some changes that will probably be painful for them .They ca n't just do what has been comfortable in the past , like appealing to those charming folks who show up at their rallies with sock puppets that suggest Obama looks like a monkey .If Republicans want to stay a viable political party , it is time to drop the racist ideology , language , and imagery that has too often been a part of their \" core values .\" This alienates voters of color that they will need if they want to win at a national level .If they really want low taxes , they should consider how that can win them votes from the many black women who work in low - paying jobs and struggle to find affordable child care .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.8587"}

{"text": "Second , the Michigan board met in public .In both cases , many dedicated and thoughtful persons came to occupy seats on the governing board .However , the Michigan board 's public meetings often provided a venue or platform for the discussion of largely irrelevant but popular public issues and causes that became confused with university business and priorities .Ironically , that meant that , in order to avoid certain public discussion , and as long as a certain level of trust existed between the board and the president , the Michigan board was more likely to delegate its authority to the president .Trust between the president and the governing board is an essential ingredient in achieving the potential of any American university or college .The establishment and maintenance of this trust is the responsibility of the president and is primarily an educational function .In this respect it is important to acknowledge that although final authority over all matters rests with the board , the board 's responsibility is to use this authority wisely .The board may indeed be in charge , but they are in charge of an institution that serves a public purpose .Presidents must also act judiciously , but any time they believe that board actions present a serious threat to the institution 's informing values , they must say so publicly .Finally , I return to the two most critical characteristics that public and private universities share : they serve society as both a responsive servant and a thoughtful critic .In this latter respect the contemporary research university is a prototypical liberal institution , always looking for a better set of arrangements within a wide spectrum of our individual and community lives .These two roles define the nature of the university 's public trust , whether it is a public or private institution .In fact , many public universities have been rapidly privatizing some of their programs in the sense of substituting federal resources , private giving , and tuition revenues for state subsidies .This process , especially marked in areas of professional education such as law and business , has narrowed even further the difference between public and private research universities .We deployed this strategy among others in dealing with the financial crisis we faced in the early 1980s at the University of Michigan , although we seldom referred to it in these terms .Certainly , it was not our preferred path , but it was one line of attack within a broader overall program aimed at sustaining the quality of our programs .Although public and private research universities meet their various obligations in somewhat different fashions , they share the same central responsibilities as public trusts .The idea of the public trust , in somewhat different form , preceded the research university .The character or shape of this public trust will change over time .It is shaped most importantly by the public policies , cultural and political traditions , and legal framework of the liberal democracy of which colleges and universities are a part .Thus , when we think about the priorities of the research university we must be attentive not only to its special privileges , from its intellectual and educational autonomy to its special tax status , but also to its public obligations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.77626"}

Tucker declared unconstitutional an Arkansas law requiring public school or college teachers to file annually a list of organizations to which he belonged or regularly contributed .The Court extended first amendment protections to untenured teachers , thereby \" preventing governmental evaluations of their beliefs based upon organizational associations .\"The U.S. Supreme Court has also affirmed the notion that non - tenured professors receive constitutional protections from termination .Public institutions can not , for example , fire a tenured or non - tenured professor for expressing unpopular opinions .Moreover , the Supreme Court has established guidelines under which faculty at public institutions are entitled to procedural due process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution if their termination adversely affects a liberty or property interest .A property interest is defined as \" clearly [ having ] more than an abstract need or desire for it .He must have more than a unilateral expectation of it ... and must , instead , have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it .\" Failure to renew a non - tenured professor 's contract by itself does not adversely affect a liberty interest , and the length of employment of a non - tenured professor is generally irrelevant .In Board of Regents of State Colleges v.

Bush 's GOP or , for that matter , John Boehner 's .Bush presided over a reckless , ideological fiscal policy and a reckless , ideological war , but the eventual erosion of his public support had much less to do with ideological overreach than with perceived incompetence .As for Boehner , the remarkable intransigence of his Republican congressional caucus , even in the face of a national economic crisis , was rewarded with a midterm election triumph .And while Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of congressional Republicans ' performance , that will probably be no more decisive in 2012 than it was in 2010 ; American elections are referenda on the president , not on Congress .Edsall 's assumption that \" overestimating ideological support from the general public \" should lead to failure reflects his more general tendency to overestimate the significance of ideology in electoral politics and policy - making .This account overlooks a much simpler and more powerful factor in the 2010 election outcome : Electoral support for the president 's party routinely rises and falls with the state of the economy .Incumbent governments throughout the developed world have been swept under by similar economic tides in the past few years , with little regard for their ideologies or platforms or the external forces that dropped austerity on their doorsteps .In the meantime , Democrats scored an impressive series of legislative victories , most notably in passing a landmark health - care reform bill .Edsall has surprisingly little to say about the Affordable Care Act .He notes in passing that , if successful , this \" one - trillion - dollar program expanding health coverage to millions of the poor and near poor \" will \" vastly enlarge the universe of voters benefitting directly from government support , a constituency Republicans characterize as ' government - dependent .

John McCain of Arizona lost the 2008 presidential election because Obama has mobilized an uprising .\" People who could not even spell the word ' vote ' or say it in English put a committed socialist ideologue in the White House , \" he said .The kinds of literacy tests Tancredo suggests were once used in the U.S. under Jim Crow to keep blacks from voting .These racist laws were overturned with the Civil Rights Voting Act of 1965 .The big news story out of the convention was , of course , the keynote speech by Sarah Palin .Rich Benjamin is spot on when he writes in his analysis of Palin : . \" Packed beneath her beehive is a spitfire brew of optimistic , yet aggrieved , whiteness .Palin embodies a bizarre , sometimes alluring , combination of triumph and complaint that many Caucasian Tea Partiers identify with through and through .Deciphering the racial codes on the movement 's ubiquitous placards does not require a doctorate in semiotics .One popular sign shows the president 's face and a caption : ' Undocumented worker .

Shipman , Cato Institute , August 14 , 1995 ) .Today the average life expectancy is close to 80 while the retirement is still set at 65 and the ratio of Workers to Retirees has fallen to 2.94 to 1 ( Social Security Board of Trustees : Long - Range Financing Outlook Remains Unchanged , August 5 , 2010 ) .Assuming that the average working age started at age 16 in both 1950 and 2010 it means that in 1950 the average Worker worked for 49 years and retired for three years .Thus there would have been 16 Workers for every Retiree all age groups being equal .This matches with the statistic dead on .Today the average Worker works for 49 years and retires for 15 years .Do the math and you find out that this means there should be 3.3 Workers for every Retiree , all age groups being equal .Since the actual rate is 2.94 , that means that increased life span ALONE has caused 97 % of the reduction in the number of Workers per Retiree from 1950 to 2010 .Does everyone see the real trend yet ?Or does everyone still want to believe the propaganda that it is all the fault of the Baby Boomers ?This means that even if you flood the USA with immigrants today , as soon as those immigrants reach retirement age we will be back to the same old problem . \" These workers do not add to the program 's costs , as they do not have Social Security cards and thus can not claim benefits later on . \" Not true .Historically , when formerly illegal immigrants become legal ( e.g. after the 1986 amnesty ) , they can get credit for Social Security payments made while they were illegal .Illegal aliens already qualify for \" emergency \" medical treatment under Medicaid .In California , this includes regular kidney dialysis .And then there 's the fact that illegal workers depress wages , which depresses tax revenues .Finally , to evaluate the economic impact of illegal immigration , one needs to look at a lot more than Social Security in isolation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.811905"}

{"text": "Somehow Nobel prizes do not elicit such animation . . .although I hope they elicit even greater admiration .When I became president of Princeton , one of my first surprises was the amount of alumni mail I received from Princeton alumni on the subject of intercollegiate athletics .I had assumed , quite naively , that intercollegiate athletics in the Ivy League would have a lower profile .Nothing could have been farther from the truth , although the issues were quite different from those I had encountered in the Big Ten .Indeed , it quickly became apparent that in some ways intercollegiate athletics was much more important at Princeton than at Michigan !On reflection , the reasons were simple .Princeton fielded many more teams than Michigan did , with an undergraduate student body about one - sixth the size .The proportion of participating students is critically important , because its relative size determines its potential impact on the institution 's academic program .Organized and competitive college athletics unquestionably benefits many young men and women and other members of the broader community .Enthusiasts claim that participation in intercollegiate sports can build admirable qualities of character such as self - sacrifice , discipline , focus , and the capacity to work with others toward a common objective .I have no doubt that this is often the case , although such traits can also be achieved in intramural sports , alternative athletic pursuits , and many other activities that require dedication , teamwork , and hard work .Moreover , competitive athletes may also cultivate other less admirable traits such as the determination to win at any cost ( including the use of banned substances to enhance performance ) , and a rejection of the university 's core academic values .In fact , I believe there are unavoidable tensions between the commercial for - profit entertainment world of which \" big time \" intercollegiate athletics has become an integral part and an academic world that takes seriously its role to provide independent intellectual and moral leadership .Students are quite expert at understanding the difference between what we profess and what we do .The moral lessons we teach on our campuses come from actions , not propaganda .Athletics gets a good deal of public attention , but so do the many ethical lapses of students , coaches , administrators , university trustees , and occasionally faculty as they relate to the university 's athletic programs .The fact is that it may be impossible to be competitive in the athletic / entertainment business and also to stay true to the stated rules and principles of intercollegiate athletics .Commercial incentives in a \" winner - take - all \" marketplace not only may overwhelm the academic and moral integrity of the institutions involved , but also may involve the serious exploitation of some student athletes .Finally , as long as antitrust laws seem to prohibit the NCAA or other joint university efforts from regulating the commercial activities of its members , there may be no effective vehicle for reform .The Supreme Court has already opined that \" big time \" intercollegiate athletics is a commercial activity connected to the entertainment business .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.571686"}
{"text": "The major decisions of private universities must take the public interest into account .The answer to this question should depend , in significant measure , on how this decision will help the university meet its public obligations .For example , it may depend on how accessible the university is currently to talented young people across all socioeconomic classes .More important , all research universities , public or private , must constantly reevaluate whose interests are being served by their current policies and programs .Everyone 's interests can not be served at the same time .At Princeton , for example , our most significant initiatives in financial aid and enrollment were driven by just such an examination of the status quo ante .At Michigan during the difficult financial times of the early 1980s , our judgment was that we could best meet our public obligations by focusing on sustaining the quality of our programs , even at the cost of offering fewer programs .This judgment may or may not have been correct , but we approached the challenge in that spirit .Other institutions with their own distinctive traditions , resources , and aspirations , but facing similar or different challenges , might select quite different initiatives to meet their responsibilities as a public trust .Thus , although financial aid at Princeton is 100 percent need - based , many other research universities , both public and private , believe , quite appropriately , that some merit scholarships are essential to fulfilling their public responsibilities .THE DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UNIVERSITIES AND SOCIETY .It is hardly surprising that Western higher education has transformed itself and its relationship to society a number of times over the last millennium , given that society 's view of itself has also been transformed many times during this same period .A crisis in education is usually caused by a crisis in society that calls into question many existing ideas regarding the central issues of knowledge , culture , and society .The crisis fuels meaningful educational debates and propels changes in educational institutions such as universities .By meaningful debates I mean debates that lead to significant changes in the curriculum .Too often , long , drawn - out , and even bitter debates leave little trace on the learning experience of students .We often forget that it is not our internalized ideas regarding what we teach that matters , but what students learn , what they come to care about , and what they themselves become .In a rapidly changing world , the social role and form of the university and its programs exist in an almost perpetual state of transition facing constant challenges of leadership and adaptability .For example , the future role of the university will depend , in part , on the particular shape taken by our evolving liberal democracy .Will democracy evolve by focusing its efforts on individual choice and open access , or on the direct provision of economic and social benefits of one kind or another ?Alternatively , will our politics focus on trying to find a new position of political equipoise between group and individual rights ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.73381"}

{"text": "( All its members are Democratic but one . )But the PAC is chaired by Rep. Gregory Meeks ( D - N.Y. ) , a CBC member , and its 20-person board is made up of seven CBC members and several lobbyists , lawyers , and consultants .Some media accounts are depicting this endorsement as the action of the CBC .But Rep. Keith Ellison , a Minnesota Democrat and a CBC member , sent out an accusatory tweet shortly before the endorsement , complaining , \" Cong'l Black Caucus ( CBC ) has NOT endorsed in presidential .Separate CBCPAC endorsed withOUT input from CBC membership , including me .\" Ellison is one of two House members who have officially backed Sanders .The CBC PAC endorsement of Clinton was hosted at the Capitol Hill headquarters of the Democratic National Committee , which raises questions about the DNC 's supposed impartiality in the Clinton - Sanders race .An official at the Democratic National Committee says that the party had nothing to do with the CBC PAC 's event , which was held at DNC headquarters on Capitol Hill . \"Members of Congress who are dues paying members of the [ Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ] can reserve the space , \" he told Mother Jones in an email .As Mother Jones reported previously , Sanders was involved in the campus chapter of the Congress on Racial Equality ( CORE ) , another civil rights group : .During his junior year , Sanders , by then president of the university 's CORE chapter , led a picket of a Howard Johnson 's restaurant in Chicago , part of a coordinated nationwide protest against the motel and restaurant chain 's racially discriminatory policies .Sanders eventually resigned his post at CORE , citing a heavy workload , and took some time off from school .Under Sanders ' leadership , the CORE group at University of Chicago joined forces with SNCC 's campus chapter , held sit - ins to protest segregation in university - owned apartment buildings , and raised money for voter registration efforts focused on African Americans .The CBC PAC endorsement comes at a key time in the Democratic primary contest , as Clinton and Sanders head toward the next primary in South Carolina on February 27 .The Democratic electorate in that state has a high percentage of African Americans , and a crucial question for both campaigns is whether Sanders can find support with black voters or whether Clinton will maintain her commanding lead in the polls among this group .Political observers have pointed to South Carolina as the state where Clinton has a shot at arresting Sanders ' post - New Hampshire momentum due to her standing with black voters .With the fight on for black voters , endorsements from the African American community are important for each campaign - and Lewis ' comments wo n't help Sanders .Searching for undecided voters above the 45th parallel .It 's hard to get too lost on your way to Pittsburg , New Hampshire ( pop .You just drive north for a while .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.66476"}
