Freeman of the church , in a written statement , expressed his and the church 's appreciation for the CPD and Newman , \" who worked tirelessly to bring this investigation to a swift , yet conclusive end within this week .The final police report indicates that there was no abduction and no rape as had been earlier reported , \" Freeman wrote .Freeman added that the campuses of the church are well - patrolled , safe and secure .We open our arms of love , support , acceptance and welcome to every person involved in the events of this past week , \" Freeman wrote .\" We pray that First Baptist Church will continue to minister redemptively , effectively and with grace to all people in our community .In what has been a stressful week for the church , Freeman thanks the members of the church and the deacon body who stood by the pastoral staff throughout the incident .We thank the pastors and members of other churches who called to express their love , support and prayers , \" Freeman wrote .About the case .The woman told police on Sunday that a man grabbed her from behind around 12:20 p.m. that day and pulled her into a building on the church 's property , according to a police report .The woman told police the man was a stranger , according to the report , and that he raped her in an unknown room .She said she fought off the man .A writer named Lynn Harris recently characterized false rape reports as a \" bugaboo \" -- which is simply a more flippant term for \" myth . \"Use of this term is straight out of the sexual assault counselors ' playbook .They routinely discount the possibility of false reports by characterizing them as a \" myth .Could it be correct that men 's fears about false accusations are , indeed , exaggerated and that the only significant harm from false accusations is to innocent women who might be deterred from making legitimate rape claims ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.367455"}

{"text": "But three failures of reporting effort stand out .They involve basic , even routine journalistic practice - not special investigative effort .And if these reporting pathways had been followed , Rolling Stone very likely would have avoided trouble .I do n't think your reading should stop with the report .Media critic Jay Rosen , who also teaches at NYU , wrote on his PressThink blog that the report failed to identify an even bigger problem with the UVA story .In an early scene in the story , three friends of Jackie 's dissuade her from reporting the alleged attack for fear of what it might mean for her reputation on campus .Though Erdely describes this scene as an omniscient narrator , it turns out that the information came solely from Jackie , and that Erdely had not been able to find and interview the three friends .The Columbia report describes the decision to go ahead with the story without having interviewed the friends as \" the most consequential decision \" the magazine made that led to the journalistic failure .Rosen disagrees : .The most consequential decision Rolling Stone made was made at the beginning : to settle on a narrative and go in search of the story that would work just right for that narrative .The key term is emblematic .[ From the report : \" Erdely said she was searching for a single , emblematic college rape case that would show ' what it 's like to be on campus now . ' \" ] The report has too little to say about that fateful decision , probably because it 's not a breach of procedure but standard procedure in magazine - style journalism .( Should it be ? )This is my primary criticism of the Columbia report : it has too little to say about the \" emblem of ... \" problem ... .Idea : Maybe \" a single , emblematic college rape case \" does not exist .Maybe the hunt for such was ill - conceived from the start .Maybe that 's the wrong way for Rolling Stone to have begun .Washingtonian editor Andrew Beaujon made a similar observation , writing that along with the writing , editing and fact - checking , the style Erdely wrote in was partly to blame : .The story 's omniscient voice placed the reader at the scene of a shocking assault as well as a meeting between the victim and three friends on a Charlottesville street corner .It 's rarely clear in these scenes that everything we 're reading came from a single source Rolling Stone identified only as \" Jackie .\" The Columbia report noted that \" There is a tension in magazine and narrative editing between crafting a readable story - a story that flows - and providing clear attribution of quotations and facts .It can be clunky and disruptive to write ' she said ' over and over .\" Beaujon writes , \" Rolling Stone 's anti - clunk strategy , though , directly reflected a more basic problem with the story : The article 's fealty to narrative was more important than its commitment to reporting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.77391"}

{"text": "We see from the numerous false claims we report on this Web site that when women do recant , the recantations typically have the ring of truth .Women often admit that the initial false claim was made as an alibi to \" explain \" or to cover up an illicit consensual sexual relationship from a parent , a husband or a boyfriend .Usually they recant only after the police have discovered serious , often fatal problems with their story .Typically the target of their wrongful accusation is n't the man or boy with whom they were having illicit sex , but some other innocent man or boy who just happened to be in the neighborhood .Often the women do n't get to the point of naming a specific individual , but they cast aspersions on a hypothetical and , according to white middle class mores , \" scary \" stranger -- often a black or a foreign man .The point is that the recantations ring far truer than the initial rape claim .A recent news story vividly illustrates this peculiar and immoral double standard of the paid sexual assault industry where women must be believed if they cry rape but must be disbelieved if they recant .You recall that recently we reported on the death of Cathleen Crowell Webb , the infamous false accuser who recanted her lie that nearly sent a young man away to prison for decades .Here is another article that provides a detailed account of Ms. Webb 's lie and its aftermath .One interesting tidbit from that story reports on what a member of the sexual assault industry said after Ms. Webb recanted : . \"Meanwhile , many did not believe Webb 's story that she had never been raped , including 57 percent of respondents in CBS 2 's poll .Some became concerned the case could have a negative impact on women 's rights . 'I think that she has carried a great deal of guilt and shame and embarrassment , as many rape victims do , and never had the opportunity to resolve that .Had she had that opportunity - had victim services been available at the time - perhaps none of this would have happened .
