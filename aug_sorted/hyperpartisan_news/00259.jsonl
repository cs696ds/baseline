{"text": "Interesting post from the comments about Hank 's behavior .I think his group have a body .In large part I think that because of the description of Hank after the first shot was fired .The behaviors described are not those you 'd expect from an animal running away but have happened before with Bigfoot .From what I know about gunshot wounds , if a bullet passes through all soft tissue , the target may not even have been aware it was injured because there is no pain for up to several minutes .I assume a running animal would not look down to see the blood .Even if it did it would keep running because it did n't know better .That is important in and of itself but more so given Hank 's actions after the first shot .So Hank was functioning on adrenaline and at that point may not have realized he was wounded .The unusual behavior is that he circled back .Animals do n't normally so this .Neither do guys in suits .When animals run away , they make a straight line away from danger - they do n't go just out of sight and then loop back to get where you are n't looking .This is a behavior by Bigfoots that has been reported before .But since most encounters do n't include people shooting at Bigfoots , it is n't seen all the time .There is a place for people to , as the pompous - haired Matt Moneymaker says , \" Spend time in the field , \" but there is also a place for people to look at reports and see what those reports tell us of behavior .I 've read 100 's , maybe 1000 's , of reports of Bigfoot sightings .In several encounters where a Bigfoot was frightened away by one person in a group , instead of running directly away , it doubled back and either tackled or ran through someone else in the group .I do n't think the Bigfoot realized there was more than one person in the group oftentimes and was simply moving fast and not looking where it was going .I wish I had links to some of these reports , but I do n't and I 'm sorry .But the description of Hank running away and then doubling back - where they would n't be looking for him - just rings true as it were with some of the reports I 've read but is not something I 've seen commented on .Tell me , would a guy in a suit who Dyer was shooting blanks at come back and tackle a cameraman ?That must have been some suit to have fooled the Minnow cameraman that close up .If that happened , could Dyer shoot his suited accomplice to not reveal the hoax and get away with that ?Once again that is a real good suit .Also Minnow may not have said , \" Yes , he shot the thing , \" but if it was a fraud or hoax Dyer was pulling , they would sure said that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.254105"}
