{"text": "Victims .In 2005 , across all types of maltreatment , newborns to three - year - olds had the highest victimization rates .11 More than half were seven or younger .About half of all victims were boys , and half girls .White and Hispanic children have lower victimization rates than children of other ethnicities .The victim profile is somewhat different depending on the individual type of maltreatment : 12 .Physical abuse .The risk of physical abuse decreases as the child gets older , although adolescents are also victims of it .Boys and girls are equally at risk of minor physical abuse , although boys are slightly more likely to sustain serious injuries .Physical abuse occurs disproportionately among economically disadvantaged families .Income also affects the severity of abuse .Sexual abuse .Children are at highest risk of sexual abuse from ages seven to 12 , although sexual abuse among very young children does occur and is often undetected because of their inability to communicate what is happening to them .Sexual abuse victims tend to be selected because they are vulnerable in some way ( e.g. , very young , passive , quiet , needy ) .Girls are significantly more likely to be sexually abused than boys , although it is possible that boys are simply less likely to report their victimization .Neglect .The risk of neglect generally declines with age .The mean age of victims of neglect is six years old .Boys and girls are equally at risk of neglect .Children are never responsible for their victimization , but certain characteristics increase their vulnerability .Children 's need for attention and affection is their single most exploitable characteristic . 13 Particularly in the case of sexual abuse , a trusted adult may take advantage of a child 's natural curiosity , desire to be included , and need for affection .The relationship between children and their caretakers makes it difficult for children to interpret what is happening to them as \" abuse . \" A victim may also feel a sense of loyalty to the abuser , and while the victim may want the abuse to stop , he or she may not want the perpetrator to be punished .Children with disabilities are extremely dependent on adults , and this dependence limits their ability to protect themselves and , in some situations , their ability to disclose what is happening to them .Repeat Victimization .For many children who have experienced maltreatment , the efforts of police , child protective services , and other social services have been insufficient to prevent repeat victimization .In 2005 , approximately 6 percent of victims experienced another incident of abuse or neglect within six months of a substantiated finding of maltreatment .14One study found that the highest risk of subsequent abuse was within 30 to 60 days after the initial report .Situations that increased the risk of subsequent victimization included caretaker substance abuse and criminal behavior , and the lack of police involvement in the initial investigation .Perpetrators .Child abuse occurs in all cultural , ethnic , occupational , and socioeconomic groups .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.88922"}

{"text": "Such a restricted focus creates the risk that cases involving imminent danger or chronic patterns of less serious injuries will not benefit from police involvement .Reporting laws should require people to notify the police of serious injuries and cases in which imminent danger exists , along with cases that child protective services deem appropriate for police involvement .29 Reporting laws must also clearly specify the point at which police must be notified .Increasing line officers ' awareness of suspicious injuries .Incidents of child abuse and neglect often go undetected because police or other first responders coming into contact with children do not identify injuries , conditions , or behaviors as suspicious .Children sustain many accidental injuries , but caretakers may also inflict them .During their normal course of duty , responding to calls for service or functioning as school resource officers , police must take proactive steps to assess the condition of all children present .From there , asking the child how he or she was injured may produce inconsistencies that suggest the injury was not accidental .There are many high - quality resources for police to develop skill in identifying suspicious injuries .In response , the department 's Domestic Abuse Reduction Team revised its standard report to note the children 's presence at domestic violence incidents , even those who were not directly involved .Detectives follow up on the children 's condition after the initial visit and also notify the prosecutor of the children 's presence so that their needs can be included in diversion agreements ( LaCrosse Police Department 1999 ) .Creating police agency policy regarding child abuse and neglect .Written policies help to establish professional standards and can elevate the quality of police investigations .Policy statements should include clear direction on the steps police must take when a suspected child abuse or neglect report comes to their attention .31 They should also provide police with specific guidelines for making crucial decisions such as removing a child from the home or arresting a suspect .Increasing the reliability of statements made by victims of child abuse and neglect .Interviewing skills .Poorly conducted interviews can alienate and upset child victims .Failing to adapt interview techniques to the special needs of child victims can lead to an inaccurate understanding of the facts and can create opportunities for inconsistencies and errors that may be challenged in court .33 The reliability of victims ' statements is enhanced when police do the following : 34 .Make the interview setting child - friendly .Recognize the developmental capabilities of children of different ages .Exercise patience when asking the child to explain what happened .Avoid \" why \" questions and focus instead on clear , open - ended questions about salient events .Make efforts to offset any guilt the victim may experience for \" causing trouble . \"Training .Numerous training programs to enhance interviewers ' skills are available .They should be grounded in child development and best - practice research .Not only should courses present information on legal issues , child - abuse dynamics , child development , evidence - gathering , and interviewing skills , but also they should provide many opportunities for attendees to practice the skills they have learned and to receive specific feedback from trained observers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.966156"}

{"text": "This positive support starts with the parents .Rauh observed that some mothers responded to their childrens initiatives in play in a relaxed manner ; they were attentive and friendly without trying to control what was happening , which cultivated an especially close attachment between child and mother .Other mothers remained detached from their sons or daughters play , which left the child detached as well .When mothers seemed to have a need to be constantly involved by controlling and limiting the childs activity , it made the child insecure .Children who felt confident of their mothers interest behaved in a more relaxed way and presumably would adapt better to their surroundings .Special games can help infants as well .Jutta Hatzer , a special - education teacher in Bremen , emphasizes simple measures designed to reinforce self - awareness during a childs first year of life .She demonstrated one exercise during a session with a one - year - old boy , Tom .She stood Tom in a large bucket filled halfway with dry beans , which reached his waist .The beans acted like little massage balls for the baby , who sat quietly and happily in his snug lair .The enclosure provides security , Hatzer explains .He can feel his body , sense his limits and get a firsthand notion of himself .After a while , Hatzer encouraged Tom to grasp the beans .Everything proceeded slowly , step by step -- the boy needed plenty of time to deal with each new situation .Hatzer sang simple , made - up songs describing each step ( Tom is in the bucket ) .She repeated each phrase several times and soothed Tom with both words and gestures .Through this continuous communication and play the child learned to understand links between his internal and external worlds .This kind of early support , which for Tom began shortly after he was born , is designed to bolster his mental development so that it will be easier for him to learn to walk and talk later .Some therapists recommend that caregivers use hand and arm gestures in conjunction with words .The children seem to learn gestures very quickly , helping them grasp the meaning of spoken words .For example , the boy mentioned earlier who got cheese instead of a hamburger might have better understood an accompanying gesture for hamburger -- such as pretending to hold and bite the burger -- which could have prevented the misunderstanding .To bring Down syndrome children along , adults must also be careful not to appear standoffish or afraid of them .People with Down syndrome do not suffer from their disorder -- only from inappropriately high demands from their environment .They are just a little different .They think differently , handle emotions differently , view things differently , look a bit different and sometimes react in ways we do not expect .They are full of originality and creativity but often do need a lot of encouragement for it to show .If those around them can accept them and be positive , they will develop into full personalities who know what they want and do nt want .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.28743"}

Children and youth ( ages 3 - 21 ) receive special education and related services under IDEA Part B. .Inclusion : An inclusion classroom is generally the same size as a regular education classroom .The class population is mixed with kids with and without special education services .The children with special education services all have IEP 's ; however , the intention of inclusion is that the kids do not know who receives special education services and who does not .There are two teachers in the room co - teaching ; a special education teacher and a regular education teacher .In some cases there is a special education assistant or para - professional rather than a special education teacher .The teachers in the classroom help all the students ; however , it is the job of the special education teacher to ensure that the student 's IEP 's are implemented and followed correctly .Students often break into small groups for more intensive instruction .Intervention : Many times schools will try interventions with students who have more intensive academic or behavioral needs than the average student .The purpose of the interventions is to try to improve the child 's academic performance or behavior without utilizing special education services .Many times a school will try interventions before suggesting that a student receive an evaluation for special education .For students who are already in the process of receiving an evaluation , it is best practice to keep interventions going during the evaluation process .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.67209"}

{"text": "By protecting children , we ensure that New York State will have a brighter future for all citizens .Preface : 2001 This handbook was written to serve as a guide through the complex structure of New York State 's Child Protective Services System .In addition , this handbook is designed to expand awareness of child abuse and highlight the process that occurs when child abuse is reported .Laws and programs designed to protect children must change to reflect overall changes in society .The New York State Legislature has responded by passing laws to increase and strengthen the State 's protection of children over the past years .For example , in 1995 , legislation was signed into law that required physician assistants to report any suspected cases of child abuse .In addition , other programs , such as the Children and Family Trust Fund , have been designed to provide funding to combat family violence , child abuse , domestic violence , and elder abuse .Further changes are pending as the State and Federal governments look for ways to reduce costs .Despite increased pressure to reduce government spending , the Assembly remains committed to serving and protecting children and their families in the years to come .The Assembly will continue its commitment to protecting children by strengthening present laws , improving CPS training programs , and providing important information about child protective services .The use of this book is intended not only for those who are mandated reporters , child protective service workers and law enforcement personnel , but for all who are concerned about the protection of children and the prevention of child abuse and neglect in New York State .As the chairman of the Assembly Committee on Children and Families , I am prepared to continue my efforts to protect the children of this State and welcome your ideas and suggestions .Sincerely , Roger L.
