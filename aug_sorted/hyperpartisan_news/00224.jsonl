Patrick Leahy , D - Vt .In Wainstein 's case , Democrats could point to his experience in establishing and running the department 's national security division , an important component in the fight against terrorism .Earlier in the Bush administration , Wainstein served as FBI general counsel and then as Mueller 's chief of staff .Democrats could point out Comey 's occasional differences with the Republican White House he served , such as his dramatic refusal to reauthorize the administration 's warrantless wiretapping program until Bush agreed to changes .Comey has told Congress that when he refused to certify the program , Bush White House officials Gonzales and Andrew Card headed to Attorney General John Ashcroft 's bed in a hospital intensive care unit to get him to approve .Comey and Mueller also raced there to help fend off the White House pressure .When Gonzales appealed to Ashcroft , the ailing attorney general lifted his head off the pillow and in straightforward terms described his reservations about the program , Comey said .Then Ashcroft pointed out that Comey , not he , held the powers of the attorney general .Comey and other senior government officials expressed concerns about whether the National Security Agency had the proper oversight in place for the program and whether any president had authority to authorize the program as it operated at the time .There is precedent for choosing a candidate who is an FBI insider .Clarence Kelley spent two decades with the FBI and came out of retirement to run it .With that backdrop , John S. Pistole , a 26-year FBI veteran who was second - in - command during much of Mueller 's tenure and now heads the Transportation Security Administration , is seen as a candidate .Some potential nominees might run into Republican opposition on Capitol Hill , particularly Patrick Fitzgerald , the U.S. attorney in Chicago since 2001 .Fitzgerald is best - known for prosecuting I. Lewis \" Scooter \" Libby , Vice President Dick Cheney 's former chief of staff in the Valerie Plame affair .Some Republicans view Fitzgerald 's conduct as an illustration of prosecutorial overreach .Libby was never charged with leaking Plame 's CIA identity ; he was convicted of perjury , obstruction and lying to the FBI during the leak investigation .Some potential nominees probably would turn down the job if it were offered .Ronald K. Noble , the first American to serve as secretary general of Interpol and the Treasury Department undersecretary for enforcement in the Clinton administration , was recently overwhelmingly re - elected to a third five - year term by Interpol 's 188 member countries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.594536"}

Traxler Jr. , writing for the majority , found that the Maryland law \" significantly burdens the exercise of the right to arm oneself at home \" and should have been analyzed using a more stringent legal standard .[ ... ] .The Maryland law was challenged by a group of gun - store owners and individuals who said the prohibited firearms are not military weapons and are used for lawful purposes such as self - defense , target practice and hunting .Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh ( D ) , who helped pass the law as a state senator , said Thursday that the court majority got it wrong .\" I think it 's just common sense that the Second Amendment does not give people a right to own military - style assault weapons , \" he said .In a strongly worded dissent , Judge Robert B.

Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had one more retirement home rumble before New Hampshire residents flock to the polls Tuesday .In some areas , the two candidates showed great respect for one another , along with agreement on some policy issues .At other times , the gloves came off and things got a bit testy .NBC 's Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow moderated the debate .Bernie Sanders opened by saying that millions are leaving political process because they know the economy is rigged .The top one percent is reaping the benefits , and there 's a corrupt campaign finance system is keeping that system in place via donations to super PACs .We need to work to create an economy that works for all .Hillary Clinton said that we could get back on the right track , where wages reflect people 's work .I 'm fighting for people , and I 'm not making promises I can not keep .Clinton said that she shares a lot of policy goals with Sen. Sanders , like fighting for universal health care .She said that she wants to build on the progress we 've made .I do n't want to rip away coverage for Americans .She added that she believes in affordable college , but thinks free college is a bit of a pie - in - the - sky initiative .She respectfully noted that many of Sanders ' policy ideas are unrealistic .Sanders , of course , disagreed , noting that he 's known Clinton for 25 years and respects her very much .But he cited Canada , France , and other industrialized nations having health care systems that consider such benefits as a fundamental human right .He did n't accept the position that U.S. can not do the same here .Oh , and to pay for tuition - free higher education , he plans to tax Wall Street .Moreover , he denied that he would dismantle Obamacare , adding that the Affordable Care Act been good for the country .But also mentioned that 29 million still have no insurance , some are under - insured , and we need to move forward with a health care for all agenda .When asked about the meaning of being a \" progressive \" by Rachel Maddow , Clinton hit Sanders for voting against the Brady bill five times and the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act .The Brady bill established a national background check system for firearms purchases , while the PLCAA offered a legal shield to gun manufacturers from being sued if their guns are unwillingly and unknowingly used in felonious activities that result in fatalities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.22571"}

{"text": "Well , today we play part two of our interview with the son of Kenneth Chamberlain , Kenneth Chamberlain Jr. , and the family 's lawyers , Mayo Bartlett and Abdulwali Muhammad .I began by asking Mayo Bartlett about some of the cases that he has represented over the years and the climate in White Plains , New York , right now .Mayo Bartlett is the former chief of the Bias Crimes Unit of the Westchester County District Attorney 's Office and the former chair of the Westchester County Human Rights Commission .This is what he had to say .MAYO BARTLETT : Within the housing authority itself , there are a lot of individuals who get arrested under what 's called a one - strike policy .And that basically is a bar - out policy in the public housing .And what we have is a rash of individuals who have been arrested for being in public housing , and they 're charged with trespass .And some of these people actually either work at public housing or they live there , or they 're going to visit friends or family members .And a number of these individuals are not on a bar - out list , they 're not trespassing , but they get arrested by police , and they will spend up to a week , and sometimes more , in jail because of this .AMY GOODMAN : When was this ?MAYO BARTLETT :This was , I believe , approximately three , maybe four , years ago .AMY GOODMAN : No , say again what happened .MAYO BARTLETT : These individuals were arrested by the White Plains Police Department .They were brought in to be booked for disorderly conduct and possibly a misdemeanor , something that you would expect they 'd be released for .And they were beaten up .One individual was a recent law school graduate .And the police actually put hoods over their heads , similar to the way Lynndie England placed hoods over the individuals ' heads in Abu Ghraib .And they had anti - Muslim and anti - Arab sentiment stated toward them by the White Plains Police Department .AMY GOODMAN : What happened to them ?MAYO BARTLETT :Well , these individuals , we discussed the possibility of going forward with a civil suit .The one individual expressed reservations because he thought there may be some repercussions with respect to his ability to practice law .And the brothers also were considering whether that was something that made sense for them to do , because when things like this happen , it takes a lot of courage to go forward , and it 's very intimidating .The LifeAid system that your father used , a medical pendant , because he had a bad heart , somehow had gone off , and the LifeAid company called the police to check on him .When they got there , he was OK .He said to them , \" I 'm not going to let you in , but I 'm fine . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.62341"}

Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had one more retirement home rumble before New Hampshire residents flock to the polls Tuesday .In some areas , the two candidates showed great respect for one another , along with agreement on some policy issues .At other times , the gloves came off and things got a bit testy .NBC 's Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow moderated the debate .Bernie Sanders opened by saying that millions are leaving political process because they know the economy is rigged .The top one percent is reaping the benefits , and there 's a corrupt campaign finance system is keeping that system in place via donations to super PACs .We need to work to create an economy that works for all .Hillary Clinton said that we could get back on the right track , where wages reflect people 's work .I 'm fighting for people , and I 'm not making promises I can not keep .Clinton said that she shares a lot of policy goals with Sen. Sanders , like fighting for universal health care .She said that she wants to build on the progress we 've made .I do n't want to rip away coverage for Americans .She added that she believes in affordable college , but thinks free college is a bit of a pie - in - the - sky initiative .She respectfully noted that many of Sanders ' policy ideas are unrealistic .Sanders , of course , disagreed , noting that he 's known Clinton for 25 years and respects her very much .But he cited Canada , France , and other industrialized nations having health care systems that consider such benefits as a fundamental human right .He did n't accept the position that U.S. can not do the same here .Oh , and to pay for tuition - free higher education , he plans to tax Wall Street .Moreover , he denied that he would dismantle Obamacare , adding that the Affordable Care Act been good for the country .But also mentioned that 29 million still have no insurance , some are under - insured , and we need to move forward with a health care for all agenda .When asked about the meaning of being a \" progressive \" by Rachel Maddow , Clinton hit Sanders for voting against the Brady bill five times and the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act .The Brady bill established a national background check system for firearms purchases , while the PLCAA offered a legal shield to gun manufacturers from being sued if their guns are unwillingly and unknowingly used in felonious activities that result in fatalities .It 's a good law - one that prevents anti - gun liberals from suing the industry out of existence .Throughout the debate , Sanders was apt to point out that he is the anti - establishment candidate , despite being in Congress for over 20 years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.49186"}

{"text": "I 've seen different explanations of nihilism .At one point I thought a useful definition for one who is skeptical without sufficient proof would be a nihilist , but then I realized that was n't an apt description .Ah , I should have read that a long time ago .No question I 'm an epistemological nihilist , and would love to know whether or not moral and existential nihilist philosophy are congruent with reality .I 'm really torn between accepting and denying those last two .The other forms ( political , mereological , and metaphysical ) are n't as important to me .I tend to think of epistemological nihilism as agnosticism , but one can get caught up in semantics about such definitions .Well glad to help out , on the subjects of moral and existential nihilism , well I hope it does n't cause you as much pain , or take as much time , as it did with me to find where my compass pointed on those matters . and loving the \" A Clockwork Orange \" just for that I 'm giving you GA 's .LOL .As a last resort , if it 's the only way to save the lives of innocent people , soldiers , police , or private citizens can wound or kill the perpetrator(s ) .However , this does n't justify the death penalty , because preventing future crimes can be achieved by life sentences as well .NATO soldiers for example stop the slaughter of innocent people in Kosovo .In Rwanda soldiers did n't intervene which led to the death of hundreds of thousands of innocent people .What is certain is that Cregan is going to spend a lot of time behind bars .In England and Wales the killing of a police officer means an automatic prison sentence of 30 years minimum with no hope of parole before that time .Cregan killed two police officers so I 'm assuming that he will be given at least 60 years in total for that .However , English and Welsh law also states that someone who pre - plans and then commits a multiple murder should be sentenced to the rest of their life in prison without hope of parole - a whole life tariff .In other words they are sentenced to die in prison .So it 's also likely that Cregan will get that sentence for the murder of the cops if it is established that he pre - planned the killing , which seems to be the case .The unplanned killing of more than one person also means a minimum of 30 years in prison .So if he 's found guilty of murdering the father and son , then he will be given another 30 years minimum - or another whole life tariff if he pre - planned it .However , there are now calls , led by Lord Tebbitt - which I support - to bring back hanging in England and Wales for anyone who kills a police officer .This is something which needs to be introduced soon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.00101"}

{"text": "We exchanged cards and pleasantries and then Strzok asked us if we were ready to check out the clock tower .Were we ever .We took an elevator to the 17th floor to a massive room with four walls of windows that offer a spectacular view of the city .At this point , we were actually above the clock faces .The spacious room had multiple comfy couches , along with a bar , and although it seems like the ideal space for a party or wedding reception , Strzok says it is n't available for the public to rent .Instead , it is used for Rockwell Automation corporate events .We chatted about the history of the clock tower and learned that it was designed and built by Allen - Bradley employees .On Oct. 31 , 1962 , it took its first tick , and from 1962 to 2010 , it was the largest four - sided clock in the world .Currently , it is the largest four - sided clock in the Western Hemisphere .The largest in the world now sits atop a skyscraper in Saudi Arabia .According to Strzok , when the clock was originally built , an agreement was made that it would not include chimes so England 's Big Ben could remain the largest four - sided , chiming clock in the world .The face of each clock measures just over 40 feet on all sides .The minute hands are 20 feet long and the hour hands are almost 16 feet long .Aside from being a Milwaukee landmark , the clock functions as a navigational aid for ships at night .The clock is actually four separate synchronized clocks that all keep Milwaukee time . \"And if one of them gets a little off , we hear about it from neighbors , \" says Strzok .When the clocks need to be changed , Strzok says a security person goes out onto the street and communicates with the person inside adjusting the clock 's controls , literally saying things like \" a little more , a little more , OK , stop ! \"On a side note , it 's interesting that the clock tower is referred to as \" the Polish Moon \" instead of the Polish \" moons \" considering there are four of them .We next went to the roof of the tower and stood next to the American flag , whipping in the wind .With the 16-by-20-foot flag projecting another 50 feet into the sky , the clock tower is 333 feet tall in total .Strzok says because of the height , heavy winds take a toll on the flags .\" We 're lucky if we get a month out of one , \" he says .The view of the city was incredible .Interestingly , the same landmarks that stick out to me when I 'm driving around were the most notable from 300 feet higher up : Miller Park , the Basillica , the Hoan Bridge , the mural of peace on the Esperanza Unida International Building .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "130.4249"}
