Don Hutto Residential Center \" opened in May 2006 .Most of the families previously housed at this residential center , like those currently housed at the Artesia and Karnes Detention Centers , were families awaiting adjudication of their asylum claims .For the most part , the facility was a staging area for families waiting to be put through the deportation machinery the government has so efficiently developed to almost \" guarantee \" the expedited removal to their home countries .What is most appalling is that none of the families held at the former prison were charged with offenses other than illegal entry .In 2007 , the Women 's Refugee Commission released a report , Locking Up Family Values : The Detention of Immigrant Families , drawing heavily on research conducted at the T. Don Hutto Residential Center .In August 2007 , the ACLU settled the lawsuit , and on August 6 , 2009 , federal officials announced that T. Don Hutto would no longer house immigrant families .In September 2009 , the last families left the facility and were moved to the much smaller Berks Family Residential Center in Pennsylvania .Recent reports from volunteer attorneys providing free legal representation to the women and children imprisoned at Artesia and Karnes prove otherwise .A prison for women and children can not be made right .These facilities are nothing but well - oiled deportation machinery run under the semblance of due process and rule of law .Women and children are considered prisoners and treated as such .They are intimidated with detention for extended periods of time : mothers are coerced to sign forms they do not understand or warned they will be taken to a higher security prison and their children removed to foster care .To add insult to injury , ICE has just announced it will open an additional facility in South Texas to house adults with children .The facility will be located in Dilley , Texas , a small unassuming oil town in the middle of nowhere .The center , ICE reports , is in response to the influx of adults traveling with children apprehended along the Southwest border .Expected to open in early November , the South Texas Family Residential Center will be the fourth facility the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) is using to detain and expedite the removal of adults with children .Volunteer attorneys are successfully slowing down the deportation mill at Artesia ; they are effectively preventing this monster from grinding out vulnerable mothers and children .So what does the government do ?Find other remote locations where access to counsel is limited if not impossible , and build another deportation machine .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.98541"}

{"text": "To see all the blog posts about this issue select Family Detention as the category on the right side of this page .The days when one spouse remained at home and the other went to work are n't the norm any longer in our society .Although there may still be some households where only one spouse works outside the home , in many cases having two working spouses is one of the requirements of the economic and societal reality within which we now live .While the Cleavers exemplified the idealized middle - class suburban family of the mid-20th century , times have changed , and now Modern Family brings us the experiences of diverse family units .Decades of changes within our own culture and values have led to the recognition of both spouses ' talents outside the home .The traditional roles of domestic spouses and working spouses are no longer rigid models in a family and with two incomes the overall financial stability and security of many family units has improved .Our country 's H-1B visa program however , lagged behind these realities until last week when the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service ( USCIS ) finally announced a visa rule revision that will allow spouses of some highly skilled immigrants to apply to work in the United States .This rule recognizes the contributions spouses of foreign workers can also bring to our society and economy .USCIS director Leon Rodriguez noted that \" [ spouses ] are , in many cases , in their own right highly skilled workers , \" and that \" many families struggled financially when a spouse could n't work , and in some cases returned to their country . \" More importantly this rule revision will have a tremendous effect on immigrant women because a large number of the H-1B spouses are , in fact , women .Women who may have completed advanced degrees in their home country and are well qualified to hold jobs in their own professions , but who until now have been barred from doing so .They have had to make a choice , either to pursue their own career or focus entirely on their spouse 's while he was employed on an H-1B visa .The Administration 's willingness to recognize these inequities for immigrant women living in our society and the agency 's action in revising this arcane rule is another step forward in remedying the complex and outdated rules in our current immigration system .The announcement and the impact the revision of the rule will have on many foreign workers and their families are welcomed , but this is only a limited remedy .It is important to note that the new authorization does n't apply to the spouses of all H-1B visa holders .The regulations only cover those whose H-1B partners are seeking permanent legal residency and for whom the agency has already approved an employer petition to start the process .Our immigration system remains a product of the past century and hinders our country 's ability to remain competitive in this global economy .The efforts by this Administration to bring relief to companies seeking to keep or hire talent should be a catalyst for Congress to get to work on further reform of our immigration laws .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.45157"}

{"text": "It is nothing short of a wholesale takeover of the financial services and banking industries , much like Obamacare is to the healthcare industry .As House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling ( R - TX ) recently said , Dodd - Frank is \" more appropriate for a Soviet - style command - and - control economy than a system of free enterprise .There are a number of serious problems with this bill .Here are some of the worst aspects : .Too Big to Fail : - Title I of the bill created a new permanent bailout regime , the Financial Stability Oversight Council .This institution would vitiate the bankruptcy process and allow the government to take over any entity that it deems vital to the rest of the economy .In other words , it consummates \" too big to fail \" as a permanent policy , the very policy this bill was supposed to fix .Volcker Rule - The Volcker rule ostensibly prohibits regular banks from investing their own money by engaging in bond trading .It also prohibits banks from holding more than a 3 % stake in private equity funds .Just this part of the bill is 300 pages long !It will take hundreds of new Keynesian jobs just to enforce , interpret , and comply with the rule .CFPB - The bill created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFBP ) , which will limit the choices of consumers in financial markets , making it harder and more expensive to obtain credit .This unaccountable agency will operate autonomously within the Federal Reserve and will not be subjected to congressional appropriations or oversight .It is essentially the \" death panel \" of the financial sector , with control over bank accounts , mortgages , and student loans .Derivatives Trades - Some key restrictions on derivatives trades only apply to banks with assets above $ 10 billion .This has created a perverse incentive for banks to limit their expansion , and by extension , creation of jobs , for the purpose of staying below the limit .Debit Card Fees - The new limitations on bank charges for processing debit card submissions from retailers has caused an increase in user fees for customers , most notably , for opening checking accounts .It has also prompted banks to eliminate debit card rewards programs .Freddie / Fannie - Dodd - Frank did nothing to privatize or even reform these two behemoths that are responsible for the housing crisis and the recession .It 's no wonder such an odious law was conceived by two of the most corrupt members of Congress - Barney Frank and Chris Dodd - who were largely responsible for the housing crisis and ensuing freezing of the credit market .Sadly , three Republicans joined with Democrats to give opponents of free enterprise 60 votes in the Senate to pass the bill .And with energy to repeal even Obamacare is gradually waning , it 's becoming harder to rally Republicans against this un - American law .While we are all focused on the more imminent threats of open borders , Obamacare , and our weak national defense , it 's important to remember that Dodd - Frank , rather than preventing a financial crisis , will serve as the foundation for the next financial meltdown .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.106415"}

{"text": "The boys refused , were threatened with suspension , and were asked to leave the campus .I am old enough to recall a time when wearing the American flag on a piece of clothing was seen as disrespectful to Americans .Even images of the flag worn as fashion were viewed as a vulgar desecration of a cherished symbol .But times have changed .Over the years , attitudes have not only relaxed , but they have completed a 180 degree turn .The flag has become an oft - used element in fashion design , and wearing the flag is now considered a display of patriotism .An image burned into my memory is one of the actress Halle Berry wearing a form - fitting gown comprised of small American flags .Disrespectful or not , if that image does n't make you stand up and salute , nothing will .Yes , times have certainly changed .I doubt that anyone ever imagined a time in this country when American children would be criticized for wearing the American flag not because it offended traditional American sensitivities , but because it was seen as disrespectful to Mexicans .Principal Rodriguez said that the request was made in an effort to prevent fights from breaking out .What remains unclear is why wearing an American flag on one 's shirt would provoke violence -- even amongst testosterone - filled teen boys .Daniel Galli and his buddies were minding their own business .If it is an educator 's job to promote critical thinking among his students then the administrators at Live Oak failed miserably .Here was a \" teaching moment ; \" here was a real opportunity for Rodriguez and Principal Nick Boden to provide a lesson in patience , priorities , and the true meaning of tolerance .But multi - culturalism has turned people into thin skinned grievance junkies - babies that cry at every cross - look or unkind word and must be coddled lest they toss themselves on the floor and begin kicking and screaming .You had better take those shirts off .You know these Mexicans ; they will pull their knives at the drop of a hat !The following day some 200 Mexican students walked out of class in protest .As they marched down the street waving the Mexican flag they demanded the boys ' suspension .And once again , rather than demand maturity from the Mexican students , the protest was greeted by the district superintendent with promises to hold a rap - session , where the students would be encouraged to express their feelings .I would like to suggest that rather than encouraging cross - cultural understanding , the school district should instead encourage a cross - cultural Algebra tutoring session .Given that Live Oak is underperforming the state average on both the California Standards test and the California High School Exit Exam , such an endeavor seems far more necessary and certainly more practical .Responding to the ongoing drama at Live Oak , a young Latina declared that wearing the American flag on Cinco de Mayo was akin to Mexicans wearing the Mexican flag on the Fourth of July .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.539474"}

{"text": "This is an overdue update on ENP 's newest reptile conservation and research project Snake Tracks : Ratsnake Tracks .This project is being conducted at The Academy at Trails Carolina by naturalist Steve O'Neil and his natural resource and conservation management and wilderness therapy students as part of Steve 's ongoing reptile focused wildlife conservation citizen science projects .In Rat snake Tracks we follow in the tracks and trails of two wild adult male Rat snake 's known affectionately as Master Splinter and Apollo .The first snake in the study is Splinter .We found him just outside the nature center in the fall of 2013 .Shortly thereafter he was fitted with a radio transmitter , treated for internal parasites , fed lots of yummy mice , and then overwintered in the nature center to await his release in the spring .In early May of 2014 Splinter was released and radio tracking commenced .Over the summer Splinter spent most of his time in large , old Oak trees and in and around the buildings on campus .He frequented attics and crawlspaces of unused and used buildings as well as large , hollow habitat trees .We believe he is using these areas as foraging , thermoregulating and sheltering sites .In mid summer , Steve and his students encountered another large , male Rat snake just outside the nature center .This snake was named Apollo in honor of the Apollo moon missions , and it was decided that this snake would join Splinter in a multi - year radio telemetry study of their natural movements in the forests surrounding the nature center .Later in the summer we produced an extended length documentary video following both Splinter and Apollo over the remainder of their active seasons .In this video follow my students and I over several months as we search for and find the snakes high in Oak trees , on the ground , in buildings and bushes , and finally , in hibernation .Please view the video below for all the details of this fascinating new reptile conservation and citizen science project .Follow this blog to stay up to date with the adventures of Master Splinter and Apollo the Rat snakes .Thank you all for making the Snake Tracks and Turtle Tracks wildlife conservation projects possible .Thank you for continuing to support Earthshine Nature Programs over the last seven years .If the turtles and snakes could speak they would thank you even more than I because due to your support they will in turn be supported through the efforts of science being put to use in the areas of wildlife and habitat conservation .Thank you also to the land owners in the community where these animals live .Thank you for taking care of these highly misunderstood but yet oh so important parts of a healthy ecosystem .The story continues ... .What is Rat snake Tracks ?Rat snake Tracks is a reptile conservation and research project occurring near Dupont Forest in the mountains of western North Carolina , USA .Through the magic of modern technology and allot of hard volunteer work by a wildlife conservationist and his small crew of volunteers and students , glimpse into the lives of two wild Ratsnakes in their natural habitats .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "129.50659"}
