Eugenio Hernandez of the border state of Tamaulipas reported the first fatality there ; telling an emergency evaluation meeting attended by President Felipe Calderon in the border city of Matamoros that the victim tried to cross a flooded road .The tropical depression made landfall at South Padre Island late Thursday morning and was expected to dump four to eight inches of rain across the area , with as much as 10 inches in some parts , said the National Weather Service .That rain comes on top of the five to seven inches Hurricane Alex already had deposited .The rain , saturated ground , swollen rivers and releases from dams upstream have experts watching the Rio Grande closely .In Laredo , where roughly half of all U.S.-Mexico trade crosses , authorities closed two bridges and severely limited traffic on a third .They also restricted traffic on the World Trade International Bridge to keep the weight load on the bridge at a minimum , but they did not have to close the connection .The World Trade bridge carries roughly 8,000 18-wheelers a day , and closing it would have crippled the nation 's busiest inland port .Another worry for local officials was the half dozen tractor trailers that were bobbing downriver in the fast - moving current after being left too close to the rising water , said City Manager Carlos Villarreal .\" It 's like a missile headed for a target , \" he said of the trailers ' potential to damage the bridge structures .Downstream in Rio Grande City , water from dam releases and the tropical depression were converging to create a serious flood threat .The National Weather Service issued a flood warning for the area after the river more than doubled its normal size .Flooding would damage farmland and could push water from a creek along the eastern side of town into neighborhoods .At the Retama Manor nursing home in Rio Grande City , administrators waited for local emergency officials to advise them of any risk posed by the Rio Grande .The facility sits next to the international bridge on the banks of the river , just feet from the swift - moving river .Nan Impink , a spokeswoman for the facility , said there is a plan to move residents if there is a danger of flooding .\" For us that 's an option of last choice because it 's very disruptive to patients , \" she said .Farther south , part of the Rio Grande flow was being diverted into miles of wide channels that will eventually send some of the flow to the Gulf of Mexico .The International Boundary and Water Commission said the last similar diversion happened after 1988 's Hurricane Gilbert .The IBWC has had to release water from the binational Amistad Dam at its fastest rate in a quarter century after the reservoir reached its highest level since 1974 .Water was also being released at Falcon Dam downstream Thursday .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.647907"}

{"text": "By Friday , FEMA 's emergency headquarters for Katrina was already running ; technically , the agency was at level one , its highest level of alert .But as the headquarters staff came in , there was a strange sense of inaction , as if \" nobody 's turning the key to start the engine , \" said one team leader , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .For his group , Friday was a day to sit around wondering , \" Why are n't we treating this as a bigger emergency ?Why are n't we doing anything ? \"That evening , shortly before Max Mayfield made his call to Walter Maestri , Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco ( D ) declared a state of emergency .Saturday , Aug. 27 ' This is not a test : This is the real deal . 'By morning , Katrina was already a Category 3 hurricane , and Mayfield was predicting it could make landfall near New Orleans as an even deadlier Category 4 .On FEMA 's daily noon videoconference , he looked around the U - shaped conference table in Washington and saw a lot of newcomers to the disaster world among the agency 's political appointees .But he knew many of the professionals listening in from the Gulf states had been through his hurricane prep course .They knew this was no drill .\" The emergency guys , they know what a Cat 4 is , \" Mayfield recalled .And this had the potential to be a Category 5 , only the fourth in U.S. history .\" This one is different , \" Mayfield told the videoconference .\" It 's strong , but it 's also much , much larger .\" When talk turned to New Orleans , Mayfield mentioned the possibility of water overwhelming the levees ; his center soon forecast a storm surge as high as 25 feet , far above the 17-foot clearance for most of the city 's storm protection . \"Clearly on Saturday , we knew it was going to be the Big One , \" recalled Jack Colley , Texas 's veteran disaster man .\" We were very convinced this was going to be a very catastrophic event . \"The challenge was to get people out of harm 's way .All day long , Louisiana officials announced voluntary evacuations , and Blanco implemented a \" contra - flow \" traffic plan to help as coastal residents reach higher grounds .Maestri said there was no point in ordering mandatory evacuations , because there was no way to force people to abandon their homes .\" I ca n't go door to door , \" he explained .In Mississippi , Gov. Haley Barbour ( R ) told his wife he was worried about hurricane fatigue ; after a series of false alarms along the Gulf Coast , the evacuation routine was starting to get old .But local officials got the word out that this was no ordinary storm , and residents took them seriously , streaming out of town in the contra - flow lanes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.750977"}

National Guard airmen to practice their ability to rescue victims by extracting them from severely flooded or isolated mountainous areas via helicopter .The teams used those skills several months later to extract several lost and/or injured hikers in the mountains .State port safety - Eight law enforcement and emergency management agencies rehearsed coordinated response to a terrorist event at the state port in Morehead City .Community Emergency Response Teams training - The CERT program expanded to include six teenage programs .More than 70 teenagers are now trained in the basics of disaster response so they can help their neighbors in the early minutes and hours following a disaster .Hazardous materials response training - More than 200 first responders and emergency management staff from four different metropolitan areas trained with Norfolk Southern and CSX to respond to hazmat incidents involving major freight shipping corridors .All - hazard response training - More than 90 Yancey County emergency management and first responders trained together in the county 's largest - ever emergency response exercise .The week - long drill tested their capabilities in hostage negotiation , search and rescue , fire suppression and emergency medical response .Emergency medical response training - A medical support drill tested coordination and response between the emergency management and medical communities in Wake County .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.85578"}
