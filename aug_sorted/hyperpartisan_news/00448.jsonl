However , \u200bmany question whether this was \u200b\u200breally necessary\u200b,\u200b \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bor if the \u200bdisaffiliation was more a reflection of \u200bWalker 's personal philosophical shifts than any job requirement\u200b. That\u200b \u200bmight explain his involvement with No Labels and claims that he \u200bdid not re - register as a Republican until quite recently .Some Walker foes are claiming he is still not registered as a Republican , \u200bwhich I have not been able to confirm , but which if true would be troubling for a number of delegates .This not only smacks of sexism that some Republicans fear could give Democrats room to attack Walker using the \" War on Women \" line quite effectively should he be nominated\u200b.This also underlines that his experience in government is Washington , D.C. , Beltway - based , as opposed to Connecticut - based .Since the job he 's running for is \u200bbased in Hartford and \u200ball about Connecticut government , that may be a challenge for him .Somers , the third candidate , seems to be regarded as a better choice than Walker by delegates , but her experience is at the very local level , which may not suit the Lieutenant Governor 's role as well as Bacchiochi 's experience does .There are also some questions about fiscal decisions in her town under her tenure as mayor ( she appears to have raised property taxes and run budget deficits)\u200b. The bottom line here is that Bacchiochi looks like the strongest choice for the Republican Lieutenant Governor nomination .A far far stronger choice than Walker , about whom much \u200bBeltway \u200bbuzz has focused .Convention delegates should compare and contrast these two candidates before the convention .There 's a good reason to believe that Bacchiochi , the most conservative candidate in this race and can win in November .IOP Polling Director John Della Volpe said , \" There 's an erosion of trust in the individuals and institutions that make government work - and now we see the lowest level of interest in any election we 've measured since 2000 [ when the poll began].\" The new poll shows 18- to 29- year - olds ' trust in public institutions at a five - year low .This disillusion is expected to result in low participation in November 's midterm elections .Less than one - in - four ( 23 % ) of young Americans say they will \" definitely be voting in November .That 's down 11 percent from five months ago and 8 percent lower than seen during a similar time prior to the 2010 midterm elections .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.59584"}

's programs vastly expanded the power of the government , but they did so mostly in ways that preserved a great deal of economic freedom .The Social Security Act provided government assistance that would save the widowed , the unemployed , and the aged from material poverty , but ( at least as originally conceived ) did not create a massive welfare state .The Wagner Act guaranteed the right of labor unions to organize and to bargain , but without making government the final arbiter of wages .The Federal Housing Administration helped to revive the housing market after the Depression and to finance America 's rapid suburbanization after the war .And the G.I. Bill gave soldiers from working - class families the financial support they needed to attend college - starting a rapid rise in educational attainment that not only answered many Americans ' yearning for self - advancement , but also helped fuel the nation 's post - war boom .In short , Roosevelt 's American - populist rhetoric and policies did legitimize a vast expansion of government in the name of serving \" the people \" - but , critically , did so in ways that preserved essential American freedoms .CONSERVATIVE POPULISM .In the wake of the Depression , the New Deal , and the enduring political coalition established by Franklin Roosevelt , American conservatives were left reeling for decades .Conservative intellectuals seemed to alternate between the despair of Albert Jay Nock and the doll houses of Southern agrarianism and Ayn Rand libertarianism .Conservative politicians like Robert Taft proved unable to build a national majority , as even the Republican Party seemed to turn to more liberal standard - bearers like Earl Warren and Nelson Rockefeller .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.27366"}

Jeff Flake ( R - Ariz . ) said that the bill was too big and not a good direction .The house bill also sought to break from the decades - old principle of user pays , funding highway improvements from user fees rather than general revenue .Marc Scribner of the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute wrote in a National Review op - ed that the Republican - backed bill was misguided piece of highway robbery that breaches their own longstanding principles .One thing that the bill would not do is raise the federal gas tax , which is currently at 18.4 cents per gallon -- the lowest it 's been in over two decades when measured in inflation - adjusted dollars .Despite calls from infrastructure groups , fiscal conservatives , and environmentalists to raise the tax to plug the gap in the federal Highway Trust Fund , this is a political non - starter in an election year .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.96858"}

{"text": "More pressing , then , than determining whether the United States is an empire is the question of how Washington will manage the transition to a situation where its relative dominance has diminished .Because the contours of this decline are highly variable , the foreign policy decisions of the Obama administration remain very relevant .One current danger is that Obama , while rejecting the brash unilateralism of the Bush administration and pulling back the fist of U.S. hard power , will return to a softer form of imperial power .Under Bill Clinton , the United States used multilateral institutions such as the IMF , the World Bank , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) as primary instruments of foreign policy .While staffed with economists in business suits rather than grunts in fatigues , these bodies exerted considerable control over foreign peoples .The international financial institutions forced developing countries to comply with the prescriptions of the \" Washington Consensus \" in order to receive economic support .These market fundamentalist policies benefited the corporate elite , while deepening inequalities and producing very limited growth in the countries where they were implemented .Corporate globalization 's deregulated markets also proved crisis - prone , producing systemic shocks ranging from the Asian financial crisis of 1998 and 1999 , to Argentina 's economic collapse in 2001 , to the crisis that began with the collapse of America 's subprime housing sector .During the Bush years the power of the IMF and the World Bank dramatically waned , in part because of the discrediting effects of the earlier crises and in part because of the Bush administration 's disinterest in investing in multilateral structures .The Bush White House , with its penchant for unilateralist hard power , did n't appreciate the advantages of Clinton 's preferred imperial instruments , and was sometimes downright dismissive of them .British journalist and Guardian columnist George Monbiot perceptively described this as \" the unacknowledged paradox in neocon thinking . \"He wrote in an April 2005 column that the Bush foreign policy operatives . want to drag down the old , multilateral order and replace it with a new , U.S. one .What they fail to understand is that the \" multilateral \" system is in fact a projection of U.S. unilateralism , cleverly packaged to grant other nations just enough slack to prevent them from fighting it .Like their opponents , the neocons fail to understand how well Roosevelt and Truman stitched up the international order .They are seeking to replace a hegemonic system that is enduring and effective with one that is untested and ( because other nations must fight it ) unstable .Anyone who believes in global justice should wish them luck .For critics of the IMF and World Bank , seeing these bodies diminish was a sign of progress .But it now looks like the job of dismantling the past hegemonic order was far from complete .The Bretton Woods system may be more enduring and effective than even Monbiot would have guessed .Usual Suspects .Today , the global economic downturn is giving new life to some of the institutions that did the most to create the crisis in the first place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.088524"}

{"text": "In the ' 60s , many Americans grew uneasy with the course the country seemed to be taking , both politically and socially .The America of farms and small towns was giving way to a nation of suburbs ; the growth of large corporations , the rise of television , and the sharp increase in internal mobility were eroding the cohesiveness of local communities .Accompanying these changes was the growth of the national government , which had continued apace even under Republican president Dwight Eisenhower .Despite increasing affluence and relative peace abroad , an ever - larger number of Americans felt their country was becoming unrecognizable - and they wanted to take it back .So it was that intellectual conservatism and popular anxiety joined forces in Barry Goldwater 's 1964 presidential campaign to create a crude populism of the right .But despite what would appear to have been a favorable political climate , this amalgam proved dismally unpopular .While the rhetoric of Goldwater 's campaign was generally fairly measured , that of his backers was too often not .Much like the Populist farmers in the late 1890s , Goldwater 's supporters felt themselves to be oppressed .Ronald Reagan , then an increasingly political Hollywood actor , entered the fray near the end of the campaign with a nationally televised speech on Goldwater 's behalf .Casting the election as a choice between \" up or down - up to man 's age - old dream , the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order - or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism , \" Reagan accused incumbent president Lyndon Johnson of spreading socialism .Johnson 's administration , Reagan said , was seeking to \" trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state \" and engaging in \" appeasement \" with our enemies .Noting that he was a former Democrat , Reagan closed with a conscious invocation of Franklin Roosevelt : \" You and I have a rendezvous with destiny .We will preserve for our children this , the last best hope of man on Earth , or we will sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness .\" The movie star 's message roused the faithful , but fell flat among the voting masses .Goldwater 's crushing defeat seemed to all but the most die - hard conservatives to be the death knell of this nascent movement .Instead of seeking to help honest folk restore the rights denied them by an adversary , too often Goldwater came across as wanting to lead victims in a violent battle against an implacable enemy .The campaign suffered from another , fatal flaw .To succeed at the voting booth , American - populist movements have generally needed to present a positive alternative - to make an affirmative case for how their victory would set things right , and show how their particular policies would let the individual help himself .Goldwater 's backers assumed that the people would simply understand that a return to classic constitutional government would achieve their desired ends .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.261215"}

{"text": "But his efforts did not translate immediately into an enduring partisan majority .Reagan 's campaign to reduce inflation was necessary , but it had the effect of ending the informal bailout of inefficient manufacturers in what is now called the Rust Belt - costing many Northern working - class voters their jobs .Republicans lost working - class seats in Ohio , western Pennsylvania , and coal - mining districts in West Virginia in 1982 , for example .Though Reagan 's legacy for conservatism was decisively positive over the long term , in the short term , working - class voters hedged their bets by splitting their tickets .Their attitude toward conservatives was clear : trust , but verify .The growing economy and more stable national fiscal footing of the 1980s gave Reagan the time to educate Americans about his brand of conservatism .His heirs do not have that luxury .Today , the rapid expansion of entitlement spending , the stagnant economy , and the looming debt crisis force modern conservatives to confront the size of the welfare state sooner rather than later .They can not simply extend the lives of government entitlements by tinkering around the edges : These programs scream out for thorough structural overhaul .Yet these needed reforms will inevitably unsettle the GOP 's newly sizable share of the working class .How conservatives handle those concerns will determine whether the Republican Party can solve both its own political problems and the nation 's daunting fiscal dilemma .CONSERVATIVES AND SAFETY NETS .Above all , conservatives need to persuade working - class voters that their efforts to reform key safety - net programs are intended not to shred those safety nets but , rather , to save them .Fortunately , in seeking to clear up the misperception that the right reflexively opposes the social safety net , conservatives have history on their side .Ronald Reagan regularly reaffirmed his commitment to this idea , and his example has been followed by virtually every conservative leader of note since .Most recently , Representative Paul Ryan 's proposal to rehabilitate federal budgeting - the \" Roadmap for America 's Future \" - maintains significant federal commitments to Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid .Moreover , he wrote , \" there can be no doubt that some minimum of food , shelter , and clothing , sufficient to preserve health and the capacity to work , can be assured to everybody . \"Indeed , champions of democratic capitalism have long understood that some safety - net protections are essential if people are going to take the kinds of risks required for a free - market economy to flourish .Such harsh penalties obviously discouraged risk - taking by both investors and entrepreneurs , so capitalism 's champions amended the common law to create safe havens for these individuals .Foremost among these protections were the corporation ( which shields investors from liability ) and bankruptcy ( which allows debtors to pay creditors back in an orderly fashion without losing their freedom ) .Over time , other participants in the market economy - like farmers , industrial laborers , and general consumers - pursued safeguards of their own , and a system of rules and protections arose .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.102875"}
{"text": "It seems , then , that voters may hate the house of government , but love the bricks used to build it .WAVES AND THE WORKING CLASS .The notion that American political attitudes are more balanced than they might initially appear is also backed up by the evidence of prior Republican wave elections .Though these other waves might not have been as large as the 2010 sweep , they were not fundamentally different in character .Democrats have held the presidency and Congress with filibuster - proof ( or very nearly filibuster - proof ) margins only four times since 1960 - after the elections of 1964 , 1976 , 1992 , and 2008 .Following each of those victories , Democrats sought vast expansions of government - through Lyndon Johnson 's Great Society programs , the presidency of Jimmy Carter , the Clintons ' attempt to implement \" HillaryCare , \" and the agenda of Barack Obama .In each case , voters swung dramatically toward the Republicans within four years of having handed government to the Democrats .Indeed , sudden , sharp swings approaching the scope of the 2010 wave have occurred only three other times since the end of World War II , in 1966 , 1980 , and 1994 .And in each case , the demographic group that swung most fiercely away from the Democrats was whites without a college degree - that is , the white working class .Those who wish to interpret what happened this year - and what it means for the future - would therefore be wise to study the causes of these prior Republican victories , as well as what happened in their aftermaths .In each of the three Republican wave elections prior to this latest one , enormous victory was not followed upon by a period of unquestioned political dominance .Richard Nixon won the presidency narrowly in 1968 , but Democrats still held Congress .Even Nixon 's 1972 landslide win over liberal Democrat George McGovern was accompanied by only moderate congressional gains .Ronald Reagan 's 1980 victory gave Republicans control of the Senate for the first time since 1954 , but most of the gains in the House were lost in 1982 .Even a huge presidential landslide in 1984 failed to produce significant Republican congressional gains .And the GOP lost control of the Senate when the class of 1980 came up for re - election in 1986 .The victory of 1994 proved somewhat more lasting and extensive , but even in that case , the political landscape was not what one would have expected were the American electorate really of a center - right bent .The Republicans failed to recover the presidency in 1996 , as they had after the previous two wave elections .The recurring difficulties Republicans have had in turning wave elections into lasting majorities can not be easily dismissed ; they have not been caused primarily by the quirks of particular leaders , or the circumstances of the times .Instead , they are directly tied to the values and policy preferences of the group that , for more than a century , has been the fulcrum of American politics : the white working class .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.11272"}

{"text": "Finally , it suggests that the same voters who are repelled by modern liberals are also leery of modern conservatives - because while these voters oppose rapid expansions of the welfare state and federal power , they do not favor rapid retrenchments of them , either .This poses a political problem for any Republican coalition .If that coalition tries to rapidly reverse many liberal policies , particularly those serving the working and middle classes , it risks a political backlash .If , on the other hand , it merely presides over a continuation of these policies , it risks failing to offer voters any clear distinction between Republicans and Democrats .As conservatives have said for decades , if voters are given a choice between a real Democrat and a fake Democrat , they will choose the real Democrat every time .This tension between the Republican base and the white working class has surfaced again and again when Republicans have risen to power in America .This time , though , the need to resolve that tension is especially urgent .Politically , the white working class is looking for a home .It does not currently hold a high opinion of Republicans , and if it feels spurned now , it will return to its Democratic roots ( or perhaps turn to a third - party populist candidate ) .Such a move would destroy whatever hopes Republicans have of reversing the recent gains of liberal policymakers .Over the long term , the white working class will become only more important to Republicans - largely owing to the rising strength of loyal Democratic constituencies like secular elites and ethnic minorities .Unless Republicans reverse their low standing with these groups in the very near future , they will need to win 60 % or more of the white vote in order to eke out a bare majority by 2016 .They can do this only by sustaining the record margins they compiled this year among working - class whites .Policy concerns compel a resolution , too .The primary policy challenge we face today is reforming our welfare state so that we can keep the promises we have made to ourselves and future generations , while also averting fiscal ruin .Liberals ' solution to this challenge is to dramatically hike taxes while ducking difficult changes to entitlement programs .Conservatives , on the other hand , seek to bring our entitlements into line with their ( more limited ) view of what welfare programs should encompass and what tax burden the public should be made to bear .But such reforms will inevitably be difficult - and if conservatives are to have any hope of achieving them , they will need the support of white working - class voters .If resolving these tensions meant throwing away conservative principles , it would not be worth trying .Conservatives believe in freedom and in traditional values for a reason ; these are the foundations of our American heritage , and the sources of our strength .Short - term political gain ought never to trump a devotion to principle - not least because that course always leads to both national and political ruin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.90598"}

{"text": "Combining the answers to these questions yields a fascinating picture : It shows that people 's understanding of their own political views and those of the Democratic Party vary substantially based on partisan affiliation .According to the Pew data , Republicans viewed themselves as falling somewhere between moderate and conservative , but viewed Democrats as being between liberal and very liberal .Independents viewed themselves as being very slightly right of center , but considered the Democratic Party to be a center - left party , closer to liberal than to moderate .Democrats , however , viewed themselves as being only slightly to the left of center ; they saw the ideological orientation of their party , meanwhile , as nearly identical to their own .In other words , a very large portion of the people who tell pollsters they are \" moderates \" are in fact loyal , partisan Democrats who view their own party as representing moderate views .These voters are clearly not open to persuasion by the right or center - right , and they constitute a hidden \" liberal \" component of the electorate that traditional poll questions tend to overlook .The existence of this hidden liberal bloc makes election results below the presidential level , and at the presidential level since 1992 , more comprehensible .If there were a consistent , strong conservative majority in America , one would expect to see the more conservative party win frequently and decisively .But this has not happened .Since 1992 , Democrats have won three of the five presidential elections ( and they carried the popular vote in a fourth , in 2000 ) .Even John Kerry 's loss in 2004 was narrow , as he received about 48 % of the vote .Congressional majorities after 1994 were generally slim , with the Republicans effectively losing their Senate majority in 2000 and dropping to a mere 221 - 214 margin in the House before recovering slightly in 2002 and 2004 .Such close results are more consistent with a nation that is ideologically balanced than with one that is tilted decisively toward the right .Still another way to examine America 's ideological alignment is to look at the public 's response to the behavior of Republican majorities .The 1995 attempt at cutting spending by shutting down the government has been widely interpreted as a failure , because it lacked public support .In the decade after , state - level spending - even by Republican governors and Republican - controlled state legislatures - increased dramatically ; the same trend emerged in Washington after the election of President George W. Bush .This sharp spending increase of course rankled conservatives - but it is not clear that it was opposed by genuine moderates and independents , so long as the deficit stayed under control ( thanks to the growing economy ) and taxes remained fairly low .The supposed public support for small government , too , demands re - analysis .The same polls that show a clear preference for small government also show robust support for the largest big - government programs , Social Security and Medicare .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.56949"}

[21 ] .Moreover , under conditions of top - down relationships with the leader and the masses , a direct link of sorts , it can be argued that most citizens vote on the basis of loyalties rather than leadership qualities .This loyalty functions within party organizations ' control of access to public office , and their recruitment and socialization activities serve to channel and filter political ambitions .[ 22 ] Even further , it can have an added component of danger when it is associated with the military .Where populist leaders are associated with institutional support from the armed forces , rather than parties or other organizations , they usually expand the political role of the military and draw it into functions that are far removed from its normal responsibilities .This is dangerous for two reasons .One , it blurs the line between the role of the military and civilian institutions , usually to the detriment of the latter .Second , making the military political is never a guarantee of loyalty .Latin America especially has a long history of military coups , even in cases of progressive populism in which members of the military find that they can do a \" better job \" than the democratically elected government .[ 23 ] .Anti - corruption rhetoric is a regular component of the legitimization of populist transcendence of traditional parties , but the cure is often worse than the disease .The lack of institutional accountability and the tendency towards opportunism and favoritism under populist governments presents an incentive ( especially in poorer countries where government positions are not necessarily well paying ) to corruption between public authorities and private agents .Additionally , promises to put an end to corruption are hard to take seriously in cases when populist leaders must fill the void presented by a lack of organized support and experienced associates and thus must simply do so by appointing inexperienced loyalists to government positions .\" While the use of Chavismo as an identification of the development of this movement may seem pejorative , it is likely because of the impression that it gives special credibility or importance to the singular influence and power of Ch\u00e1vez himself .While this is not necessarily the intention , it is the intention of this paper to assert that Ch\u00e1vez 's discourse and ideological content are populist .As such , the term Chavismo - much like Per\u00f3nismo - indicates both the uniqueness of the rise of Chavismo and its relation to historical populism .It is with this in mind that we turn to the presidency of Ch\u00e1vez and the emergence of Chavismo populism .Chavismo Populism .In more recent times , populism has been characterized with more of an emphasis on the political mobilization of largely unorganized masses by charismatic leaders who typically circumvent institutionalized forms of representation and challenge established political or economic elites .[ 24 ] If we use these parameters , a look at Venezuela and the election of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez can be enlightening .[ 25 ] Latin American history has no shortage of Leftwing military coup attempts , but Ch\u00e1vez ' case is unique .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.91847"}

{"text": "The relative absence of these movements has always puzzled European and Marxist social scientists , who have struggled to explain why America - in this respect virtually unique in the Western world - never formed a significant socialist or communist party .After all , economic mobility is n't that different in the United States than in Europe .Inequality is worse .Why , then , have n't Americans clamored to overthrow the powerful ?What is the matter with Kansas ?The answer is to be found in the American soul , shaped as it has surely been by Madison 's system .Americans are a self - governing people through and through , and American populism reflects the American passion for self - determination .That passion certainly leads some Americans to respond powerfully against overbearing elites , and so causes some populist movements to form .But it has also often allowed these responses to be channeled in constructive directions - keeping our politics in balance , and over time giving rise to enduring political coalitions .In looking at some key populist episodes in our history , then , one finds a pattern that should ease the worries of those now concerned about a politics of resentment .It is also a pattern that offers some crucial guidance for the instigators and cheerleaders of today 's populist movement .AMERICAN POPULISM .American populism shares with its classical cousin the use of heated rhetoric against an unjust \" other , \" and the idea that popular control of the state is essential to the restoration of justice .But it breaks from the classical model in three significant respects .First , successful populist movements tend to characterize the American people not as helpless victims , but as honest folk dispossessed of their right to achieve prosperity and happiness through self - improvement and hard work .As such , American populists seek not a charismatic leader who will bring them order and justice , but rather a re - opening of the avenues to self - advancement and self - reliance .Second , the \" other \" in American populism tends not to be vilified as an implacable enemy without rights .Instead , he is an adversary : one who might be corrupt or acting unjustly at the moment , but still a fellow citizen who retains his basic American goodness , is capable of redemption , and is secure in his rights .Despite some reckless accusations to the contrary , today 's populist movement seems no different on this front .Third and most important , effective American populists generally do not seek to take the enemy 's property to redistribute it to the people .Instead , they argue that if the government is once again made responsive to the electorate - by placing the populists in power - the people will again be able to help themselves .Sooner or later , the populists usually develop a policy agenda - and it is typically a case for using government to advance self - reliance or enable prosperity and growth .These distinctive elements of American populism recur throughout our political history .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.288635"}

{"text": "51 ] .In this sense , it is not impossible for a populist movement to change into a radical project that employs a more systemic analysis of the antagonisms of a given society .But Laclau 's mistake is to suggest that populism is an aspect of radical movements that is inherent and continuous instead of initial and something to be overcome .Again , Zizek acts as a corrective to Laclau , drawing attention to the vastly critical and eclipsing point about populism that overwhelms its other aspects : .[ T]here is a constitutive mystification that pertains to populism .Its basic gesture is to refuse to confront the complexity of the situation , to reduce it to a clear struggle with a pseudoconcrete enemy figure .[52 ] .And , to employ an earlier quote from Zizek again , furthermore : .[ T]he ultimate difference between true radical - emancipatory politics and populist politics is that authentic radical politics is active , imposing , enforcing its vision , while populism is fundamentally reactive , a reaction to a disturbing intruder .[53 ] .Accordingly , as long as the discourse of populism employs the rhetoric of the \" disturbing intruder \" or the \" alien element \" that affects social unity , it can never truly be a bearer of emancipatory radical politics or a be an element within it .It lacks a long term vision or unitary ideology with which to actively impose itself .It is reactive in the sense that it waits for the contradictions of society to emerge and creates attempts at solutions based on these reactions .Ch\u00e1vez 's \" reaction \" to the 2002 coup attempt and the 2003 strike is an unparalleled example of this tendency .Faced with a major contradiction , he first attempted a policy of moderate conciliation and when that did not work adopted a radical rhetoric and policy that was fundamentally a \" reaction \" to a \" disturbing \" element .In very direct terms , there is a question of whether Ch\u00e1vez and the Ch\u00e1vista government has the ability and ideological fortitude to grapple with the difficult organizational , sociological , economic and political issues that arise from populism and come out the other side with something workable .It may be that Chavismo does not have the tools necessary to construct a viable and sustainable political and economic framework , and that an alternative is imperative .Additionally , there is the danger that Ch\u00e1vez has been caught in a cycle that leads him to believe that governance is not complicated and that he is a leader of the people whose large and vague ideas are all that is needed to radically transform society .The simple truth may be that despite the limitations of populism , there are few obstacles to the ability to lead a movement and a country with some degree of popularity if you have expensive resources that are in massive demand .But the obverse and hopeful hypothesis is that populism is inherently unsustainable and that eventually its limitations will be overcome .In regards to the contemporary developments in Latin America and Venezuela , building on this hypothesis continues , and will continue , to be of the utmost significance and importance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.37305"}

{"text": "In the first section , a look at the history of populism in Latin America will present a contextual introduction to the forms of populist governments in the past .The second section will develop a theory of populism by looking at the traditional academic theory of populism and incorporating more modern and radical theories .The third section will take this theory of populism and look at how it creates limitations , drawbacks and deficiencies in political and economic governance .Following this third section , a look at the presidency of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and the Chavismo movement , and why it is a modern example of populism , will segue into the final section in which conclusions will be drawn and some encouraging aspects of populism highlighted .A Brief History of the Origins of Latin American Populism .Conventional theory associates populism in Latin America with the rise of mass politics in the middle of the 20th century , when traditional forms of oligarchic domination connected to the latifundio based commodity export model were overshadowed by the social mobilization that came with the early stages of industrialization .Following the Great Depression , this export model was replaced by a state - led industrialization effort that transformed the socioeconomic landscape of the continent .While new middle and urban working classes were created by this process , the traditional forms of political representation and inclusion could not fulfill the demands of these new demographics .It is this void that populism filled .Populism incorporated workers and capitalists within broad , multiclass political coalitions backing social reform and state led industrialization .It relied heavily upon nationalism and charismatic leadership to bring together diverse social demographics , and it made special appeals to urban workers and labor unions , who were bound to the state for distribution of benefits and the exercise of political infl uence .[ 1 ] In gaining access to public office , most of them also expanded the economic role of the state by protecting and subsidizing basic industries , restricting foreign investment , regulating labor markets , and providing a broad range of social benefits .Traditional populism was largely considered outdated by the economic and political changes of the past several decades .The wave of right - wing military coups starting in the 60s led to the repression of labor and popular movements and to new forms of capital accumulation .When a wave of democratization occurred in the 1980 's , it coincided with the infamous Latin American debt crisis and ushered in the era now best associated with neoliberalism and economic \" discipline .\"[ 2 ] This new era marked an incapacity for government to intervene with social programs and spending to respond to popular demands due to the stringent demands of institutions like the IMF and World Bank who insisted on rigid economic policy for debt repayment .These changes weakened organized labor and they deprived governments of the policy tools that had been used by populist leaders in the past .It is now widely accepted that this comfort was unfounded .Highlighted by the complete collapse of the Argentinean financial system from 1999 - 2002,[4 ] the neoliberal project in Latin America has crumbled .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.15823"}

{"text": "Seeing religion as a tool for political ends , Will quite naturally praises religious figures he sees as politically simpatico ( like Pope John Paul II ) and savages those whose politics he finds politically unpalatable ( like Pope Francis ) .It 's not surprising that Will is so nakedly partisan in his evaluation of religious leaders .What is perhaps more noteworthy is that the same pattern can be found among conservatives who claim to be genuinely devout .Some of these critics voice the objection that Francis is too political , but on closer inspection their real problem is the same as Will 's : They do n't like his politics .In a 2005 column , for instance , Will praised John Paul II as one of the great heroes of the 20th century because he made common cause with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in fighting communism .Yet if John Paul II 's political interventions were held up as crucial in the battle against the enemies of civilization , then his successor Francis , seemingly embodying very different politics , stands condemned as a menace who threatens the very survival of capitalism .As one of America 's foremost climate change deniers , Will has nothing but contempt for Francis 's calls for environmental responsibility .In a 2014 column , Will condemned the Pope as a sanctimonious interloper whose ignorance of worldly matters threatens to leave millions impoverished . \"He stands against modernity , rationality , science and , ultimately , the spontaneous creativity of open societies in which people and their desires are not problems but precious resources , \" Will thundered .\" Americans can not simultaneously honor him and celebrate their nation 's premises . \"In taking up the cause of the environment , Will argued over the weekend , the church was abandoning its \" salvific mission . \"Continue ringing those church bells , Will is saying , so they 'll drown out the protests of environmentalists .The cynicism of Will 's position hardly needs to be underlined .Yet it is broadly shared by others on the right .In an extremely confusing line of argument , Pullmann seems to suggest that an environmental apocalypse might actually be a welcome outcome from a Christian point of view : .We will never achieve utopia in this world .That 's kind of the central story arc of the Bible : How humans screwed themselves and the whole world up , and how Jesus has and will ultimately put things to right .Getting all the way to a perfect eternity , however , requires first an apocalypse .So maybe Pope Francis should welcome the environmental apocalypse he thinks is coming .That 's partly a joke and partly serious , because every time I see another Planned Parenthood butchering video I am ready for Jesus to take me and my kiddos right up to Paradise and end this sick , mad world .Pullmann 's words might seem lurid and even nonsensical , but they follow the basic contours of Will 's : The church should stick to saving souls and leave the job of running the world to big business .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.6515"}

Aron ; it also owned a stake in a major oil refinery in Kansas , where it warehoused the crude it bought and sold .Even though the supply of oil was keeping pace with demand , Murti continually warned of disruptions to the world oil supply , going so far as to broadcast the fact that he owned two hybrid cars .But it was n't the consumption of real oil that was driving up prices - it was the trade in paper oil .It was a repeat of both the Internet craze and the housing bubble , when Wall Street jacked up present - day profits by selling suckers shares of a fictional fantasy future of endlessly rising prices .In what was by now a painfully familiar pattern , the oil - commodities melon hit the pavement hard in the summer of 2008 , causing a massive loss of wealth ; crude prices plunged from $ 147 to $ 33 .Once again the big losers were ordinary people .The pensioners whose funds invested in this crap got massacred : CalPERS , the California Public Employees ' Retirement System , had $ 1.1 billion in commodities when the crash came .And the damage did n't just come from oil .Soaring food prices driven by the commodities bubble led to catastrophes across the planet , forcing an estimated 100 million people into hunger and sparking food riots throughout the Third World .BUBBLE # 5 - RIGGING THE BAILOUT After the oil bubble collapsed last fall , there was no new bubble to keep things humming - this time , the money seems to be really gone , like worldwide - depression gone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.26652"}

Steele , co - author with Donald L. Bartlett of The Betrayal of the American Dream . \"The US was a great believer in free trade after World War II , \" opening up its borders to foreign products , often unilaterally , Steele explains .\" Underlying this was the idea of reciprocity - that when they got back on their feet they would take our products , leading to true free trade .But reciprocity just did n't happen . \"Japan and Europe kept up trade barriers to US products , and by the early 1970s , this was harming many US manufacturers - long before China embraced capitalism .Congress vowed to act .It crafted legislation ostensibly to defend the American worker and demand fairer trade policies .Bills were passed in 1974 , 1979 and again in 1984 .But by the 1970s , American companies became hungry for profits from outsourcing - high margins that would have been impinged by tougher trade legislation .And so each of bills , explains Steele , was hijacked by corporate lobbyists , eager to further open the door to foreign markets .By 1993 , when Congress adopted the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) , lawmakers dropped the pretense that they were protecting American workers .Rather , despite pitting US jobs directly against low - wage Mexican workers , President Bill Clinton and politicians from both parties claimed that the pact would actually create many thousands of high paying jobs to replace the low - paying ones lost .On the contrary , NAFTA 's net effect was to eliminate more than 650,000 jobs , according to the Economic Policy Institute .Sixty percent were in manufacturing .Globalization put the American middle class on a level playing field with workers everywhere .Even for those whose jobs were n't outsourced , the shift tilted the power balance decidedly in favor of the employers , at the expense of workers .While capital could flee across borders in search of a better or cheaper opportunity , labor was stuck at home .That made it far harder for Americans to demand higher wages .With Wall Street focused on quarterly returns , bosses no longer recognized the self - interest in generous pay .Henry Ford 's virtuous circle had been transformed into a downward spiral .The jobs did n't flee abroad immediately .Instead , they have dissipated with time , at an increasingly rapid pace .Since 2000 , US multinationals - which pay higher wages , and employ more than one in five US workers - sent millions of jobs overseas , slashing 2.9 million domestic jobs , while adding 2.4 million abroad , according to the Federal Reserve .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.719864"}

'The second thing I would say is that the Oath Keepers are there to protect your rights .We care about you , regardless of all the lies that the media and some other instigators have tried to propagate .Black lives matter , we care about you , we love you and we are there to protect you .Andrews also announced plans to hold a march through downtown Ferguson in which Oath Keepers members would accompany fifty African Americans armed with long barrel rifles .\" Every person we talked to [ among black protesters ] said if they carried [ guns ] they 'd be shot by police .That 's the reason we 're going to hold this event and it will be a legal demonstration , \" Andrews said .\" I 'm sick and tired of law enforcement who does n't think they have to abide by the law .Color blindness and self - defense These statements and actions by Oath Keepers reflected an ideology of color blindness , as expressed in their November 2014 letter to Ferguson residents : . \" For us , this is not about race .This is about defending the Bill of Rights , which is a shield against government abuse that is meant to protect ALL Americans , of whatever color .Those of us who served in Marine or Army infantry learned to see only one color : green .Oath Keepers ' color blindness ideology set them miles apart from the Klan and other white nationalist groups .Their criticism of the Ferguson cops and support for the community 's right to protest contrasted with , for example , the Patriot Action Network ( a Tea Party group ) , which claimed that Ferguson protesters had threatened to rape the wives of police officers .And by invoking the Deacons for Defense and urging African Americans to arm themselves , Oath Keepers stomped on one of the traditional core principles of U.S. white supremacy , that black people must never practice - or be able to practice - self - defense .To be clear , color blindness is not an anti - racist ideology .It opposes overt racial discrimination but also masks ( and thus helps to protect ) the implicit but powerful racial oppression that remains central to U.S. society .Oath Keepers ' critique of police repression , for example , did n't acknowledge the fact that cop violence systematically targets people of color .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.15564"}

{"text": "But this is not nearly enough , as almost any original movement can be seen this way .An alternative approach to populism is taken from a more radical left viewpoint .Ernesto Laclau , a philosopher of the Marxist tradition , in his essay Towards a Theory of Populism , is an essential reference point here .It has no inherent program or political orientation but through the discourse of \" the leader \" towards the audience of \" the people \" a certain political subjectivity emerges through \" interpellations \" and \" the people \" develop an identity that did not exist before .[ 13 ] .The limitation of Laclau 's analysis is analyzed by the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek .Zizek postulates that populism seeks to overcome a refusal of a complicated systemic analysis by using a logic of \" reaction .\" For Laclau , populism represents a neutral space for which open struggle can incorporate a larger and necessary sphere and where the content of what is at stake is formed .This means that in populism the content is situation - specific and this specificity is never predetermined , while a theory such as class struggle \" presupposes a particular social group ( the working class ) as a privileged political agent .\" [ 14 ] For Laclau , the series of equivalencies does not have to be the result of a general particular struggle .In some cases it can be worker 's struggle , in others anti - colonial or anti - racist .The inherent nature of populism is thus a form of frustration or grievance being \" interpellated \" through a new discourse , but this frustration is mitigated by the \" reactionary \" belief that there is a hidden agent causing all the problems .As Zizek puts it : .Populism is ultimately always sustained by ordinary people 's frustrated exasperation , by a cry of \" I do n't know what 's going on , I just know I 've had enough of it !It ca n't go on !It must stop ! \" - an impatient outburst , a refusal to understand , exasperation at complexity , and the ensuing conviction that there must be somebody responsible for all the mess , which is why an agent who is behind the scenes and explains it all is required .[ 15 ] .Zizek goes further , contrasting the populist discourse to the Marxist one : .For a Marxist , on the contrary ... the pathological ( deviating misbehavior of some elements ) is the symptom of the normal , an indicator of what is wrong in the very structure that is threatened with \" pathological \" outbursts .For Marx , economic crises are the key to understanding the \" normal \" functioning of capitalism ...[16 ] .It follows that a theory of populism is not so much an idealistic economic / political enacting of policies , an unrealistic relationship between demands and conditions , ideological \" interpellation \" or solely marked by the will of political charisma .Instead , these characteristics arise from the original lack of systemic analysis that utilizes a logic and rhetoric of \" alien \" elements infecting the unified and potentially balanced social whole .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.1008"}

{"text": "[ 3 ] The nationalisms of Catalonia , Quebec and Flanders have been escribed as cultural .[ 4 ] .Since the process of decolonisation that occurred after World War II , there has been a rise of Third World nationalisms .Third world nationalisms occur in those nations that have been colonized and exploited .The nationalisms of these nations were forged in a furnace that required resistance to colonial domination in order to survive .As such , resistance is part and parcel of such nationalisms and their very existence is a form of resistance to imperialist intrusions .Third World nationalism attempts to ensure that the identities of Third World peoples are authored primarily by themselves , not colonial powers .[5 ] .Many nationalist movements in the world are dedicated to national liberation , in the view that their nations are being persecuted by other nations and thus need to exercise self - determination by liberating themselves from the accused persecutors .Liberal nationalism is a kind of nationalism defended recently by political philosophers who believe that there can be a non-xenophobic form of nationalism compatible with liberal values of freedom , tolerance , equality , and individual rights .[ 7 ] Ernest Renan , author of \" Qu'est - ce qu'une nation ?\" [ 8 ] and John Stuart Mill [ 9 ] are often thought to be early liberal nationalists .Liberal nationalists often defend the value of national identity by saying that individuals need a national identity in order to lead meaningful , autonomous lives [ 10 ] and that liberal democratic polities need national identity in order to function properly .[ 11 ] .National conservatism is a political term used primarily in Europe to describe a variant of conservatism which concentrates more on national interests than standard conservatism , while not being nationalist or a far - right approach .Many national conservatives are social conservatives , in favour of limiting immigration , and in Europe , they usually are eurosceptics .National conservatism is related to social conservatism , and as such may be heavily oriented towards the traditional family and social stability .Within the European Union , for instance , they argue there are over 500 ethnic nations [ 12 ] within the 25 member states , and even more in Asia , Africa , and the Americas .Moving from this position , they argue that the achievement of meaningful self - determination for all of the worlds nations requires an anarchist political system based on local control , free federation , and mutual aid .There has been a long history of anarchist involvement with left - nationalism all over the world .Contemporary fusions of anarchism with anti - state left - Nationalism include some strains of Black anarchism and Indigenism .In the early to mid 19th century Europe , the ideas of nationalism , socialism , and liberalism were closely intertwined .Revolutionaries and radicals like Giuseppe Mazzini aligned with all three in about equal measure .[ 13 ] The early pioneers of anarchism participated in the spirit of their times : they had much in common with both liberals and socialists , and they shared much of the outlook of early nationalism as well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.23874"}

' 'So as I was stepping into the elevator when the plane hit .And it just blasted me into the elevator , you sort of just smashed off the back and did n't realize what had happened .The doors had almost closed , or as much as I could tell , and it was just a complete firestorm .The elevator split at the seams , the floor blew up .You could just sort of look right through the corner of the elevator into the elevator shaft and it was just all fire .And the elevator was filling up with thick , black smoke ; you really could n't breathe .On his climb to escape : ' 'This probably was maybe five to ten seconds after it hit .And I actually thought , you know , you sort of have this thing that goes through your mind which is how stupid was it to get into an elevator during a panic situation .And you always want to know how you 're going to die and I thought to myself , well , now I know .I 'm going to die in an elevator .I mean obviously there must have been a bomb or something and there was one in each tower , etc .No one thought it was a plane .However , what I noticed was the doors had n't closed all the way .They were still open about an inch .So I was able to crawl out .And then when I crawled out you just saw an absolute scene of destruction .Across from me , because when you crawl out you 're facing the other elevator bank , they were completely destroyed .There was fire just shooting out those .The ceiling had collapsed .There were bodies like blown into the alcove a bit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "140.62703"}
{"text": "As soon as I hit the button , that 's when there was a big boom .We both got knocked down .I remember feeling this intense heat .The doors were still open .The heat lasted for maybe 15 to 20 seconds I guess .Then it stopped .At the time , when this happened , the elevator was shaking and I thought it was moving .But actually , it never moved .So when it stopped , me and her were able to walk out of the elevator , like into the lobby .She said to me , she could n't feel her feet .I ca n't walk .She said she was going to stay there .So I said all right , I was going to try to get some help .All I remember was looking around after that and seeing people on the floor , just sprawled out , knocked out , blood everywhere , people crying .One guy had his insides they were like totally out , like a horror movie .So I was just trying to fathom what had happened .I thought it was a bomb , I did n't know it was a plane .So there was smoke all around , and I walked around towards the windows , and I found an open window that had gotten shattered through .And I started to breathe through that open window .I was there about three minutes and then this guy , I do n't know who he was , he said , I 've found a staircase .He could walk a little bit better than anyone else , and he was trying to get people out .I was just trying to get some air .If I had thought the window was going to come down , I would have been in a lot more panic .I found the staircase , and I started to make my way down the staircase .So I went down 78 flights .I remember being bloodied up , but I do n't remember pain from my burns .It was n't until I got down to the bottom that I started to feel weird . ' ' Doris also got out , he does n't know how .He thinks her burns were worse than his ( his were on 50 percent of his body , he said ) , even though he was closer to the door of the elevator at impact , and he actually thought he had protected her .
