{"text": "The bigger question this year is whether we can believe the conventional polls , especially when they are being used to determine who qualifies for the debates , which can potentially influence the outcome .Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie have been eliminated from Tuesday 's main debate , along with George Pataki and Lindsay Graham being excluded from the undercard debate .Even some pollsters have argued that the polls should not be used in this manner .One problem is that the Republican candidates are too close together to use the polls to separate them .Then there is the question of whether the polls are all that accurate in predicting a primary election well before the vote .I 've followed the Democratic primaries far more closely , and have noted many times how little predictive value the polls have .This polling report from December 2007 described how Clinton had a huge lead over Obama .In December 2003 , Howard Dean was pulling away in the polls .Eventual winner John Kerry was in sixth place with only 4 percent , even trailing Al Sharpton .Among the problems with these polls , many voters in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire do not decide until the last minute .People are far more likely to switch between relatively similar members of their own party than they are to switch from a liberal Democrat to a conservative Republican in a general election .Pollsters also adjust the raw results based upon projections as to who will actually vote , but that is difficult to predict .Some polls this year are basing their prediction upon whether someone voted in previous Democratic primaries , but this excludes the people are who , at least from discussions on line , are saying they have just recently registered to vote Democratic in order to vote for Sanders .There is no good way to determine how many of these people , or how many who are turning out in huge numbers for Sanders events , will really vote .The results out of Iowa and New Hampshire could radically alter the results in subsequent states when the media covers the winners more favorably and voters see them in a new light .Pollsters are having an even more difficult time .An article at The New Yorker described how much fewer people are even responding to polls : .The participation rate - the number of people who take a survey as a percentage of the population - is far lower .Election pollsters sample only a minuscule portion of the electorate , not uncommonly something on the order of a couple of thousand people out of the more than two hundred million Americans who are eligible to vote .The promise of this work is that the sample is exquisitely representative .We wo n't be able to be in business ! \"A typical response rate is now in the single digits .Another problem is that fewer people have landlines : .Even if more people could be persuaded to answer the phone , polling would still be teetering on the edge of disaster .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.03197"}
