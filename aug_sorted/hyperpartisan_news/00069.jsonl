{"text": "The Space Management Branch Chief said that the formula for GSA 's funding of the new Headquarters called for GSA to pay $ 33.00 per square foot of space and for ATF to pay anything above that amount .According to a senior ATF budget official , ATF 's share of the project covering design changes , security features , furnishings , equipment , and relocation expenses , will have cost approximately $ 90 million by the end of the project .This official told us that of this amount , $ 60 million has been funded through Congressional appropriations , leaving ATF to find at least $ 30 million in additional funds .The additional $ 30 million in costs was driven in part by construction design changes made after the plans for the new Headquarters had been drawn up .30 The New Building Project Office ( NBPO ) attributed some of the design changes to ATF 's internal reorganization after moving from Treasury to the DOJ .According to the New Building Project Manager , ATF 's move resulted in the loss of the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade regulation offices .This , coupled with the formation of the Office of Strategic Information and Intelligence directorate ( OSII ) , resulted in significant changes to the layout of the new Headquarters .The project manager told us that the changes to the layout consisted mainly of reconfiguring walls , entranceways , and other features related to office space .One of the more significant modifications involved the JSOC , which is operated by the OSII directorate .However , as discussed later in this section , witnesses disputed the need for the changes to the JSOC even with the creation of the new directorate .Other design changes to the new Headquarters building , such as a redesign of the blast curtain in front of the structure , resulted from errors and omissions in the original design , or from unforeseen conditions at the site of the new Headquarters .Finally , some of the design changes , such as changes to the Director 's Suite , were alleged to be unnecessary or frivolous changes and were proposed or authorized by Truscott .We focus on those changes in subsection 3 , below .ATF officials recognized that ATF would have to pay for any increased costs associated with deviations from and corrections to the original new Headquarters building plans .On June 16 , 2005 , ATF 's Office of Management submitted another request to DOJ to reprogram $ 13.5 million in funds from expired ATF accounts for use in funding the new Headquarters .The request was approved by the DOJ and subsequently by Congress in September 2005 .A senior budget official explained that even after this reprogramming , ATF had to use money from its operational funds to cover outstanding construction and other costs remaining from the initial $ 30 million shortfall .This official told us that since September 2005 ATF had been seeking DOJ approval to reprogram another $ 8.3 million to replenish the operational funds that were being applied toward construction of the new Headquarters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.59851"}

Issa seemed quite aware that his goal of resolving the congressional investigation in 2011 was going to be obstructed by an administration in full cover - up mode .Issa also revealed that the reason a special prosecutor has not yet been brought in to investigate the plot is that once a special prosecutor begins to investigate , the Oversight Committee has to stop its own inquiry .The committee wants to be certain that they have explored every avenue and leave no source or witness uninvestigated before turning over the case .He also pointed out that a special prosecutor will be a Department of Justice employee investigating his own employer .Thus , Issa wants to be certain that they have enough knowledge to hold the prosecutor accountable . wants to see a special prosecutor appointed to investigate the matter .That creates a clear pattern of we 'd like to know who did know and why they did n't brief the attorney general .During May testimony to the House Judiciary Committee , Holder was asked when he first became aware of Operation Fast and Furious .He responded , \" I 'm not sure of the exact date , but I probably heard about Fast and Furious for the first time over the last few weeks .WASHINGTON - CBS News has obtained secretly recorded conversations that raise questions as to whether some evidence is being withheld in the murder of a Border Patrol agent .( Scroll down to listen to the audio )The tapes were recorded approximately mid - March 2011 by the primary gun dealer cooperating with ATF in its \" Fast and Furious \" operation : Andre Howard , owner of Lone Wolf Trading Company in Glendale , Arizona .He 's talking with the lead case ATF case agent Hope MacAllister .As CBS News first reported last February , the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives allegedly allowed thousands of weapons to \" walk \" onto the streets without interdiction into the hands of suspected traffickers for Mexican drug cartels in its operation \" Fast and Furious .Court records have previously only mentioned two weapons : Romanian WASR \" AK-47 type \" assault rifles .Both were allegedly sold to suspects who were under ATF 's watch as part of Fast and Furious .Also , a ballistics report turned over to Congressional investigators only mentions the two WASR rifles .The ballistics report says it 's inconclusive as to whether either of the WASR rifles fired the bullet that killed Terry .Law enforcement sources and others close to the Congressional investigation say the Justice Department 's Inspector General obtained the audio tapes several months ago as part of its investigation into Fast and Furious .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.32814"}

Ellis , Wisconsin officials are acknowledging that at least 12,000 DNA samples that were supposed to be taken from convicted felons and databased are missing from the state registry .So why is there no outcry ?Why are ten , or thirty , or fifty dead women so easy to leave behind ?Sure , we read these stories with prurient interest .The term \" serial killer \" piques imagination and inspires Hollywood stories .But nobody seems to be able to take the next step , to behaving as if injustice to victims matters as much as injustice to anyone else .For it is n't just that Ellis ' DNA sample disappeared .It 's far worse than that .Ellis convinced another felon to give a sample for him .On discovering the duplication of samples in the database , the tech simply threw out the one wrongly attributed to Ellis and left his profile blank .It sounds as if this happened all the time , but nobody did anything about it .Ellis was released from prison three months before the faked DNA sample was noticed , and his address was known , but authorities did nothing to obtain an accurate sample .Even with a serial killer operating in Ellis ' neighborhood , and his own prior record , there apparently was n't enough curiosity about his effort to conceal his DNA .Bodies , Bodies Everywhere : .DNA technology has been used in criminal convictions in the United States since 1987 , when the first rape case was won using DNA in Orlando , Florida .Despite the astonishing promise of this technology , it was years before some states even began testing suspects for DNA , and nearly a decade passed before the FBI managed to convince the first few states to begin sharing samples .At every step of the way , civil liberties organizations have fought implementation of DNA testing , except , of course , in cases where it might be used to exonerate someone .Georgia recently passed the threshold of solving 1500 cold cases from their database , though \" solving \" does n't necessarily translate into convicting the offenders .Who 's got the money for all that ?And Georgia , like every other state , still suffers from perennial backlogs and rape kits that go missing .Meanwhile , murderers like Brian Nichols get stables of silk - stocking lawyers on the public dime .Little wonder the bodies keep piling up .In addition to the seven murder victims now tied to Walter E. Ellis , twenty other similar , unsolved murders are being investigated again .That 's twenty - seven raped and murdered women in Milwaukee whose killers were never caught .Why ?Lack of resources .Too many murderers , and not enough cops : .Nick Sandoval , a detective . . .said the homicide unit was understaffed and detectives were often overwhelmed by the number of killings they were investigating .There were 85 homicides that year .\" We were so short - handed , \" he said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.40224"}

Daniel had produced some 60,500 handguns and an untold number of accessories , including silencers and machine - gun kits .Among the guns it produced was Nicholas Elliot 's weapon , the Cobray M - l1/9 , which it fondly advertised as \" The gun that made the 80s roar . \"Condemned by the police , reviled even by those who sell it , the gun has been remarkably controversial ever since its creation as a cheap , reliable submachine gun meant specifically for close military combat .\" The premise seems to be that if they 've got the right to do something , then that 's the right thing to do . \"The Baltimore county police shooting range occupies a wooded compound just north of Towson , Maryland , where the six - lane strip roads of Baltimore taper to rolling two - lane highways .When I visited there recently , I heard firing the moment I stepped from my car - a sound something like what you 'd get if you put a stethoscope beside a cooking package of microwave popcorn .The range was carved from a hillock , leaving a plane half the size of a football field bordered on one end by an earthen cliff that keeps stray rounds from bounding north into Baltimore County horse country .Supenski arrived carrying a gray attache case , and led me onto the range .Supenski is a big fan of guns and shooting .\" I grew up in the era of the B westerns , \" he told me . \" Loved them , still love them .My single most prized possession is an original Colt single - action ' cowboy ' gun .Nickel - plated , hand - engraved , ivory stock .\"But he also believes in more - stringent controls to force a heightened level of responsibility in the sale and use of firearms .This has not won him many friends among the gunslingers of America .One pro - gun group twice threatened to kill him , prompting a mischievous female assistant to don a bulletproof vest one afternoon before joining him for lunch .His is a pragmatic stance .He worries that irresponsible behavior by gun dealers , manufacturers , and the NRA may soon lead to controls far more restrictive than the simple regulations now sought by proponents of moderate gun control .He considers the Cobray pistol made by S.

{"text": "\" One episode in particular illustrates the lengths to which the company was willing to go .In January of 1983 the Daniels invited two men , Joseph Ledbetter and James Travis Motes , to their home to make the men a proposition .Ledbetter and Motes had installed air - conditioning in the RPB offices and electrical wiring in the S. W. Daniel headquarters .The Daniels suggested that they diversify into the business of making the outer tubes for silencers .S. W. Daniel would make the internal parts .The two companies would advertise in the same gun publications and travel to the same gun shows .By selling only parts , both would stay on the right side of federal law requiring registration of completed silencers .Indeed , no law barred the sale of silencer parts .In the eyes of the law , however , any consumer who merely took delivery of both internal parts and tubes would automatically possess a completed silencer - a felony if the silencer was unregistered .But again , that was the consumer 's worry .Ledbetter and Motes founded L & M Guns and began selling their tubes through Shotgun News and at gun shows around the country .The Daniels , meanwhile , began advertising their internal - parts kits and displaying them at the same gun shows .On at least one occasion the two companies found themselves facing each other across an aisle .The ATF began an investigation after a detective with the Mono County , California , sheriff 's office discovered an unregistered silencer during a search .The investigation quickly gained momentum .At one point an ATF special agent , Peter Urrea , posed as the president of the Widow Makers Motorcycle Club and ordered silencer components from L & M Guns .He also said he had a criminal record .The components were sent , no questions asked .On July 19 , 1984 , ATF agents raided the company , seizing firearms , components , and , most important , customer lists and shipping records .The ATF used the seized records to launch some 400 individual investigations relating to arms trafficking and illegal possession of restricted weapons .In June of 1985 ATF agents arrested the Daniels and , using an experimental tactic , charged them with conspiracy to sell illegal silencers .( By now the Daniels had divorced , but they had continued to have a close working relationship . )Later , in formal court arguments , they would claim that they were simply trying to fill a valid need for replacement parts for silencers owned by legitimate users .The ATF 's investigators found a rather different story .All in all , from November of 1983 to July of 1984 , the government charged , S. W. Daniel had mailed some 6,000 silencer and machine - gun kits .Only four buyers had bothered to register the devices .When the ATF ran the customer lists through the FBI 's National Crime Information Center databank , it found that more than fifty customers had prior criminal records or were believed to be involved in drug peddling and other forms of organized crime .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.8241"}

{"text": "Disgusting behaviour .He should have lost his job .This is what I was thinking as well .In an emergency , people swear .That 's just how it is .It 's just uncontrollable and the 911 person being called should know that and be able to continue on as if it was normal language .Like ... if someone said fudge instead of fuck is that really that crucial to helping them out ?Seems weird .Sorry if I sound like I am venting .This is not directed at the OP either .I just know people who have called 911 and have had many issues like this or other such things .I really really appreciate the good ones .I 'm pretty amazed at how much it seems people are bothered by cursing , with even the OP saying they 'd ask the person to stop cursing .Do I just live in some strange place where people do n't bat an eye at swearing ( especially in a life and death situation ) , or are 911 operators especially sensitive ?I ca n't even begin to say how angry that link made me .I hope that cop is no longer working anywhere , and is n't getting a pension .I know that is mean , but there has to be some serious consequences for that type of behavior .In his position and making the kind of money he is making that is a waste on so many fronts .I had to get that out .EDIT : I just wanted to add that I 'm so thankful there are good dispatchers ( like the one doing this AMA ) and cops and rescue crew that not only do their job but do it well .And I know everyone has their breaking point , but if you watch this video it is clear the girl did not have this coming , and he put a life at risk .Have you ever had a call from someone you knew or found out later that you knew them ?I know some EMTs / Firefighters do n't like to work in the same town they live so they wo n't respond to an emergency of someone they know .Do 911 operators do this too ?No , actually , I have n't .Well , not a citizen anyhow .I 've heard many thank you 's from officers when we have an officer involved shooting but not yet from a citizen .I think it has a lot to do with how anonymous we are to the public .They do n't know us individually , but only as the people on the other end of 911 when they call .Sort of related anecdote : a few weeks ago in my city , a dispatcher got a call about his own car being stolen .Some guy stole it out of the parking lot while he was on shift .Another dispatcher was outside smoking and saw the dude driving away , so she called 911 and said \" Hey Bill , someone just stole your car \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "133.17957"}

{"text": "I work at a mental health facility for those who are chronically ill , and from the bottom of my heart , thank you and your fellows for your patience .As per patients rights they always have access to a phone and can report crime , emergencies and rights violations at any time .... even if they are imaginary .Sometimes we get someone who is a hypochondriac .Thank you for what you do - I know it must be frustrating sometimes .My old blackberry used to pocket dial 911 on a daily basis .The screen locked , but when you tried to unlock it one of the two options was to dial 911 , so if you hit enough buttons on the phone it would end up calling .Sorry on behalf of people like me .It 's not normally our fault , just a terrible phone design .As one of those kids , I apologize .When I found out that Santa Claus was n't real , I extended that to the tooth fairy , the easter bunny , God , and 911 .I thought , \" you dial three numbers and some guys just magically show up to rescue you ?nah , that 's made up .\" Tried it on a dare and was amazed to find out it was a real thing .Not to attempt to hijack this AMA , but I 'd like to point out that in my experience as a 9 - 1 - 1 dispatcher , kids make some of the best callers .They are typically highly cooperative , provide great information , and are eager to help .Kids do make some of the best callers !I listened to a tape once during a training course of a 4 year old girl that was able to tell the dispatcher that her dad shot her mom , gave his clothing description , vehicle description and that she thought he was going to his cousin 's house .Police were able to catch him while driving , murder weapon still in hand .The little girl is like 13 now and does n't remember any of it .Still gives me the chills .Kids are very literal .Even in emergency situations , they can focus and answer questions very well .They give excellent details on descriptions .I think it may have a lot to do with the fact that they are in the learning process still and they are getting the chance to show someone how smart they are .For example : Dispatcher : \" What color shirt did he have on ? \"Kid : \" Well , I think it was the color ...... green , yeah green !\" i think it 's also the mindset / emotional development of a child .a 15 year old seeing their mom bleeding out will be instantly crushed with the realization they will never see their mom for the rest of their lives etc . whereas a small child will not have the terrible realization until later .It has nothing to do with lying , and has much more to do with the difference between how an adult brain works and 4 year old child 's brain work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "137.96704"}
