{"text": "I am very upset that I was charged $ 219.00 each for tickets with a face value of $ 50.00 , plus a service fee of $ 81.04 .You should post the face value of the tickets you are selling so the customer would know what they are getting .While your price was similar to prices found on other websites , not knowing the face value of the ticket made it difficult to determine how the price compared to the value .I do n't think a scalper would have sold these tickets for the price you charged .Our Response on Wednesday , Sep 05 , 2012 at 5:43 PM : Hello Mary Ellen !Thank you for taking the time to leave feedback on our site .We 've addressed the face value and the service fee issue in the past ( see below ) but would like to address the issue you mentioned about not advertising the face value of tickets .There are a few reasons for this ... .First , we at TL do n't directly own event tickets and therefore do n't have inside knowledge about ticket face value .There are over 70,000 events listed on our exchange , too , so we could n't possibly research the face value of every single ticket for every single event .We do n't believe it would be a good use of our resources to spend time and money researching ticket face values - especially since we 'd have to pass those costs off to consumers .Second , the face value of a given ticket is not necessarily what your ticket seller paid to access the ticket .Sometimes venues part with tickets below face value ( season ticket sales ) and other times ticket sellers access event tickets from other third - party suppliers .The end result is that the face value of a ticket can give customers the wrong idea about the profit margins of their seller .Third , the face value of a given ticket is not always representative of what that ticket is really worth .Almost any other product you can buy is priced by its owner based on the rule of supply and demand - market value and so forth .Event tickets have traditionally been stamped with a fiat price that bears little relation to the real worth of an event experience ( from the customer 's perspective ) .And , of course , it 's worth pointing out that hardly any product in the marketplace advertises its initial sale price ...No one knows how much their local clothing store really paid for that dress in the window .No one knows how much their local florist really paid for those flowers .The fact that the initial sale price of event tickets is n't printed for all to see is thus not an unusual thing .I found and bought 2 tickets for my boyfriend and I. Of course , narturally and very obviously if someone buys 2 tickets they would ecxpect to recieve the seats to be next to one another .No not in my case , I have received 2 tickets with a seat between us .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.38666"}

Success !He stated it was from the airline , but at this point , after almost 6 hours on the phone , I decided it was worth it to not have to deal with this anymore .I know people will criticize me for using Priceline for airline tickets , but the weather was unexpected , and neither the airline nor myself caused this issue .Thanks to Frontier , they were the most helpful !Writing this just to that others may know about issues that you may have to deal with by buying tickets through Priceline .OK so here is my story .I in this the month of January turned 20 , graduated from nursing school ( LPN ) , and was accepted into an RN program .So it is a big month for me , and my mom being the best in the entire world bought us tickets to go to New York ! ! !She wanted it to be a present for me for graduating and my b - day .Well she bought the tickets a couple months ago when everything was pretty OK where her health ( she has been battling cancer for about a year ) , but just this past month her health had taken a down turn .Her leg ( where the cancerous tumor was ) is not receiving the skin graft and doctors are freaking out about the chance of infection and having to amputate the leg , so we are already under a lot of stress .The doctors say no traveling and with good reason , my mom still wanted me to go and have fun and take a friend with me instead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.46988"}

{"text": "The Local Pickup option is primarily relevant for near - term events that require last - minute delivery .The reason for that is because tickets are often irreplaceable items and sellers want to make sure they end up with the correct party .A seller would n't want to provide tickets so quickly to someone whose name is different from the person who ordered the tickets .Someone , for instance , might steal your card , order some tickets , and then input their name as the pick - up name for the order .Sellers want to guard against such fraud and protect consumer security by making sure that the right person receives the right tickets .In situations like the one you reference , the best thing to do would be to contact the seller supplying your order and explain the situation .Individual sellers would likely have procedures in place to address the issue you 're raising .You 'd just need to contact the seller to ascertain the exact procedure they would need you to follow .The seller may want some more information from you or for you to sign something that testifies to the name change for the order .Again , we 're sorry for the inconvenience , but the procedures in place are truly in everyone 's benefit , so as to reduce the chances of credit card fraud with ticket orders .I ordered two tickets to the Detroit Tigerss Game on July 16 .I never received the tickets .Instead I received 3 tickets to some concert in August .I caledl the representative in Royal Oak Michigan , Phillip at 248 - 613 - 1632 and he told me he sent the wrong tickets to the wrong person and asked me to send the tickets I received back .I did so and he received them on July 3 .I could and now wish I had simply thrown them away , however I did what he asked .He told me he would refund my money , less the 27.02 service charge .The total he charged me on my Visa Card was 188.02 and as of this date has not done what he said he was going to do .I will never use Ticket Liquidator again and have informed many friends never to consider this service for event tickets .Very poor reputation .Gerald Holman .Our Response on Wednesday , Jul 11 , 2012 at 6:26 PM : Hello Gerald !Thank you very much for your feedback .We 're certainly sorry for all the confusion with your ticket order .We have since dealt with you in regards to this ticketing issue .It would appear that you initially ordered tickets for the Tigers game and that your seller subsequently sent you the wrong tickets .The problem is that the seller has informed us that you proactively wanted to cancel your Tigers order at that point and did n't want those tickets anymore .The seller could have provided the tickets to you easily , but you opted not to have them .The seller was nevertheless still within their rights to fulfill the order and thus were not obligated to cancel the purchase .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.99765"}
