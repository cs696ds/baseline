Ron Johnson of Wisconsin , a vulnerable incumbent , said in an email to CNN .Political calculation .The political calculation underscores the high - stakes nature of the 2016 campaign .The race for control of the Senate -- and the future of the Supreme Court -- is playing out against the backdrop of an already tumultuous presidential race .With 24 GOP Senate seats at play compared to 10 for the Democrats , both sides are already calculating how the Supreme Court vacancy could upend the high - stakes battle for the Senate , where Republicans currently hold a 54 - 46 majority .Democrats believe McConnell must feel his grip on the Senate majority is at risk to let Obama 's nominee come forward .On Sunday , Sen. Chuck Schumer , the likely next Democratic leader , foreshadowed the Democratic attack line .\" The American people do n't like obstruction , \" Schumer , a New York Democrat , said on ABC 's \" This Week . \"\" When you go right off the bat and say , ' I do n't care who he nominates , I am going to oppose him , ' that 's not going to fly . \"Schumer added : \" I believe that many of the mainstream Republicans , when the president nominates a mainstream nominee , will not want to follow Mitch McConnell over the cliff . \"Schumer and his aides declined to comment further , but other Democratic senators and aides believe the pressure will be unsustainable , especially if the Supreme Court reaches a spate of 4 - 4 rulings and Obama chooses a qualified nominee widely viewed in the mainstream of judicial thought .Since 1975 , no nominee has waited for a confirmation vote longer than 108 days from the time he or she was selected .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "31.239555"}

Chuck Grassley , the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , made a similar statement , saying that \" it only makes sense that we defer to the American people who will elect a new president to select the next Supreme Court justice . \"Beth Levine , a Grassley spokeswoman , declined to comment beyond the statement , which did not address whether the Senate Judiciary Committee would have a hearing on the next nominee .Vulnerable Republicans stay mum .Whether vulnerable Republicans will change that dynamic remains to be seen .Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio , who is in a tough Senate race , issued a statement Saturday praising Scalia 's tenure on the court , but did n't address whether he opposes any nominee coming for a vote .Toomey of Pennsylvania made similar remarks , and a spokesman declined to comment Sunday .A spokeswoman for Kirk , the Illinois Republican , did n't respond to an inquiry seeking comment .And while it 's unclear where New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte stands , her Democratic opponent , Gov.

Bush succeeded in pushing through a slate of D.C. Circuit judges who included hard - core conservatives such as Thomas Griffith , Brett Kavanaugh , and Janice Rogers Brown .They have done all kinds of work for the right since then .Most recently , Brown came through with a ruling against Obamacare 's requirement that employers provide health insurance that covers contraception .As Bush lined up his nominees to the courts ( not to mention federal agencies ) , the Democrats kept their promise only to filibuster selectively , based on \" extraordinary circumstances . \" As a result , Bush was able to build a federal judiciary with an overwhelming majority of Republican - appointed judges .As Charlie Savage wrote in 2008 before Obama became president : \" Republican - appointed judges , most of them conservatives , are projected to make up 62 percent of the bench next Inauguration Day , up from 50 percent when Mr. Bush took office .They control 10 of the 13 circuits , while judges appointed by Democrats have a dwindling majority on just one circuit .\" That 's pretty much how the presidential power of appointment is supposed to work .You win the White House , you control the courts , until the next time around , when it 's the other party 's turn to pick judges .That has always been the norm , so it was actually the Republicans that changed the norm : .They have appointed just one of Obama 's five nominees to the D.C.

Circuit Court of Appeals , one of the most important courts in the country .An ordinary observer might look at this and assume there was a problem with the nominees .Were they too extreme ?Not qualified ?Unprepared for the tasks ahead of them ?In this case , not at all .Instead , it 's just another chapter in the GOP 's long effort to gum up the works and disrupt the White House through abuse of the filibuster , an otherwise extraordinary measure that has become a routine part of governance in the age of GOP extremism .North Carolina Representative Mel Watt - President Obama 's nominee to the FHFA - is a long - time member of Congress with twenty years on the House Financial Services Committee .It 's fair to disagree with his priorities as a lawmaker and potential regulator , but there 's no question he 's qualified for the position .Republicans do n't have a specific complaint with Watt , and have n't questioned his ability to do the job .Their only issue , it seems , is that Watt is the Democratic nominee of a Democratic president .Indeed , Republicans would prefer that Obama stuck with the acting FHFA director , Edward DeMarco , who entered the agency as an appointee of George W. Bush .\" We 've spent so much time at the White House prior to them naming a nominee asking them to please not appoint a politician , please appoint a technocrat , \" said Tennessee Republican Bob Corker in an interview with Bloomberg . \" To have a politician in that position , to me is inappropriate .\" The problem for Corker and his colleagues is that the Constitution does n't outline requirements for presidential appointees .Obama can choose whomever he likes ; the Senate 's job is to offer its advice and consent , which they 've declined , in favor of unprecedented obstruction .Watt is the first sitting member of Congress to be blocked for an appointment since 1843 .Patricia Millett is the other qualified nominee to face partisan obstruction from Senate Republicans .Nominated for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , she 's worked in Democratic and Republican administrations , argued dozens of cases before the Supreme Court , and has wide support from the legal community .She was even praised by Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz for her \" fine professional qualifications .\" But , like Watt , Millett is the Democratic nominee of a Democratic president .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.84018"}

{"text": "Now that majority - imposed reform has happened , will it spread rapidly to legislation the next time it matters ?Or will the incentives for Senators to retain it - keeping their individual influence - preserve it ?How will the new Senate actually work out in practice on nominations ?Will Senators still be able to put holds on nominations when it is n't backed up by the need for a super - majority to move to a final vote ?It 's worth noting that the filibuster / cloture procedure was not eliminated ( at least if I understand correctly ) ; instead , the number for cloture was dropped to a majority .Therefore , an objection can still slow things down for several days .Of course , now that the precedent has been set , that could be eliminated as well , presumably .Things do n't work that way anymore , and it 's pretty simple in this political instance .Why did Reid pull the trigger ?He was tired of making deals with McConnell , only to see their spirit violated by yet more obstruction , allies say .But none of these bargains affected the overall trend of blockage , and Reid finally had enough .The real reason Democrats were so eager to confirm Obama 's DC Circuit nominees , and Republicans were so desperate to block them , is that the court 's current conservative majority has repeatedly blocked the president 's agenda .Since most of the federal bureaucracy resides in DC , the DC Circuit is tasked with assessing the constitutionality of federal rules and regulations .Conservatives on the court have neutered much of Dodd - Frank , the post - recession financial reform bill that was meant to keep banks in check .The court also overturned Obama 's ability to appoint staff while Congress is out of town and struck down state environmental rules that would have regulated emissions from other states .Laws get passed .This removes that factor , and Jonathan Chait explains a few specific details here : .President Obama 's second - term agenda runs not through Congress but through his own administrative agencies .His appointees are writing rules for financial reform , housing policy and - the potentially enormous one - climate emissions .Senate Republicans have tried to stymie this agenda by blocking executive - branch appointments , most recently filibustering the nomination of Mel Watt to run the Federal Housing Finance Agency .The executive - branch filibuster has become a primary Republican weapon against Obama 's agenda .John McCain has predicted this will put a \" chill \" on the \" entire \" chamber , and Louisiana Sen. David Vitter has said that this is \" a shame for the Senate \" and \" scary and dictatorial \" for the country .But there 's nothing undemocratic about changing the rules to allow a majority to prevail , or - in this case - robbing a minority of a tool to obstruct without consequence .Indeed , if there 's anything undemocratic , it 's the GOP 's war on President Obama 's ability to make nominations , and to nullify one consequence of the 2012 elections .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.83205"}
{"text": "Major presence on high court .Appointed to the court in 1986 by President Ronald Reagan , Scalia was a conservative icon who transformed the court by instilling in it his belief that judges should follow the precise words of the Constitution and not apply a modern interpretation .He was the first justice of Italian - American heritage and passed through confirmation with a unanimous vote .Scalia changed oral arguments as he became an active participant with tough questions for advocates .He will be best known , perhaps , for his landmark decision District of Columbia v. Heller , holding that the Second Amendment protects the right to posses a firearm at home .He was a critic of Roe v. Wade and dissented in last term 's same - sex marriage cases .He wrote a stinging dissent in the same - sex marriage case Obergefell v. Hodges , calling the decision a \" threat to American democracy . \"He believed that marriage should be decided by the people , not the courts .He was also concerned that some members of the bench might determine that the death penalty is unconstitutional .Scalia caused a stir as recently as December when he made controversial comments during a hearing about the future of a program at the University of Texas that takes race into consideration as one factor of admissions .Scalia pushed a point that had been made in some friend of the court briefs filed in the case .It concerns a theory called \" mismatch \" popularized by authors Stuart Taylor Jr. and Richard Sander that suggests affirmative action programs do n't always benefit minorities .Although Roberts had mentioned the theory in a different case in 2013 , Scalia 's language was blunt .\" One of the briefs pointed out that most of the black scientists in this country do n't come from schools like the University of Texas , \" he said .This term was slated to be every bit as blockbuster as last term .The court is considering a major challenge to public sector unions , a race - conscious admissions plan at the University of Texas , a big abortion case , voting rights , the contraceptive mandate and a challenge to Obama 's immigration actions .Although in some of the cases Scalia probably indicated to his colleagues in conference which way he was going to vote , those preliminary votes are n't binding and are now void . \"The entire tenor of this term has now changed , \" said Stephen Vladeck , a CNN contributor and a law professor at American University Washington College Law . \" The court can try to go ahead , but on cases where they are split 4 - 4 , their only options are to leave the lower court decision intact or to hold the case over until Justice Scalia 's replacement is confirmed .\" If the Supreme Court is equally divided in a case , ruling 4 - 4 , it means the lower court opinion stands and there is no precedent set by the high court .The jaunty jurist was able to light up , or ignite , a room with his often brash demeanor and wicked sense of humor , grounded always in a profound respect for American law and its constitutional traditions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.99749"}
