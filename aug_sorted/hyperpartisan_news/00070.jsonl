Ann Coulter , as an American , is entitled to her opinion and the right to express it .II .Ann Coulter 's inflammatory rhetoric upsets the Fordham Community because her fighting words directly attack our members .III .Fordham University is a private institution , not a public forum , and the speakers it chooses reflect on the values of our Fordham community .IV .Ann Coulter 's self - expression is not compatible with the values the Fordham community professes - particularly the Jesuit tenet of \" Men and Women for and With Others \" .V. For these reasons , we feel that our tuition should not pay for Ann Coulter to speak at Fordham University or any Fordham Facility .The Fordham University Facebook page also was the focus of complaints .Here are some examples from a section called \" Comments by others \" which appears to have been taken down in the past few days , but which I screen captured on November 15 .The comments included alumni threats to withhold funds , and links to the Fordham Republicans ' Officers ' email addresses .Note the response by Fordham , which refers to Father McShane 's later letter condemning the Coulter appearance : .One of the Facebook users above , Thomas R. Riley , also posted a letter to Father McShane from the Editor in Chief of Fordham 's literary magazine urging Fordham to cancel the speech , with this commentary : .FORDHAM FRIENDS - Below is a letter from a Fordham Honors Student , Anne Buckel ' 13 , from Syracuse NY , who is asking Fr .McShane to cancel a scheduled appearance of Ann Coulter .I 'd like to get behind her effort and put some pressure on the University .Coulter is the living embodiment of everything the University DOES NOT stand for .Her public behavior is an affront to the Gospels , as well as the numerous Jesuit ideals the University ( with our support ) seeks to inculcate .Jesuit education calls all its students to be men and women for others .Ann Coulter , with her bigotry and hate speech , insults that principle .This is not the same as inviting a Buckley or a Liddy to discuss a conservative point of view , as happened many times back in the ' 70s and ' 80s , and which did boost public discourse .She has no place on the University stage .Please read Anne 's letter and let me know what you think .\" Some people express their views that seem particularly intended to inflame emotions that can be harmful to the safety and stability of our society , \" Jackaway said , referring to Coulter and people from parties across the political spectrum .While obviously opposed to Coulter 's politics and agenda on a personal level , Jackaway admits that it is not the place of the university to dictate who may and may not be allowed to speak on campus .Threats to Disrupt The Event .According to Mantia , as soon as the event was announced on Facebook the \" phones started blowing up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.210823"}

{"text": "But ....I'm finding it terribly hard to make some general claim as to the protected nature of speech from protest .When the architecture of discourse is not symmetric , as in a lecture hall with one speaker before an audience , one speaker is operationally favored .Even worse are cases where the speaker himself ( or herself ) controls the venue , either explicitly or implicitly through the use of plants in the audience to softball questions , etc .In those cases the opportunities for protest that represent countervailing speech acts ( and not suppression of the speech in question ) are very limited .If the venue allows for a rebuttal time , then one person may respond .If questions are allowed , then questions may be asked ( although these frustrate me to no end when used as avenues for soapboxing ) .This is not a problem if you accept the fundamental assumption that everyone ( on average ) is capable of telling rotten messages from good ones and therefore the broadcast of rotten messages will likely have no ill effect .This is what pains me .I DESPERATELY want to believe this .I 'm in school to be an economist , and this is kinda the fundamental basis for the profession : that we are , on the aggregate , actually capable of looking out for our best interests .But I do n't know .Certainly the students had this in mind when they unilaterally decided that their interpretation of Sorba 's speech would suffice as a proxy for others .If you accept that as given ( as some on feminisiting probably do ) , then they might be justified in stopping his speech .Presumably the logic would go something like this ( either one of two ways or both ) : .The continuation of his speech without strident protest might represent some tacit normative approval for the values behind his speech .This approval might be seen to stem from the university or from the students attending and approval of his views goes against everything that the student body is thought to believe in .there are a lot of ifs here , and I 'm not defending the reasoning , just speculating on it .More likely , the students felt that they had ( as in # 1 ) a superior understanding of the merits of Sorba 's speech than others might .They also felt that the nature of the platform and the repetition of the speech itself would inculcate these views into others or ( intertwined with the above point ) give them the impression that the ideas behind the speech represented some normatively good thing .This is ( more so than # 1 ) at its core a paternalistic notion .The students would foreclose on future speech out of some concern for the weak - minded nature of possible audiences for that speech .That particular line of logic has a long and storied history with tyrants .But I think that while these two lines of logic are statist ( were they beliefs held by the state ) , they are n't necessarily as toxic when held by those out of power .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.53902"}
