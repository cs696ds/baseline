[Jesus ] is saying , \" You are addicted to being who you are in the eyes of your adoring public , or your execrating public , it does n't matter which , since crowd love and crowd hate give identity in just the same dangerous way .So , go into a place where you are forcibly in detox from the regard of those who give you identity so that your Father , who alone is not part of that give and take , can have a chance to call your identity into being .\" The truth is that an authentic self can be called into being by relationships that mirror God 's unconditional love .But crowd love or hate can not call forth an authentic self !It will only shape a \" self \" in its image .As James explains , we too easily become a puppet of the crowd , forever doing its bidding in order to keep the feedback coming .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.38111"}

{"text": "This has got to be one of the most lonliest feelings in the world .That seems to me to be psychological and emotional torture to have to be married to someone who does n't love and really does n't want to be with you .If this is really the case , then why not just divorce the 1st wife totally and let her be and support her financially still ?This sounds like the most selfish thing that a man can do is not not love or care for his 1st wife , go out and get another , but then expect the first wife to still have sex with him .I sincerely hope this is not the case why muslim men try to practice polygamy because if so , you will never change the hearts and minds of the muslim woman .I have various issues with this article and mainly because of the misleading idea that a husband who marries again or who wants to marry again does n't love his wife or because their is n't an emotional attachment in their relationship .This argument not is it only insulting towards first wives in polygamous relationships , but it also feeds into the fear and misunderstanding some women have with regards to polygamy .Some men are very much in love with their wives , but they also have a desire to marry again because they feel as though they will be able to look after another equally .There are many cases in which a man loves his first wife more than is second .It is well known that the Prophet S.A.W loved Aisha the most out of all his wives yet he still married other women after her so therefore your argument really does n't work .In addition , the article reminded me of the arrogant view some women have when they are entering polygamous marriages as they think that they are some how better than the first wife and that the husband must somehow not love his other wife .However , these women are then given a rude awakening to reality then they realize that they are not that special nor better than the first wife in their husbands eyes .Furthermore , you seem to blame wives on the reason as to why their husbands wants to marry again creating the impression that their must be something wrong with them or their relationship .This article pretty much inflames a woman 's insecurity and makes sisters misunderstand polygamy even more because that is far from reality .Just because a woman 's husband wants to marry again is not a reflection on her as a person or her relationship with her husband nor should a woman in that situation feel threatened that her husband would no longer care about her or lover her .Although a man can not love all his wives equally , men however are well capable of loving all their wives , but just one more than the other whether it be the first wife or the second .If a man was not able to have an emotional attachment to all of his wives then Polygamy would not have been ordained .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.67059"}

'The Qur'an has clearly stated that a man can keep four wives simultaneously .Allah has given him the permission .So how can a woman say no to that ... are you saying no to Allah taala ? ?Ok and about she being ' free to walk out ' but that would be demanding something that Allah intensely dislikes , divorce , for something that Allah has given permission for .And what about the children , how is she going to raise them and help them to grow ?Is she going to deprive them of a father and a normal family life at the hands of her obstinacy , jealousy and stubbornness ? 'In my opinion , this lady made a lot of practical sense .I also got this heated tart response : . 'I refuse to agree with you .Maintaining equality between wives might be his problem , but in what context is it not our problem ?If a 2nd marriage situation arises in my case I really do n't know what I will do but one thing I definitely wo n't be doing is singing and dancing at his wedding .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.04412"}

{"text": "It makes me sad that you think relationships in which you have been hit were not abusive !And just because Waterman 's victim - blaming is quite ' classic ' does not mean it is less open to criticism .Similarly , social context or not , punching someone you say you love is always wrong .Whether it 's legal or illegal , whether it was the 70s or the 50s or the 20s .You 're right that we all have to take responsibility for our own actions .From the Mirror reports , Waterman is still not doing this , despite declarations of being ashamed , as he stated several times , in several ways , that it was Lenska 's fault .Sometimes domestic violence is not a man hitting a woman because she 's a woman , it 's someone with massive issues lashing out because they ca n't control themselves .Well yes , of course .It 's not an exception or an excuse .This argument suggests that \" sometimes in a relationship an unstable person who happens to be a man hits a person who happens to be a woman \" .True , but people who \" just lose it \" like this rarely hit - for example - their supervisor at work .Instead , they allow themselves to act it out on people who do n't have adequate means to defend themselves .I 've seen thrice divorced Waterman interviewed on the subject of his \" womanising \" & he takes a similarly blase approach to infidelity .He admits to behaving in a way that causes others harm whilst stating that it was n't his intent to cause harm , as if his actions and their consequences were not related .I do n't see Piers Morgan 's tv show as being an appropriate platform for a sober discussion re domestic abuse , nor do I think that isolating the past indiscretions of a celeb & using them as an opportunity to highlight this issue is helpful .Phillipa , even with that definition of abuse ( which is a good one ) , I can see that the relationships were n't abusive , because they did n't lead to either party living in fear .Times I 've hit , and been hit , have ( almost ) all been followed by the person doing the hitting collapsing in tears and being consumed by self - recrimination - which is probably a fairly appropriate reaction .As a corollary to that , I think it 's important to consider that abuse depends very little on the intent of the person hitting ( or otherwise abusing ) the other , and largely on the impression of the person abused .I 'm certain it 's possible to be abusive without ever landing a blow , or even physically threatening , and certainly it 's possible to be abusive without meaning to .In a healthy relationship , when things happen that could lead to someone feeling abused , people should feel able to talk about it and resolve it - that 's harder when someone 's been violent , but not impossible ( again speaking from experience ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.94444"}

{"text": "Overall , I find this to be very poorly thought - out piece and quite frankly embarrassing .Islam limited the practice of polygyny , which was otherwise endemic to pre - Islamic Arabia and not necessarily \" promoted \" it in the casual manner in which the author speaks .Furthermore , the author pays lip service to the explicit Quranic injunction stating its warning against polygyny without equity , but then goes on to try to justify a wife acquiescing to a husband 's demand on the basis that he no longer loves her .How can there be any kind of equity in marriage if there is not equal love ?Again , I could go on and I do n't wish to be malicious , but this piece is just prattle .Anaeem , I whole heartedly agree with you and could n't put my response any better .The key word in the Kuran is \" Justice \" .The author almost talks about practising polygamy like as if it were eating a bar of chocolate and not sharing it with your wife .I 'm sorry , but this is a responsibilty of great magnitude that must be carried out very carefully because it involves more than one women and most importantly your children .Saying that , I do n't understand why any women would remain in a loveless marriage or why you would encourage them to live as though they were simply a vegetable .Like men , women have their needs and desires and should be able to fulfil them if men can .Justice as referred to in the Quran refers to material justice .It is impossible to feel an equal amount of love for all wives , and even the Prophet ( sallallahu alaihi wa sallam ) was not immune to this .The point is that justice dictates that despite one 's love being greater for one than the other , this should not lead to favouritism .This is similar to a father 's love for his children ; Ya'qub ( as ) loved Yusuf and his brother more than the other brothers , simply because they were more righteous .But the brothers could find no other complaint against their father other than love , and this is why the mufassirin say that Ya'qub was not to be blamed at all , since he never treated his children differently .If he loved some more than others , this was evident by the character of the other brothers .Anyway , this is an emotive topic but we should be careful when we state halal and haram .I absolutely agree with Aneem .Equality is everything , in finances and love .I am currently courting a sister to potentially be my second wife .My wife is fully aware .Yet there is no lack of love for her .We are regularly intimate with each other and there is no other person who shares my confidences .The key is the ability to be equal .You can not have fallen out of love with the first , otherwise the equality stipulation in Quran is already breached .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.83608"}

'Mike Sando of ESPN.com has his wrap - up from Sunday 's game , \" What it means : The Rams showed they wo n't be an easy out for NFC West opponents , particularly in the Edward Jones Dome .They showed that coach Jeff Fisher and staff can give the team an edge .They also moved into a tie with Seattle at 2 - 2 in the NFC West .This game showed the Seahawks ' vulnerability pending improvement in the passing game .They 're a defensive team and a rushing team , but not much of a threat in the passing game .Wilson 's three interceptions speak more to an opportunistic Rams defense than anything else ( only one can be blamed on Wilson alone ) , but he struggles to complete drives .We also saw this Monday night against the Green Bay Packers .Wilson can move - and he was involved in more play - action passes against St. Louis - but he 's not finding his passing lanes over the middle .Seattle 's simplified offense has led to Wilson 's decent completion percentage , but where are the points ?Pete Carroll said this week he 's \" holding the lid \" on the passing game , but that 's a challenging concept for fans to cling to with Matt Flynn on the bench .As we head into the final week of Jazz Appreciation Month , culminating next Tuesday in International Jazz Day , there 's a fine selection of jazz and creative music performances taking place over the next few days in St. Louis , with several touring headliners on local stages .Let 's go to the highlights ... .Tonight , organist Dr. Lonnie Smith ( pictured ) and saxophonist James Carter join forces for the first of four nights at Jazz at the Bistro .Although the two men do n't normally work together , Carter performs frequently with his own organ trio , and certainly can go deeply into the kind of funk and soul grooves that are Smith 's stock in trade .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.03563"}

{"text": "As was common in Arab ( and , indeed , Semitic ) practice , the men were massacred ; the women and children were spared but enslaved .However , it is important to note that the motivation for such actions was political rather than racial or theological .Although the Banu Qurayza had remained neutral , they had also negotiated with the Quraysh .Moreover , the exiled Jewish clans had actively supported the Meccans .Muhammad moved decisively to crush the Jews who remained in Medina , viewing them as a continued political threat to the consolidation of Muslim dominance and rule in Arabia .One final point should be made .Muhammad 's use of warfare in general was alien neither to Arab custom nor to that of the Hebrew prophets .Both believed that God had sanctioned battle with the enemies of the Lord .Similarly , in speaking of the Israelite conquests , Moses recalls : \" And I commanded you at that time , saying , ' The Lord your God has given you this land to possess . . . .You shall not fear them ; for it is the Lord your God who fights for you \" ( Deuteronomy 3:18 - 22 ) .Muhammad 's marriages have long provided another source of Western criticism of the moral character of the Prophet .A noted British author has observed : .No great religious leader has been so maligned as Muhammad .Attacked in the past as a heretic , an imposter , or a sensualist , it is still possible to find him referred to as \" the false prophet .\" A modern German writer accuses Muhammad of sensuality , surrounding himself with young women .This man was not married until he was twenty - five years of age , then he and his wife lived in happiness and fidelity for twenty - four years , until her death when he was forty - nine .Only between the age of fifty and his death at sixty - two did Muhammad take other wives , only one of whom was a virgin , and most of them were taken for dynastic and political reasons .Certainly the Prophet 's record was better than that head of the Church of England , Henry VIII .In addressing the issue of Muhammad 's polygynous marriages , it is important to remember several points .First , Semitic culture in general and Arab practice in particular permitted polygyny .It was common practice in Arabian society , especially among nobles and leaders .Though less common , polygyny was also permitted in biblical and even in post biblical Judaism .From Abraham , David , and Solomon down to the reformation period , polygyny was practiced by some Jews .While Jewish law changed after the Middle Ages due to the influence of Christian rule , for Jews under Islamic rule , polygyny remained licit , though it was not extensively practiced .Second , during the prime of his life , Muhammad remained married to one woman , Khadija .Third , it was only after her death that he took a number of wives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.33899"}
