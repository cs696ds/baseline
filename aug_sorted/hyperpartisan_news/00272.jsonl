Kennedy : What standards should be met to demonstrate a link to terrorism before the NSA should be able to initiate domestic surveillance ?Response : I do not know the full extent of NSA surveillance .That means FISA warrants might not be available for some surveillance operations that the NSA is undertaking - e.g. , monitoring the communications of al - Qaeda \" contacts \" who do not rise to the level of \" agent . \" Useful intelligence might therefore be lost even if the administration were forced to seek FISA warrants , which are not presently available unless the target is an agent .Conceivably , FISA could be amended so that warrants could issue merely upon showing that an individual has had contact with al - Qaeda .That is a policy question , not a legal question , on which I claim no special insight .Question from Sen. Kennedy : Would Congress be remiss if it failed to fully understand the details of the program before acting on any legislation ?What would a complete investigation entail ?Response : At a minimum , before enacting legislation , Congress should determine answers to the following questions : ( 1 ) What is the scope of the NSA program ?Are only al - Qaeda agents targeted , or mere contacts as well ?( 2 ) How often has the NSA monitored the communications of U.S. persons in the United States ?Over what period ?( 3 ) What are the technological advances that may have rendered FISA obsolete ?( 4 ) To what extent is data - mining part of the program ?( 5 )Is the physical intelligence collection done domestically or overseas ?( 6 ) What evidence suggests that the program has been effective ?How many false positives and false negatives have there been ?( 7 ) What minimization procedures are in place to ensure that intelligence is not retained longer , or distributed more widely , than is absolutely necessary ?Finally , the legislation should be sunsetted - perhaps after four years , to coincide with the expiration of selected provisions of the reauthorized PATRIOT Act .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.765465"}

{"text": "The final argument is that Article II of the Constitution gives the President inherent authority to conduct such monitoring .The Administration introduced this theory in a supplemental brief filed in the FISA Court of Review : .The President Has Inherent Authoritv to Conduct Warrantless Electronic Surveillance to Protect National Security from Foreign Threats .In considering the constitutionality of the amended FISA , it is important to understand that FISA is not required by the Constitution .Rather , the Constitution vests in the President inherent authority to conduct warrantless intelligence surveillance ( electronic or otherwise ) of foreign powers or their agents , and Congress can not by statute extinguish that constitutional authority .Both before and after the enactment of FISA , courts have recognized the President 's inherent authority to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance .So the argument , as I understand it , is that Congress has no power to legislate in a way that inteferes with the President 's Commander - in - Chief power , a judgment made , I suppose , by the President himself .I have been unable to find any caselaw in support of this argument .Further , the argument has no support from the cases cited in the government 's brief .In all three of those cases - Butenko , Truong , and Keith - the Courts were talking about whether the President 's interest in conducting foreign intelligence monitoring creates an exception to the Warrant Requirement of the Fourth Amendment .In other words , the issue in those case was whether the Constitution bars warrantless surveillance absent Congressional action , not whether Congressional prohibitons in this area can not bind the Executive branch .Consider the citation to the Butenko case .Here is the relevant section , from 494 F.2d at 608 : .Both executive authority in the foreign affairs area and society 's interest in privacy are of significance , and are equally worthy of judicial concern . . . .The importance of the President 's responsibilities in the foreign affairs field requires the judicial branch to act with the utmost care when asked to place limitations on the President 's powers in that area .As Commander - in - Chief , the President must guard the country from foreign aggression , sabotage , and espionage .To be sure , in the course of such wiretapping conversations of alien officials and agents , and perhaps of American citizens , will be overheard and to that extent , their privacy infringed .But the Fourth Amendment proscribes only ' unreasonable ' searches and seizures .And balanced against this country 's self - defense needs , we can not say that the district court erred in concluding that the electronic surveillance here did not trench upon Ivanov 's Fourth Amendment rights .As I read this analysis , it is entirely focused on the Fourth Amendment , and specifically whether the President 's Commander in Chief power should trigger a relaxed Fourth Amendment standard .That seems quite different from a claim that Article II makes Congressional regulation inoperative .The same goes for the citation to Truong , 629 F.2d at 914 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.382454"}

Edgar Hoover against suspected communists , Black Panthers , civil rights leaders and others .That 's why FISA was enacted in 1978 .It had a dual purpose : to curb abuses while facilitating domestic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes .To be sure , the FISA statute was drafted to deal with peacetime intelligence .But that does not mean the statute can be ignored when applied to the post-9/11 war on terror .First , the FISA text makes no distinction between wartime and peacetime .To conduct surveillance without statutory authorization , in wartime or peacetime , is a crime , punishable by up to five years in prison .22 Second , in passing FISA , Congress expressly contemplated warrantless surveillance during wartime , but limited it to the first 15 days after war is declared .23 Third , FISA warrant requirements and electronic surveillance provisions were amended by the USA PATRIOT Act , 24 which was passed in response to 9/11 and signed by President Bush .If 9/11 triggered \" wartime , \" as the administration has repeatedly and convincingly argued , then the amended FISA is clearly a wartime statute .Some administration supporters have argued that FISA and the PATRIOT Act provide tools that the president had anyway , except he could not use the acquired evidence in a criminal prosecution .25 Yet there is no support for the notion that members of Congress , in passing the two statutes , thought they were simply debating the rules of evidence .Moreover , warrant requirements are triggered even if the government declines to prosecute .Imagine police secretly entering a private home without a warrant , installing bugs on phones and tracer software on computers , searching every room and closet , then leaving , never to be heard from again - no arrest , no indictment , no notice to the target .Clearly , the Fourth Amendment 's warrant provisions have been violated , even if the target is unaware and no fruits of the search are used as evidence in a criminal prosecution .A key purpose of the Amendment is to ensure privacy in those situations in which an expectation of privacy is reasonable .That said , there may be some international satellite or radio communications that do not come under FISA 's prohibition because the communicating parties could not reasonably expect privacy .But I know of no court case that has denied there is a reasonable expectation of privacy by U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens in their phone calls and emails .Moreover , the Justice Department , in a December 2005 letter to Congress , acknowledged that the president 's October 2001 NSA eavesdropping order did not comply with the \" procedures \" of the FISA statute .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.69893"}

{"text": "14 As for a national security exception for foreign intelligence surveillance , that remains an open issue .The so - called Keith case in 1972 said there would be no exception if a domestic organization were involved ; but there might be an exception if a foreign power were involved .Thus , the administration can credibly argue that it may conduct some types of warrantless surveillance without violating the Fourth Amendment .But the Congress did expressly disapprove , in the FISA statute .Therefore , the president 's assertion of a national security exception that encompasses the NSA program misses the point .The proper question is not whether the president has inherent authority to relax the \" reasonableness \" standard of the Fourth Amendment in order to direct warrantless surveillance , even if not approved by Congress .The answer to that question is \" yes , in some cases .\" But the narrower issue in the NSA case is whether the president , in the face of an express statutory prohibition , can direct that same surveillance .The answer is \" no , \" and I am not aware of any case law to support an argument to the contrary .Put somewhat differently , Article II establishes that the president has inherent powers , especially during wartime .And those powers might be sufficient to support his authorization of warrantless surveillance , notwithstanding the warrant provisions of the Fourth Amendment .But Article II does not delineate the scope of the president 's wartime powers .And because Congress has concurrent authority in this area , 16 an express prohibition by Congress is persuasive when deciding whether the president has overreached .The distinction between concurrent and exclusive powers is important .For example , the president 's \" Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons \" 17 is exclusive ; there is no stated power for Congress to modify it by legislation - e.g. , by declaring certain offenses unpardonable .By contrast , the president 's wartime powers are shared with Congress ( see note 16 ) .That suggests the president must comply with duly enacted statutes unless he can show that Congress has exceeded its authority .In this instance , President Bush has made no such showing .III .Does NSA Warrantless Surveillance Comply with FISA ?Accordingly , even if the administration establishes that NSA warrantless surveillance during wartime is reasonable in the context of the Fourth Amendment , the question remains whether the NSA program violates the express terms of FISA .It does .The text of FISA is unambiguous : \" A person is guilty of an offense if he intentionally engages in electronic surveillance ... except as authorized by statute . \" 18 That provision covers communications from or to U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens in the United States .Moreover , the Wiretap Act provides that its procedures and FISA \" shall be the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance ... may be conducted .\" From the early 1960s until 1973 , the NSA , without approval of Congress , used a \" watch list \" of U.S. citizens and organizations in sorting through intercepted foreign communications .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.52278"}

Sawyer 45 - the 1952 case denying President Truman 's authority to seize the steel mills .Truman had argued that a labor strike would irreparably damage national security because steel production was essential to the production of war munitions .But during the debate over the 1947 Taft - Hartley Act , 46 Congress had expressly rejected seizure .48 Second , when the president acts in the absence of either a congressional grant or denial of authority , \" there is a zone of twilight in which he and Congress may have concurrent authority , or in which its distribution is uncertain . \"49 But third , where the president takes measures incompatible with the express or implied will of Congress - such as the NSA program , which violates an express provision of the FISA statute - \" his power is at its lowest .\" Even under Youngstown 's second category ( congressional silence ) , the president might have inherent wartime authority to interpret the \" reasonableness \" standard of the Fourth Amendment in a manner that would sanction certain warrantless surveillance .But the NSA program does not fit in Youngstown 's second category .It belongs in the third category , in which the president has acted in the face of an express statutory prohibition .Naturally , if the statutory prohibition is itself unconstitutional , the administration is not only permitted but obligated to ignore it .That 's the argument administration supporters have proffered to excuse the NSA 's defiance of FISA .51 To bolster their case , they cite the only opinion that the FISA Court of Review has ever issued , In re : Sealed Case .52 There , the appellate panel mentioned several earlier cases 53 that concluded the president has \" inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information . \"54 The Court of Review then added : \" We take for granted that the President does have that authority and , assuming that is so , FISA could not encroach on the President 's constitutional power .\" Three responses : First , I do not contend that the president lacks \" inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches to obtain foreign intelligence information . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.539986"}

{"text": "The administration presumably takes the position that the President does have such power in cases involving foreign evidence collection , and that the NSA surveillance is such a case .The Supreme Court has never resolved the question , so it 's an open constitutional issue .Nonetheless , between the border search exception and the open possibility of a national security exception , there are pretty decent arguments that the monitoring did not violate the Fourth Amendment .Maybe persuasive , maybe not , but certainly open and fair arguments under the case law .Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .Now let 's turn to FISA , a 1978 law that Congress enacted in response to the Keith case .FISA goes beyond the Keith case , including foreign intelligence surveillance in its scope even though it was left open as a constututional question .Specifically , 50 U.S.C. 1809 prohibits \" electronic surveillance \" except as authorized by statutory law : \" A person is guilty of an offense if he intentionally . . .engages in electronic surveillance under color of law except as authorized by statute . \" \" Electronic surveillance \" is defined in 50 U.S.C. 1801(f ) to mean , in relevant part : .A \" United States person \" is defined in 50 U.S.C. 1801(i ) as \" a citizen of the United States [ or ] an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence . \"A \" wire communication \" is defined as a communication that is traveling by a wire ; I do n't know if \" radio communication \" is a defined term , but I assume it refers primary to satellite communications .Putting aside the AUMF and statutory exceptions for now , let 's consider whether the NSA surveillance program violates the basic prohibition of 50 U.S.C. 1809 - intentionally conducting electronic surveillance .I think the answer is probably yes .If the surveillance tapped wire communications under 1801(f)(2 ) , the case is pretty clear : the surveillance involved people in the U.S. and survillance in the U.S. , and that 's all that is required .If the surveillance involved radio communications ( satellite communications , I 'm guessing ) , that 's a bit trickier .There is at least a little wiggle room in Section 1801(f)(1 ) .For example , you could say that the border search exception eliminates Fourth Amendment protection , such that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy and therefore there would be no warrant required in an analogous criminal case .In that case , the tapping of the radio communication would n't count as \" electronic surveillance .\" I do n't think we know the details of how the communucations were obtained , so I think it 's fair to say that the surveillance probably violated the basic proibition but it at least arguably depends on some of the technical details we do n't know .Now , on to the exceptions .50 U.S.C. 1802(a)(1 ) provides in relevant part : .Notwithstanding any other law , the President , through the Attorney General , may authorize electronic surveillance without a court order under this subchapter to acquire foreign intelligence information for periods of up to one year if the Attorney General certifies in writing under oath that-- .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.682724"}

{"text": "The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution is the part of the Bill of Rights which guards against \" unreasonable \" searches and seizures , and for many such searches or seizures , requires an order from a court known as a warrant .It is a right of the individual that neither the Executive nor Legislative branch can lawfully abrogate , not even if acting in concert .It is conceived that a judge will be sufficiently distanced from the authorities seeking a warrant that he can render an impartial decision unaffected by any prejudices or improper motivations they may harbor .An individual who believes that his Fourth Amendment rights have been violated by an unreasonable search or seizure may file a civil suit for monetary compensation and to seek a court - ordered end to a pattern or practice of such unlawful activities by government authorities .Such civil rights violations are sometimes punishable by state or federal law .Evidence obtained in an unlawful search or seizure is generally inadmissible in a criminal trial .Although these are undertaken as a result of statute or Executive order , they should not be seen as deriving their legitimacy from these , rather , the Fourth Amendment explicitly allows reasonable searches , and the government has instituted some of these as public policy .The Supreme Court held in Katz v. United States ( 1967 ) , that the monitoring and recording of private conversations within the United States constitutes a \" search \" for Fourth Amendment purposes , and therefore the government must generally obtain a warrant before undertaking such domestic wiretapping .The protection of \" private conversations \" has been held to apply only to conversations where the participants have not merely a desire but a reasonable expectation that the conversation is indeed private to themselves and that no party whatsoever is listening in .In the absence of such a reasonable expectation , the Fourth Amendment does not apply , and surveillance without warrant does not violate it .Privacy is clearly not a reasonable expectation in communications to persons in the many countries whose governments openly intercept electronic communications , and is of dubious reasonability in countries against which the United States is waging war .The law also recognizes a distinction between domestic surveillance taking place within U.S. borders and foreign surveillance of non - U.S. persons either in the U.S. or abroad .In United States v. Verdugo - Urquidez , the Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle that the Constitution does not extend protection to non - U.S. persons located outside of the United States , so no warrant would be required to engage in even physical searches of non - U.S. citizens abroad .The U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled on the constitutionality of warrantless searches targeting foreign powers or their agents within the US .There have been , however , a number of Circuit Court rulings upholding the constitutionality of such warrantless searches .In USA v.
