Roosevelt set the standard with the most active First Hundred Days ever accomplished , every President , and in fact every Governor and Mayor , has been put under judgment after 100 Days .No one has ever matched FDR for activism in the First Hundred Days , and one can not claim that Obama has surpassed Roosevelt .However , I believe that his performance will stand in history as the SECOND most active First Hundred Days in American History .Sometimes , one can wonder whether the President ever sleeps .He and his wife have been a whirlwind of activity since January 20 , and they have both certainly succeeded in raising the spirits of the nation .Both of them are very popular , and interest in the Obama children and even their dog is very high .It is obvious the American people , in any poll , want their President to succeed and wish him well , with only talk show hosts on radio and Fox News Channel wishing him ill .The country has been very impressed with Obama in every way , including his press conferences , speeches , travels overseas , and promotion of his economic program on Capitol Hill .The Democrats have been very unified , and it is a shame that only three GOP senators ( now two , with the switch of Arlen Specter ) have the willingness to promote bipartisanship in a difficult economic time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.07858"}

Wade is under constant attack and the only thing MS Magazine is worried about is how feminists should teach sex education to boys in the home ?The real question is how long will the retreat continue ?They are within striking distance of getting Roe now and birth control methods are next .Forgive me for disagreeing with this love fest , but while this might seem counter intuitive \" How do I teach my son to resist the pervasive attitudes about rape and victim - blaming \" will only increase the number of rapes .The problem with this idea is that , while a mother sitting down with her son and having a frank talk about rape might work with a lot of young boys , it 's success depends on a lot of other factors .i.e. imagine a woman who is ashamed of her own sexuality ( very common ) talking to her son about sex ( which makes her feel dirty but excites her at the same time ) talking about rape to a son who is awakening sexually .All those subconscious cues in the mother / son dynamic building and building and suddenly you have a boy with a fetish for rape .The problem as I see it is n't necessarily the feminist perspective that men should stop raping .The problem is firstly of politics .Politics in this country is one of blame and disavowing personal responsibility .Republicans blame Democrats for their problems without asking themselves how they themselves were responsible , and missing their own cloak of victim - hood .Democrats blame Republicans for the same reasons and fail in exactly the same way .As do racists blaming minorities .As do Feminists , like the author of this article , putting the ultimate blame on men .I am not saying that men should n't rape .Or that Rape is not thoroughly evil .Or that the person who rapes is n't making a choice that is wholly their own responsibility .What I am saying is that women must begin to embrace their own sexuality rather than hide from it .Ten years ago BDSM culture was considered fringe , now 50 Shades is a bestseller .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.459335"}

{"text": "Such a generative article Stassa and a great discussion .I want to tell you about a humble but effective way to introduce little ones to the concepts of bodily integrity and consent , which my son and I discovered together when he was 2 ( he 's now 4 ) .He loves being tickled , but only to a point .I wanted to know when that point was reached .So we use the language of ' green light ' ( meaning Go - tickles ! ) , ' orange light ' ( slow down ! ) and ' red light ' ( enough already ! )I 've noticed that this has really bedded in for him the idea that you need to know ' if the light is green ' , and that it 's OK to say the light is red .He uses this language in play with his friends .Among them , hugs , games , etc happen depending on ' what colour the light is ' .I 've noticed that when one of them says their light is red it 's respected .The language helps ward off aggro .Might have road safety outcomes too .If you really want to make a difference , on an individual or national scale , you need to teach a child empathy .There are many empathy - based curricula for schoolchildren out there , but none of them are recognized on a state or national level as being important enough to offer everywhere .If a child can inherently see that someone is in trouble , to feel their feelings , then they wo n't need to worry about what specific words we must use to prevent one from raping , or bullying , or shooting , or any number of other things .It will be inherent in them .I 'm not saying the conversations should n't happen , I 'm saying you might be trying to build a house on sand if you were to use the perfect words to explain to those kids why what they were doing was wrong .Building a foundation to work off of is of paramount importance .I 'm raising my son right by instilling him with my Pagan values .Respect of the earth , all beings , and both the male and FEMALE gods / goddesses .Christianity has instilled a fear / hatred of women / earth / nature and the result is increasing misogyny and devaluation of all feminine aspects of life .very sad .Crime of any kind , across society is correlated with cruel upbringing , and lack of crime with kind upbringing , with touch and emotional kindness .There are no fuzzy moral lines in full expansive compassion .But , sadly , empathy is a quality more and more lacking from society , male or female .This is the real concern , in my view , a society that is constantly losing human connection .And its no surprise to see teenagers and the young showing the most obvious manifestations of that .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.74132"}

{"text": "Personally while every once in a while I meet a girl who makes the first move , most of the time I have to initiate .Where are the women with weird things like foot fetishes & food fetishes & fatty fettishes .And yes there are women who have rape fantasies and presumably who do want to be raped .There are women who keep entering abusive relationships because deep down they want to be abused .These women might seem weird to our middle class Euro - centric culture but that does n't mean that they do n't exist and that they do n't have a right to explore ( in a safe environment ) their deep inner psychoses .Long ago , men used to get really excited about legs and ankles .They did so because men hardly ever saw legs and ankles .Now we see these bodily parts every day , and honestly ... who cares .The same thing goes with rape .The more common & everyday something is , the less we yearn for it .Make sex as banal as shaking hands .Make it is utterly pointless for men to objectify women , by making it so that women have no need make themselves objects , and rape will disappear .Tell men not to rape .That sex is dirty .That women need to choose the right time and the right person , thus making a commodity of themselves .That women snarking / shaming women who make different lifestyle choices from their own .And yes men shaming women who are sexually adventurous .This is a recipe for rape .A lesson about standing up and being a hero is a good thing .We have become TOO equal in our treatment of each other .All of my sons rush to open and hold the door for women and men , handicapped and able bodied alike .Our lessons to our children about being good people should n't be separated into categories .I hit the submit button by accident .To continue , we need our sons to feel empowered to stand up always when there is an injustice , large and small .It should have been second nature to any young man present to stop what was happening , just because it was wrong .It does n't need to be an internal debate about how he would feel if it was his sister or mom .We do n't need that inner discussion about assault with a weapon or even animal abuse .We must keep the dialogue going about our responsibility as good humans so that , when a situation like this arises , it 's second nature to do the right thing and step in .It sounds like oversimplification , but encouraging your boys to cross a parking lot to help someone load groceries into their car gives them practice in real human interaction .Our sons are n't pre programmed to be rapist .Nor are they destined to be part of the blame pack .However , if we do n't actively work to give them the insight and experiences that come with being good men on a daily basis , it wo n't come to them under pressure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "120.661736"}
