King , a politician and planter from North Carolina who was a future Vice President of the United States .The name , meaning \" high seat \" or \" throne \" , came from the Ossianic poem The Songs of Selma .Selma became the seat of Dallas County in 1866 .Selma during the Civil War .Importance of Selma to the Confederacy .During the Civil War , Selma was one of the South 's main military manufacturing centers , producing tons of supplies and munitions , and turning out Confederate warships such as the ironclad Tennessee .The Selma iron works and foundry was considered the second most important source of weaponry for the South , after the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond , Virginia .This strategic concentration of manufacturing capabilities eventually made Selma a target of Union raids into Alabama late in the Civil War .[ 1 ] .The capacities and importance of Selma to the Confederate movement were noted in the North , and were too great to be overlooked by Federal authorities .As the town grew in importance , the Union decided to try to take it .Battle of Selma .On March 30 , 1865 , General James H.

Austin .[ 4 ] Mirabeau B. Lamar , second president of the newly formed Republic of Texas , advised the commissioners to investigate the area named Waterloo , noting the area 's hills , waterways , and pleasant surroundings .Waterloo was selected and the name Austin was chosen as the town 's new name .The location was seen as a convenient crossroads for trade routes between Santa Fe and Galveston Bay , as well as routes between northern Mexico and the Red River .[5 ] Austin is also the site where the southern leg of the Chisholm Trail leads to the Colorado River .Edwin Waller was picked by Lamar to survey the village and draft a plan laying out the new capital .[ 4 ] The original site was narrowed to that fronted the Colorado River between two creeks , Shoal Creek and Waller Creek , which was later named in his honor .The 14-block grid plan was bisected by a broad north - south thoroughfare , Congress Avenue , running up from the river to Capital Square , where the new Texas State Capitol was to be constructed .A temporary one - story capitol was erected on the corner of Colorado and 8th Streets .On August 1 , 1839 , the first auction of 217 out of 306 lots total was held .[ 4 ] The grid plan Waller designed and surveyed now forms the basis of downtown Austin .In 1840 , a series of conflicts between the Texas Rangers and the Comanches , known as the Council House Fight and the Battle of Plum Creek , finally pushed the Comanches westward , mostly ending conflicts in Central Texas .Settlement in the area began to expand quickly .Travis County was established in 1840 , and the surrounding counties were mostly established within the next two decades .[ 6 ] .Initially , the new capital thrived .But Lamar 's political enemy , Sam Houston , used two Mexican army incursions to San Antonio as an excuse to move the government .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.63932"}

{"text": "It became clear later that the whites - some formally deputized , many not - took the opportunity to ride down and kill African Americans generally .While Captain Randlett was only able to confirm the deaths of five African Americans , the actual death toll was probably much higher , estimated by Republican newspapers at fifty or sixty , scattered across the countryside .Rev. Brooks ' corpse was found on July 18 ; he had been lynched .The wave of racial violence that had been building up for weeks had finally broken ; as one historian put it , \" the much - feared confrontation between the races had taken place , with whites protected by the United States Army and blacks massacred .\" [ 19 ] .It 's impossible to say what role Lawrence Daffan might have played in any of these events , or whether his membership in the Klan pre- or post - dated them .While Daffan 's personal involvement in these activities in unknown , we certainly know the immediate , local context of the Klan and related groups in the Brazos Valley in the summer of 1868 .I 've been critical in the past of lionizing old klansmen like William Stewart Simkins ( right ) , who went on to a prominent career as a law professor at the University of Texas .I applauded when his name was removed from a dorm on the Austin campus .The naming of Simkins Hall was very much a case of the UT Board of Regents of the 1950s saying \" fnck - you \" to those fighting for integration of public higher education in the South .But without knowing more about Daffan 's own involvement , it 's hard to make the case that he was fundamentally different than Simkins .While Lawrence Daffan was n't the rancid old braggart that Simkins was , he admitted his membership in the Klan and , apparently , viewed his involvement with it as both a necessity and perhaps with some pride .So who else in my family knew about Daffan 's involvement with the Klan ?I do n't think my mother did , but it 's probable that her mother did .My grandmother , the daughter of Lawrence 's younger sister , was fifteen when her uncle died in 1907 .She would have attended the funeral - they only lived forty miles away , in Mansfield - and seen some of the memorial proclamations , at least one of which specifically mentioned Daffan 's involvement .She also knew Lawrence 's daughter Katie ( left , c. 1904 ) , her first cousin , very well , and Katie was n't bashful about her father 's involvement in the Klan in the least .This is all deeply troublesome , and I 'm still thinking through it .It 's hard to reconcile Daffan 's honored reputation within the family and in his community - his grave carries the inscription \" faithful to every trust \" - with something as odious as the Ku Klux Klan .But I suspect there are a great many Southerners , and descendants of Confederate veterans , in exactly the same spot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.33809"}

Fremont and David Hunter who issued general emancipation proclamations in their respective Departments .Lincoln disavowed their actions and even fired former Presidential candidate Fremont , dismaying the Radical Republicans and European nations .On July 22 , 1861 , the Johnson - Crittenden Joint Resolution was overwhelmingly passed in both the Senate and House giving a sense of the Congress .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.90892"}

{"text": "The author 's inevitable plea \" that it is time we put it away \" leaves the reader with the impression that an inordinate number of white southerners remain preoccupied with the flag .This overly simplistic narrative masks a more complex history , as well as evidence suggesting that attitudes about the Confederate flag are , in fact , continually evolving in the South .Not all Confederate soldiers fought under the blue St. Andrew 's cross ( more accurately , the saltire ) .And apart from its use during veterans events , the flag 's visibility was minimal during the decades following the war .At the beginning of the 20th century , the United Daughters of the Confederacy sought to protect the flag 's connection to the men in the ranks by maintaining a strict code governing its usage in public .Misuse and alignment with questionable causes , they believed , would not only soil the meaning of the flag , but the memory of the Confederacy and the righteousness of its cause as well .By the 1940s , however , the flag could be seen at University of Mississippi football games and other popular events , ushering in what historian John Coski has called a \" flag fad .\" That fad eventually extended to the far reaches of the nation , and the flag can now be seen on every kind of trinket and tchotchke imaginable .During that period , the flag became the standard for those committed to defending classrooms , bus depots , and other public spaces ( now battlefields themselves ) from black encroachment .In fact , the flag 's use throughout the 20th century covered a time span significantly longer than its presence on Civil War battlefields .Its placement atop southern statehouses like South Carolina ultimately reinforced the flag 's connection to segregation and racism .Confederate flags no longer enjoy those privileged perches .In fact , over the past few years , white and black southerners have become less tolerant of the public display of the flag , which has relegated its supporters to the sidelines and a much more defensive posture .Last year , the city of Lexington , Virginia , banned the flying of the flag from public fixtures .This past spring , the Museum of the Confederacy opened a new branch at Appomattox that did not include the display of the flag outside its doors .Finally , late last year , the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond removed Confederate flags flying on the grounds of the Confederate Memorial Chapel , which the museum oversees .The museum 's decision led to the creation of a grassroots group called the Virginia Flaggers , but despite daily protests in front of the museum and a social media presence , its efforts have met with no success .The Sons of Confederate Veterans utilized their mailing lists and other resources in response to all three events , but they also have little to show for their efforts .These shifting fault lines suggest that while white and black southerners may tolerate the right of the individual to display the flag on private property , its display on public grounds and at other institutions will be met with suspicion and openly challenged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.25336"}

{"text": "A free public education for all was a great example of America 's commitment to a society where everyone has an opportunity to succeed .We all paid our share for public schools , even those who sent their kids to private school or whose kids had finished school or who never had any kids at all , because it meant a better - educated society and that was a benefit for all of us .But more and more , people became unhappy with their public school systems .When the quality of the education declined people got upset that their kids were being cheated out of their futures ; in some cases it was court - ordered desegregation that made people unhappy with their public schools .Many of those who could afford to moved to suburban school districts and took their tax money with them , leaving the city schools with less and less money to spend on teachers and books and buildings .Which meant even poorer quality education , which prompted more parents to flee , and the cycle continued .I understand that parents want the best for their children ; I get it that despite recent improvements our economy is n't as strong as it once was and a lot of people do n't have the jobs and income they want and deserve .Still , I 'm saddened at how many people seem to feel that abandoning the greater good for American society - the education of everyone else 's children - is the best way for them to take care of their own .But that 's what courts are for , to enforce law and equity in the face of majority ignorance .Why did the justices decide as they did ?I do n't know , and the justices are not compelled to explain .But it means that , for whatever reason or reasons , there were n't at least four justices who were willing to take one or more of these cases right now .I 've read some theories that the court decided not to hear any cases because there was no disagreement : all the pending court cases were in favor of allowing same - sex marriage , so they felt there was no conflict that required their special wisdom to resolve .This is not about what one religion or another teaches about homosexuality ; this is about how the civil law treats American citizens regardless of their religious belief , or their gender or their race or national origin .A religion is free to believe and teach what it wants about the morality of homosexual behavior or same - sex marriage , and its teachings and laws are important to the members in good standing of that particular faith .But those teachings are not binding on Americans who are not members of that denomination .The civil law , which orders how we all deal with one another in the secular society outside the confines of our many private clubs , is blind to such moral questions .States have the right to decide who can \" marry \" and who ca n't , and the federal government has to treat all \" married \" couples in the same way , regardless of the gender of the spouses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.78116"}
