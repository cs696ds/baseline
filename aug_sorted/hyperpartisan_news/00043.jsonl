Ron Paul of Texas , another 2008 presidential candidate , with five percent supporting Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota , who enjoys strong backing from many in the Tea Party movement .Everyone else registers in the low single digits .Trump jumped from 10 percent in a CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll conducted last month , with Romney dropping from 18 percent to 11 percent . \"Are Republicans switching from Romney to Trump ?Some are , but it 's a lot more complicated than that , as you would expect with 11 potential hats in the ring , \" adds Holland .\" Only one in five Trump supporters say that Romney would be their second choice .It looks like Trump pulls as much support from Gingrich and Palin as from Romney , and Romney 's support would go down even if Trump were not in the list of potential candidates .\" The poll was conducted in the two days before Romney 's Monday announcement that he was taking the first formal step towards another bid , by setting up a presidential exploratory committee .According to the survey , more than seven in ten Republicans say that regardless of whom they would support , they 'd like to see Huckabee run for the party 's presidential nomination , with two - thirds saying the same thing about Romney .But that figure drops to 56 percent for Trump , with 43 percent saying they do n't want to see him run .By a narrower 53 to 47 percent margin , they would like to see Palin make a bid for the White House , and by a 51 to 45 percent margin , they would like to see Gingrich run .So what could be behind Trump 's rise in the poll ?One contributing factor could be his numerous appearances in the national media .Trump 's questioning of whether President Barack Obama was born in the U.S. has put Trump smack in the media spotlight the past two months .\" If Trump is rising in the polls because of the amount of air time he has gotten , it would be difficult to tell whether his gains are due to what he is saying or simply due to his increased visibility .In a field of more than a dozen potential candidates , all air time is good air time , \" says Holland .\" Most presidential seasons get to a point when the voters are looking for a fresh face .That 's what gave us Fred Thompson in 2008 and Wesley Clark in 2004 , to name just two examples .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.40454"}

' ...\" It 's time to get some justices that will stop being politicians , stop obeying the public opinion polls , and actually read and obey the Constitution .Mike Huckabee , who has made an attack on \" judicial supremacy \" the centerpiece of his presidential campaign , said .\" I guarantee you in a Huckabee administration there will be very different kind of people appointed to the court .Candidates are responding to the demands of right - wing leaders and organizations , who see the 2016 election as a chance to cement right - wing control of the Supreme Court for a generation .She also looked ahead to the elections and the \" generational impact \" of future Supreme Court justices : .\" I think it 's important to have judges on the court that are going to be faithfully interpreting the Constitution , and therefore to make sure that there 's a president in place , and senators in place , who recognize the overarching importance of this issue .... .Ryan Anderson of the Heritage Foundation said that Justice Kennedy 's majority opinion in Obergefell cited \" new insights \" into marriage and that a Court with more right - wing justices could use their own \" new insights \" to overturn the marriage equality decision .He urged the anti - marriage - equality movement to conduct new research into gay parenting ( citing the widely discredited Mark Regnerus study on \" family structures ) to give future right - wing justices some justification for overturning the recent ruling .\" I could see a situation in which the Court has a different composition , as Carrie mentioned , chances are the next president will have up to four seats to fill .At Inauguration Day three of the justices will be in their 80s and one of them will be 78 .So there 's a chance that there will be a different composition of the Court .And if there are new insights into marriage , and new insights into the rights of children , that could be a possibility for the Court to reconsider .The court 's decision will also powerfully inject marriage into the 2016 presidential contest .The most direct course to reverse this ruling lies in the next president appointing new justices to the Supreme Court .Social conservatives will do everything possible to ensure that the Republican nominee is a strong pro - marriage champion , making this a litmus test throughout the GOP primaries and caucuses .Paul Waldman says that , believe it or not , John F. Kennedy was the last Democratic president who had the chance to nominate a replacement for a conservative Supreme Court justice .Given the age of the justices , he says , \" it would be strange if at least one or two did n't retire in the next president 's term ( the last three presidents each appointed two justices ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.03946"}
