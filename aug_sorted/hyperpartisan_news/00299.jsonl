{"text": "20 ] However , the full develop\u00adment of an independent European Security and Defense Policy ( ESDP ) is a long - term French foreign policy goal , and negotiations are advancing to con\u00adclude the deal in time to announce it in Strasbourg in April 2009 .Within NATO , France has repeatedly engaged in deliberately obstructionist behavior , and until NATO can be sure that it will not do so in the future , NATO should not be afraid to frustrate Paris 's demands .In 2003 , France led Germany and Bel\u00adgium in a coalition to deny America 's request to pro\u00advide NATO defensive systems to Turkey in the event of an attack during the liberation of Iraq , as allowed for under Article IV of the North Atlantic Treaty .The United States managed to sideline France by taking the decision to the Defense Planning Committee where France does not have a vote .The German-Belgian coalition collapsed , and Article IV was ulti\u00admately honored .Under plans to reintegrate France into the full military command , the United States would no longer have this option .Equally , France 's exclusion from NATO 's inte\u00adgrated military command structures does not pre\u00advent it from being a full and active member of the alliance .France is a key NATO member .Approxi\u00admately one - third of its 10,000 forward - deployed troops are under NATO command , [ 21 ] and more than 2,600 French troops are participating in NATO 's mission in Afghanistan , [ 22 ] including an additional 700 troops sent to eastern Afghanistan earlier this year .[ 23 ] Detachment from NATO 's mili\u00adtary command structures , following President Charles de Gaulle 's withdrawal in 1966 , merely excludes Paris from NATO 's overall defense plan\u00adning .It is a full member of all key decision - making bodies and transformation initiatives , including the Military Committee , Allied Command Transforma\u00adtions , and the NATO Response Force .Although Washington is keen to cement the recent d\u00e9tente with Paris , it needs to recognize that France 's relatively recent enthusiasm for the transat\u00adlantic alliance is potentially only skin deep .The United States should not assume that this short - term entente represents a fundamental change on France 's part .This was clearly demonstrated by President Sarkozy 's call for a temporary moratorium on Amer\u00adica 's missile defense deployments in Poland and the Czech Republic , [ 24 ] a project that NATO had endorsed at the Bucharest Summit .As long as France continues to be an unpredictable ally with interests clearly at odds with those of NATO , Washington should resist its reintegration into NATO structures .Washington should similarly demand a French commitment to the supremacy of NATO in European defense , rather than concede to the duplication and decoupling of NATO and the EU through the ESDP .Decision Making .It is important that NATO continues to enlarge , and as its geographical reach expands , it must become more flexible in its decision making .NATO boasts that one of its greatest strengths is its consen\u00adsus - voting model , whereby no official votes are taken and all decisions can be interpreted as the alli\u00adance speaking with one voice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "44.722107"}

{"text": "The incorporation of West Germany into the organization on 9 May 1955 was described as \" a decisive turning point in the history of our continent \" by Halvard Lange , Foreign Affairs Minister of Norway at the time .A major reason for Germany ' 's entry into the alliance was that without German manpower , it would have been impossible to field enough conventional forces to resist a Soviet invasion .Three major exercises were held concurrently in the northern autumn of 1957 .Operation Counter Punch , Operation Strikeback , and Operation Deep Water were the most ambitious military undertaking for the alliance to date , involving more than 250,000 men , 300 ships , and 1,500 aircraft operating from Norway to Turkey .French withdrawalMap of the NATO air bases in France before Charles de Gaulle ' 's 1966 withdrawal from NATO military integrated command .NATO ' 's unity was breached early in its history with a crisis occurring during Charles de Gaulle ' 's presidency of France .De Gaulle protested the United States ' ' strong role in the organization and what he perceived as a special relationship between it and the United Kingdom .In a memorandum sent to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Prime Minister Harold Macmillan on 17 September 1958 , he argued for the creation of a tripartite directorate that would put France on an equal footing with the US and the UK .Considering the response he received to his memorandum unsatisfactory , de Gaulle began constructing an independent defence force for his country .He wanted to give France , in the event of an East German incursion into West Germany , the option of coming to a separate peace with the Eastern bloc instead of being drawn into a larger NATO - Warsaw Pact war .In February 1959 , France withdrew its Mediterranean Fleet from NATO command , and later banned the stationing of foreign nuclear weapons on French soil .This caused the United States to transfer two hundred military aircraft out of France and return control of the air force bases that had operated in France since 1950 to the French by 1967 .Though France showed solidarity with the rest of NATO during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 , de Gaulle continued his pursuit of an independent defence by removing France ' 's Atlantic and Channel fleets from NATO command .In 1966 , all French armed forces were removed from NATO ' 's integrated military command , and all non - French NATO troops were asked to leave France .U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk was later quoted as asking de Gaulle whether his order included \" the bodies of American soldiers in France ' 's cemeteries ?\" This withdrawal forced the relocation of SHAPE from Rocquencourt , near Paris , to Casteau , north of Mons , Belgium , by 16 October 1967 .France remained a member of the alliance , and committed to the defence of Europe from possible Warsaw Pact attack with its own forces stationed in the Federal Republic of Germany throughout the Cold War .A series of secret accords between US and French officials , the Lemnitzer - Ailleret Agreements , detailed how French forces would dovetail back into NATO ' 's command structure should East - West hostilities break out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.399734"}
