Edgar Hoover to undermine the Truman Administration before McCarthy even got to Washington .He created the most far - reaching anti - sedition law ever enacted in America ( the McCarran Internal Security Act ) , which filled Ellis Island with immigrants alleged to be subversives and set up concentration camps to hold suspected traitors in the case of a national emergency .McCarran 's Senate Internal Security Subcommittee cowed the State Department into sacrificing the careers of diplomats accused of helping the Communists take over China .McCarran virtually blackmailed more than one attorney general into carrying out his policies .From Capitol Hill to the United Nations , from union halls to Hollywood , McCarran 's wrath broke careers and lives and ultimately , in a self - destructive fit of pique , cost his party control of the Senate .Ybarra 's even - handed narrative shows that McCarran was ultimately half right : There really were Communists in Washington - but it was the hunt for them that did the real damage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.20615"}

Johnson , who with Stuart Taylor , wrote a first rate book on the Duke University scandal .Check his article out too .Teaching in the universities about the so - called McCarthy era has become an area most susceptible to politically correct and one - sided views of what the period was all about .One historian who strenuously objects to the accepted left - wing interpretation that prevails in the academy is Jennifer Delton , Chairman of the Department of History at Skidmore College .In the March issue of The Journal of the Historical Society Delton writes : .However fiercely historians disagree about the merits of American Communism , they almost universally agree that the post - World War II Red scare signified a rightward turn in American politics .The consensus is that an exaggerated , irrational fear of communism , bolstered by a few spectacular spy cases , created an atmosphere of persecution and hysteria that was exploited and fanned by conservative opportunists such as Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy .This hysteria suppressed rival ideologies and curtailed the New Deal , leading to a resurgence of conservative ideas and corporate influence in government .We may add detail and nuance to this story , but this , basically , is what we tell our students and ourselves about post - World War II anti - Communism , also known as McCarthyism .It is fundamentally the same story that liberals have told since Whittaker Chambers accused Alger Hiss of being a Communist spy in 1948 .This conventional narrative of the left has been told over and over for so many years that it has all but become the established truth to most Americans .It was exemplified in a best - selling book of the late 1970 's , David Caute 's The Great Fear , and from the most quoted one from the recent past , Ellen Schrecker 's Many Are the Crimes : McCarthyism in America .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.388245"}

Cole requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital ( no more than thirty miles from the clinic ) .It also requires abortion clinics to have facilities equivalent to those at an outpatient surgical center , that is , more equipment than Texas law demands in doctors ' offices where more hazardous procedures such as colonoscopies or liposuctions are performed .The rise of the Whole Woman case just as an election looms may provoke voters in ways unsought by sponsors of the Texas law .Several Texas clinics challenged the law , but a federal appeals court , the Fifth Circuit , upheld the new requirements .The Supreme Court now faces several questions : Does the law protect women 's health , as Texas claims ?Does the law impose an \" undue burden \" on women who seek abortions ?The \" undue burden \" consideration arose in Planned Parenthood v. Casey ( 1992 ) , which confirms the right to abortion set forth in Roe v. Wade ( 1973 ) .A law can be an undue burden , states the Casey decision , if it has \" the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion .\" It is likely that the Supreme Court , when it reviews the Texas case , will further explicate \" undue burden , \" \" substantial obstacle , \" and , especially , \" purpose or effect . \" Texas claims that it has \" wide discretion \" to pass medical regulations , that it enacted the 2013 law to protect the health of those who seek abortions , that the law ensures qualified doctors , and that it cuts delay if a patient needs a hospital .The clinics contend that the state requirements were not designed to promote women 's health , that the law is a tactic to close clinics , and that it imperils women 's health by \" reducing access to safe and legal abortion . \"Since 2013 , critics of the law charge , the 42 clinics that once provided access to abortion in Texas now number nineteen and would dwindle to ten if the law survives review .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.44296"}

Billy Graham the Presidential Medal of Freedom and proclaimed 1983 the \" Year of the Bible . \"He called on Americans to join him : \" Let us take up the challenge to reawaken America 's religious and moral heart , recognizing that a deep and abiding faith in God is the rock upon which this great nation was founded .Reagan also used racism , of course .He even announced his run for the presidency with a speech supporting \" states rights \" in Philadelphia , Mississippi , where Michael Schwerner , James Chaney and Andrew Goodman were murdered because they were trying to register African American voters in 1964 .William Raspberry in the Washington Post in 2004 : .It was bitter symbolism for black Americans ( though surely not just for black Americans ) .Countless observers have noted that Reagan took the Republican Party from virtual irrelevance to the ascendancy it now enjoys .The essence of that transformation , we should n't forget , is the party 's successful wooing of the race - exploiting Southern Democrats formerly known as Dixiecrats .And Reagan 's Philadelphia appearance was an important bouquet in that courtship .He gets full credit from me for the good things he did - including presiding over the end of international communism .But he also legitimized , by his broad wink at it , racial indifference - and worse .His political progeny include Trent Lott , who got caught a while back praising the overtly segregationist 1948 presidential candidacy of Strom Thurmond , and , I suspect , many Lott soul mates in the current Republican congressional majority .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.111015"}

{"text": "The most well - known contemporary formulation is due to John Rawls : .Persons are reasonable in one basic aspect when , among equals say , they are ready to propose principles and standards as fair terms of cooperation and to abide by them willingly , given the assurance that others will likewise do so .Those norms they view as reasonable for everyone to accept and therefore as justifiable to them ; and they are ready to discuss the fair terms that others propose .( John Rawls , Political Liberalism , p. 49 ) .It could hardly be fair to expect some citizens to comply with a policy if it was devised without their perspectives in mind .Policy that is genuinely fair must come from deliberation that takes every reasonable perspective into account .The stability of democracy as a system therefore depends upon a citizenry who are not sealed off from the perspectives of their reasonable co - citizens by fear , panic , or hatred .A general belief that Jews are out to deceive will undermine reasonable public discourse , as it will lead citizens to discount the actual perspective of their Jewish co - citizens in forming policy .It would be no surprise to discover in such a society policies unfair to Jewish citizens .Problematic ideological divisions do not immediately disappear in a society even when wars are fought to overcome them .But in the presence of a public ethos that repudiates them , it becomes unacceptable to endorse them in public .As Tali Mendelberg has brilliantly described , this does not mean that the problematic ideological fissures become politically neutralized .It rather means that politicians who seek to exploit them must do so in a way that does not undermine the public 's view of them as reasonable public servants .This dialectic , applied to the ideological fissure of racism in the United States , is aptly reflected in a 1981 interview with Lee Atwater , later to lead George H.W. Bush 's 1988 presidential campaign , with the notorious Willie Horton ad : .You start out in 1954 by saying , \" Nigger , nigger , nigger .\" By 1968 you ca n't say \" nigger\"-that hurts you , backfires .So you say stuff like , uh , forced busing , states ' rights , and all that stuff , and you 're getting so abstract .When a politician uses language that explicitly represents a group in negative terms , it undercuts the social norm that keeps such ideological fissures part of the private sphere .Since it is assumed that legitimate public discourse is guided by a norm of reasonableness , it gives an aura of reasonableness to the description of Muslims as terrorists , Mexican immigrants as \" rapists \" , or climate science as \" bullshit \" .Certain ideologies subordinate by targeting a group , and representing the perspectives of its members as unworthy of consideration in the formation of policy .In the extreme case , such ideologies dehumanize its targets .When ideologies that subordinate or dehumanize a group are legitimated in public debate about policies governing members of that group , democratic deliberation about policy is placed into crisis .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.75432"}

Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992 .Today , the U.S. remains the world 's largest cumulative carbon emitter .Having caused the greatest share of the problem to date , the U.S. must now meet its obligations to respond , and must understand that human rights , equity and fairness matter and are vital to unlocking cooperation in the international negotiations .Independent scientific analysis demonstrates that our country 's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution ( INDC ) is not yet consistent with keeping warming below even 2 \u00b0 C .A far greater commitment will be necessary to account for our nation 's historic responsibility and serve as the basis of a just international agreement .A recent Civil Society Review concludes that the current U.S. INDC represents only about one - fifth of our country 's fair share of mitigation action .For these reasons , in advance of the Paris talks we urge you to greatly increase the U.S. commitment to reduce emissions at home and finance a just transition abroad , in line with what science and justice demand .As a fundamental policy to achieving our emissions goals , leaving fossil fuels in the ground is critical to protect people from the ravages of oil , gas , and coal extraction .A major study from Stanford University found that that it is feasible for the U.S. to achieve 100 % renewable energy by 2050 , and that doing so will generate a net increase of two million American jobs and a reduction of approximately 62,000 air pollution - related deaths per year .A study by Carbon Tracker has demonstrated that the world needs to keep 80 percent of proven fossil fuel reserves in the ground if we are to keep warming below even 2 \u00b0 C .As the leader of the world 's largest historical emitter , we urge you to exert leadership by pledging to keep at least 80 % of U.S. proven fossil fuel reserves in the ground .Two critical first steps are needed in order to implement this pledge : placing a ban on fracking and other dangerous extraction techniques , and ending fossil fuel leasing on public lands and waters to keep these publicly owned resources in the ground where they belong .Finally , we urge to you commit to financing a just transition to a renewable economy at home and abroad .We request that you exert pressure immediately on Congress to make good on the $ 3 billion pledge to the Green Climate Fund .The U.S. should also commit to targets to significantly increase public finance to meet the cost of mitigation , adaptation , and loss and damage in developing countries , particularly for the most vulnerable communities and nation - states .This includes committing to mechanisms for raising new and additional resources such as a financial transaction tax ( as France has committed to ) , halting subsidies for fossil fuel production immediately and investing those public dollars in clean energy solutions that benefit communities on - the - ground .You recently proclaimed that \" America is now a global leader when it comes to taking action to fight climate change .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.48338"}

{"text": "KS & DS : Compensatory arguments were important in the early development of income tax systems in the 19th century when it was argued that income taxes on the rich were necessary to compensate for heavy indirect taxes that fell disproportionately on the poor and middle class .But the most significant compensatory arguments over the last two centuries have been arguments to raise taxes on the rich to preserve equal sacrifice in wars of mass mobilization .These conflicts , particularly World War I and World War II , led states to raise large armies , often through conscription , and citizens and politicians alike adopted compensatory fairness arguments to justify higher taxes on income and wealth .Mass war mobilization led governments of both left and right to tax the rich .When have countries taxed the rich ?KS & DS : Well , one thing our book shows is that governments have n't taxed the rich just because inequality is high , nor have they done this simply because the poor and middle class outnumber the rich when it comes to voting .The main occasion when governments have moved to tax the rich is during times of mass mobilization for war , especially in democracies in which the norm of treating citizens as equals is held more strongly .The real watershed for taxing the rich for many countries came in 1914 .The era of the two world wars and their aftermath was one in which governments taxed the rich at rates that would have previously seemed unimaginable .How do we know that the effect of wars was due to changes in fairness considerations ?KS & DS : We show in the book that when countries shift from peace to war , or the reverse , there has also been a big shift in the type of fairness arguments made in favor of taxing the rich .During times of peace debates about whether it is fair to tax the rich center on competing equal treatment and ability to pay arguments .During times of war supporters of taxing the rich have also been able to make Compensatory arguments .If the poor and middle class are doing the fighting , then the rich should be asked to pay more for the war effort .If some with wealth benefit from war profits , then this creates another compensatory argument for taxing the rich .These compensatory arguments had the biggest impact in democracies that are founded on the idea that citizens should be treated as equals .The fact that war had a much bigger impact on taxes on the rich in democracies than in autocracies also suggests that the rich were n't being taxed out of simple necessity .It was because war determined what types of fairness arguments could be made .What are the implications for future tax policies in the United States ?KS & DS : Do n't expect high and rising inequality to necessarily lead to a return to the high top tax rates of the post - war era .What really matters is what people believe about how inequality is generated in the first place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.430954"}

{"text": "I have friends from many different ethnicities and if they met some of my racist friends , will they think that I am racist also ; although , I have never said or implied that I think like them .The race is a huge issue in the US and it will always be .All American are not racist but some are and we can not change our history and pretend like nothing every happened .Obama 's skin colour can be harming the principle of democracy in the USA if his race and colour become a major issue instead of his ideas .What matters in a fair election race are the tone and the colour of ideas and not the fair skin of the speakers .Obama , as it is evident , has to battle on two fronts : first to prove the credibility of his ideas in confronting Hilary Clinton camp .The second is to convince the voters that colour should n't be an issue as what matters is the person behind the colour and not the colour making the look of a person .His opponents will try to play down the race issue .The fact of some insisting on his past try implicitly to emphasize his black origins .Perhaps Obama 's move to sever ties with his pastor is aimed at limiting controversies around him .After his apparent hesitant remarks about the Rev Jeremiah Wright that he could n't disown him , now he directly announces his completely separation of him in an attempt to unite more voters around him .It can be easy to turn a new page vis - \u00e0 - vis the Rev Jeremiah Wright .But it will be hard for him to change his political views 180 \u00b0 without paying dearly for that .The church membership can be seen as personal matter , but politics is an issue that interests every member of the society .Martin Luther King Jr. is one of the most highly regarded people in the history of our country .Nearly every city has a street named after him .He is highly regarded by both whites and blacks .I 've never , in my entire life in the USA heard someone say something bad about him .Nearly every american can quote parts of his speeches .Blacks make up 12 % of the population in the United States .Do you think Martin Luther King could have become so famous with 12 % of the population supporting him ?How can you possibly argue that he is not highly regarded by whites ?And the nail in the coffin .....The Gallup Poll - .That 's right , MLK Jr. is the number 2 most widely admired person in the 20th century .Right above JFK .I have this funny feeling that they may have polled 1 or 2 white people during that 69 year period .Very few people are entirely unbiased .Many people will vote for Mr. Obama because of his skin color , Some who may vote for Mr. Obama , would not want a person of his skin color to move into their neighborhood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "123.11792"}
