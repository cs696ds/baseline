Dick short story , \" We Can Remember It for You Wholesale \" .Kindergarten Cop ( 1990 ) reunited him with director Ivan Reitman , who directed him in Twins .The movie also featured actress Pamela Reed .Schwarzenegger had a brief foray into directing , first with a 1990 episode of the TV series Tales from the Crypt , entitled \" The Switch \" , and then with the 1992 telemovie Christmas in Connecticut .He has not directed since .Schwarzenegger 's commercial high - water mark was his return as the title character in 1991 's Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , which was the highest - grossing film of 1991 .In 1993 , the National Association of Theatre Owners named him the \" International Star of the Decade . \"His next film project , the 1993 self - aware action comedy spoof Last Action Hero was released opposite Jurassic Park , with the box office suffering accordingly .His next film , the comedy drama True Lies ( 1994 ) was a highly popular spy film , and saw Schwarzenegger , reunited with James Cameron , appearing opposite Jamie Lee Curtis .Shortly thereafter came the comedy Junior ( 1994 ) , the last of his three collaborations with Ivan Reitman and again co - starring Danny DeVito and also for the second time featuring Pamela Reed .This film brought Schwarzenegger his second Golden Globe nomination , this time for Best Actor - Musical or Comedy .It was followed by the action thriller Eraser ( 1996 ) and the comic book - based Batman & Robin ( 1997 ) , where he played the villain Mr. Freeze .This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.35279"}
