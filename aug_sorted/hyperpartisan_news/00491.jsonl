Hansford Sun 29 Jun 08 ( 11:56am ) .Yep .Certainly makes more sense than CO2 warming the atmosphere without added energy .After all this time you have still failed to grasp the most fundamental concept of the GHE .CO2 does not warm the atmosphere ; it blocks / slows the outgoing long wave radiation ( heat ) from being radiated to space .This is why a clear night will cool more rapidly than a cloudy night ( water vapour is a GHG ) or the deserts cool faster than the humid tropics .99.9999 % of the energy comes from the sun .As for Prof Miskolczi , here is a 4 part series on his theory and climate audit also has a good discussion which casts several doubt on the paper .J. Hansford replied to J. Hansford Mon 30 Jun 08 ( 12:51am ) .Well Daryl ....The empirical data and observations just do n't fit the Computer models as per the AGW Hypothesis ....Tropical troposphere has n't warmed to the predicted levels , Sea levels and temps are not in accordance .... the rate of change is 1.8 degrees of warming over the last 120 years which is well within the 2.5 degree parameters for the last 5000 years ... CO2 rise lags temp rise ....Temp has n't increased in for ten years despite a 4 % increase in CO2 ... and plenty more ....Miskolczi is by no means perfect ... but he does not say that he is ...It 's just a pity that Hanson and other AGW theorists are not scrutinized and pressured as he was .... .Plus he is n't refuting the effects of GHG 's ... just reinterpreting the effects of the main one ....Water vapor .But that was , of course , long before Al Gore came along to enlighten us , tell us that it 's our fault , and inform us of ways to make money from sounding the alarm .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.860855"}
