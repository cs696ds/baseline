{"text": "The name Columbia for \" America \" first appeared in a 1738 weekly publication of the debates of the British Parliament .The use of Columbus as a founding figure of New World nations and the use of the word ' Columbia ' , or simply the name ' Columbus ' , spread rapidly after the American Revolution .In 1812 , the name ' Columbus ' was given to the newly founded capitol of Ohio .During the last two decades of the 18th century the name \" Columbia \" was given to the federal capital District of Columbia , South Carolina 's new capital city , Columbia , South Carolina , the Columbia River , and numerous other places .Outside the United States the name was used in 1819 for the Gran Colombia , a precursor of the modern Republic of Colombia .The main plaza in Mayag\u00fcez , Puerto Rico is called Plaza Col\u00f3n in honor of the Admiral .A candidate for sainthood in the Catholic Church in 1866 , Celebration of Columbus 's legacy perhaps reached a zenith in 1892 when the 400th anniversary of his first arrival in the Americas occurred .Monuments to Columbus like the Columbian Exposition in Chicago were erected throughout the United States and Latin America extolling him .Numerous cities , towns , counties , and streets have been named after him , including the capital cities of two U.S. states , Ohio and South Carolina .In 1909 , descendants of Columbus undertook to dismantle the Columbus family chapel in Spain and move it to a site near State College , Pennsylvania , where it may now be visited by the public .At the museum associated with the chapel , there are a number of Columbus relics worthy of note , including the armchair which the \" Admiral of the Ocean Sea \" used at his chart table .More recent views of Columbus , particularly those of Native Americans , have tended to be much more critical .The native Taino people of the island were systematically enslaved via the encomienda system .The pre - Columbian population is estimated to have been perhaps 250,000 - 300,000 .According to the historian Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdes by 1548 , 56 years after Columbus landed , less than five hundred Taino were left on the island .In another hundred years , perhaps only a handful remained .Physical appearance .Although an abundance of artwork involving Christopher Columbus exists , no authentic contemporary portrait has been found .Sometime between 1505 and 1536 , Alejo Fern\u00e1ndez painted an altarpiece , The Virgin of the Navigators , that includes a depiction of Columbus .The painting was commissioned for a chapel in Seville 's Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n ( House of Trade ) and remains there to this day .James W. Loewen , author of Lies My Teacher Told Me , said that the various posthumous portraits have no historical value .At the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition , 71 alleged portraits of Columbus were displayed , most did not match contemporary descriptions .These writings describe him as having reddish hair , which turned to white early in his life , light colored eyes , as well as being a lighter skinned person with too much sun exposure turning his face red .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "34.488113"}

Lee explains it as follows : .As taught worldwide to the innocent school children , for us , the \" discoveries \" of Columbus ( that the earth was round and that a \" New World \" existed outside Europe ) are still rated by us as the greatest hoaxes of all times .The ancient Greek scientists and the Middle Age Norsemen , who traded with Iceland , Nova Scotia and Greenland , respectively , knew very much about \" America \" already .This Big Lie about Columbus , as a political and psychological strategy , over the centuries , became a racist ideological dogma , a formal logical \" absolute truth , \" to celebrate global European \" race \" superiority .This is the alienating essence of all the busts and statues of Columbus across the globe and of the \" Day of the Race \" !Even if this were so , it can hardly be claimed that Columbus himself \" instigated \" this lie .It is impossible to deny that certain events and the accomplishments of major figures through history have been magnified to serve the interest of national and occasionally even racial pride .The centuries - long debate over whether Columbus was of Spanish or Italian origin bears witness to this fact .He makes a series of emphatic claims : .And yet , across modern history there is no people on earth who was ( and still is ) more exploited , dominated , discriminated humiliated and massacred like the African people .It has been reliably demonstrated that Scandinavian vessels under the command of Leif Ericson arrived in North America through Greenland several centuries before Columbus .The reality of this voyage , while its historic importance is negligible when compared with Columbus ' , has been well - established by both documentary and archaeological evidence .There have been other attempts in the past to claim that non - European travelers visited the Americas prior to Columbus .Not all of them seem to have been guided by the ulterior motive of dispelling a \" myth \" of European historiography , either .Gavin Menzies ' 2002 book , 1421 :The Year China Discovered the World , asserts that Chinese explorers arrived more than 70 years before Columbus .The claim is not all that outrageous - Chinese society at that time possessed sufficient nautical technologies that they could have potentially built a fleet that reached America .The main evidence on which Menzies based his assertion , however , has come under severe scrutiny .A map , purported to be of an early fifteenth - century origin , was revealed to be a forgery after a number of national Chinese scholars and Western sinologists noticed that it contained several anachronistic references .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.527565"}

Roosevelt , primarily at the behest of Catholics and the fast growing Italian immigrant community who wanted a national holiday of celebration .By the quincentenary celebration of his discovery in 1992 , Columbus stood accused of genocide and ecocide .Columbus Day became controversial in the 1970s , as a matter of white guilt regarding the mistreatment of native Americans .The main accuser was Colorado professor Ward Churchill ( who was fired in 2007 for academic misconduct and falsifying history ) ; he compared Columbus to Nazi Holocaust sponsor Heinrich Himmler , pointing to the genocidal outcome of Columbus 's brutal practices in the Caribbean .Columbus did return to Spain with a number of Indian slaves , and that slave labor was used in his quest for gold .Native populations died out primarily because of exposure to new Old World diseases .[ 4 ] .Leftist protesters of the 1992 quincentennial celebrations of frequently used the term \" genocide \" to describe European treatment of the Indians , but they never defined genocide or provided sound evidence that Europeans practiced genocide .Historians should recognize the legitimate emotional source of these complaints , but counsel against the use of moral blackmail by groups who have something to gain from characterizing European treatment of Indians as genocidal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.089294"}

{"text": "Overview .Five hundred years after Columbus 's first voyage to the New World , the debate over the European impact on Native American civilization has grown more heated than ever .Among the first -- and most insistent -- voices raised in that debate was that of a Spanish priest , Bartolome de Las Casas , acquaintance of Cortes and Pizarro and shipmate of Velasquez on the voyage to conquer Cuba .In 1552 , after forty years of witnessing -- and opposing -- countless acts of brutality in the new Spanish colonies , Las Casas returned to Seville , where he published a book that caused a storm of controversy that persists to the present day .The Devastation of the Indies is an eyewitness account of the first modern genocide , a story of greed , hypocrisy , and cruelties so grotesque as to rival the worst of our own century .Las Casas writes of men , women , and children burned alive \" thirteen at a time in memory of Our Redeemer and his twelve apostles . \"He describes butcher shops that sold human flesh for dog food ( \" Give me a quarter of that rascal there , \" one customer says , \" until I can kill some more of my own \" ) .Slave ship captains navigate \" without need of compass or charts , \" following instead the trail of floating corpses tossed overboard by the ship before them .Native kings are promised peace , then slaughtered .Whole families hang themselves in despair .Once - fertile islands are turned to desert , the wealth of nations plundered , millions killed outright , whole peoples annihilated .In an introduction , historian Bill M. Donovan provides a brief biography of Las Casas and reviews the controversy his work produced among Europeans , whose indignation -- and denials -- lasted centuries .But the book itself is short . \" Were I to describe all this , \" writes Las Casas of the four decades of suffering he witnessed , \" no amount of time and paper could encompass this task . \"Rodrigo de Bastidas .The next expedition to leave Spain , after the trip by Alonso de Ojeda , was under the command of Rodrigo de Bastidas , a wealthy notary of Triana , a suburb of Sevilla .He was a man of position and well educated , very different in nature than the explorers that preceded him and would come after him .On the 5th of June , 1500 , he was able to secure a license from the Spanish Crown .It granting him the right to secure in the new world all Treasures he could find .After deducting the cost of outfitting the ships and crew , he was to give the king one - forth of the net profits , and keep for himself , three - forth of the profits .Bastidas was familiar with the New World , since he had accompanied the Admiral , Don Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n on his second voyage , and also with Alonso de Ojeda , on his first voyage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.7981"}

{"text": "Christopher Columbus : The First Voyage .At the end of the 15th century , it was nearly impossible to reach Asia from Europe by land .The route was long and arduous , and encounters with hostile armies were difficult to avoid .Portuguese explorers solved this problem by taking to the sea : They sailed south along the West African coast and around the Cape of Good Hope .But Columbus had a different idea : Why not sail west across the Atlantic instead of around the massive African continent ?The young navigator 's logic was sound , but his math was faulty .He argued ( incorrectly ) that the circumference of the Earth was much smaller than his contemporaries believed it was ; accordingly , he believed that the journey by boat from Europe to Asia should be not only possible but comparatively easy .He presented his plan to officials in Portugal and England , but it was not until 1491 that he found a sympathetic audience : the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile .Columbus wanted fame and fortune .Ferdinand and Isabella wanted the same , along with the opportunity to export Catholicism to lands across the globe .( Columbus , a devout Catholic , was equally enthusiastic about this possibility . )Columbus ' contract with the Spanish rulers promised that he could keep 10 percent of whatever riches he found , along with a noble title and the governorship of any lands he should encounter .On August 3 , 1492 , Columbus and his crew set sail from Spain in three ships : the Nina , the Pinta and the Santa Maria .On October 12 , the ships made landfall - not in Asia , as Columbus assumed , but on one of the Bahamian islands .In March 1493 , leaving 40 men behind in a makeshift settlement on Hispaniola ( present - day Haiti and the Dominican Republic ) , he returned to Spain .Christopher Columbus : Later Voyages .About six months later , in September 1493 , Columbus returned to the Americas .He found the Hispaniola settlement destroyed ( to this day , no one knows what happened there ) and left his brothers Bartolomeo and Diego behind to rebuild , along with part of his ships ' crew and hundreds of enslaved natives .Then he headed west , with his own complement of native slaves , to continue his mostly fruitless search for gold and other goods .In lieu of the material riches he had promised the Spanish monarchs , he sent some 500 slaves to Queen Isabella .The queen was horrified - she believed that any people Columbus \" discovered \" were Spanish subjects who could not be enslaved - and she promptly and sternly returned the explorer 's gift .In May 1498 , Columbus sailed west across the Atlantic for the third time .He visited Trinidad and the South American mainland before returning to the ill - fated Hispaniola settlement , where the colonists had staged a bloody revolt against the Columbus brothers ' mismanagement and brutality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.89521"}

{"text": "The little we know about the Discoverer 's childhood and early youth can be quickly told .He had very little formal schooling , spoke the Genoese dialect , which was almost unintelligible to other Italians , and never learned to read and write until he went to Portugal .As everyone who described him in later life said that he had a long face , an aquiline nose , ruddy complexion and red hair , we can picture him as a little , freckled - faced redhead with blue eyes .One imagines that he was a dreamy little boy and very religious for one of his age , and he must have disliked working in his father 's loom shed , as he took every opportunity to go to sea .There were plenty of opportunities in that seafaring community .Almost all the traffic along the Ligurian coast was sea - borne .And everyone who had no other job , besides many who did , went fishing .Big carracks and galleons were built in the harbor ; there were boat yards in every cove along the shore ; and the ships of the Republic traded with all parts of the Mediterranean and with Northern Europe .In later life Columbus said that he first went to sea in 1461 when he was ten years old .Probably his seafaring at that age did not amount to much ; maybe his father let him sail with a neighbor to Portofino to load dried fish , or even over to Corsica , which would have seemed like a foreign voyage to a little boy .What sailor can forget his first cruise ?Every incident , every turn of wind , every vessel or person you meet stays in your memory for years .What pride and joy to be given the tiller while the skipper goes below and the mate snoozes on the sunny side of the deck !What a thrill to sight five mountains above the horizon , to watch them rise , spread out and merge into one as you approach !Then , to go ashore , to swap your jackknife for a curiosity , to see the island gradually sink below the horizon on the homeward passage , and to swagger ashore feeling you are a real old salt !Such things a sailor never forgets .Exactly when Christopher decided to quit the weaving trade and make the sea his profession we do not know .Facts about his early life are few ; one has to piece together incidents that he or his friends remembered after he became famous , or which were recorded in a notary 's office because of some litigation .It is probable that for a period of about eight years , between ages fifteen and twenty - three , Christopher made several long voyages in the Mediterranean but spent most of his time ashore helping his father .When he was nineteen , he served in a Genoese ship chartered by King Ren\u00e9 II of Anjou as part of his war fleet in a brief brawl with the King of Aragon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.46452"}

{"text": "But neither Italians nor other Catholics were prepared to cede such a powerful symbol of their own identity , any more than they were willing to abandon their own particular heritage and beliefs .They wanted Americans to be treated equally , whether of Irish , Italian or Anglo - Saxon descent .They pushed for a new form of American identity , pluralistic enough to allow their children to retain their own creeds and origins and still be accepted as patriotic Americans .At the forefront of the struggle came the Knights of Columbus .Founded in 1882 as a Catholic alternative to the popular fraternal orders of the day , its first generation of members was almost exclusively Irish .Yet they took Columbus as their namesake , embracing the appeal of America 's most popular Catholic as a means of forging a cohesive Catholic community .In grand Columbus Day parades , they asserted their own patriotism and respectability , proudly affirming that good Catholics could also be good Americans .Out in Colorado , an Italian immigrant named Angelo Noce relentlessly pushed legislation to transform the local observances of the Italian community into a formally recognized holiday .In 1905 , he succeeded .There was nothing remotely like it on the civic calendar of the era .The Governor 's proclamation declared Columbus Day : .Local papers celebrated it as an important step in combating prejudice and bigotry , but it was much more .It served as a formal acknowledgment that immigrants could preserve their own ethnic identities and simultaneously embrace their new nation .Two years later , it became a statutory holiday .Over the ensuing decades , the Knights of Columbus pressed the cause in other states , with widespread success .In 1934 , Congress voted to recognize Columbus Day as a federal holiday .The success of the Catholic and Italian communities in laying claim to the great discoverer , and with him to their own place in the New World , led others to follow suit .Some Jews . suggested that Columbus had been financed or accompanied by marranos , or even that Columbus himself was secretly Jewish .No , others replied , Columbus was actually Greek , Catalan , Portugese , Polish , or even Norwegian .It is not necessary to grant credence to any of these claims in order to take their motives seriously .The elevation of Columbus into a patriotic icon suggested to immigrants that they might demand full acceptance , and not mere toleration .If other marginalized immigrant groups saw in the Genoese Catholic sailing for the Spanish Crown a little bit of their own story , they were not entirely wrong .The great irony of Columbus Day , though , is that its struggle for a pluralistic nation succeeded only too well .The ineradicable racial difference of the swarthy Italians faded , over a short few decades , into an indistinguishable whiteness .In 1960 , America elected a Catholic president .New waves of immigrants , and other marginalized groups , pressed for an America that would affirm the equality not only of different varieties of white men from Europe , but of all of its varied people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.48131"}

Hidalgo .On Lascasian Studies .Those who write about Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas ( 1485 - 1566 ) generally fall into his admirers and his detractors , benign descriptors for the divisions that the life of the \" universal protector of the Indians \" usually provokes .The four hundredth anniversary of his death was marked by a flurry of literature about him .Modern scholars have added their own lens to viewing Las Casas and his times , throwing agency , myths , imagination , race , and even gender into the equation as they try to figure out this remarkable man .Daniel Castro 's Another Face of Empire is one of a number of new works in the past two decades on the famous protector of American Indians , a title bestowed in 1516 by Cardinal Francisco Ximenez de Cisneros , twice regent of Spain .Las Casas was already launched on a career that turned him into the most controversial person of the Encounter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.83014"}

Merediz and Santa Arias recently coordinated and contributed to a volume , Approaches to Teaching the Writings of Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas , that contains biographical information within its didactic context .It is a compilation of modern , largely literary approaches to Las Casas , demonstrating that he does not belong to historians alone , but his life and times have universal appeal .Perhaps the most important work to appear in the last two decades is the massive Obras completas .It was published between 1988 and 1998 by the Dominican Foundation Instituto Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas de los Dominicos de Andalucia and Alianza Editorial , Madrid .The overall director of the project was Paulino Casta\u00f1eda Delgado .Some of these volumes number well over one thousand pages each .While not all are Las Casas 's works ( the entire first volume , for example , is a biographical study by Alvaro Huerga ) , the output is impressive .This is the best of the several editions of his various works , and the editors have heavily annotated the presentation to help readers place Las Casas 's works and life in the context of the times .For example , the treatises originally composed in Latin appear in that language with accompanying Spanish translations .Plus , the annotations -- some of them book - length essays by the editors -- represent a wealth of information and interpretation in their own right .It now awaits someone to mine it for its riches and render those riches comprehensible to students of the sixteenth century .The Obras completas remind me of Pierre and Huguette Chaunu 's monumental work on Sevilleet l'Atlantique ( 1504 - 1650 ) , an eleven - volume treasure trove published in 1955 on the almost eighteen thousand voyages by Spanish ships on the Atlantic .I remember reading the wonderful two - volume work published in the mid-1960s by John Lynch , Spain and the Hapsburgs , being eternally grateful for his mining of the Chaunus 's work and rendering into a comprehensible piece .Now someone needs to do the same with Obras completas .Controversy has almost always marked Lascasian studies , and Castro 's Another Face of Empire is no different .Castro 's basic premise is that Las Casas represented the face of \" ecclesiastical imperialism \" during the Spanish conquest of the Americas .This , in fact , was the driving force in the Dominican 's life , and for many Las Casas scholars , it becomes a line in the sand , a litmus test of sorts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.95331"}

{"text": "Christopher Columbus Biography Page 2 .After his disappointment in Portugal , Columbus took his young son and moved to Spain in 1485 with the intention of presenting his plan to the Spanish monarchs , King Ferdinand V and Queen Isabella I. Spain lagged far behind Portugal in exploration of the Atlantic .The two powers had engaged in open hostilities since Spain had begun to dispute some of Portugal 's claims in Africa and to Atlantic island groups , such as the Canaries and the Azores .In 1479 Spain had gained control of the Canary Islands , although Portugal did not abandon its claims .A fragile peace existed because neither side wanted to go to war over the issue .According to tradition , one of the reasons the Portuguese king rejected Columbus 's plan was his concern over aggravating the situation with Spain .One of Columbus 's first stops in Spain was the monastery of La R\u00e1bida in the southern port town of Palos de la Frontera , not far from the Portuguese border .At the monastery Columbus found not only a boarding place for his son Diego but also support from the friars , several of whom became great believers in his vision .One of them , Friar Antonio Marchena , spent many hours discussing geography with Columbus .He also helped shape Columbus 's plans by directing him to the writings of the ancients and of church authorities who were known to support the idea of a westward crossing of the ocean .Through Marchena , Columbus was introduced to powerful noblemen as well , including Friar Juan P\u00e9rez , one of the guardians of the monastery - and the confessor of Queen Isabella .P\u00e9rez introduced Columbus to the court of the Spanish monarchs .Columbus moved to Sevilla ( Seville ) in 1485 , and between May 1486 and September 1487 , he was maintained at the expense of the queen .Although interested in his ideas , the king and queen were in the midst of a protracted war to conquer the province of Granada in southern Spain , which had been held by the Moors , a Muslim group , since 711 .This war left the monarchs little time to consider Columbus 's plan .Finally , in 1487 , Columbus presented his project to a committee of experts called to hear the case .The committee raised numerous objections , asked many questions , and , in the end , rejected the plan .Among the reasons given for the rejection was that the ocean was simply too large to cross .While waiting for the war in Granada to end , Columbus established a liaison with a young peasant woman named Beatriz Enr\u00edquez de Arana .During this period of great despair , Columbus 's one comfort was his love for Beatriz .Although the two never married , in 1488 they had a son named Ferdinand , who later accompanied his father on his final voyage to the Americas .In the last weeks of 1491 Columbus made his final appeal to the Spanish monarchs in the royal camp as the monarchs prepared for their final battle with the Moors in Granada .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.350395"}

'He gives , in the book he wrote , a picture of seven Indians burning in one fire , while a couple of elaborately dressed Spaniards stand by to watch them roasting with unaffected boredom .The abandoned natives were probably being burned alive on account of inaccurate views as to the Real Presence , but as they were ignorant of the Spanish tongue the offence was small .In another engraving Champlain shows how the savage , after he had been brought under religious influences , was induced to attend the service of his church .At the door of a house of prayer stands a priest with a book in his hand .The fingers of the other hand are raised as if he were about to pronounce a blessing .In the forecourt an Indian is being beaten with a club by a very powerful man .The ecchymosed savage is gazing at the priest with curiosity .It is explained that the club , which would fell an ox , is a means of Grace whereby the thoughtless were led to attend to their devotions .It is further explained that each convert who was absent from Mass received at the hands of the athletic missionary thirty to forty blows from the Gospel club in the precincts of the place of worship .Champlain in his account of the natives remarks that \" they are of a very melancholy humour .\" Those who were irregular in their church attendances and who survived their bruises and broken ribs had certainly reasons for depression .The Caribs in the smaller islands , although they may have had the good fortune to escape the missionary , fell victims to the man with the musket and the man with a keg of brandy under his arm .They both came to him with lies on their lips and treachery in their hearts .The Carib had to fight for his life and for every foot of his native land .He had to fight in turn the Spaniards , the French , the English and the Dutch .It was the hopeless battle of arrow and spear against powder and ball ; the war of the naked savage against the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.62002"}

{"text": "The truth is that , whatever a few monks and physicians may have thought of it , the proposed expedition terrified the ordinary seafaring population of Palos .It was thought to be the wildest and maddest scheme that any one had ever heard of .And not only was there reluctance on the part of mariners to engage themselves for the expedition , but also a great shyness on the part of ship - owners to provide ships .An inducement was provided in the offer of a free pardon to all criminals and persons under sentence who chose to enlist .Still the thing hung fire ; and on June 20 a new and peremptory order was issued by the Crown authorising Columbus to impress the vessels and crew if necessary .Time was slipping away ; and in his difficulty Columbus turned to Martin Alonso Pinzon , upon whose influence and power in the town he could count .There were three brothers then in this family- Martin Alonso , Vincenti Yanez , and Francisco Martin , all pilots themselves and owners of ships .There was one more financial question to be settled -- a question that remains for us in considerable obscurity , but was in all probability partly settled by the aid of these brothers .The total cost of the expedition , consisting of three ships , wages of the crew , stores and provisions , was 1,167,542 maravedis , about L950(in 1900 ) .After all these years of pleading at Court , all the disappointments and deferred hopes and sacrifices made by Columbus , the smallness of this sum can not but strike us with amazement .Many a nobleman that Columbus must have rubbed shoulders with in his years at Court could have furnished the whole sum out of his pocket and never missed it ; yet Columbus had to wait years and years before he could get it from the Crown .Still more amazing , this sum was not all provided by the Crown ; 167,000 maravedis were found by Columbus , and the Crown only contributed one million maravedis .He believed in his Idea so thoroughly that he knew he was going to find something across the Atlantic .Continents and islands can not for long remain in the possession of private persons ; they are the currency of crowns ; and he did not want to be left in the lurch if the land he hoped to discover should be seized or captured by Spain or Portugal .Ever since ships were in danger of going to sea short - handed methods of recruiting and manning them have been very much the same ; and there must have been some hot work about the harbour of Palos in the summer of 1492 .The place was in a panic .The presence of these adventurers , many of them entirely ignorant of the sea , would not be exactly an encouragement to the ordinary seaman .It is here very likely that the influence of the Pinzon family was usefully applied .I call it influence , since that is a polite term which covers the application of force in varying degrees ; and it was an awkward thing for a Palos sailor to offend the Pinzons , who owned and controlled so much of the shipping in the port .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.43117"}

Lee 's raving diatribe against both Columbus ' personal character and the continuing celebration of Columbus Day throughout North and South America .A South African expatriate and outspoken supporter of Hugo Ch\u00e0vez 's Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela , Lee studied under the legendary Western Marxist intellectuals Ernst Bloch , Theodor Adorno , and J\u00fcrgen Habermas in Frankfurt between 1962 and 1970 .In his article Lee presents a quite different picture of Columbus ' role in history from that offered by Engels : .Are they really things to celebrate ?Precisely these are the things that Columbus brought to America .For those who have studied capitalism and imperialism in the Americas , it is no secret at all that the source of metropolitan wealth , of power and of so - called progress is simply exploited physical and/or intellectual human labor - force .First of all , their accusation that Columbus inaugurated \" the destruction of a culture \" treats the Native Americans as all belonging to a single culture , rather than what they were - a number of quite distinct cultures , many of which were hostile toward one another .Second , some of these charges are absolutely groundless .There has never been any evidence to suggest that Columbus or his men were personally responsible for any incidents of rape , torture , or genocide .Even if some of Columbus ' men did kill some islanders , this is hardly equivalent to \" genocide , \" unless the term is to lose all meaning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.28143"}

{"text": "As Marx stated in \" The British Rule in India , \" .For many who adhere to this regressive glamorization of non - Western societies , the heinous acts the natives were reported to have carried out , described by colonists and frontiersmen , are chalked up to racist projections owing to a pre - conceived notion of native \" savagery . \"And while it is likely that many of the crimes the Native Americans were said to have committed were exaggerated or even sometimes invented , it would be na\u00efve to think that all the descriptions left in Western accounts are sheer fiction .Human sacrifice was an institutionalized practice for a number of native tribes and civilizations , especially in Central and South America , perhaps most famously in the case of the Aztecs , known for their brutality .Documentary evidence , recorded by both European and non - Europeans alike , attest to this .A great deal of archaeological data also confirms this .European and American violence against the Indians was a great deal more organized , ruthless , and generally dehumanizing , but the violence the native tribes directed against the settlers and against each other is scarcely less real .Also , though the popular imagination has long believed that the Native Americans lived in greater harmony with nature and closeness to the earth , many tribes were guilty of environmental destruction and even local ecological catastrophes , leading to the collapse of their civilizations .The European exploitation of nature was significantly more systematic and rationalized , but this was more a result of the development of capitalism than it was any pre - existing European cultural values .Returning to the figure of Columbus , it might be wondered why it this is an issue worth examining at such length .It would be insane to try and argue that Native American groups do n't have legitimate grievances against the European powers , or their successors in autonomous nations that have since declared their independence from their mother countries by cutting colonial ties .Insofar as Columbus can be seen as symbolically representing the innumerable crimes the natives later suffered at the hands of the Europeans , it is insensitive to cling unconditionally to the celebration of his arrival in the Americas .After all , he clearly possessed racist attitudes , enslaved members of the native population he encountered , and was in general a failure as an administrator , no matter how famed he was for his navigation skills .The informal celebration of Columbus ' person was begun , moreover , as part of a cynical ploy by the Republican party to gain the Italian vote in New York in the 1860s .Since then , the public veneration of Columbus by the Italian immigrant population has of course elevated the explorer to almost the level of a Saint , and the parade that runs through New York has Frank Sinatra impersonators crooning behind rows of Italian flags .Although the holiday is popular in both North and South America , it is in the end a rather frivolous affair , and I would not be too sad to see it go .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.45729"}

{"text": "Navigation in the 15th century was far from an exact science , although several navigational tools and aids were available .The most important navigational aids were compasses , astrolabes , hourglasses , maps , and charts .Although celestial navigation ( finding direction by checking the positions of stars and other heavenly bodies ) was the favored method while sailing under familiar skies , a technique known as dead reckoning was more dependable on voyages in unknown seas .Using an astrolabe , a metal disk inscribed with a map of the major celestial bodies , a mariner could tell location simply by positioning the stars on the astrolabe to match the stars in the sky .But the astrolabe worked only when the skies were clear and the positions of the stars were known .On cloudy days or when the stars in the sky were unfamiliar , celestial navigation and the astrolabe were ineffective .In dead reckoning , the technique often used for traveling in unknown waters , the position of the ship was determined by starting with its last known location .Then , by calculating what direction the ship was going , how fast it was going , and how much time had passed , the pilot could come up with a new position .Pilots could calculate the distance they had traveled in an hour or a day by dropping a floating object in the water at the front of the ship and timing how long it took to get to the back of the ship .Knowing how long the ship was , the pilot could calculate how fast the ship was moving and , thus , how far they had traveled .Columbus preferred dead reckoning over celestial navigation and was never comfortable with the astrolabe and other devices for navigating using the heavenly bodies .Successful navigators survived by \" reading \" nature in this way .Columbus was expert at this and could even predict hurricanes accurately .At daybreak on August 3 , 1492 , the small flotilla of ships left Palos de la Frontera for parts unknown .At the age of 41 , standing on the bow of the Santa Mar\u00eda , watching the coast slowly slip below the horizon , Columbus left behind on dry land a struggle that had lasted a quarter of his life .He was now in his element , doing what he had dreamed about for the past ten years .After a trip to the Canary Islands , where the rudder of the Pinta was repaired , the voyagers departed the known world on September 6 , 1492 .Throughout the voyage the ships traveled primarily westward .The choice of sailing from the Canary Islands proved to be a good one , as the Canaries Current speeded their journey .On September 25 it was thought that land was sighted , but it was nothing more than low - lying clouds .As the trip lengthened , many of the crew feared that the strong daily winds would prevent them from getting back to Spain .Columbus had difficulty with his crew at times , and he found it hard to work with the Pinz\u00f3ns , especially Mart\u00edn Alonso , who had much more experience than Columbus .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.680305"}

{"text": "- How is it possible that the documents of an exclusively Castilian expedition are stored in the archive of the Aragonese crown in Barcelona ?The traditional Spanish historiography says that the 17th of April 1492 the \" Capitulations \" between Columbus and the Catholic Kings for the discovery of the new world where signed in Santa Fe .Is a contract between two parts for which Columbus asks for certain government titles and economic privilege in exchange of the findings of new and yet unknown lands and to put them under sovereignty of the Crown .As we already know the censors acted we see in no wonder that the originals have already disappeared .We will though analyse step by step what the Spanish history says .First : the documents are said to be signed in Santa Fe but at that time Santa Fe in Granada where only a tent camp .Not a town .Second : the Catholic Kings did n't sign themselves those \" Capitulations \" but instead was done by Joan Coloma which was the royal secretary of the Aragonese Kingdom .This makes clearer that the fact that Columbus leaved land form Catalonia as already being demonstrated previously .I would be rather odd to think that Mr Joan Coloma from Catalonia and Columbus would travel to Andalusia to sign themselves those documents just to return home afterwards .There is yet more evidence though because if the \" Capitulations \" where entirely Castilian documents then they would have been prepared , stamped and registered by civil servants of the Castilian chancellorship and being conserved as the remaining documents regarding the issue in the Castilian archives .It was not .Instead the document was registered in the archives of the Aragonese crown .As in all documentation that has disappeared the most ancient document is in the 3569th book in the \" Diversorum sigulli secreti \" section in Simancas archive .In our case not only they where signed by a Catalonian civil servant but also stored in Catalonia .-Castile .Paradise of gardening .It would have been difficult to see if the changes made by the censors would n't be so far from reality and strange .In Casaus book we can find statements like : .By all those descriptions Castile looks like a Mediterranean country rather than one with continental clime as it is .The references to the harvested gardens lead us to Valencia and Barcelona for is there where they where famous .Yet to give more evidence we can quote the description of the Barcelona and Valencia of 1494 by the German writer Munzer which would point out the plain clear manipulation in Casaus 's book .Muner says of Barcelona : \" From Saint Anthony 's door to occident is full of gardens and tree plantations such as lemon - trees , palm trees , pines and vineyards .The land is fruitful and plentiful \" .Of Valencia says : \" We where taken to see the gardens of the city , which are excellently planted of lemon - treed , orange - trees , etc \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.344604"}

Nash notes in his fascinating study of early America , Red , White , and Black : \" Thus power was shared between the sexes and the European idea of male dominancy and female subordination in all things was conspicuously absent in Iroquois society . \"Children in Iroquois society , while taught the cultural heritage of their people and solidarity with the tribe , were also taught to be independent , not to submit to overbearing authority .They were taught equality in status and the sharing of possessions .The Iroquois did not use harsh punishment on children ; they did not insist on early weaning or early toilet training , but gradually allowed the child to learn self - care .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.252075"}

Nash notes in his fascinating study of early America , Red , White , and Black : \" Thus power was shared between the sexes and the European idea of male dominancy and female subordination in all things was conspicuously absent in Iroquois society . \"Children in Iroquois society , while taught the cultural heritage of their people and solidarity with the tribe , were also taught to be independent , not to submit to overbearing authority .They were taught equality in status and the sharing of possessions .The Iroquois did not use harsh punishment on children ; they did not insist on early weaning or early toilet training , but gradually allowed the child to learn self - care .All of this was in sharp contrast to European values as brought over by the first colonists , a society of rich and poor , controlled by priests , by governors , by male heads of families .Gary Nash describes Iroquois culture : .No laws and ordinances , sheriffs and constables , judges and juries , or courts or jails - the apparatus of authority in European societies - were to be found in the northeast woodlands prior to European arrival .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.082565"}
