{"text": "Rite Aid also has a Wellness card that you can use to get UP Reward Dollars .Do n't be intimidated by the names .Each store has a different name for these cash back coupons .The principle is simple .You will need to check the weekly flyer for each store to see what is on sale , and where you can get money coupons back from purchases .These money coupons can be spent in the store like cash .Some stores have stipulations ( i.e. You ca n't spend the cash back coupons on Prescriptions or Gift Cards ) , yet CVS will allow you to spend Extra Bucks on milk , so you will have to check each store for their cash coupon policy .Also , CVS has a coupon Kiosk inside the front of their store where you can swipe your CVS card and get coupons for store items .For example , last week the coupon kiosk printed out a $ 3 off of $ 10 coupon for cosmetics , and if you purchased $ 15 in Revlon cosmetics , you received $ 7 in Extra Bucks .So , I had purchased two Revlon items with my ( 2 ) $ 2 off coupons , AND I could use my kiosk coupon for an extra $ 3 off , PLUS I received $ 7 cash back in Extra Bucks .Because I had saved my Extra Bucks from last Sunday , I basically got these two items for free .This is a prime example of how to use cash back coupons .The best way to explain deal making is to give you an example .The supermarket is having a sale on yogurt .They are currently offering Buy One Get One Free on single yogurt cups , and they are also on sale for 50cents a piece .You have a 50cent coupon for that same yogurt , and you 've just scored two free yogurts .While this is a very basic example , it will help you get the idea of how you can save money using the tips from this website .I 'm not kidding , I calculated that my savings from deal making / couponing saved me over $ 7,000 last year .We also utilized this strategy to help our non - profit ministry score MANY free items that we give to needy people !Because most stores conduct sales on the same items every six weeks or so , you should learn to stock up on items ONLY when they are on sale .This does require a little bit of an up front investment , but would not have to if you also used coupons to start your stockpile .For example , my local CVS had BOGO ( Buy One Get One ) on razors several times this year , and I also had $ 2.00 coupons for razors .I was able to score a year 's supply of razors for under $ 10 .This has allowed us to get extensive supplies for our ministry .I also now have a stockpile of items in my basement of the various items I have gotten for almost nothing or free .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.782887"}

{"text": "In 2014 , GNC reported that its revenue from its relationship with Rite Aid came out to about $ 78 million , with operating margin coming in at 40 % .When you consider that this margin is higher than GNC 's aggregate operating margin of 17.5 % and Rite Aid 's of 2.8 % , it 's safe to assume that Rite Aid is seeing some benefits from the deal as well .This implies that as the company 's ties with its strategic partners grow , so too will the benefits it receives from them .Focusing on the things that count Another big change for Rite Aid in recent years has been its focus on cultivating its more profitable stores while shuttering those that fail to create shareholder value .This can be seen by the fact that a 4 % reduction in store count resulted in the modest drop in sales the retailer experienced .Over the past five years , Rite Aid 's stores have remained around 10,000 selling square feet , or SSF , apiece .During this period , the stores in the Eastern portion have risen from an average of 8,800 SSF to 8,900 SSF , while its Western stores fell from 15,400 SSF to 14,900 SSF .What this implies is that management is trying to find a nice midpoint between size and efficiency in these regions so it can optimize revenue per square foot ( and margins ) .Interestingly , Rite Aid 's stores are , on average , smack in the middle of the range used by both CVS and Walgreen of around 9,800 SSF to 10,400 SSF each , respectively .Like Rite Aid , both of these peers have also been changing their store sizes , with average selling square feet increasing at CVS and dropping at Walgreen .This suggests that Rite Aid 's physical locations might be , on average , just the right size for optimal revenue .Foolish takeaway Despite the problems that have faced Rite Aid in the past , as well as the challenges that await the business in the future , it has a number of strengths that could help it achieve prosperity .Top dividend stocks for the next decade For all of its strengths , there is one thing that Rite Aid 's missing ; a strong , stable dividend .By investing in companies that provide shareholders with strong dividends primed to deliver returns for the next decade or longer , investors can see amazing things happen to their portfolios !The smartest investors know that dividend stocks simply crush their non - dividend paying counterparts over the long term .That 's beyond dispute .They also know that a well - constructed dividend portfolio creates wealth steadily , while still allowing you to sleep like a baby .Knowing how valuable such a portfolio might be , our top analysts put together a report on a group of high - yielding stocks that should be in any income investor 's portfolio .To see our free report on these stocks , just click here now .Comments .Author .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.114174"}

{"text": "\" I also told my friend that I do n't need to go past the financials to prove why Rite Aid is a bad place for your money ...but I 'll dive a little deeper for you guys .First , however , we have to start with the company 's balance sheet .Rite Aid has $ 6 billion in debt that the company is paying $ 515 million in interest on every year .Oh ... wait .It actually just refinanced $ 810 million of 9.5 % Senior Notes due 2017 to 6.75 % due 2021 .That 'll save a whopping $ 22 million a year in interest .Plus , the company turned a $ 107 million profit last year - its first full - year profit in over half a decade - after losing almost a billion dollars in the previous two years .Heck , things are going so well at the company that its primary shareholder , The Jean Coutiu Group cut it 's stake by 158 million shares since April of 2012 ... at prices between $ 1.50 and $ 2.75 .That 's a vote of confidence .Can you smell the sarcasm ?This is all reflective of a business model that just wo n't work anymore , at least in part because Amazon ( AMZN ) is now eating everyone 's lunch .Anything you want to buy at this point is available online ... and that includes medications .There 's nothing you can get in a drugstore that you ca n't get elsewhere , and the attempt to move into food and groceries is n't going to help .In fact , I think it 'll make things worse .You ca n't just throw open the grocery aisles in a drugstore .It takes specific types of labor to do food handling and storage .It also requires additional electricity for refrigerated products , which boosts expenses .Drugstores are really no more than convenience stores at this point , but they are not making the kinds of margins convenience stores make .The latter is able to inflate prices because of the - you guessed it - convenience offered .Drugstores are n't inflating prices and if they did , they 'd lose market share .In addition , much of what you can find at a drugstore can be found at the dollar outlets like Dollar Tree ( DLTR ) - a company that 's actually growing at 15 % annually .Sure , you can think of Rite - Aid as a potential turnaround play .At a minimum , it will take years and years for any real turnaround to occur ... and that 's if it does at all .Would n't you rather put your money into a stock that 's merely undervalued because the market has n't noticed it yet , while it 's growing rapidly and throwing off tons of free cash flow ?Rite Aid Seems to Be Running Out of Steam .If you missed the earlier articles , the main argument is simple : In 2012 , Rite Aid benefited from several one - time items that boosted profits .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.80117"}
{"text": "Earnings .Last week , Rite Aid ( NYSE : RAD ) reported a Q2 loss of five cents per share , which was a significant improvement over the prior year Q2 loss of 11 cents per share .This exceeded the consensus estimate for a loss of seven cents per share .While revenue declined , this was primarily the result of the introduction of new generic drugs , which are cheaper but have a higher margin than brand name drugs .The company also updated its ful l - y ear guidance , slightly raising its earnings and EBIDTA targets .While Rite Aid posted a decent quarter ( at least by its own low standards ) , I expect the company to continue limping along on the edge of bankruptcy for the foreseeable future .Any downturn in business , either from competitor actions or from the macro environment , could send the stock to zero .In March , Rite Aid shares briefly jumped above $ 2 on speculation that Walgreen ( WAG ) might purchase the company to gain leverage in its dispute with Express Scripts ( NASDAQ : ESRX ) .At the time , I wrote that Walgreen was highly unlikely to purchase Rite Aid because of the latter 's high debt load and lack of profitability .I therefore recommended selling or shorting Rite Aid stock .Since then , Rite Aid shares have declined by nearly 40 % , and have been trading in a range from $ 1.20 to $ 1.40 over the summer .Furthermore , the rumor that Walgreen might come riding to Rite Aid 's rescue has been definitively squelched .First , Walgreen announced in June that it would pay $ 6.7 billion to take a 45 % stake in European pharmacy chain Alliance Boots .Walgreen also has an option to buy Alliance Boots outright in 2015 .After making such a large acquisition , Walgreen clearly will not have the ability to acquire Rite Aid ( let alone the interest ) .Second , Walgreen and Express Scripts settled their long - running dispute in July , and Walgreen began filling Express Scripts prescriptions again as of September 15 .With a multi - year agreement locked up , Walgreen does not need to acquire another U.S. drugstore chain to prevent customer defections .Rite Aid will thus be forced to find its own way to profitability .However , while the company is projecting adjusted EBIDTA of roughly $ 1 billion for this year , roughly half of that figure goes to cover interest payments on the company 's more than $ 6 billion of debt .This heavy debt load also creates a drag on Rite Aid 's ability to invest in its stores .Recently , the company has been rolling out a new \" Wellness \" store format , and management claims that these stores have been outperforming the company average in sales growth .Rite Aid plans to convert 500 stores to this new format in the current fiscal year .However , at that rate the company will not have converted its full store base until early 2020 !", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.82631"}

Bluebird .This is a checking / debit alternative offered by American Express .It accepts Vanilla Reloads , which can often be purchased from CVS stores with a credit card .Once loaded , cardholders can pay any bill online or transfer money to a linked bank account .Serve .Like Bluebird , this card accepts Vanilla Reloads , but it also accepts up to $ 200 in loads per day from any debit card , up to $ 1,000 a month .Serve also features online bill payment .AccountNow .The Silver AccountNow Classic card can be reloaded from Green Dot Money Paks or REloadit cards .This card has no monthly fees and a free bill pay service .H&R Block Emerald Card .This card can be obtained in person from an H&R Block branch office , of which there are thousands .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.93181"}

{"text": "Going Cashless & Cash Lite in Nigeria : What are your Payment options .You must have heard about the cashless policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria , CBN by now .Well , if you have not , it is a policy aimed at reducing the volume of physical cash circulating in the Nigerian economy with e - payment options .Core to the cashless ( more like cash - lite ) policy is the introduction of daily bank deposit / withdrawal limits above which account holders pay huge transaction costs .Most articles on the cashless policy so far have focused on either announcing the policy or highlighting the challenges facing it .Very few have actually focused on what payment and transaction options are available to you if you require transactions above the daily limits without paying the huge cash handling charges or if you just want to go cashless or cash - lite .In this article we will be highlighting some of these e - payment and e - transaction options .Cashless Policy Overview .Before going through the payment / bank transaction options , let us first see what the cashless policy is all about .Although the CBN has watered down the cashless policy to the extent that I now consider it useless , any policy that pretend to drive Nigerians towards electronic payment is welcome .As part of the cashless policy , the CBN has put in place daily limit for bank account withdrawals and deposits .The cumulative daily limit is N500,000 for individual accounts and N3,000,000 for corporate accounts .Above this daily limit you will pay cash handling cost of 3 % .Note that the service charge is borne by the account holder , whether deposit or withdrawal .So , you can withdraw above the limit , but it will be expensive if not stupid .For example , if an individual withdraws / deposits N1,000,000 in a day , the first N500,000 will be handled free and the excess N500,000 will attract a 3 % handling charge ( i.e N15,000 ) .So , under the cashless policy you will be debited for N1,015,000 if you withdraws N1,000,000 and credited for N985,000 if you or a client deposits N1,000,000 .To avoid the huge charges you have to use e - payment and e - banking options .Note that if a third party deposits cash to your bank account it is you ( account holder ) that will bear the transaction cost .For now the cashless policy is piloting in Lagos .The cashless policy will be coming to other parts of Nigeria from June 1 , 2012 .Now that you have some handle on the cashless policy , let us now go through some of the other channels available to you if you want to go cashless or cashlite .Internet Banking .Internet banking , also called online banking will enable you handle your banking transactions online .Most Nigerian banks now have internet banking platforms .Internet banking platforms will enable you view account balances , view account activity / statement , check exchange rates , Transfer funds between your accounts within the same bank , and paying bills ( DSTV , water , airtime , etc ) and taxes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.76304"}

{"text": "A bank draft or banker 's draft is a check that it guaranteed by the bank that issues it .In most cases , it lists the bank 's main office or branch as the issuer , and the person or company that is receiving the money as the payee ; the name of the person who requested the draft is often not included .Unlike a personal check , which could bounce if the account holder does n't have enough money to cover it , there is virtually no chance that a legitimate bank draft will not be honored and paid in full .This term is more commonly used in the UK than it is in the US , where a cashier 's check is a similar , more common method of guaranteed payment .How To Get One .To get a bank draft , a customer must make a request at the bank , which often involves some paperwork .The bank will make sure that the customer has enough money to cover the amount being requested , and deduct that money from the person 's account .The draft will then be issued , naming the bank itself - usually the main office - as the entity making the payment , and it is typically signed by at least one manager .It 's given to the person who requested it , who can then use it to pay for his or her purchase .Because the draft is written on the bank itself , payment is guaranteed in most cases .Ad .The person who requests the draft is usually charged a fee , set by the amount of the check .Many people find that the security of this type of payment is worth the cost , however , especially for one - time payments .Customers who must regularly purchase many bank drafts may be able to get a discount .How To Cash One .It is usually not necessary to have an account to cash a bank draft .The payee can typically take it to any bank and be given the amount of the check in cash .If the draft is for a large amount , however , the bank may require it to be deposited directly into a checking or savings account .It may be possible for the payee to open an account , however , so that he or she can access the money .Uses .Most of the time , bank drafts are used by people who need to make large payments .Someone might need to use one to put down a deposit on a house , for example , or to pay for a car bought directly from a private seller .They are considered much more secure than personal checks , since the funds are coming from the bank rather than the individual , and are especially useful in situations where the seller does n't have the ability to take a credit or debit card as payment .Advantages .The biggest advantage of using a bank draft is that the payment is guaranteed , both for the buyer and the seller .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.682755"}
