{"text": "To some of my unschooled , ignorant conservative friends , this is further proof that if we elect Obama president , there will be a department of Sharia Affairs .The truth as Jim Hoft ( via Sweetness and Light ) shows , is a little less dramatic .The costume is that of a Kenyan tribal elder .Now Obama already has some problematic connections to Kenya including his appearances for presidential candidate Raila Odinga , a distant cousin and someone whose recent actions in fomenting violence in Kenya following a crooked presidential election are extremely troublesome .But the idea that Obama in traditional Kenyan garb proves he 's some kind of closet Muslim or Islamic sympathizer is absurd .Kenya is 70 % Christian and only 10 % Muslim .To extrapolate that Obama 's dress denotes anything other than acknowledging his birthright not to mention playing the gracious guest by donning the clothing of his hosts is irrational , stupid , ignorant , and totally without foundation .On the other hand , some conservative bloggers are expressing dismay over the photos on Drudge and are critical of the pix and those who are circulating them .( See roundup below ) .Moran also has this to say : .I would say to my conservative friends who continue to insist that this is a rich vein to mine that you are so off base as to be a laughingstock .Just because my middle name is David does n't mean I 'm a Jew despite a long , illustrious connection of that name to the history and faith of the Hebrews .Hence , this nonsense about Obama 's middle name being \" proof \" that he is a Muslim has got to stop .There 's no evidence that name was given to him for any other reason except the given one - it was his father 's middle name as well .Nor does Obama dressing up in local garb make him a Kenyan elder or a shadow Muslim .The fact that he is wearing a traditional headress is irrelevant to what he believes .When Calvin Coolidge was photographed wearing a Lakotan headdress , no one came out and said Coolidge was a devotee of The Great Spirit .Politicians wear all sorts of funny hats and clothes .It 's part of Americana .For Obama to be singled out for honoring his hosts by dressing in traditional garb is the height of stupidity and my conservative bretheren should be ashamed of themselves .I really wish this meme would stop .There is so much else to criticize Obama for that to start tilting at windmills by claiming he 's a danger to our Judeo - Christian society is a waste of time , effort , and resources .I would imagine the candidate himself rather than being hurt by these accusations probably gets a good laugh out of them , so silly they are and so revealing of the stupidity that permeates a large subset of the right .If Clinton staffers are indeed spreading this then its a second instance of the Clinton camp playing a bigotry card .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.36795"}
