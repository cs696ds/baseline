Grace Meng ( D - Flushing ) held a press conference Tuesday morning to urge undocumented immigrants in New York to enroll and reapply for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program .The program implemented by President Barack Obama allows qualified immigrants under the age of 31 , who were brought into this country as children illegally , to receive work permits and stay in the United States for two years .This protection allows them to remain safe from deportation .DACA protections will begin to expire this September but the U.S. Dept . of Homeland Security announced last month that it will accept renewal requests for an additional two years .Meng thanked local immigration advocacy groups who were in attendance for helping undocumented immigrants apply for this program since its inception in 2012 . \" Many of these children , many of these youth know no other home except for the United States . \"Approximately 560,000 immigrants have been granted DACA protection , but it is estimated that thousands of immigrants in New York are eligible for the program but have not applied for it yet .Meng said that only two - thirds of those eligible actually applied , because some people either do not know about the program or are afraid of negative consequences if they do apply .\" Our communities need to spread the word about DACA , \" she said .The Rev. Patrick Keating , CEO of Catholic Migration Services , said that DACA is a glimmer of hope for immigrant children .He said it gives young people \" an opportunity to avoid fear and continue their education , to continue working , to continue being a part of America and continuing to make America great . \"Keating said that while DACA may only be a temporary fix , it is an opportunity for young immigrants .Renewal applications should be submitted at least 120 days before DACA protections expire to ensure a smooth transition without the possibility for deportation .Assemblyman Francisco Moya ( D - Jackson Heights ) said he wanted to remind the youth to reapply .\" This is such a critical and important program and the right step in the right direction for so many undocumented youth , \" Moya said .\" Especially here in New York .This is the critical step for these young students . \" Grace Shin , executive director of the MinKwon Center for Community Action , said her organization has provided legal assistance to more than 500 applicants to the DACA program since it was announced .\" We encourage everyone to come to us , \" Shin said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "43.889057"}

{"text": "Against the Obama administration , they made the accusation that the government 's \" excessive leniency \" in dealing with undocumented immigrants has created rumors that young people who cross the borders without papers will get a free pass to live in the United States .They were referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program which the Obama administration initiated in 2012 , which allows some people brought without papers as minor children to avoid deportation .Although DACA has indeed helped out some half a million young \" Dreamers \" , the current group of border crossers would not qualify for it .In fact , the current administration has deported immigrants at a rate exceeding any other one in recent history .What has been happening on the political scene explains to some extent why the right wing has been so eager to seize on the child migrant issue .Although the Senate passed an immigration reform bill last year and the movement has heavily lobbied individual Republican members of the House of Representatives , there has been no progress .President Obama promised the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that if the Republicans in the House did not move on immigration reform before the 4th of July recess , he would take executive action to expand the categories of people now covered by DACA .He asked the Secretary of Homeland Security to start a review of the way deportations are being carried out .Subsequently , Obama asked the Secretary to delay this process until the end of the summer , to give the House leadership some more time .Immigrant rights activists are thinking in terms of expanding DACA to cover at least the parents of dreamers , undocumented family members of U.S. citizens , and other specific categories .Meanwhile , another movement has started for deported persons whose families , which include U.S. citizens , have been threatened with death or kidnapping in Mexico to be allowed to return to the United States .While the situation in Central America is especially dire , violence against deported people and their families in Mexico is also rising , because criminals think that ransom for kidnapped people can be extorted from their relatives working in the United States .U.S. authorities have reacted positively in some cases , including that of Elvira Arellano who had spent a year in sanctuary in a Chicago church before being deported to Mexico in 2007 .Arellano 's high profile work with Central American Refugees in Mexico had made her family a target for kidnappers , and she was allowed to return , as have several others .The Obama administration sent Vice President Joe Biden to Guatemala to talk to the presidents of the three countries most affected .The president of Honduras , Juan Orlando Hernandez , who owes his 2013 election to U.S. support , decided it was more important to attend the World Cup games in Brazil , but the other two presidents met with Biden .Biden confined himself to exhorting Central American countries not to let their citizens take the child migrant route , as being \" too dangerous .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.960808"}

{"text": "If U.S. policy was the main reason why there is a sudden surge of UAC , it should also pull UAC from Nicaragua .This suggests that other factors like the high levels of violence and strong family connections are the main reasons why UAC from the Northern Triangle are coming and why Nicaraguan UAC are absent .Nicaragua has a much lower homicide rate than El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala .According to the United Nations , there has been a dramatic increase in murder rates across Central America since 2006 - except in Nicaragua .The increase of human smugglers transporting unauthorized immigrants to the United States is likely a consequence of more effective border enforcement .Although the Obama administration has de - emphasized internal immigration enforcement after 2011 , his administration has ramped up enforcement along the border - focusing on increasing the legal and economic costs imposed on unlawful immigrants apprehended while trying to enter the United States .Since border and internal enforcement are substitutes , the shift in resources and increase in penalties for unlawful crossers does not represent a decrease in total enforcement .Matt Graham from the Bipartisan Policy Center wrote an excellent breakdown of the reprioritization of immigration enforcement , the increase in penalties , and how it has deterred unauthorized immigration .The price of smuggling is an indication of the effectiveness of immigration enforcement along the border .The first effect of increased enforcement is to decrease the supply of human smugglers .As the supply of human smugglers decreases , the price that remaining human smugglers can charge increases .Before border enforcement tightened in the early 1990s , migrants typically paid about $ 725 ( 2014 dollars ) .Currently , unauthorized migrants from Central America are paying around $ 7500 .There are two main issues surrounding the increase in the migration of unaccompanied children ( UAC ) and asylum seekers in recent years that have recently reached crisis proportions .The first is the treatment of those children who are apprehended by Border Patrol and how American policy is reacting to the surge .The second is explaining why UACs are coming .Below I will lay out three different theories that attempt to explain the surge in UACs .Each theory has some merit and I present evidence in support and opposition to each one .First Explanation : Family Reunification .Immigration by stages and family reunification could explain part of the UAC border surge .Stage migration works like this : First , the single breadwinner of the family immigrates to find work in the United States .After getting established , finding employment , and figuring out how to function in his new country , the initial immigrant then sends for the rest of his family .Sometimes the initial immigrant 's spouse will come alone while leaving the children in the care of extended family .Often times , after the second parent is working , they will then have the funds to send for the children to join them in the United States .This pattern of family separation through stage immigration and eventual reunification is a desperate strategy undertaken by poor people who do n't have any other options .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.31395"}

Steve King , far - right radio host Steve Deace and activist Bob Vander Plaats , who helped steer Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum to victory in the state in 2008 and 2012 , respectively , all endorsed Cruz .But there has been little question that Cruz is the Religious Right 's candidate .Cruz is betting that stature in the Religious Right will help him drive up evangelical turnout in the upcoming South Carolina primary and on Super Tuesday , colloquially known as the \" SEC primary \" because it is dominated by Southern states .He has insisted that winning evangelical support in the Republican primary will translate into success in the general election , claiming that Republican nominees have lost the last two contests because the party 's insufficiently conservative nominees failed to motivate the Religious Right base .To inspire that base , the Texas senator is spouting toxic rhetoric about his ideological opponents and hyping purported threats to the religious liberty of American Christians , all while courting endorsements from the Religious Right 's most extreme wing .What 's good for Cruz is bad for our increasingly diverse country .But that is the very reason why Cruz is the candidate who the Religious Right has desperately been seeking : someone who will give them his undivided attention in a country where they are terrified of losing relevance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.43881"}
