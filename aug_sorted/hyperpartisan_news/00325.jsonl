Price Waterhouse ( Supreme Court , 1989 ) which ruled that a woman who was n't ' feminine enough ' was improperly denied promotion .The Hopkins case was crucial in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) finding that laws barring discrimination based on sex , and sex stereotypes , apply to transgender individuals .The above notwithstanding , Brynn Tannehill of SPARTA had this to say : .Laws and regulations that specifically target based on sexual orientation are generally viewed with intermediate scrutiny ( Romer v. Evans , LCR , and Witt ) .Subtle , but crucial legal difference .Also note that sexual orientation and gender identity are two different concepts .Also note that the courts have generally held that it is ok to fire a gay man who acts \" gay \" , but firing a trans woman who acts too feminine is not .This one gets pretty tricky .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.54126"}
