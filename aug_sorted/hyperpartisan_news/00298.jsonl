Bush , the man at the center of it all .The reason , as we said earlier , is that the president is a coward -- a fact for which this dust - up constitutes merely an example .And as we 'll discuss in a post later this evening , President Bush 's moral cowardice -- not his physical cowardice or bravery , of which we know little and which is simply a side issue -- is the essence of this campaign .Mr. Bush 's advisers said they were girding for the most extensive street demonstrations at any political convention since the Democrats nominated Hubert H. Humphrey in Chicago in 1968 .But in contrast to that convention , which was severely undermined by televised displays of street rioting , Republicans said they would seek to turn any disruptions to their advantage , by portraying protests by even independent activists as Democratic - sanctioned displays of disrespect for a sitting president .Indeed , far from it -- if for no other reason than that implied in the article .Namely , that any violence or ugly scenes or anything really will tend to help the president , rather than hurt him .It is probably true that most of the more vitriolic protestors do n't even support Senator Kerry , let alone operate with his or his party 's sanction .And I think I can guarentee you that the Democratic party and the Kerry campaign would vastly prefer that Kerry supporters among the demonstrators keep their heads down and their voices low or simply not show up at all -- again , for the simply reason I noted above .There 's no use in belaboring the point since everyone knows this is true .Yet here we have Nagourney 's sources telling him they plan to make the case for a demonstrably false proposition .Yesterday , you 'll recall , we noted that a guy named Jim Russell had written a letter to the editor of his local paper in Telluride , Colorado , saying he 'd witnessed the Rassman episode and vouched for Kerry 's version of events .It seems he was where he said he was .The Post mentions his account in this story today .And he was on a conference call today arranged by the Kerry campaign .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.60015"}

Bush cast out the GOP traditions of conservative restraint in foreign policy in favor of neoconservative activism .Conservatism in Republican politics is not a static concept defined in the writing of Edmund Burke , or Ayn Rand for that matter , as Paul Ryan 's words suggest .It has been balanced over the years by the exigencies of what it takes to win .Paul Ryan 's protests notwithstanding , Donald Trump 's populist , nativist rhetoric -- as offensive as it may be -- is well within the American political tradition , and his campaign has its antecedents in the traditions of the GOP as well .GOP candidates have thrived over the years through their willingness to say the words necessary to motivate their base -- however offensive to others they might be -- and Trump is no different .The question is what comes next .Now that the GOP top brass -- from Speaker Paul Ryan to GOP Chairman Reince Priebus to its \u00e9minence grise Dick Cheney -- have heaped condemnation on Donald Trump , and many declared him unfit to serve , they have placed themselves between a rock and a hard place .Within hours of the shooting at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs , my friend , a long time reporter with years of covering the Department of Justice received a call from the editors of a major newspaper .They were struggling with how to describe the actions of Robert Lewis Dear : if it turned out the shooter had anti - abortion motives , would that meet the Department of Justice 's definition of domestic terrorism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.64297"}

Wade .John McCain elevated senate tradition over and above the lives of the unborn .This is no small matter , and stands as a big black mark on his Pro - Life credentials .This is n't meant to be a hatchet piece against the Senator from Arizona , but I want my readers to know that what I am about to say about McCain , I say with my eyes wide open .John McCain is by far the lesser of the two evils , and if he is the Republican nominee , I will reluctantly vote for him in November .It is the only responsible choice remaining for evangelicals .As bad as McCain is on the issue of the sanctity of human life , he is light years ahead of either Obama or Hillary .On this point , there can be no confusion .But if you 're like me and you deplore the number of taxpayer - funded abortions performed each year , just wait until they are ALL taxpayer funded .Both Hillary and Obama want to introduce universal health care .It would be easy to institute with Democrats running the White House and Congress .With government funding of health care comes government control , and a Hillary or Obama administration is not who I want exercising the power of the purse over my health care .The Democrat Party is trying to introduce euthanasia through the back door by calling it the \" right to die with dignity .\" Will it only be after \" death with dignity \" is being funded by taxpayer money that we 'll regret not having used our votes to stop the Democrats from taking control of both elected branches of our government ?With a Democrat congress and a Democrat President , we can fully expect the rights , dignity , and lives of unborn and elderly image - bearers to be trampled underfoot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.06861"}

{"text": "The depth of the Republican problem was made evident by polling published since Trump 's most recent pronouncement .Most notable about the CBS News poll was their observation that Trump 's support was 30 % before his comments on Muslim immigration , and jumped to 38 % after the comments .As despicable as many view Trump 's comments , his populist success should not come as a surprise to the Republican establishment .For the past half - century , the GOP has built its electoral success on an uneasy alliance between the GOP establishment -- with roots among the landed aristocracy , Wall Street and Main Street mercantilist classes -- and the predominantly white working class and evangelical wings of the party .This modern Republican coalition was the strategic brainchild of Richard Nixon and Kevin Phillips among others .Determined not to face a third close contest , Nixon and the Republican Party implemented the Southern Strategy to bring long - time Democratic white southern , rural and evangelical voters into the Republican Party .Those voters , alienated largely by the Democratic Party 's embrace of civil rights , became a core GOP constituency .And the strategy was successful .Four years after his narrow win over Humphrey , Nixon demolished George McGovern , winning 49 states and 60.1 % of the popular vote .While McGovern was a particularly weak candidate , Nixon 's 1972 election numbers largely mirrored what 1968 would have been if you added George Wallace 's vote totals to Richard Nixon 's , which would have given Nixon 56.9 % of the popular vote and a 44 state landslide .Against that backdrop , Donald Trump 's success this year should not be particularly surprising .This year 's revolt of less - educated , southern , rural and working class voters against the GOP establishment has been simmering for decades .The Republican Party establishment has long held tight control over its nomination process .As the saying goes , Democrats fall in love , Republicans fall in line .Yet along the way there has been a history of discord .In 1992 and 1996 , Nixon speechwriter and conservative herald Pat Buchanan led his Peasants with Pitchforks uprisings against the establishment candidates , winning 20 - 25 % of the primary vote against the incumbent George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole , respectively .Buchanan 's share of the vote mirrored exactly the share of the GOP electorate represented by the Wallace voters that Nixon brought into the party .The subsequent emergence of the Tea Party movement within the Republican Party demonstrated more than a decade after Buchanan 's last race that the anti - establishment , nativist wing of the GOP was alive and well .Over the past fifty years , the GOP has catered to the socially conservative views of the voters who migrated to the GOP in the wake of the Southern Strategy , but has been largely inimical to their economic interests .Pat Buchanan railed for years that the GOP was serving the interests of Republican corporate and Wall Street elites by supporting free trade and immigration policies that undermined the economic interests of working and middle class Americans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.89517"}

Bush sought to make inroads with the rapidly - growing demographic .But the convention in Florida , a state with a large Hispanic population , did little to formally and significantly address the issue of immigration , for instance .Giving Rubio , a Cuban - American , the chance to introduce Romney was smart in terms of appealing to Latino voters .And there were a number of high - profile Hispanic leaders present .But there was little done to move the needle for Romney with voters he badly needs if he 's to win .Fiscal conservatism is the new conservatism .For a few days ahead of the convention , it seemed like Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin was actually on the presidential ticket .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.98203"}

Salem Idris , the leader of the Supreme Military Council of the Free Syrian Army , according to Mouaz Moustafa with the Washington - based Syrian Emergency Task Force that was involved in planning the trip .He spent about an hour meeting with Free Syrian Amry commanders from various parts of the country including Aleppo , Homs , and Idlib .McCain is the leading voice in Congress for a greater U.S. role in ending Syria 's civil war , which has been waged for more than two years .He has suggested establishing \" safe zones \" for Syria 's rebels and taking out the regime 's air assets , along with providing lethal weapons to Syria 's opposition .In their meeting with McCain , leaders of the Syrian rebel forces pressed the United States to provide them with weapons to continue their fight against Syrian President Bashar al Assad .They also called for establishing no - fly zones and for airstrikes against Assad 's regime , according to the Daily Beast 's report .His visit came shortly before U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was scheduled to meet in Paris regarding Syria with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov .For months during the Syrian war , Russia appeared to be supporting the country 's president , Bashar al - Assad .But that tide seems to be turning , at least gaining some wiggle room for the Russians to help broker an end to the violence .Moustafa of the Syrian Emergency Task Force called McCain 's visit \" an incredibly important trip and trips like this need to happen more frequently .It was very important because one of the biggest arguments against supporting the opposition is not knowing who they are .So being able to sit face - to face with these commanders brings a much higher level of confidence in who they are , \" he said .The U.N. estimates that more than 70,000 Syrians have been killed since anti - government protests in March 2011 led to a fierce government crackdown , an armed uprising and a bloody civil war .The war has uprooted a quarter of the country 's 22 million civilians .Republicans and Democrats alike have called on President Barack Obama to ramp up support for Syrian rebels , who now receive nonlethal aid like food and medicine from the United States .In early April that aid was stepped up to include equipment such as body armor , night vision goggles and other military equipment that is considered defensive in nature .Long an advocate of a more pronounced American effort in Syria , McCain has previously visited camps in Jordan that have harbored massive waves of Syrian refugees .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.59566"}
