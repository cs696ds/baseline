Rand Paul , R - Ky . , suggested Sunday that Democrat 's do n't have the moral high ground when it comes to women 's issues because of former President Bill Clinton 's \" predatory \" behavior toward then - intern Monica Lewinsky .\" One of the workplace laws and rules that I think are good is that bosses should n't prey on young interns in their office .And I think really the media seems to have given President Clinton a pass on this , \" Paul said on NBC 's \" Meet the Press \" Sunday . \"He took advantage of a girl that was 20 years old and an intern in his office .There is no excuse for that . \"Though Paul said that Hillary Clinton should n't be judged for her husband 's behavior , he added , \" it 's hard to separate one from the other .But I would say that with regard to his place in history , that it certainly is a discussion and I think in my state , you know , people tend to sort of frown upon that . \"Mike Huckabee only talked about \" female libidos \" ( and got grossly misquoted for it ) .Bill Clinton actually did something about it .Why bring this up now ?Sometimes , there 's no defense like a good offense .To prove this , Gregory 's next guest - Paul 's colleague Dick Durbin - tried to scold Paul for attacking Hillary Clinton through Bill : . \" For goodness sakes , let 's judge Hillary Clinton based on her talents and her vision of America should she choose to run for president , \" Durbin said .Yes , let 's judge Hillary on her talents and vision .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.79219"}

Jackson Reviewed by Michael J. New .Ever since the 1992 election , books about President Clinton have become a virtual cottage industry in conservative circles .With titles like High Crimes and Misdemeanors , Slick Willie , and Legacy , conservative writers have made the case for President Clinton 's impeachment , thoroughly researched his background , and critiqued his eight - year presidency .Indeed , many would conclude that there would be scarcely enough room on the shelf for another title about President Clinton .However , with the paperback version of President Clinton 's memoirs now in the bookstores , World Ahead Publishing has recently released a needed corrective : Their Lives : The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine by Candice E. Jackson .Billed as the stories that Bill Clinton left out of My Life , Jackson uncovers the trail of bribes , threats , and intimidation that Clinton 's inner circled leveled at the women who got in their way .While other authors have researched President Clinton 's scandals and marital indiscretions , Jackson offers the reader considerably more than another litany of allegations .Most coverage of scandals involving President Clinton has dealt with their political ramifications .However , Jackson looks beyond the politics to put a human face on the pattern of threats and intimidation Clinton and Clinton doled out .Jackson secures interviews with both Kathleen Wiley and Juanita Broadrick and details how the lives of many of these women continue to be adversely affected by their involvement with President Clinton , even years after their story faded from the national spotlight .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.61417"}

{"text": "Indeed , Their Lives features chapters devoted to the often painful stories of President Clinton 's most well known accusers including Elizabeth Ward Gracen , Sally Purdue , Gennifer Flowers , Paula Jones , Kathleen Willey , Monica Lewinsky , and Juanita Broadrick .The fact that the reader gets to hear these seven stories in succession is very powerful and lends a great deal of insight into President Clinton 's boorish behavior .Furthermore , nearly all of these women faced intimidation after they went public with their stories .Paula Jones , Elizabeth Ward Gracen , and Juanita Broadrrick all received unexpected IRS audits .Clinton supporters assembled an attack team to smear Kathleen Willey , a grief stricken widow , after the media covered her story .Both Willey and Gracen had to deal with stalkers .In fact , while jogging , Willey was threatened by a man who knew the names of her cat and her children .He instructed her to lie during her upcoming deposition in the Paula Jones case .Furthermore , almost none of the women profited financially from their short - lived fame .In fact , because of their legal fees , many of the women profiled in the book face financial struggles to this day .Taken individually , some of these stories could appear to be very serious , but isolated , lapses in judgment .However , by presenting these stories in succession , Jackson clearly demonstrates what a reckless , promiscuous , ruthless , self - interested figure Bill Clinton really is .Indeed , if the general public had heard all the details of all of these scandals at the same time , it seems highly unlikely that President Clinton would have been elected in 1992 , nor re - elected in 1996 .Jackson , however , does considerably more than just relate stories .At the end of every chapter , Jackson uses the experience of each woman to describe how a particular tenet of modern liberalism can either breed or remain tolerant of misogyny .Conservatives spilled considerable amounts of ink during the late 1990s sharply chastising feminist groups for their near dogmatic support of President Clinton .However , Jackson shows that support for Clinton was consistent with the liberal worldview of many of these groups .For instance , Jackson argues that in modern liberalism , political goals justify any political means to achieve them .As such , liberal feminists supported President Clinton since he would help them achieve their political goals , including easy access to abortion .Similarly , Jackson argues that modern liberalism believes that the validity of the message is determined by the motives of the messenger .Consequently , claiming that Clinton 's accusers are motivated by money or ideology is enough to discredit them , regardless of the accuracy of their story .Jackson will not be so easily pigeonholed , as she describes herself as a libertarian feminist and admits she is intrigued by the idea of electing a woman president .The stories that Jackson relates and her political commentary mesh nicely in the final chapter in the book , which deals with Hillary Rodham Clinton .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.60958"}

Teele Jr. Already under indictment on numerous corruption charges , Teele was facing further humiliation from the imminent publication of an article in The Miami New Times that alleged dealings with drug dealers , crooked contractors and transvestite prostitutes .DeFede was worried about Teele ; his friend sounded on the verge of cracking up .So he quietly hit the record button on his tape recorder .There should be a record of this conversation , he thought .They talked for 25 minutes .A little later , Teele called again .Moments after this second call , he shot himself to death in The Herald 's lobby .Hours later , DeFede was out of work .Herald Executive Editor Tom Fiedler and Publisher Jes\u00fas D\u00edaz Jr. say they fired DeFede because it is a violation of Florida law -- and journalistic ethics -- to tape a phone conversation without the consent of both parties .The argument is not convincing .It is unclear whether DeFede actually did break the law -- I 've seen conflicting assessments -- though if he did , it 's probably a misdemeanor at best .But the law is not the point .New York Times reporter Judith Miller has run afoul of the law -- she 's in jail for contempt of court after refusing to identify an anonymous source -- and many journalists regard her as a hero .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.04976"}

{"text": "Your friend is devastated .She feels there is a lot of evidence pointing to the rapist 's guilt .What can you do for your friend ?FACT :Although police handling of rape cases is improving , it is still generally inexcusably poor .Way too many police remain ignorant about how to handle and investigate rape cases , and way too many just plain do n't like rape cases , so they try to get rid of these cases , often by letting the case run dormant and cold .But there are many unique investigative techniques that make acquaintance rape cases often very simple to solve , such as pretext phone calls , close examination of the suspect 's pre - rape behavior , of the victim 's post - rape behavior , her post - rape conversations with others , and much more .WHAT TO DO : .a. Tell your friend it 's nowhere near time to lose hope .Tell her it sounds to you as if this detective is just trying to dump the case .The fact that the detective did n't call her for four weeks is suspicious to begin with .So is the fact that he referred to the case as a \" he said , she said , \" which is true of virtually all crimes .After all , the suspect usually says the opposite of the victim no matter what the crime .That the detective did n't send the case to the District Attorney 's office to make the final decision on prosecution is also suspicious .And perhaps most alarming of all is the detective 's cruel statement to the victim that the suspect \" seemed like a nice guy .\" That 's the kind of statement that reveals a detective 's attitude toward rape cases , and by itself is a strong indication the detective is dumping the case .b. Tell your friend there are a number of things you and she can do to get the case handled properly .The two of you can arrange a meeting with the head of the sex crimes unit .Or you can write a letter outlining your concerns , what the detective said , and give your reasons why you think the case can be solved .You can send the letter to the chief of police and a copy to the mayor .Or you can call a victim advocate and ask her to help you be heard , or you can call a trusted police officer in another department and ask him or her for advice .c. If your friend is nervous about doing these things , remind her that she has every right to a full and competent investigation of the rape .It 's just that sometimes women have to fight very hard for justice .You 've been helping your friend get out of a violent marriage .She got the police to arrest him , she testified against him , she got a restraining order and she got custody of the children .And even with all this going on , she got a new job , too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.52319"}

{"text": "- The Maddow Blog .Apparently , only some women are worthy of protection against violence .The Violence Against Women Act had been reauthorized without significant challenge in 2000 and 2005 , but because the new version of the bill would extend protection to 30 million more women , House Republican leadership did not reauthorize the bill in 2012 .Essentially , in these politicians ' eyes some women are unworthy of the bill 's protection - specifically Native Americans , immigrants , and LGBT women who would have been included under the new bill .Native American women are twice as likely as other demographics in the U.S. to be sexually assaulted , according to the Justice Department .One in three Native American women will be raped in their lifetime .About ten percent of hate crimes against gay men and lesbians include sexual assault .The Human Rights Watch found that at least 50 % of the agricultural work force is undocumented immigrants , who can not come forward about sexual assault because of fear of deportation .In Jessica Valenti 's 2009 book The Purity Myth , she observed that , \" The rates of sexualized violence against women of color in the United States are far higher than those regarding white women .Why are the women who are most in need of support the women House Republicans are least willing to protect ?Valenti argues that \" it 's not possible to prove that these increased rates of violence in particular communities are a direct result of society 's positioning women of color as impure .But a society that portrays them as such absolutely contributes to a culture of violence against them - women who transgress purity norms are punished , and women of color transgress simply by not being white . \"Similarly , in consideration of which women House Republicans opposed protecting , LGBT women transgress simply by not following the heterosexual purity guidelines .We have seen other politicians punish women for transgressing these purity norms recently with the constant redefinitions of rape .From Todd Akin 's now infamous \" legitimate rape \" qualification to Roger Rivard 's \" some girls rape easy , \" it is clear that these Republicans only believe a certain type of women can be raped - women who meet their preconceived idea of purity .And while these men lost the election , the House Republican leadership is perpetuating the same beliefs that only certain women - chaste , white women - are worthy of protection .You do n't have to look far to see these beliefs reflected and reinforced by popular media .Native American culture is constantly overtly simplified and sexualized .Native American women suffer from these sexual appropriations of Native American culture , and they 're not the only ones .This sexualization is rampant in the media concerning all minorities - the same minorities , incidentally , that the House does n't want to protect from violence .Because such portrayals sexualize these demographics , these women lose the protection of \" purity \" - they lose the respect of men who believe women 's worth lies in their sexuality .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.629776"}

Kanin , in over 40 percent of the cases reviewed , the complainants eventually admitted that no rape had occurred ( Archives of Sexual Behavior , Vol .23 , No . 1 , 1994 ) .Kanin also studied rape allegations in two large Midwestern universities and found that 50 percent of the allegations were recanted by the accuser .Kanin found that most of the false accusers were motivated by a need for an alibi or a desire for revenge .A link would'v been helpful .and why does the 40 % contradict the FBIs figures ?In 1985 the Air Force conducted a study of 556 rape accusations .Over one quarter of the accusers admitted , either just before they took a lie detector test of after they had failed it , that no rape occurred .A further investigation by independent reviewers found that 60 percent of the original rape allegations were false .The most common reasons the women gave for falsely accusing rape were \" spite or revenge , \" and to compensate for feelings of guilt or shame .The air force in 1985 .[ incidently a time when making a rape complaint meant that the woman would be crucified for daring to speak out ] would be doing studies on their own not on average citizens .The armed forces are also notorious for ' hazings ' and coverups .they have a public image to maintain .I 'm wondering .why are n't their stats reflective of the FBI stats ?Another thing .they handle complaints ' in house ' .independent investigations ' [ very vague ] do n't have as much objectivity as criminal investigations so I doubt they 'd be objective .I 'm also wondering .why would female soldiers [ /pilots ] risk their careers etc for vengence when female soldiers are n't suppose to have relationships with their comrades ?Please post sources that are actually relevent to main populations [ ex .FBI].A Washington Post investigation of rape reports in seven Virginia and Maryland counties in 1990 and 1991 found that nearly one in four were unfounded .When contacted by the Post , many of the alleged victims admitted that they had lied .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.75762"}
{"text": "Let 's take a highly condensed look back at identity - based attacks on Republicans by Democrats .Over many years , Democrats found success defining the GOP as the party of racial insensitivity , with lots of assists from characters like Trent Lott and George Allen .There was a time , back in the 1990s , when the most typical Republican response would be to inveigh against political correctness and race - baiting .Figures on the right would accuse Democrats of cynically using race as a cudgel , and lament the immorality of making frivolous accusations of racism .Some in the GOP still make those complaints .But gradually , Republicans realized that the American people were never going to reject charges of racial insensitivity as a category .So they began to take a different approach : They tried to make the case that Democrats are \" the real racists . \"Affirmative action became \" reverse racism .\"Clarence Thomas accused Democratic Senators of a high - tech lynching .The Wall Street Journal editorial page complained that Democrats blocked Miguel Estrada 's judicial nomination because they felt threatened by a Hispanic conservative .Some Republicans began referring to the Democratic Party as a \" plantation .\" In time , Rush Limbaugh was making more frivolous accusations of racism than anyone in America .Neither party is always right on race .I judge these controversies discretely , on their individual merits .I 've seen plenty of GOP racism , as well as Democrats cynically using race as a cudgel ; I 've seen Republicans justly accuse Democrats of racism , and I 've seen Republicans make absurd , frivolous charges of racism too .The \" Democrats are the real racists \" line has always been more cathartic than effective for the right .The GOP 's use of the charge against Obama has been particularly absurd and doomed .Racially unifying rhetoric and a nuanced grasp of race in America are two of the things Obama does best , and when the right attacked , for example , his Trayvon Martin remarks , they seemed like they were feigning umbrage .Besides , attacking the first black president , who by the way is half white , for being \" the real racist \" was obviously going to be a hopeless task .But even that did n't stop the GOP from trying .Republicans feel unfairly attacked on race .And the urge to turn the attack around on Democrats is too much to resist .Republicans feel similarly about the \" War on Women \" attacks : that they 're being unfairly , cyncically labeled as retrograde misogynists by malign Democratic operatives .( Suffice it to say that , as in all broad - brush efforts to label one 's partisan opponents in America , some of the attacks hit the mark and others are unfair . )Republicans were unprepared for the \" War on Women \" attacks in 2012 .In advance of 2016 , the GOP is coaching its candidates to avoid gaffes on rape and reproductive rights ; and presidential aspirants are pondering how to inoculate themselves against the charge that all will face , true or not : that they 're anti - woman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.784065"}

{"text": "Every other criminal act is assigned a sentence , in part , to deter others from committing that act based on the seriousness of the act .The more serious the crime , greater the need for deterrence , and the greater the sentence .( There are , of course , other purposes for sentencing as well , but deterrence is an important one . )Underlying the claim that increasing sentencing will hurt innocent men seems to be an unstated belief that deterrence simply does not work .That belief , of course , bucks centuries of collective wisdom .False rape accusers lie because they can , and because they believe they have some need to do so .If we convince them they ca n't lie -- at least not without serious consequences -- it is likely we 'll see a significant decrease in false rape claims .In addition , it is a matter of simple justice that false rape claimants deserve to be punished in a manner consistent with the serious harm they cause .At present , that is n't happening .This is among the more important posts we 've done here , because it goes to the crux of the false rape problem .Perhaps the single most glaring reason false rape accusations are not deterred is that making a false rape report is not treated in our criminal statutes as a serious crime .Our criminal laws are supposed to be statutory articulations of how seriously society disapproves of various forms of misconduct .A good indicator of how much society disapproves of a particular crime is the maximum allowable sentence for its commission .The maximum sentence for rape , for example , is typically second in number of years only to murder .In contrast , the statutory laws that punish false rape claims are proverbial slaps on the wrists .The maximum sentences often allow just six months to two years , depending on the jurisdiction .In addition , our criminal statutes often do not treat false reporting of rape any more seriously than false reporting of other crimes .It has become obvious to many people in recent years that false reporting of rape is a special problem in need of special attention .The brilliant legal scholar Professor Alan Dershowitz said : \" Rape is such a serious crime that deliberately bringing a false accusation of rape should be an equally serious crime and women are not being punished for those crimes .I believe that being falsely accused of rape is as traumatic as being raped .Exactly how did we reach this point ?Until relatively recently our criminal laws typically required some form of corroborative evidence to prove rape .In days gone by , the lone accusation of a woman or a girl was not enough to charge or convict for rape .Starting in the 1970s , rape laws underwent sweeping reforms to make it easier to convict men and boys .The requirement of corroboration was among the first casualties of the old laws .Feminist legal scholars provided the intellectual firepower to justify the changes in the law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.7629"}

{"text": "FACT : 1 .Threats to kill are a crime , and they should be taken very seriously , especially when the threat contains specific details about how it will be carried out .It is most crucial in domestic violence , rape , and child abuse cases that all interviews with non - English speaking victims be done by fully bilingual officers or by professional translators .Most all police departments have 24 hour access by telephone to banks of professional interpreters .There 's no excuse for officers ' not using these services to assure full and accurate victim statements .WHAT TO DO : .a. Remind your friend that she has a Constitutional right to equal protection of the law , even though she does n't speak English , and even though she may not be in the country with proper documents .Go down to the police station with your friend .Tell the front desk the story of what happened with your friend the night before .Tell them you are concerned that the officer did n't understand the seriousness of the situation because of language problems .Tell them you want either a fully bilingual officer or a professional translator to talk with your friend so that police will have an accurate victim statement .And so that the case can get handled properly , including having the guns and the perpetrator removed from the home .b. Also , have your friend write out a full statement of what happened .Naturally she should write it in Spanish .Make two or three photocopies of that statement .Have your friend keep at least one copy for herself .Give the original to the police .Ask the police to enter that statement into the criminal case file .Your friend should also get a domestic violence restraining order against her husband .And if the husband is n't in custody , your friend should stay in a shelter or other safe place .c. Suggest to your friend that she file a formal complaint against the officer for failing to treat her case competently and seriously .For a couple of years now you 've tried to convince your friend to get out of a violent relationship and sometimes it seems like she tries .You notice that things have gotten much more serious over the last month .You 've seen a lot more bruises .She 's told you he 's been playing with his guns and making threats to hunt her down if she tries to leave .She says that the last couple days he 's been constantly waking her up in the middle of the night to rant and order her around , and during the day he wo n't leave the house .Today she calls you and says that last night things were so bad she tried to leave .But he grabbed her before she could get out the door , threw her in their room and raped her brutally .He said he would never let her go , and threatened that if she dared call the police he was going to kill her for sure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.67307"}

Have your friend gather her rental agreement , the legal notice that came in the mail , and a notebook .Find out as much as you can about her legal rights and options .Start by calling your regional office of Fair Housing and other housing agencies .Even if your friend does n't have a legal right to stay in the apartment , there are usually a number of steps she can take to delay the eviction process a number of months .b.

The best way to handle this all too common situation of police and prosecutors attempting to isolate victims from their support persons is to plan your strategy ahead of time .Before going with your friend to an interview or meeting with officials , tell her what might likely happen .Tell her you think it 's important for you to be with her in the interview in order to minimize any attempts by the officials to play games with her case .If she agrees that she really wants you present at the interview , tell her she may have to state this firmly and clearly to the official .In fact , she may have to get right down to telling the official that she wo n't do the interview unless you , her friend , can be present .Some police , prosecutors , and other criminal justice officials can be very bullying and intimidating at times like this .It 's very hard to stand up to them when they start throwing their weight around and telling you things you 're not quite sure are true or untrue .And though many officials are caring and professional , you just never know when you 're going to encounter an abusive one .So be prepared with a plan and stick together .Remember , your friend 's safety and access to justice depend more than anything else , on a good criminal justice response .b. If the officer still wo n't do the interview with you present , your friend should tell the officer that she wants to cooperate and do the interview , but she first wants to talk to an advocate or another official .c. If at any point your friend feels like she does n't want to struggle the point further , it 's important that you abide by your friend 's decision .If she does do the interview by herself , it may very well be that just by having made the officer aware that the two of you are willing to put up a fight , that will be enough to discourage the officer from further abusiveness .d. Whether or not you are present in the interview , a couple other points of advice will help prevent abuse by officials during interviews and meetings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.57296"}

{"text": "Yet taxes were glossed over in the debate of Republican candidates last week .Donald Trump says that his tax plan , which has huge reductions in rates and on the amount paid on investment income , focuses on working folks and sticking it to billionaires such as himself .A recent analysis by the Tax Policy Center showed just the opposite .The Trump plan would cost the Treasury $ 9.5 trillion over the first decade , and almost $ 25 trillion over 20 years .The tax cuts would principally benefit the wealthy , almost 40 percent would be for the top 1 percent .The superrich - the top one - tenth of 1 percent - would get an average annual tax cut of $ 1.3 million .By comparison , the lowest , or poorest quintile , would get an average tax cut of $ 130 , or 1/1000 th of what the wealthiest receive .In percentage terms , the top 1 percent gets a 7 percent cut , the poorest taxpayers a 1 percent reduction . )The center also analyzed Jeb Bush 's proposal , which would cost less : $ 6.8 trillion in a decade .The distributional effects would be almost the same , the center found , with upper - income taxpayers receiving much of the benefit .The wealthiest 1 percent would get an average annual tax deduction of $ 167,325 .The center plans to examine the plans of Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz next week .Although some of the specific proposals are different , the bottom lines are expected to be similar .Both the Bush and Trump tax plans would \" improve incentives to work , save , and invest , \" the center stated , while noting that these gains could be partly offset by increases in the national debt .Also , while both these Republican plans would remove any limits on exemptions for charitable contributions , the Tax Policy Center projected that the steep reduction in rates would reduce the incentive to give to charities .Conservatives complain that the center is associated with the left - leaning Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute .But the analysts include Republicans , and the team reached out to the campaigns and Republican economists for input .The conservative Tax Foundation , while projecting smaller revenue losses , concurs that the distribution of the cuts heavily tilts to the wealthy .The center has also said that the liberal Democrat Bernie Sanders significantly exaggerates the revenue that would be brought in by his financial transaction tax .The Vermont senator has n't produced a comprehensive tax plan that would pay for the enormous expansions of social programs he proposes : universal health care coverage , free tuition at public institutions and huge infrastructure projects .He advocates further tax increases on the wealthy , but some hikes for the middle class seem inevitable under his plan .Hillary Clinton , seeking to stem a surge by Sanders in the Democratic nomination race , rushed out a proposal last week that would impose a levy on annual income of more than $ 5 million .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.8866"}

{"text": "It was during this era that the two percent canard ( i.e. , only two percent of all rape claims are false ) was invented out of whole cloth .Due to these changes in the law , fueled by dishonest statistics , it is now possible to charge and to convict men and boys of rape solely on the say - so of lone accuser .Men and boys , for the first time , face the spectre of having their lives destroyed if a false accuser is a good enough actress .As but one recent example , because it is not necessary to have corroboration , it was possible to arrest and charge four innocent men at Hofstra University based on the say - so of one \" troubled \" young woman .When the laws requiring corroboration were repealed , the power of a lone accuser was greatly enhanced .She could send her rapist to prison for many years .The trouble was , she could also send an innocent man or boy to prison for many years .Because of the political climate , it was verboten to discuss the possibility that the rape accuser might misuse her newly enhanced power , or to suggest that the misuse of this power should have serious consequences .Such sentiments were contrary to the culturally accepted myth that women do n't lie about rape .In short , society handed theoretically every female in America the power to destroy theoretically any male above a certain age , but it did n't bother to change the laws to penalize the misuse of that power .We are still stuck with the old false reporting statutes that were in place back before the need for corroboration was eliminated from our rape laws .Political correctness be damned , women do lie about rape , and frequently .The fact that we have given females the power to destroy men and boys means that we need to hold them accountable for misusing that power .As Professor Dershowitz said , they are not being held accountable at present .We need to amend our criminal statutes to impose greater penalties for false reporting of rape and sexual assault .Only then will false accusers be deterred .Only then will they be punished justly .And only then will we treat the victimization of our sons with the seriousness that we treat the victimization of our daughters .The group International Christian Concern ( ICC ) said 18-year - old Safian Masih , who lives in a mixed neighborhood of both Christians and Muslims , is held in a prison of the city of Gujranwala , in Pakistan 's Punjab province . \"His family has fled their home because they fear for their safety \" after a mob \" also threatened to kill anyone who helped Safian or his family , \" ICC added .ICC linked the imprisonment to an incident August 8 when the young daughter of one of his Muslim neighbors demanded that Safian bring her items from the grocery store .When Safian refused she reportedly slapped him , and the young man apparently slapped her back , escalating the argument to include both families .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.82593"}

{"text": "The study was commissioned by the feds to gain information about the existence and strength of bullying laws and policies in schools districts in all 50 states .The results of the study are decidedly mixed .While most states and school districts today have some form of anti - bullying measures , some do n't go far enough - or carry much weight when it comes to enforcement or punishment .\" Every state should have effective bullying prevention efforts in place to protect children inside and outside of school , \" said Secretary of Education Arne Duncan , in a statement issued Dec. 6 when the study was released .\" This report reveals that while most states have enacted legislation around this important issue , a great deal of work remains to ensure adults are doing everything possible to keep our kids safe .\" Called the Analysis of State Bullying Laws and Policies , the 200 + page pdf of the report is available here for those who 'd like to tackle the government tome .The defining moment for the beginning of state bullying legislation and school district policy on bullying began right after the horrific shootings at Columbine High School in 1999 .In fact , due to the events at Columbine - and in relation to a local bullying - related suicide - the state of Georgia became the first state to pass legislation requiring schools to implement bullying prevention programs .From there , the following breakdown shows how others states have responded with their own policies , according to the study : .From 1999 to 2010 : More than 120 bills enacted by state legislatures either introduced or amended education or criminal statutes to address bullying and related behaviors in schools .In 2010 : 21 new bills were passed .In 2011 : 8 additional bills were passed as of April 30 , 2011 .From 2006 to 2010 : 35 states enacted new laws regarding cyber bullying .It 's also worth noting that as of April 2011 , Texas was the only state without any requirement for schools to create bullying or harassment policies .That changed in June 2011 , when Gov. Rick Perry signed legislation requiring Texas public school districts to create and adopt formal bullying policies .Key Findings of the Study : What 's Up With Bullying Laws in States ?46 states have some type of bullying laws - but three of those states prohibit bullying without actually defining the behavior that 's prohibited .36 states prohibit cyber bullying .13 states specify that schools have jurisdiction over off - campus behavior if it creates a hostile school environment .States with the most expansive anti - bullying legislation have school districts with the most expansive anti - bullying policies .However , there were some school districts located in states with less expansive laws that expanded their policies beyond the state 's minimum legal expectations .School Violence and Student Safety .The Department of Education 's study noted that the most recent survey on school violence and student safety is one conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics ( NCES ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.27893"}

{"text": "This year Easter falls on April 5 .The time between Epiphany and Mardi Gras is commonly referred to as Carnival , during which parades take place in Catholic strongholds like Brazil , Venice , Uruguay , Trinidad and Tobago , and New Orleans .Like many Catholic holidays , Mardi Gras bears resemblances to ancient pagan rituals , particularly Saturnalia and Lupercalia .The former honored the god Saturn , an agricultural deity , and was marked by gift - giving , revelry and gambling .The latter was conducted in mid - February to honor Faunus , the god of fertility , which involved feasting , drinking and debauched behavior .When Rome was Christianized , the Catholic Church adapted popular pagan holidays into the new faith .Mardi Gras season became a time to celebrate before the 40 days of Lent marked by prayer , repentance and atonement .As Christianity spread throughout Europe and the New World , so did Mardi Gras traditions .The pre - Lenten festivals continue to be marked by drinking , dancing and feasting on fatty foods containing meat , eggs , milk and cheese - ingredients that are restricted during Lent .Shrove Tuesday falls on the same day as Fat Tuesday .It is the day before Ash Wednesday when Christians are reminded they will soon enter a season of penance .\" Shrove \" comes from the word \" shrive , \" which means to confess .In the Middle Ages , Catholics began marking Shrove Tuesday as a time to confess their sins before Lent .After about five months of working at Davison Home Bakery , she 's preparing for the biggest day of the year : Fat Tuesday .\" They tell me it 's going to be pretty insane , \" she said , standing in the bakery the morning of Monday , Feb. 16 , wearing a white baker 's apron .Fat Tuesday is the day before the Christian tradition of Lent , when practitioners give up something for 40 days and 40 nights .Sweets are a common thing to give up , and for many , Fat Tuesday is one last chance to splurge .And the favorite way to splurge on Fat Tuesday ?Paczki .Paczki are like doughnuts , if you 're the kind of person who thinks there just are n't enough calories in cream- or jelly - filled doughnuts as it is .Diane Henson , a baker at Davison Home Bakery , has been making paczki since 1972 .The morning of Feb. 16 , she and baker Mitch French had already made 200 dozen , having been there since 9 p.m. the night before .They plan on having 600 dozen baked by the time Fat Tuesday rolls around .She said to make paczki , they use their doughnut batter but add more sugar , butter , and eggs .Of course the biggest celebration of Mardi Gras is in New Orleans .Here 's a schedule of activities for today that includes links to watch video of the parade .I 'm sure Dakinikat can also fill us in on what 's happening down there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "134.46608"}
