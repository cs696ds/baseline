{"text": "The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) was created in 1908 , thanks to the vision of President Theodore Roosevelt and Attorney General Charles Bonaparte .At the time , the Attorney General ( AG ) lacked manpower to conduct investigations , relying mostly on the Secret Service when situations called for the AG 's office to handle an important law enforcement matter .Roosevelt agreed that the situation required changes and gave his blessing to Bonaparte to appoint a force of Special Agents within the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) .The first Special Agents consisted of ten former Secret Service employees and a number of DOJ investigators .On July 26 , 1908 , Bonaparte ordered them to report to Chief Examiner Stanley W. Finch , which is considered the official beginning of the FBI .By the following year , as Bonaparte and President Roosevelt were heading out of office , the AG recommended that the force of 34 agents become a permanent part of DOJ .The new Attorney General , George Wickersham , named the force the Bureau of Investigation on March 16 , 1909 .At that time , the title of chief examiner was changed to chief of the Bureau of Investigation .The first major expansion for the new bureau came in June 1910 when the Mann Act was passed , making it a crime to transport women over state lines for prostitution .It also gave federal investigators a new means for pursuing criminals who evaded state laws but had no other federal violations .Finch became Commissioner of White Slavery Act violations in 1912 and former Special Examiner A. Bruce Bielaski became the new Bureau of Investigation chief .Over the next few years , the number of Special Agents grew to more than 300 , and these individuals were complemented by another 300 Support Employees .Field offices existed from the bureau 's inception .Each field operation was controlled by a Special Agent in Charge who reported to bureau headquarters in Washington , DC .Most field offices were located in major cities .However , several were located near the Mexican border where they concentrated on smuggling , neutrality violations and intelligence collection ( regarding the Mexican revolution ) .When the US entered World War I , the bureau 's responsibilities grew to include activities involving espionage , Selective Service and acts of sabotage .Bureau agents also assisted the Department of Labor by investigating enemy aliens .As part of this work , a young man named Herbert Hoover was hired to work for the Justice Department .A graduate of George Washington University 's law school , Hoover , in his mid - twenties , helped lead DOJ 's enemy alien operations during World War I and , in the General Intelligence Division under Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer , assisted with investigating suspected anarchists and communists .In 1919 , William J. Flynn , former head of the Secret Service , became Director of the Bureau of Investigation and was the first to use that title .Flynn would serve five years as director .During that time , Washington was awash in political scandals emanating from the administration of Warren G. Harding , including the infamous Teapot Dome scandal which destroyed the president 's reputation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.1478"}

Traxler Jr. , writing for the majority , found that the Maryland law \" significantly burdens the exercise of the right to arm oneself at home \" and should have been analyzed using a more stringent legal standard .[ ... ] .The Maryland law was challenged by a group of gun - store owners and individuals who said the prohibited firearms are not military weapons and are used for lawful purposes such as self - defense , target practice and hunting .Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh ( D ) , who helped pass the law as a state senator , said Thursday that the court majority got it wrong .\" I think it 's just common sense that the Second Amendment does not give people a right to own military - style assault weapons , \" he said .In a strongly worded dissent , Judge Robert B. King wrote : \" Let 's be real : The assault weapons banned by Maryland 's [ law ] are exceptionally lethal weapons of war \" and as such , he said , not necessarily protected by the Second Amendment .Bob Owens noted that this could impact the legality of assault weapons bans from other anti - gun states as well .The National Shooting Sports Foundation voiced their support in a statement released yesterday : .\" We are greatly heartened by the Fourth Circuit panel 's ruling today , \" said Lawrence G. Keane , Senior Vice President and General Counsel , National Shooting Sports Foundation ( NSSF ) , one of the lead plaintiffs in this case . \" As this important case goes forward , NSSF will continue to work with our co - plaintiffs to ensure that our citizens ' Second Amendment rights are protected and that the lawful commerce in firearms is restored in support of this constitutional protection . \"Liberals keep twisting themselves into pretzels over these so - called assault weapons , which are a figment of the liberal imagination .It looks scary - that 's their argument .An AR-15 rifle has the same operating system as a handgun .They 're both semi - automatics , meaning they self - reload upon discharging a round .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.17929"}
