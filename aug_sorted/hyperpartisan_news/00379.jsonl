Mahony .Cardinal Mahony is the fourth and recently retired Archbishop of Los Angeles .Born in Hollywood , he is the first native Angeleno to be created Cardinal .CIVIC INVOLVEMENT : Cardinal Mahony has served on a number of committees of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops , including those on Pro - Life Activities , and Migration & Refugees .He is a member of the Board of Trustees of The Catholic University of America .You are here .Scripture and History Remind UsThat We Are All Immigrants .Nearly five years ago my friends , Hector and Gabby and their five kids , entered the U.S. legally from Mexico in order to join the pastoral staff at my church , Willow Creek .They have built a vibrant ministry with Spanish speaking members of Willow .One of their challenges is to discern the best way to serve the hundreds of undocumented immigrants in our congregation .These are wonderful people working hard to provide a better life for their families , but often living in fear on the margins of society .What does it mean to serve them as Jesus would ?We have concluded that part of serving them is to advocate for Comprehensive Immigration Reform .The complexity of the immigration situation in the U.S. is unfolding \" up close and personal \" for us , as Hector and Gabby join the ranks of the uncertain , their visa renewal having been inexplicably denied and their appeal pending .Following are excerpts from a statement submitted by Lynne and her husband Bill to the Senate Hearing on Immigration Reform .Click here to read the full testimony .In this capacity , we are continually confronted with immigration , not necessarily as a policy issue but as a personal issue in which we witness the human consequences of a broken immigration system every day .Our faith informs us that we were all strangers and aliens once , separated from God .Because God was willing to include us in his redemptive plan , we \" are no longer strangers and aliens , but [ we ] are fellow citizens \" ( Ephesians 2:18 - 19a ) .As Christians , we accept the biblical perspective that we are all sojourners on this earth , commanded to steward it while we await the full arrival of God 's eternal kingdom .Recognizing that we are all sojourners on this land , no matter what our legal status , compels us to extend solidarity to all .This deep sense of solidarity with others is a foundational truth of our country .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.13621"}
