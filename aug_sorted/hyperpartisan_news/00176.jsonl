{"text": "The fact that people tend to seem to feel regret and loss when leaving TNG suggests that the transition from TNG to the wider BDSM community is difficult in Boston as well , for whatever reason .Certainly right now , TNG and the people I have met there are the ones I connect the best with - but this may be simply because of generational differences of the sort that pepomint talks about in this article .( ie , in 10 years , when I become 40 , will I start feeling like TNG is no longer good for finding like - minded friends ? )I think part of the answer to this is that communities tend to age .People who found like - minded folk in a community ( whether it is a particular convention like Arisia or a particular group like bdsm ) tend to continue to go back to the group / con year after year as it becomes habit .Communities centered around events and such , I think , do not tend to propagate to younger people without active effort on the organizers ' parts .At least , that 's my theory .So I bet if you look at a particular con , or groups that are not specifically age - limited , you will find a large group of people who are all clustered around the same age .This could be 18 - 25 ( for something like , say , Anime Boston ) or 50 + ( which I hear something like Boskone is ) .This means that as communities age , splinter communities start forming to address younger people with the same interests that are n't finding people their age in the original community .TNG is specifically set up to propagate to younger people , since people \" age out \" , but due to the community aspect I think this means that it tends to skew upwards in age .I think TNG groups tend to become popular when they are addressing an unfilled need .In SF , according to pepomint , TNG seems to be a very good entry point into the large scene .It sounds as if in Chicago it is not .In Boston , I think TNG is not terribly well - integrated , but there is some amount of overlap and friendly relations with the other Boston organizations .I think the question about young people becoming integrated into the larger scene is more a question of whether this is due to ageism or due to finding the wider scene more unwelcoming than TNG .Certainly some , and maybe all young people are ageist , but there are definitely many young people who are not .I would n't think that the youth in SF are somehow less ageist than the youth in Boston .So I guess I would say that if the larger scene is n't attracting any real numbers of youth , then there is probably something we could be doing better .I think some of the anger that shows up about a TNG group is due to the fact that its seen as \" stealing \" the youth away from the larger organizations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.263016"}
{"text": "The author of YMP has heard similar criticisms , and has recently ( in the last couple days ) changed the pictures to pictures of herself .I suspect that a group based on racial minorities , or class , would see a lot of the same arguments and flamewars that a TNG group gets .Do you think the San Francisco poly ( or BDSM ) scene does a good job in serving these other minority groups ?Do you feel like the general scene is diverse in this way , or does the age clumping also include an income / race / etc . clumping ?You are spot - on when it comes to race .In the San Francisco area at least , it is pretty clear that white people are over - represented and other racial / ethnic groups are under - represented .Presumably this is due to subtle racism and the operation of certain forms of privilege .This has led for occasional calls for poly groups specific to people of color .Whenever those calls go out , the organizers get flamed for discrimination .Class is a little less clear .In this area , there is a real push towards holding very cheap or free events .In fact , if the event costs more than $ 15 , you have to post on the local list with a different header so that people can filter it out .Some poly organizing has dovetailed with anarchist organizing in the area .One of the largest and oldest events in the area is held by folks who are definitely not quite middle class .Event costs are often covered by donation , and most events will waive any entrance fee if you ask the organizers .That said , it is not like we are free of class issues .A number of events are held in locations that basically require a car to get to .Also , subtle class power dynamics are definitely still in play - I had to leave a party a month ago because the person I was with was feeling like she was on the wrong end of those dynamics .I think there might be some self - segregation by class at events .Overall the community is probably mostly middle - class .I suspect we do not do so well when it comes to ability politics , but I do not know many details there .There is a ( somewhat inconsistent ) effort to make events accessible , but my sense is that the usual subtle power effects around ability are very much still in play .As for gender , I think poly community gender politics in my area are surprisingly good .This is not to say we are free of sexism ( for example , the sort described in this post ) by a long shot .But , there seems to be a general recognition that gender politics are important , and in my area there are various women - only groups and email lists , and they generally do not get flamed for organizing in this manner .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.28053"}

'So what does it really mean to be politically correct , and why are we reading so many bad things about it ?The term ' political correctness ' probably originated in the 1970s .But according to writer Barbara Epstein , it was widely publicized by the media in October 1990 , when the Western Humanities Conference held an interdisciplinary forum entitled ' Political Correctness ' and Cultural Studies at the University of California at Berkeley .She explains that what started out as a wry self - deprecating joke on the Left became a rigid standard against which both liberals and conservatives were being measured .The actual ' politically correct ' agenda introduced to the universities consisted of curricula whose values , historical perspectives , and standards were not white , male , and heterosexual .Not only were students exposed to literature that presented the views of people of colour , feminists , and gays ; they were also asked to apply this multicultural outlook to how they treated people in their daily lives .Just as models of racism , sexism , and homophobia were being ruptured - attacks against political correctness started up .One prominent view claimed that so - called radicals , by injecting multiculturalism into the schools , were displacing scholarly ' objectivity ' with their own biased orthodoxy .There were reports about how PC behaviour was getting out of hand .Black students at the University of Pennsylvania , reacting to a conservative columnist in the school paper , confiscated 14,000 copies of the publication before it could be distributed .At the University of Wisconsin , a student was suspended simply for telling an Asian - American , ' It 's people like you - that 's the reason this country is screwed up ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.792816"}

I did n't move over for Stern .I was in an area that did n't carry Stern on FM so I did n't care one way or the other about him when he made the move .You brought up car sales as the driving force in subscriptions , and that 's an interesting point .Sure I bought a car and got 6 months free but I subscribed \" after \" that 6 months because of Stern .Without Stern Sirius has nothing unique to warrant its cost .You left out the fact that Stern is about retention of subscribers , not just changing people over , and that 's where Sirius makes money .Many people would just let their free subscriptions run out without Stern .You would see not only increases in subscribers but drops as car sales ebb and flow .We have not seen that .Sirius has had a steady increase since signing Stern .People , once subscribed , seem to stay that why .Why ?It 's not because of Dr Laura .It 's because of Howard and his interviews with Billy Joel , Paul McCartney , Quentin Tarantino , Francis Ford Coppola , Robert Duvall , Ron Howard , etc , etc .We can find talk , comedy , and music for free ( yes even commercial free ) .It 's also about the advertising $ for Sirius .They can sell ads on Stern , which is something they ca n't do for the rest of their channels .I can get all the free music and comedy I want on Pandora or other free services .My car has an auxiliary input so I just attach my droid / ipod and stream music from there .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.21175"}

{"text": "As a sociology teacher , not only do I discuss topics related to oppression and inequality , but these topics comprise a pervasive and substantial portion of our pedagogy .When covering a lesson on privilege and oppression - almost inexorably , and amongst others - at least one of the following responses from students ensues : denial , defensiveness , and/or diminishment .Aptly enough , their reactions exemplify a part of the lesson , and therefore can be used as a learning device in the liberal arts and social sciences classroom .Denial is a common response from students ( and the general public , for that matter ) when discussing the existence of gender inequality in the United States .This mentality is revealed in such sentiments as \" it 's not like it 's the 1950s anymore , \" or \" but my mom makes all the money in our family , \" and is frequently - though not exclusively - retorted by male students .Similarly , Johnson contends , \" members of privileged groups are culturally authorized to interpret other people 's experiences for them , to deny the validity of their own reports , and to impose their views of reality \" ( 109 ) .When statements similar to the above arise in the classroom setting , instructors can employ the parent / child analogy to explain how dominant groups often denunciate experiences of others .The classroom discussion itself , a microcosm of society , may serve as an example of power dynamics of the larger culture .The teacher might begin by asking if the classroom is a component of society , and if elements of the larger culture can be found represented in the classroom .The teacher may subsequently inquire : \" Why is there a tendency to deny that inequality exists when discussing it in the classroom ? \"Alternatively , perhaps an instructor can preemptively use this common tendency as a hook - even before comments such as these are made - to instigate a discussion : \" It is not the 1950s anymore .People have more rights than ever before , and yet for some this does n't seem to be enough .Do I- do we - really even need to listen to the voices of others if they are demanding change ?Does a person / group from poverty have more authority to speak about their experiences in poverty than myself , coming from the middle - class ?What could that person really know that I do n't ? ! \"Prompts like these often result in a good , active discussion .Another reaction when covering topics related to privilege and oppression is defensiveness .At times , the replies are even a bit angry : \" This is just a bunch of bulls _ _ _ ! \"( I have heard worse , but out of respect for fellow faculty , will refrain from interjecting it here . )And it is not just anger , but a hostile , defensive anger .What might be the cause of this ?What are the benefits of being defensive ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.13309"}

{"text": "I find it illuminating that people are often quick to worry about what effect these younger groups might have , but when pressed can not actually name those effects .What exactly are you worried about ?Now , there are age - limited groups that can cross one of the above lines and start exerting their own unpleasant forms of age - related power .For example , there is a BDSM TNG sub - group on the east coast that is so successful that it is challenging its parent group in terms of numbers and control of the local scene .Similarly , we 've had a couple of people ( less than five out of a cast of hundreds ) who have shown up to the under - forty group expecting to find the secret hidden cache of hot young poly things .They quickly realize that we are real people and then move on to hunt their fantasy elsewhere .For these reasons , it is important to measure the intent and effect of any particular age - limited group .This is true to a certain extent .Certainly high schools are currently the primary bastion of open homophobia .And monogamy enforcement seems to operate in a very similar manner .Someone I know who was doing polyamory organizing at a local college ran into surprisingly negative and vicious attitudes .But at least for monogamy / poly stuff ( and I would guess for homophobia as well ) a lot of this peters out by the mid-20 's as people get exposure and start thinking for themselves .And it should be noted that despite the vicious enforcement , younger people typically are actually more liberal on issues if you poll them .For example , youth are more supportive of same - sex marriage than any other demographic , at the same time as youth are much more likely to engage in queer - bashing violence .I think that in some ways younger people are used as a front line for conservatism : older folks set the ideological tone and younger folks carry out the nasty enforcement of that ideology .You are likely wrong in this assumption , though your reception would depend largely on region and the particular poly group in question .Most poly groups are very welcoming to folks without much in the way of polyamory experience , or who do not identify as polyamorous .Indeed , people new to polyamory make up a good chunk of those participating in poly community , partly because polyamory is growing but also because the more experienced poly people tend to drop out once they 've settled into their life with three partners or whatever .In my area , poly groups are generally welcoming to people in open relationships , who do n't like labels , who are into casual sex or play parties , and so on .We have one regular at my poly social group who actually identifies as monogamous , and is just taking a temporary break from monogamy for a couple years .At the last event , one guy showed up who was working from an \" open relationship with casual sex on the side \" model and he found a very warm reception .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.51851"}

{"text": "Let me recap briefly what I have observed in the San Francisco area .Older people are more likely to have the resources to hold events ( and perhaps urge towards building community ) .The events they hold will tend to cater to older people in subtle ways , simply because people hold events based on their own personal preferences .Older people at the events will tend not to notice the age distribution since they are having a good time , so these events can be mostly free of younger people without anyone raising a stink .Even when people do notice , they will tend to assume that there is some issue with the younger folks that prevents them from attending .Younger people who show up to these events ( often with no idea as to the age range of the event ) often find themselves the youngest person in the room , which means that people will generally not relate to their current life state .Events rarely have allowances that encourage inclusion by younger folks .( Some of these are simple and increase the general inclusiveness of the event , assigned greeters for example . )Younger folks are at a disadvantage due to older / younger power dynamics in the wider culture , and thus may trouble having fun , meeting people , or discussing difficult subjects at mixed - age events .When there are problems , there is often no recourse to the ( usually older ) organizers , again due to the power dynamic .Due to these issues , younger folks do not stay around , and so events usually do not develop the critical mass necessary to become truly mixed - age .And the cycle continues .With all this at play , it is not at all surprising to see the sort of de facto age segregation I described above .In fact , we should be surprised when mixed - age events are successful at pulling a large age range .Let me again remind you that we live in a largely age - segregated society , despite the modern conceit that adults are largely the same .This all begs the question : what can we do to bring younger people into the visible polyamory movement and hold events that appeal to them ?How can we do this while not hurting the attractiveness of polyamory to people in the age range from middle age to retirement ?( There is a third question which I will not be addressing here : how can we support polyamorous people who are of retirement age or older ? )Pay attention to age .As I discuss above , it is easy for a movement ( or for particular sub - groups within a movement ) to fall into a lull where questions of age are largely ignored .Instead , we should be asking questions about the age of our participants .What is our age distribution ?How old are people when they first decide to pursue polyamory ?( And is this age lowering ? )What are the differences in poly style or identification across ages ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.91065"}

The progressive bent of the group and my facilitation meant that the subjects were definitely interesting to me .However , even though the discussion group ( and actually , all of Love+Politics ) started off with a good age range , over time we would add older people and the younger people would drop out .Some of the younger left - wing folks who helped kick - start the organization left over political differences with the leader .My discussion group added a couple of problematic people who happened to be older .It was with Love+Politics that I first noticed a problem that has dogged my polyamory organizing : I had a hard time getting my friends and lovers to events I was holding .It was n't that they did n't like me or did n't want to go to poly events , but rather that the sort of events I was putting on had very little appeal to them .This prompted me to start thinking about what sorts of events would actually attract younger poly folks , the question that is still fueling my attempts at poly organizing .Eventually Jen and I found other ways to locate poly people near our age .We got good at finding partners through the online personals .Our friend / lover network eventually grew enough so we started meeting folks through social ties .But perhaps most importantly , we started going to BDSM events .The BDSM community is not shy about creating age - limited events specifically for younger people in the community .The last decade has seen a proliferation of \" TNG \" groups ( TNG is short for The Next Generation ) , typically social events or dinners specifically limited to people under a certain age .The age limit varies from place to place , but is usually either thirty , thirty - five , or forty .While these groups initially faced a lot of resistance , eventually the kink community came to the conclusion that they were necessary : the only alternative seemed to be giving up on the possibility of people in this age range joining the public BDSM community .Here in San Francisco we have a monthly TNG dinner , a bimonthly play party for people under forty , and a kinky club night that tends to attract younger folks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.59333"}

{"text": "Attract younger people via outreach and representation .If younger poly or nonmonogamous people are going to join the poly movement or a particular poly community , they must be attracted to it .There is this tendency for people to self - identify as poly or nonmonogamous for a long period of time before seeking out poly community .( It took me twelve years . )From the outside it is often unclear what purpose organized polyamory serves , especially if one already has nonmonogamous friends and lovers .Once people find community that works for them , they tend to stick with it or at least view it as a useful resource in the future .So we should make it a priority to get people through the door that first time .Overall , the polyamory movement has a lot of work to do on improving and expanding our outreach channels .At the same time as we improve outreach generally , we should consider ways that we can deliver outreach efforts to younger people .One way this has already been happening is via presentations at college classes .Human sexuality classes like to bring in speakers from sexual minorities of various sorts , and some professors specifically seek out poly people .This is great , but has mostly been informal up to this point , with professors approaching people they know or being referred from their other speakers .Every couple years there is a push to form a speakers ' bureau and start actively seeking out these engagements .If we could get this together and facilitate frequent presentations of this sort , it would be an amazing outreach coup .While college classes are going surprisingly well , there are a host of other outreach opportunities that we are not taking advantage of .For example , BDSM TNG groups are relatively common at this point and are generally friendly to polyamory .Simply flyering or even just showing up as poly representatives at these groups would do a lot to alert poly kinksters to the existence of poly resources .Along more formal lines , educating college and high school counselors is an important step , though one that is a large effort of its own and should happen in tandem with general therapist education .Youth - oriented sexuality websites such as Scarleteen or the Midwest Teen Sex Show tend to not mention polyamory ( or even nonmonogamy ) at all , or at best in passing , even though they prominently cover other relatively advanced topics such as BDSM .I think there is this sense that nonmonogamy is not yet an appropriate topic for youth , which is kind of odd given that nonmonogamous experimentation definitely happens .We could offer to help them generate such materials .When doing outreach , there is a certain \" ladder strategy \" that can be helpful .It is important to usually have the people doing the outreach in the same general age range as the target audience .In the best case , this means having peers show up .For example , if we want to do outreach to BDSM TNG groups , the people doing it should be under the age limit of the groups in question .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.010025"}

{"text": "Younger people often leave mixed - age events ( especially sexualized ones ) having failed in their social goals , or with a vague ( or often not - so - vague ) sense of discomfort or frustration .Of course , there is one sort of power that younger people retain : the power to \" vote with their feet \" .Usually , they can walk away from the conversation , argument , social group , or event .( This is not always true , for example leaving a family holiday dinner is not much of an option .But it is true for polyamory community events . )And in fact , when one is faced with a entirely hopeless discussion or argument , or a frustrating social situation , walking away starts to look good .It makes more sense to spend your time and energy in a milieu where you can make some progress .And indeed , younger poly people seem to make a habit of walking away from mixed - age polyamory events in my area .This effect pretty much disappears when younger people are socializing primarily or entirely with other younger people .It is not that they suddenly get more socially adept or conceptually well - grounded , but rather everyone in the situation is working at a similar level , excepting any other subtle power dynamics ( racism , sexism , homophobia , ableism , etc ) that may be in play .In other words , there is a need for younger - only polyamory social and discussion spaces .This need does not come out of younger - against - older ageism , but rather from older - against - younger ageism .There are certain things that go much better in younger - only spaces than they do for younger people in mixed - age spaces : discussion or debate , overcoming social awkwardness , finding people to date , and so on .I can feel this at the under - forty events I am holding : compared to the mixed - age events ( which it should be noted , are exactly the same excepting the age restriction ) there is a certain relaxation that happens , a kind of letting go .This should be no surprise to people who are familiar with activism that resists power dynamics in the culture .It is typical that the group with less power is forced to hold events that exclude people from the group with more power .This is not out of animosity ( though animosity certainly may be present ) , but is rather a logistical matter that springs directly from the power in quesion .For example , meetings of feminist women often have to exclude men .This is not because the women in question hate men or do not wish to engage them .( In fact , changing men is a primary goal of feminism . )Rather , it is because having men in the room , even really well - intentioned ones , can prevent the group from getting things done .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.38043"}

{"text": "Are they even someone you want to have sex with ?I do n't know about you , but when I have sex ( even hookup sex ) the encounter lasts longer than thirty minutes , so hooking up with someone I can not stand is a recipe for disaster or at the very least bad sex .I think a lot of men put the horse before the cart and try to establish mutual physical attraction before chemistry , often by basically spamming a large number of people with low - effort come - ons that will almost certainly end in rejection .This is not a strategy that promotes self - esteem , and this sort of approach tends to be incompatible with maintaining one 's own high standards .In this final section , I would like to describe some of the challenges and successes in creating events that are targeted at a younger crowd .The last two years have been an illuminating journey , and hopefully this section will help others start and run events oriented towards younger poly people in their area .While most of my experience has been with a group that has an explicit under - forty age limit , there are ways to hold events that are mostly attended by younger folks without instituting an explicit age limit .One way to do this is to create other attendance limits that effectively end up limiting the age of attendees .For example , a college polyamory group could limit attendance to polyamorous people at the college , which would definitely skew things towards a younger crowd .Another way to unofficially skew attendance towards a younger crowd is to center the event around an activity that younger people prefer .The most obvious way to do this is to hold the event late at night .If things get started at eleven or later , then the people who will show will be mostly younger .There is a ( not particularly polyamorous ) popular sex party in San Francisco where the action really does not get rolling until one or two in the morning , and the party continues until the sun rises .While the party gets a mix of ages , the event manages to hold the interest of the younger crowd .Similarly , there is a BDSM club night here that consistently attracts kinky college - age folks in the area , because the door price is cheap ( or free with a local dungeon membership ) and it has that late - night club atmosphere that keeps the average age down .I have been thinking about putting together a regular poly event at a local goth club , which I think would have similar age skew effects .In addition to late - night activities , there are certain daytime activities that younger people are just going to be more interested in .There was a recent lasertag event in San Francisco that seemed to draw a mix of ages , I think because running around in the woods all day shooting at people is somewhat more attractive to younger folks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.40293"}

{"text": "So , consider being open to the idea of mentoring younger organizers .This could take place in the context of a large organized poly group , where the more experienced organizers help the less experienced organizers get started on holding their own events .Or it could happen in an ad - hoc manner , typically when a less experienced organizer asks someone they know for advice .My under-40 group turned out to be a touchstone for this sort of interaction - since starting it , I have been approached by three different people in my age cohort or younger for advice on holding events .Consider holding events that attract a mix of ages .This is harder than it sounds , which is why these events are relatively rare .The suggestions above ( inclusiveness , monitoring sexual dynamics ) go a long way towards making an event friendly to younger folks while still including older folks .However , perhaps the most important step is partnering with one or more younger organizers .While not strictly necessary , the tendency of event demographics to mirror the organizers means that it will be difficult to attract a mix of ages with only older organizers .Partnering does not just mean putting their name on the event , but also that they should take an active hand in designing and carrying off the event .Advertising appropriately is a big part of attracting a mix of ages to an event .If there is one poly email list in the area and it tends to draw people of a particular age segment , then only advertising the mixed - age event on that list will probably not result in the desired mix of ages .Consider advertising on social networking sites , or finding ways of advertising through friend networks .Approach other groups in the area , like BDSM groups or the local sex - positive sex toy store .Formalizing events tends to make it easier for people of different age groups to interact .As I mentioned above , discussion groups tend to be more friendly to a mix of ages than social events , and I think this is largely due to the more formal structure .So , consider ways that the event could be made more formal while still being attractive across age groups .For example , add a ( desexualized ) activity that is fun or useful to people across age .At more formal events , it may be possible to build age - awareness directly into the event itself .For example , if a support group is above a certain size on a given night , it could be split into two groups by age .Even if it is small , there could be communication exercises that people do in pairs or small groups , giving them the chance to break off with just their cohort .Because we were already doing matching by gender and sexuality at poly speed dating , we took the chance to also allow people to specify the age of the folks they would like to meet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.77586"}

{"text": "The right wing has started making attacks on nudist groups , focusing on a child abuse tack , as we see in this article .On a side note , nudism and polyamory carry a similar sexualization profile , which is to say most people in these communities will very forcibly tell you that what they do is not sexual , but at the same time the mainstream inevitably views them as sexual .I think the fact that we are a somewhat sexualized community has something to do with our generational organizing issues , as I will discuss below .My point here is that there is no guarantee that organized polyamory ( or for that matter , polyamory ) will continue .We could easily turn into a one - generation flash in the pan .Something new would probably spring up to take our place , much as polyamory seems to have largely taken the place of open relationship ideology .But at the same time , losing the momentum of polyamory would be a serious setback for nonmonogamy in general , much like the decline of the naturist movement has been a setback for anyone who values nudity .We saw this happen in the 80 's , when both open relationships and swinging took a serious conceptual and cultural beating , and this halted or reversed much of the progress that had been made in nonmonogamy .For example , we would not be able to make progress in the area of legal custody reform , or in legal recognition for our relationships .We would be much easier targets for right - wing attacks and cultural backlash .We might not be able to publish our guidebooks , and our conferences and workshops could disappear .We would certainly lose our relatively good credibility .This could all happen at the same time as polyamory or nonmonogamy gains in popular acceptance , much like has happened with nudism .We can see this with the bisexual movement .In the 90 's , bisexual activism was on the move .We got most lesbian / gay organizations to change their names to include bisexuality , we started agitating on the national level , and so on .It seemed like things would only keep on growing , and soon bisexuals would be a national force to reckon with .But instead , organizing fizzled ( for reasons that were not the aging - out problem , but have more to do with bisexual invisibility and appropriation of bisexual issues ) .Today , there are more bisexuals than ever , but very little in the way of bisexual organizations .We have a hard time keeping up a bisexual support group in San Francisco , though we have plenty of bisexuals .We are unable to forcibly respond to media attacks on bisexuality .LBGT organizations seem to be largely staffed by L 's and G 's with the occasional T.

{"text": "In general , there is no issue with older women propositioning younger people of any gender , because women are generally taught to be less forward when it comes to sexual advances .So , this section is primarily aimed at men ( of any age ) .Younger women ( and sometimes younger queer men ) who come to poly events often end up feeling harassed just due to the sheer number of compliments and come - ons .Once you get past the first one or two in an evening , a younger person tends to start feeling like a piece of meat , even if the people approaching are totally polite and respectful .Also , often these propositions happen out of the blue or right after meeting someone , which only adds to that meaty feeling .In addition , the significant majority of younger women are really just not interested in anyone twenty years their senior .But , at mixed - age poly events it is not uncommon for men that much older to hit on younger women .This again produces a fresh meat feeling and tends to discourage younger women from returning to the event .So , I would like to propose two simple rules for self - policing .I think every man ( of every age ) at a poly social event should be following these rules , both to keep from annoying other people and as a matter of personal integrity and self - respect . 1 ) Respect a lower age limit .If a person is below a certain age in comparison to your own , chances are they are different enough that you are not going to get along with you , and chances are they are not going to be interested in you .If someone is this age or younger , do not hit on them , no matter how cute they are .The culture largely determines what this lower age limit is .It starts small after high school and widens out as you get older .At thirty , the lower age limit is around twenty - two ( or \" out of college \" ) .At forty , the lower age limit is somewhere around the late twenties , or perhaps thirty .At sixty , the lower age limit might be forty or forty - five .The XKCD comic created a formulaic version of this rule , though I suspect it gets too wide past the fifties .Of course , some people get along better with the younger crowd , and others get along worse , so I am not going to tell anyone exactly what their cutoff should be .You can judge for yourself - if you are talking to a group of people and they seem to be in a different world , they are under the age limit .To use myself as an example , I am thirty - four and my current lower age limit is twenty - five .People younger than their mid - twenties are different enough from me that I usually do not interact well with them , and the chances of us getting along well enough to date or even have sex drops precipitously as ages cross that mid - twenties line .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.22952"}

{"text": "If you 're past the poly thing , no worries .The effect you describe is real , though I do n't think it is a matter of maturity as much as experience .A lot of people come to polyamory after having failed at monogamy a couple times , or at least gotten enough experience with it that they decide they want something else .And all that takes time , making it somewhat more likely that someone will be looking for polyamory in their late 20 's rather than late teens .Also , a lot of college - age folks are sort of playing the field , and so the polyamory identity does n't have much to offer them , since things have not gelled enough in their dating life that monogamy becomes an issue .That said , there are effects going the other way .Most notably , I 'm pretty sure that the younger generation is more accepting of nonmonogamy ( or at least will be when their ages are comparable to the older generation ) .In other words , there will be more poly people in the next generation .This is partly due to word getting out about polyamory , and partly due to steadily liberalizing sexual and relationship views across the generations .So , while it might take some time ( on average ) for any particular person to come to polyamory , the greater numbers in the next generation offset that a bit .It is hard to say whether there are more poly people of one age than another as a result , and no one has actually done any statistical studies .I think people make claims like the one you brought up because they see certain things in their particular polyamory social scenes , but of course those scenes are self - selecting and that 's not all that meaningful .The various things affecting poly acceptance at various ages mean that you get some odd effects .For example , at our poly speed dating events , we get a solid number of women in their twenties , but very few guys - go figure .I 'm not sure why , but I suspect one of the above effects is knocking the guys out .Perhaps at that age they are not strongly feeling the pressure of a long - term monogamous relationship yet , so the urge to find polyamory is less present .I 'm in the Twin Cities , MN .I think we have a fair number of polyfolk here , esp .given the large GLBT , BDSM , pagan and geek communities .So I probably could 've found more possible poly partners if I 'd looked harder but I was pretty new to dating in general ( did n't much in high school ) .I think another issue is , in my experience middle - aged people are just more prone to joining formal organizations , while younger people prefer more informal , spontaneous ways of socializing .Currently I am in a monogamous relationship , though I would n't rule out polyamory as a future possibility .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.63269"}

{"text": "We would see people show up once , and never come back ( though one of the people who did not come back was inspired to start holding events in her own age cohort ) .So , I think I can say with confidence that forty is too high of an age limit if you want to serve a college - age crowd in addition to folks in their twenties and thirties .In comparison , a local TNG BDSM group has an age limit of thirty - five , and seems to attract and retain college - age youth .This speaks of a need to have different age - limited poly groups with different age limits : college - age or under - twenty - five groups alongside under - forty or under - thirty - five groups .Another general problem with events aimed at the under - twenty - five or college ages is that poly identity starts getting slippery in that age range .Once you hit the late twenties , enough people have taken on the poly identity that it is much easier to get a critical mass at poly events .In the late teens and early twenties , there are plenty of nonmonogamous people but in most cases their practice has not become an identity of any sort , much less a poly identity .This makes it hard to assemble a critical mass of poly - identified youth .So for youth events , it may be helpful to hold events that are generally targeted at nonmonogamous practice rather than labelling them polyamorous .I have seen something similar in the bisexual community , where an explicitly bisexual youth group does not do as well as one labelled \" Fluid \" or something similar .In the BDSM world , we have seen a lot of problems around what happens when the people who meet and bond at the social group start getting older .As people start to cross the upper age limit of the group , the cutoff ends up fracturing those social networks , since some folks can stay but others have to leave .In some cases this has created pressure to steadily move the age limit higher as people age , which starts effectively excluding younger folks but keeps the base social group together .One very popular east coast TNG group gave up at one point and decided to become a generational group , still excluding people older than themselves but keeping their own generation together .Because of this issue , it is important to identify the exact reasons that an age - limited group is required .I have listed the reasons I have seen above , and some of them are generational ( flirting styles ) while others are related to stage - of - life ( older - vs - younger ageism ) and will repeat across generations .If the issues are more due to stage of life , then it is preferable to keep the group around as a resource to people entering that age cohort and find other social venues for the people who are aging out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.8127"}

{"text": "So for example , people in their thirties approach people in their twenties , and people in their twenties approach teens .This nicely creates a way to transmit poly knowledge across generations .The thirty year old learns at a class taught by a forty - five year old , and then in turn teaches a twenty - four year old , who in turn teaches people at a college .In addition to outreach , representation is key .By representation I mean having young poly people visible in various forums , in media and on the internet .Getting good media representation has proven to be tricky for the poly movement in general .We should identify a pool of younger spokespeople and refer some set of media opportunities to them .However , this should not be at the expense of older media representation , and there is definitely a danger that this might happen .Due to the media 's obsession with young people ( and their bodies ) , media producers will usually favor younger subjects over older .To date , we have had a lot of success putting middle - aged and older poly people in front of the cameras .We should ensure that media opportunities continue to flow to older spokespeople despite industry pressure for young subjects .Along the same lines , we should front a variety of looks and body types , resisting the media 's proclivity for people who look like models .We should also encourage self - representation of younger poly people .This can happen many ways ( for example , by publishing a book ) but the internet is currently the most vibrant medium for self - representation .Blogging has taken off , and many poly people are blogging their experiences and issues around polyamory , including some younger folks .In addition , polyamory already features prominently on some social networking sites .The two I know best are livejournal and fetlife .Just today I heard rumor that some folks are considering putting together a social networking site or sub - site specifically for young poly people .I am not entirely sure that we need to do anything to encourage these efforts ( since they are already well underway ) but finding ways to track them and refer people to them would be a great start .Recognize the necessity of age - limited groups .The BDSM community took a while to get used to the existence of TNG groups and events .Initially there was a lot of bitterness , accusations of exclusivity and ageism , and what have you .Over time the flames died down .These days the larger community generally recognizes the utility of TNG organizing , though resentment still flares up from time to time .In the polyamorous community , we seem to be in that initial discomfort phase .People ( especially but not always people over the age limit ) tend to come down really hard on \" under - X only \" groups , and there is a general failure to understand that these groups are necessary if we want younger people to join polyamory in significant numbers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.25871"}

{"text": "Sometimes these younger folks end up not identifying as polyamorous , even when what they are doing looks and quacks like polyamory .This may seem odd , but in fact is not too surprising .It is really hard to pick up or retain an identity when you can not find anyone in that identity group from your own demographic .If the people you end up dealing with are all swingers or Burners , then you tend to start thinking of yourself that way , even if the reason you met these people was because you are poly .Along these lines , I also see lots of people taking on the poly label , but having their polyamory identity end up secondary to these other community identifications .Which again makes sense : we prioritize the identities that are serving us best .I see these types all over the public BDSM community in the area , where polyamory has gained a foothold but the number of strongly poly - identified people is much much smaller than the number of nonmonogamous people , who are a majority in the local kink scene .In particular , I want to note that the lack of peer support for younger poly people is a real problem in my area , and may be reducing our numbers .I know lots of younger poly folks who have problems with polyamory , and they do not have any place to get this sort of support .Some of them give up , and head back to monogamy .While of course some of these people are not the poly type , others are , and I suspect they will suffer in monogamy .I had my four years of trying to be monogamous and it was hell .I would rather that others not have to travel that particular path .This problem may well be specific to the San Francisco area .Certainly , the Boston people in my social circle do not have this issue to my knowledge .Here in the SF area we are blessed with two things that might be contributing to this issue : a large number of poly people in general , and a large and vibrant older generation of people in their forties to early sixties .This latter group seems to be a generational spike : people who came of age in the 60 's , 70 's , and 80 's .When you get older than this group , poly membership tapers off drastically .Most of the events in this area are held by folks in this late - middle - aged group , and attended by the same crowd .And it is very cool that we have these events .Because of this generational group , there has been a consistently visible poly presence and activity in the bay area since before I was on the scene .I can show up to an event and actually talk to one of those people who started being nonmonogamous in the 70 's and never stopped .In short , we have an incredible resource base here in the area , one that is generally not replicated in other regions in the States .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.23677"}

{"text": "This is why workers at Disney resorts can not wear piercings aisde from simple earrings .There is a gap of time between when a generation gains adulthood and when its values become the mainstream , perhaps twenty years .When things change quickly , this can lead to a situation where older and younger adult generations seem alien to each other , and open intergenerational clashes ensue .The most recent example of this was the 60 's and 70 's , but we can find earlier examples as well , such as the early 1900 's when a significant number of women were first able to move to cities and live mostly independently .However , the generation gap never entirely disappears .Also , the lack of modern mentorship arrangements and the culture 's obsession with ( certain kinds of ) youth probably makes the generation gap somewhat worse in the United States than in other cultures .Given this sort of intergenerational power , there are certain effects we can expect in social spaces .In particular , having one 's own values ( more ) aligned with mainstream values confers a kind of power .Mainstream conceptualizations are hegemonic and self - defending in certain ways .Because ideology builds out from the mainstream , there are all kinds of subtle ways to use common cultural tropes to reinforce one 's mainstream values in discussion , argument , or even socializing .The age - related power differences I have described means that older people generally are more aligned with the mainstream and the power it represents .So , older people tend to have certain kinds of social power when compared with younger people , in addition to any other power dynamics that might be at play ( race , class , gender , etc ) .Younger people have trouble holding an equal stance in a discussion , and often are simply not heard or can not get a word in edgewise .Even if we get past the social issues around discussion , a younger person 's ideas will not have the more - mainstream backing that the older person 's ideas have , if the discussion is crossing one of these conceptual generation gaps .This means that the younger person 's argument is ( on average ) harder to articulate and strategize .The socializing implications do not just end with discussion of topics .In the general social milieu , younger people often have trouble with social maneuvering that older people take for granted : taking up social space , protecting personal space , meeting the people you want to meet , addressing or preventing uncomfortable situations , and so on .This is a strong effect when you have a social scene that mixes younger and older folks : the older - against - younger ageist power sneaks into the socializing in various subtle ways .Which is not to say that things are all one - sided .Some younger people are of course way ahead on socializing and arguing , and plenty of older people have problems around these acts .The younger - against - older ageism I have described also has an effect , further muddying the waters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.06038"}

{"text": "Part of paying attention to age is paying attention to power dynamics around age .I have discussed some of these above , but that discussion is only the beginning .In particular , when age - related power dynamics intersect with other kinds of power then we can see problems around inclusiveness .The problem of older men hitting on younger women to the point of making them uncomfortable ( age - related power intersecting with sexism ) is an ongoing issue in polyamorous organizing , one which tends to drive away younger women .Given that polyamory was built on a history of feminism , this trend could seriously prevent polyamorous progress in the next generation .Similarly , I am starting to suspect that there is some intersection of ageism and racial power dynamics occurring .I am not sure how exactly this intersection functions , but my under - forty social group is significantly more racially diverse than other poly events in the area ( including other all - ages events that I hold ) , which are mostly white .Encourage younger organizers .Organizing the younger crowd is hard .Younger people may not identify as polyamorous yet , or even if they do , they may yet see the value of attending polyamory events .Younger poly people are often not hooked into polyamory online or in - person resources , depending instead on friend networks or converting poly - curious folks .In addition , monogamous younger people tend to be more vicious about enforcing compulsory monogamy , so promoting nonmonogamy opens one up for attack .( This parallels homophobia , where currently the most blatant homophobic attacks can be found in high schools . )And to top it off , younger poly organizers have on average less organizing experience , and organizing is a real skill that must be learned .So , any encouragement we can give to younger poly organizers is very important .This can take the form of how - to - organize guides , such as this one put out by the new and fabulous Young Metro Poly blog .It can also take the form of organizer - to - organizer mentorship , where a more experienced ( usually but not always older ) organizer helps a less experienced organizer get started .These mentorship arrangements should generally be non - sexual .And in general , the polyamory movement should provide support to its younger organizing cohort : younger poly birds - of - a - feather meetings at conferences , sharing resources ( space , finances ) , and so on .Also , I think the time is ripe to start looking at college organizing .While polyamory has been known on college campuses for a while ( including back in my mid-90 's college days ) , visible polyamory organizations are rare .We are currently seeing an increasing trend of polyamory articles in college newspapers , as documented by Poly in the Media , which points to a good situation for college organizing .Other movements ( notably , the queer movement and drug law reform movement ) have managed to establish strong and enduring presences on college campuses , and tend to reap rewards in terms of membership and mindshare .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.5385"}

{"text": "This is an understandable reaction borne out of repeated frustrating experiences and being on the losing end of various subtle power - laced interactions , including uncomfortable sexualized situations .Typically these interactions around power are subtle enough to be invisible , and younger people find themselves getting defensive with no clear understanding of what exactly is causing the defensiveness .Of course , a lack of understanding does not prevent people from responding to emotional discomfort .I have observed the following various tactical responses that I believe are responses to the age - related power dynamics at poly events .First , some younger poly people respond with straightforward anti - old ageism , pulling out the \" ick , old people \" cultural trope and swinging it around .And seeking to avoid older people as a group starts to look like a reasonable personal strategy .This anti - old ageism comes out various ways .It is pretty rare to hear someone actually say \" old people disgust me \" , but it is clear that a minority of young poly people start to feel this way .Sometimes this comes out as comparisons to parents : \" everyone there was the same age as my parents \" or \" I do n't want to see naked people my parents ' age \" , as if there is some problem with being one 's parents ' age .In other cases older people are not mentioned , but instead younger people are praised or it becomes clear that a particular person considers younger people to simply be better in some way .Again , this is building on the obsession with youth that we see in the media and culture .To be clear , I find these attitudes reprehensible .I am not trying to excuse any of this , but rather trying to explain where it comes from .Even ( perhaps especially ) socially reprehensible attitudes have a personally strategic purpose .To be fair , the vast majority of poly people I know in my social group do not hold these ageist views .It is particularly hard to hold on to anti - old ageism as one ages into the mid - twenties , because one becomes the older person in comparison with teens and college students .And of course anti - old ageism is clearly ugly when expressed , and the social group has less tolerance for it as they age .My social cohort starts is primarily late twenties to early forties , and so I can not think of any of my friends who are ageist in this way , though I have met other people in this age group who are anti - old ageist .However , my friends still use defensive tactics in various ways .They are still defensive because they still need to actively defend : the effects of anti - young ageism that I have described do not start to significantly recede until a person is in their late thirties or forties .In addition , learned habits die hard , and I think many of these defensive tactics may carry on or be repurposed ( to defend against other power dynamics ) later in life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.61045"}

{"text": "If you are older , the media focus on youth creates a strong conceptual incentive to avoid thinking of yourself as different from younger people .To do otherwise is to be lost without a map .If you are younger , the absence of older protagonists means that you can largely ignore the fact that older people exist .In both cases , what we get is agewashing .The idealization of young bodies and youth as attractive only makes this worse .We are simply not taught how older bodies and older people can be attractive .While most people grow up and figure it out for themselves to some extent , this creates a further incentive for older people to think of themselves as the same as younger folks : to do otherwise is to be consigned to a kind of conceptual desexualization .The obsession with young bodies also tends to make younger people more defensive around interactions with older people in sexualized spaces .Young bodies basically end up as a kind of commodity , and of course people do not like feeling like commodities , so younger people opt out of sexualized spaces where older people are present .This is true for young people of any gender , but goes double for young women , due to the culture 's tendency to sexualize young women 's bodies and due to the culture 's focus on older men / younger women relationships and sex .I think that women actually get less defensive about their bodily space as they get older , because their aging means that the culture is less sexually aggressive towards them .More specifically , men are less sexually aggressive towards them .The upshot of all this is that younger people will generally refuse to share sexualized space with older people , due to an entirely understandable defensiveness brought on by the culture 's fetishization of them .Much as we might dislike it , most polyamory spaces end up being sexualized .This is not because of anything about polyamory , but rather because the larger culture views any kind of nonmonogamy as deeply and inevitably sexual and titillating .The statement \" I am not monogamous \" is generally heard as \" I am a nympho , please take me to your orgy \" .And we are largely successful at creating space where people can talk about poly or with poly people without the orgy madness descending .But at the same time , we never fully erase the sexualizing effect of the culture 's understanding of nonmonogamy .There is a certain sexiness in the air at poly events .So , one strategy for creating good intergenerational interactions is to desexualize the interactions , either by setting up certain roles between people or by desexualizing events .I will discuss this below in a section on ways we can improve the generation gap situation .As I have mentioned , there is a certain ageism in the culture that works against older folks , and younger poly people are in no way immune to this .This ageism can show up a number of ways : thinking that older people are icky , refusing to socialize with folks older than a certain age , developing an obsession with PYTs ( \" pretty young things \" ) , and so on .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.889275"}

{"text": "I 'm not making that claim .How that plays out - the various horrors visited upon those targeted groups and the precise way the privileged imposes a shame - based group identity upon those they also oppress - will look different .On the extreme , it may look like human trafficking or it may look like group killings .On a more common level , it might simply look like a glass sealing where people of a particular group are not permitted to rise above .Segregation of the oppressed from the privileged takes many forms and can never take place in the absence of the dictionary definition of bigotry .That 's my argument .If you think that the dictionary definition of segregation happens in the absence of the dictionary definition of bigotry or that there is only one type of segregation and it happens to only one group , then those are discussions we can have .However , I think we both agree that both the historic and current experience of racial segregation is different than both the historic and current drive to impose cis / trans segregation within society .I think that we can both agree that there are some similarities while also recognizing the reality of some really important differences .In my mind there was never any disagreement on these points .I get what you 're saying , Andreea .While the rhetoric behind bigotry and segregation employed against different groups might look the same , it comes from completely different historical systems of oppression .Like Michelle Alexander says in her book \" The New Jim Crow , \" racial segregation comes out of a racial caste system dating back to the time of slavery .Generation after generation , people of color are born into a worse set of economic conditions than white people because of institutions that prevented people of color from accumulating wealth to pass on to their children .So when we see racist bigotry expressed today , it does not come just from the belief that people of color are inferior , it comes from a long history of economic exploitation being justified through ideas .tl;dr When white people ( myself included ) make arguments comparing racist bigotry with other forms of bigotry , they have to be very careful not to erase racism 's specific meaning that is rooted in historical and present - day institutions .Yes !This !As a homosexual woman of color I have to make sure that one struggle is not co - opted by another .I agree bigotry relies on similar angles to hurt different groups and overtime they are probably recycling tactics , however the implication I gathered from the article is that somehow racism and transphobia are alike and historically that is at worst markedly untrue and at best distinctly unbalanced .I 'm not playing oppression olympics , I am just saying that correlating similarities is important to intersectionality , but it is also important to realize that your struggle and my struggle are very different .Jim Crow laws and the \" bathroom issue \" as it applied to race was based on the fallacy that Black Men are dangerous to White Women and African Americans as a group are subhuman , unclean , etc .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.96829"}

{"text": "Polyamory itself tends to support intergenerational dating much more than monogamy : when a person does not have to be your one and only , it is much easier for them to be outside the standard cultural age range for dating .But while poly people are somewhat less likely to care about age compared to the culture at large , for most it is still a significant concern .People act surprised about this , but if we remember the culture we live in , what is surprising is our relative flexibility about age , not the fact that it remains a concern .To be clear , there are plenty of good and understandable reasons for primarily socializing close to one 's age .The first is that it is easier to relate to people one 's own age , due to being at the same life stage .It is easy to underestimate the strength of this effect .We see this in discussion group topics .A young friend of mine recently went to a poly discussion group , and the primary topic of discussion was raising children in a poly household .This is a hugely important topic for many poly people , but at the same time it is unlikely to interest most poly folks in their early twenties .In general , many discussion topics vary widely in importance depending on age .Some examples of such topics : moving a quad in together , coming out to parents , concerns about job security , and dealing with divorce .Even when general topics are important across the age spectrum , often the particular concerns or solutions involved are specific to one 's life stage .For example , many poly people are interested in how to find other poly people , regardless of age .However , the manner in which they can find people varies widely : a twenty year old person will successfully locate poly people differently than a thirty year old person , who in turn will use different tactics than a fifty year old .Also , the reasons for looking are quite possibly different depending on age : somewhat more likely to be validation for the twenty year old , dating partners for the thirty year old , and community for the fifty year old .The life stage effects also impact our polyamorous practice itself .People 's relationship needs are different at different ages .There is a shift from a focus on sex to companionship as people age .Middle - aged people tend to be looking for stable child - rearing arrangements or good economic partners , more so than people in their twenties or sixties .Poly style tends to be age - specific due to these reasons .In my personal experience , younger people tend towards loose relationship networks while older poly folks tend to have a smaller set of stable established relationships .In addition to life stage effects that make it more attractive to spend time with people close to one 's age , there are a whole series of generational changes .In other words , a thirty year old today will have very different attitudes than a thirty year old twenty years ago .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.025665"}

{"text": "Comments .The positives and negatives of the PC world .Political correctness is perhaps one of the most fiercely debated topics of our time , particularly by the press and although being a misunderstood topic often polarises debates .Firstly the term means different things to different people , to the proponents of political correctness it exemplifies courteous and responsible behaviour for all people in positions of authority .This tends to be , although not exclusively a position for the political left .For the political right , political correctness is often a dirty word and shows a limit on free speech .The term is commonly known to be abused by the far right as a guise to hide behind racist views .Usually minorities , or discriminated groups in society often use political correctness to shut down controversial debate .Getting the right balance is always very difficult because political correctness often enters in the most controversial of debates be it race , culture or gender .This is clearly a case for political correctness and to be fair it was perhaps warranted because an organisation like the BBC , which is broadcast worldwide has a duty not to politicize a sporting event .There are often many negatives aspects of political correctness , those who speak on controversial topics such as racial problems or social degradation are often criticized for using harsh or unpolitcally correct terms or references .This they argue is a censorship placed on them by those criticized , basically shutting down debates .Of note , Enoch Powell and Norman Tebitt come to mind but the difficulty comes in the political opinion you stand upon , often the right think both were correct , whilst the left often describe them as veiled racists .As much as minorities may try to exploit political correctness ( say by branding critics as racists , anti - Islamic , anti - Semitic etc ) there are those who wish to exploit the term and portray themselves as marginalised but justified critic .In light it has been often shown that so called stories of abuses of political correctness are often fabricated or at least exaggerated to a high degree .Thus credibility for such stories is undermined . often baffle and anger the populace .Yet when such stories are thoroughly investigated it is often either exaggerated or due to an misjudgement on behalf of a manager .The idea that white middle - class managers are going out of their way to pander to minority groups often breeds resentment , but conveniently supports the political agenda of such newspapers .It is fair to say political correctness is here to stay , no doubt it is a big hindrance if misused and sometimes freedom of speech is curtailed but because it is not controlled by any part of society it will be impossible to stop .It is clear that we are living in a different world than a generation ago , globalisation whether forced or not is the way of the progressing world nations and immigration on a big scale is a big part of this .Of course with so many people from so many various countries and cultures has its positives and negatives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.14839"}

Cooper 's \" All Negro \" radio show aired in the 1930s on Chicago 's WSBC .2 ) Jack \" The Rapper \" Gibson Gibson got his start on the very first Black owned radio station , Atlanta 's WERD , in 1949 .Embodying the fast talking style for which he was named , Gibson also went on to create one of the first Black radio trades , \" Jack The Rapper , \" and the infamous Black music convention of the same name .3 ) Rufus Thomas Rufus Thomas was the preeminent DJ of Memphis ' WDIA , the nation 's first radio station with an all - Black air staff .A triple - threat performer of song , dance , and comedy , Thomas ' nighttime show , \" Hoot and Holler , \" was an influential source of blues and R&B for a generation of white and Black listeners alike .Thomas also hosted amateur talent shows on Memphis ' famed Beale Street , premiering young talents like B.B. King , Ike Turner , and Bobby \" Blue \" Bland .5 ) Petey Greene Known as one of the original shock - jocks , Greene was a trailblazer of talk radio ; and his influence was such that he has been credited with quashing the riots in Washington , D.C. in the wake of Martin Luther King Jr. 's assassination .Greene got an unusual start to his broadcasting career when he began DJing for the Virginia prison in which he was serving a five year sentence for armed robbery .Upon his release when he was hired to host his own show , Rapping With Petey Greene , at WOL in Washington D.C.His success led him to television where he hosted his own Emmy Award - winning show , Petey Greene 's Washington , on local WDCA - TV and BET .6 ) Melvin Lindsey Almost twenty years after his death , WHUR jock Marvin Lindsey 's \" Quiet Storm \" playlist remains an inspiration for imitators at radio stations across the country .Lindsey started out interning at Howard University 's WHUR , and got his first break filling in for a DJ who could n't make it in .The positive response for Lindsey 's impromptu show led WHUR station manager ( and now Radio One founder ) Cathy Hughes to give him his own time slot .Christening the show \" Quiet Storm \" after a hit single from Smokey Robinson , Lindsey 's smooth soulful playlist was an instant success , and may well have influenced the growth of the \" smooth Jazz \" sector of the music and radio business . 7 ) Dyanna Williams Dynanna Williams is one of the earliest and most influential female air personalities in Black radio .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.08567"}

{"text": "How can we help her to be more empathetic ?I am a psychotherapist .The psychological research on empathy shows approximately 15 to 20 % of people are highly empathic ( they are known as HSPs - highly sensitive persons ) .And racial minority groups , at least in America , have been shown to have as much empathy for whites as they do for members of their own group due to how we all are socialized .My experience has been that it is simpler to generate a discussion about gender inequality than to address issues of race , especially in classrooms that are heavily dominated by white students .I think a discussion and exploration of the issue of \" color blindness \" or \" gender blindness \" is also highly relevant and critical .Sometimes , I have students read some of the research that has shown that emphasizing color blindness makes even children more likely to then accept discriminatory attitudes .I also really value and appreciate Derald Wing Sue 's Tripartite Model of Cultural Identity .He notes that the color blindness problem tries to ascribe everyone 's identity just to the universal level while ignoring the other levels .It is important that we understand and can accept a person on all three levels .I find this a very useful framework for helping students think differently about other people .( This is for a counseling - related course but I think might apply to other disciplines ) .With regard to student defensiveness , I wholeheartedly agree with Kimberly 's assessment of the situation .There are valid reasons why students resist this type of information ( at least valid from a perspective of psychological protection of one 's own ego and avoidance of anxiety ) or accepting it .Research on how people change suggests that the best intervention for those in this \" precontemplation \" stage is consciousness raising , but the person needs to be an active participant in that consciousness raising instead of just having ideas imposed on them .Kimberly suggests several good discussion prompts .I also have students read articles or chapters related to these concepts and then to reply to a few prompts in a reflective journal assignment ( ongoing across the semester ) .This has seemed to work quite well and offers the chance not only for class discussion of these issues , but individual dialogues with my students about their journals .All I have to say is keep up the good work , and it may be denial , or minimization of the facts , however , how else will they be able to explained their own identification with the oppressor .Please , require readings to get them ready is White Like Me , by Tim Wise or any thing on the movement of race theories of classism and oppressiveness .Hi I teach about inequality on an occupational therapy degree programme .We developed a tool and teaching methodology in order to raise the students ' critical thinking on the topic .It seems to work pretty well with our students - though of course they are predisposed to being empathetic to the difficulties of others having chosen a health and social care career .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.92987"}

{"text": "Wow , a great thoughtful thread on racism or what is racism .It 's really hard to find discourse on racism these days without the discussion backpeddling into simplistic conclusions in order to wrap up the discussion .I 'm also a minority ( Native ) .I 'm also undecided where I fully stand on this issue .I 've read white people on forums say that derogatory words like \" cracker , honkie \" etc , do n't offend them and they just laugh them off , implying that everyone should just laugh racial slurs off .However , is there really a history of negative connotations to those words ?I mean , I can only think of George Jefferson .Redneck , however , I think is more hard - hitting , because it implies an issue of status and education .There is history with the word \" redneck \" although how hard - hitting I 'm not entirely sure .I 've also noticed \" wigger \" is \" race - traitor \" or \" nigger - lover \" - only modernized .This next point is where I stray from many other people .The terms \" Uncle Tom \" \" Apple \" \" Banana \" \" Oreo \" and others are offensive to me .They suggest a race should be a certain way and that going against the grain of your ethnic culture is some great sin and you are deemed a traitor .Every member of every race is an individual , first and foremost , and that individuality must be cherished and protected .If someone is successful , they might be accused of trying to be \" white \" - as if only white people can be successful .However , there are some people who might sell out their culture completely and know they are doing this - those are the real Uncle Toms .I suppose those words are offensive to me because they are exercised too freely .I suppose my opinion agrees with both sides .Yes , anyone can be racist , but it certainly helps if one 's words are backed by societal power and long / on - going history of that power .It 's like a homosexual person making fun of a heterosexual person and someone trying to say it 's the same thing as godhatesfags dot com - O Rly ?[ ... ] If you missed the discussion in last Monday 's debate post , I encourage you to take some time to read the comments there .Very interesting things said and points raised .Tomorrow afternoon I 'm disabling comments , so if you have more to say you should , you know , say it now .[ ... ] .[ ... ] a lot when white people try to have a discussion about the word racism .Any time the concept of Prejudice + Power comes up , certain folks rush to m - w . com to prove that racism means exactly what it says online .[ ... ]", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.6662"}
