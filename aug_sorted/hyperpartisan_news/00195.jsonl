{"text": "Whether state and local governments have the legal right to be doing this is the subject of many court battles around the country since the Founding Fathers clearly gave Congress the sole authority to regulate immigration .But with a Congress seemingly paralyzed in its attempts to get a handle on immigration policy and with 1400 bills pending around the country , the new reality is that employers will need to comply with a whole new set of laws on top of the existing federal rules .The Arizona and Tennessee rules are similar in sanctioning employers who violate immigration laws with the revocation of their business licenses .This punishment is seemingly much more serious than the federal punishment of a fine since loss of a business license is really the death penalty for a business .Both rules provide a defense if employers have been complying with I-9 rules .Tennessee provides an additional safe harbor if employers have used the new E - Verify electronic employment verification system .Arizona goes a step further in actually mandating that all employers use E - Verify .This will represent a major expansion in the number of employers using E - Verify and it is far from clear whether the E - Verify system can handle the additional load .A recent report commissioned by the DHS itself noted that there is an unacceptable false positive rate and that as many as 10 % of naturalized citizens show up in the E - Verify as being unauthorized to work .Employers in Arizona had fought the new law and had been attempting to keep it from taking effect on the 1st .However , a judge has just denied an injunction order and the law will , in fact , take effect .An injunction is still holding in another measure aimed at employers - DHS ' social security number no match rule .DHS ' rule would sanction employers who are notified that their employees ' social security numbers and names do not match .One of the key issues in that case is also the high rate of false findings in the Social Security Administration database and the inability of that agency to resolve questions in a timely manner .However , DHS is promising to re - release a modified rule any day now that would attempt to meet the objections of the judge .2008 is likely to be a year of considerably more enforcement against employers violating immigration laws and we intend to cover the issue in great depth .To all of our readers around the world , all of us here at Siskind , Susser , Bland wish you all a year of peace , happiness and good health .December 20 , 2007 .Arizona about to implement draconian law .Arizona 's draconian measures to root out illegal labor are the subject of this editorial on 12/18 by the New York Times .\" On Jan. 1 , Arizona intends to become the first state to try to muscle its way out of its immigration problems on its own .That is when , barring a last - minute setback in court , it is to begin enforcing a new state law that harshly punishes businesses that knowingly hire undocumented immigrants .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.68759"}

Wade , America has aborted 45 million of her children .And Asia , Africa and Latin America have sent 45 million of their children to inherit the estate that aborted American children never saw .It goes without saying that claims that America has been built by and for White people are historically incorrect and intensely racist .More importantly , this country continues to be shaped by immigrants and draws immense political and economic strength from its diversity .Continuing in the vein of racial divisiveness is the idea that immigration rights advocates are themselves racist , a notion that has emerged in the post Obama election days .While television personality Glenn Beck has referred to President Obama as someone who was opposed to white people , he has generated the idea from numerous accusations of racism thrown at pro - immigration advocates during the 2007 push for reform .At that time , the radio host Michael Savage attacked the National Council of La Raza by calling it \" the Ku Klux Klan of the Hispanic people . \"He went on to say that it was \" the most stone racist group I 've ever seen in this country \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.327255"}

With the new Silver Line and shuttle services from Fairfax Connector and Washington Flyer , the 5A wo n't be as important .Cutting the service will save the region money , which makes a lot of sense with the new options coming online .Another option is to simply run the 5A between Wiehle Avenue and Dulles Airport .That duplicates the 981 and Washington Flyer services , but it would maintain the Metrobus brand as an option for getting to Dulles .A third option is to run the 5A only during times when a connection to Metrorail is not possible , like when the system is closed .The final option is to keep the existing service .There may be some merit to this approach , since an express from Dulles Airport to Downtown Washington would likely be faster than the multiple - stop rail service .But it is somewhat incongruous with the rest of the system , where suburban buses typically feed into the rail system .The B30 , for example , only runs to Greenbelt Station , not all the way downtown .New local stops on BWI service .The Metrobus B30 runs nonstop from Greenbelt station to BWI Airport .This bus service has proven to be very popular , and some trips on the route can be very crowded .Currently , the bus runs every 40 minutes throughout the day .Metro wants to shorten headways to 30 minutes during some periods , which should help alleviate crowding .The agency also wants to add a stop at Arundel Mills Mall , requiring a short detour from the Baltimore - Washington Parkway , which the B30 uses to get to the airport .In addition to the large collection of retailers , Arundel Mills is now home to one of Maryland 's new casinos , Maryland Live !There 's no other Metrobus service in this area .Since the B30 gets so close , Metro hopes to tap into the demand for more service here .A stop at Arundel Mills would also provide connections to other transit providers which serve the mall , including MTA local and commuter bus service , Howard Transit , and Central Maryland Regional Transit .But the diversion would add about 10 minutes to the trip time between Greenbelt and BWI .One other possible change is making the B30 more of a local service .Metro 's proposed restructuring of the 87/88/89 line will eliminate bus service along Powder Mill Road in the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center .Since the B30 uses this road to get to the B - W Parkway , Metro may allow it to serve stops along this corridor .These stops are very lightly used , so it probably wo n't add much time to trips .However , one effect of making local stops along Powder Mill is that the B30 wo n't be as flexible .If there 's a crash on the Parkway , today supervisors can send the bus up I-95 instead .That wo n't be an option if this change happens .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.20532"}
