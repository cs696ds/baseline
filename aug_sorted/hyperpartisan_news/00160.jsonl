{"text": "We do know that Stutzman wanted to keep some of Elkhart County and it was given to Walorski .Still , that seems like a small reason to jump into a race that should be an a quick and easy primary with a focus on the general election .For the Democrats , all seems to be quiet at this point outside of the 8th District where Bucshon has two Democrats fighting it out in a primary for a chance to go against him in the fall .Today , Mike Pence has officially announced to supporters that he will be running for Governor .A formal announcement will be held June 11th in Columbus .Speculation that Congressman Pence would run for Governor has been going on for nearly a year since Pence decided not to run for U.S. Senate against Evan Bayh .This was before now Sen. Coats got in the race and then Sen. Bayh got out of the race .The Congressman spent last fall out on the stump , helping all the close Congressional races and building his team .The announcement was supposed to be on Monday but was postponed due to the death of Osama bin Laden .And , of course , there was the issue of premature announcement yesterday when a pre - timed email was sent out by the campaign saying \" Mike for Indiana \" with blank text .We are sure someone got into some big trouble for that one .So where does this leave the race for Governor ?First , it leaves us waiting for an opponent .We do not believe there will be a viable primary challenger to Mike Pence .On the Democrat side , it seems to be looking like John Gregg for Governor with Joe Donnelly opting for the U.S. Senate race .Second , it leaves the race as a bit of a toss - up / leans Pence .Indiana is a Republican state but John Gregg is a conservative Democrat from the South and could potentially pose a threat .The real question for us is if Mike Pence can find a message that works for the General Election .While his strong , conservative stances on social issues have played well in conservative crowds nationally and here in Indiana , they may not be winning issues in a general election .President Obama will be on the ticket so that could be a challenge- unless Mitch Daniels is the Republican nominee and that would greatly benefit Indiana Republicans .This morning , we saw an article from the Journal Gazette on Congressman Marlin Sutzman 's fundraising for the quarter and it made us curious about the rest of the Indiana Delegation .Congressman Visclosky , District 1 : $ 73,568 raised , $ 469,547 cash on hand .Congressman Donnelly , District 2 : $ 363,288 raised , $ 338,286 cash on hand .Congressman Stutzman , District 3 : $ 59,937 raised , $ 33,184 cash on hand .Congressman Rokita , District 4 : $ 120,848 raised , $ 374,072 cash on hand .Congressman Burton , District 5 : $ 48,006 raised , $ 210,124 cash on hand .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.72628"}
{"text": "With just 16 days to go until the vote , the race could n't be tighter .Polls suggest a dead heat .Even Republican organizers concede the Democratic senator has benefited from his performance in the three presidential debates .And a Washington Post poll shows Kerry with a significant lead in important states that could decide the outcome of the election .The poll found Kerry held a 53 per cent to 43 per cent lead among likely voters in 13 such states .I was stunned to see some document showing Joe the Plumbers ' tax problems on my 10 pm ( CT)newscast on the local NBC affiliate in Chicago on Thursday night .They have very little time for any national news and they actually spent time on Joe the Plumbers ' tax problems .Amazing !But when an actual candidate - Barack Obama - released his tax returns , which on their face seemed to show an ethics violation of Illinois law , the press could n't care less .A bit over a week ago , WISH TV put out a poll on the AG race indicating a ten point Greg Zoeller lead over shady Democratic candidate Linda Pence .The extent of media advertising in the campaign has been that both candidates have each run a warm and fuzzy ad about how great they are .Zoeller 's ad has run statewide in every media market .Linda Pence 's ad has not ; it is not running in Terre Haute , Evansville , or Louisville .That would seem to indicate that Pence is ceding the entire southern and southwestern regions of the state to Greg Zoeller .WISH does n't provide crosstabs on its polling , so we do n't know the regional breakdowns , party identification numbers , ideological ratios , name identification numbers , or anything else .In the southern part of the state , Zoeller benefits from his famous last name , shared with a popular local golfer who happens to be his cousin .In the eastern part of the state , Linda Pence benefits from sharing the name of a popular conservative congressman who has absolutely nothing in common with her and probably finds her defense of shady characters and corrupt Democrats to be abhorent .So what does a poll asking voters their preference tell us ?Presumably , the question was something like this : \" In the race for attorney general , will you vote for Republican Greg Zoeller or Democrat Linda Pence ?The most distinguishing things in that question are not the names of the candidates .Their name ID is probably still relatively low , their media buys have done little to distinguish them , and there are regional considerations that are probably a wash .The most distinguishing things in that question are the political parties of the candidates .I would contend that the WISH poll tells us less about the race for AG than it tells us about the current breakdown in partisan identification in Indiana .In their most recent presidential poll , Survey USA ( which is the only poll taken in Indiana that makes crosstabs publicly available ) places party identification in Indiana at being 38 % Republican , 37 % Democrat , and 18 % independent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.73593"}

{"text": "The Speaker 's ruling yesterday focused on what was required to maintain decorum in the House , which is fine .The Speaker implied that the rules of the House did not give him the authority to recognize the displaying of the Canadian flag on the desks of members .The motion before the House is designed to change the rules and simply give that authority .Like you , Mr. Speaker , we have taken into account rules , practices and precedents affecting this House , but our position on this issue also takes into account what we believe to be the wishes of the Canadian people to whom this House ultimately belongs .Since the government spin doctors have been hard at work putting their interpretation on this matter , let me first say what this motion is not .It is not a motion of censure of the Speaker or the way in which the Speaker handled this issue .This caucus is composed of blunt plain speaking westerners who tend to say what we mean and mean what we say .We prefer to argue and to agree and disagree out in the open and not behind closed doors .But this penchant for plain speaking should not be interpreted as any disrespect for the House or for the Chair .Second , this motion is not intended as a putdown of any members of this House , including members of the Bloc Quebecois .It is a simple positive affirmation of Canadian nationalism .The members of the Bloc never tire of exhibiting their feelings of nationalism in words , symbols and actions and their efforts to separate Quebec from Canada .We , however , simply want to remind the Bloc that there is also such a thing as Canadian nationalism .Some people wear their nationalism on their sleeves and its slogans are always on their lips .Other people are less vocal and carry their feelings for their country deep in their hearts .It would be a huge miscalculation on the part of the Bloc to believe that those feelings do not exist in the hearts of Canadians or that they can be ignored or insulted with impunity .My third point is that one member of this House chose to see in our simple request to put a Canadian flag on our desks an example of extreme nationalism like that which led to World War II .How anyone could characterize our simple request in that fashion is beyond comprehension .I choose to believe the member misspoke himself or was perhaps misquoted .I address the remainder of my remarks to government members .One of the disturbing characteristics of this government is that it seems unable or unwilling to finish what it starts , a sign of a government and a party in decline .For example , the government started to get the federal fiscal house in order but after eliminating the deficit , which is only the first step , it appears to be giving up on the other steps of reducing the debt , reducing the taxes and controlling the spending .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.38577"}

{"text": "Why would I say that ?Well , after yesterday 's game against Middle Tennessee , I can give several reasons .First , let me say that we 've heard Nick Saban preaching about complacency after the team won three National Championships in four years .Each new year brought the challenge of finding an identity of their own and gaining respect week after week for what they have done .Case in point - we do n't have Blake Sims roaming the field this year , do we ?No , once again the team is forced to find a starting quarterback and many of you forget that it took Blake four years before he was the starter , and AJ McCarron did his understudy work with Greg McElroy .The point being that every new year is a new team so they can not get complacent .That same sense of entitlement , though , has seeped into the fan base and the expectations , while I agree they should be hopefully high , have led to some rather uncalled - for comments and unkind words .Take , for example , the second field goal missed by Adam Griffith yesterday .I 'm not sure how many people knew that it had been tipped and an opponent got a hand on the ball after it left his foot , but when it did not go through the uprights we actually heard ..... 'booing ' from the crowd .How dare you ?Oh , I know - he gets a scholarship to MAKE these field goals , not miss them , right ?Well , let me ask - when was the last time you had 101,821 people watching you at work AND you were perfect ?More importantly , how perfect were you when you were in your early 20 's ?Ah , not so much , huh ?I hope to never hear that again from anyone in that stadium .Sadly , I have no control and many of you are still asking who I am to ask this of you .I 'm no one .I 'm just an ' Everyman ' that enjoys the privilege and honor of watching one of , if not THE , most storied programs in all of college football every Saturday in the fall .While we 're at it , these players and coaches , as well as opponents , give up much to provide the entertainment you all desire on Saturday afternoons .They sacrifice much to be on that field and they deserve to have people in the stands cheering them on .It is our part of the equation and The Process - they promise to do their part , now we have to do our part .Park your ass in the seat and stay for the entire game - they deserve that and though you might want to beat traffic and the crowds , they never get to leave early .You wanted this and we have it - a championship - quality team every year .Would you rather have a team on the same level as , say , Kentucky or Kansas ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.39064"}

{"text": "Concerns about the circulation of violent material arise primarily from the fear that exposure to this kind of material trivializes the real phenomenon of violence or encourages people to resort to violence .To this general concern is naturally added the concern to protect children .Striking a balance between freedom of expression and a justified control of material harmful to society is not easy .For example , in 1996 , there was an American bill , the Decency Act , which was intended to criminalize the distribution of pornographic material , but it was declared unconstitutional .Considering how difficult it is to establish the identity of a user , the effect of that legislation was to restrict the freedom of expression of the distributors on the one hand , but also the right of adult users to receive information on the other hand .This clause does not solve all of the problems relating to use of the Internet , and others , but it does engage a debate , which makes us reflect as lawmakers .The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of this more thorough analysis .Clause 2 addresses sexual assault against children .There is most certainly nothing more abhorrent than sex crimes involving children .Children are the incarnation of everything that is most fragile in our society .When someone decides to sully the innocence of our young people , society as a whole suffers .Children are arguably our most precious resource .How , then , can such acts not be vigorously denounced ?How can we understand someone stooping so low as to commit such monstrous acts ?A lawmaker can not remain indifferent to offences of this nature .The bill of the hon .member for Oxford is intended to offer some elements of a response to these questions .Clause 2 of the bill provides for special sentencing of those found guilty of sexually assaulting children .This bill would add to section 271 of the Criminal Code , which pertains to sexual offences , and include in it a special regime for cases when children are the victims .The sentence proposed is harsh : imprisonment for life .This sentence is sought when the crime is particularly heinous , but that is what he are dealing with in cases of sexual assault of children .Nevertheless , while the bill is severe , the member proposes certain application criteria that would require the courts to evaluate certain characteristics of the victim .Clause 2 thus provides that imprisonment for life would apply when the child involved is under the age of eight years or under the age of fourteen years and in the trust of or dependent on the offender .It should be pointed out that the Criminal Code currently provides a defence that the offender charged under section 271 could use .The problem is that the bill makes no mention of section 150(1 ) .Once again , we agree with the content , with the objective of clause 2 , but I believe it lacks some refinement to really achieve the intended objective .Clause 3 deals with the confinement of a child or ward .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.67106"}

{"text": "However , there is a pattern .The government is weak .When action is needed there is a pattern of Liberal government weakness .While this government is introducing legislation which deals with technology and privacy it has neglected to make the necessary Criminal Code amendments to protect our children from the perverts who surf the net .It is not surprising given the low priority this government places on the protection of society and in particular our children .We have discovered sex slavery in Canada and sadly we have juvenile prostitution in every major city .The government has done little while at the same time shuts down private members ' bills that deal with these things .The government is weak .Despite claiming in June , 1997 that revamping the Young Offenders Act was a priority , the justice minister has failed to bring one single amendment .The minister 's failure in this regard has put our children who are most often the victims of crime at needless risk .We also support the increase in the maximum penalty for forcible confinement from 10 to 14 years in the case of a parent or a ward who confines a child and thereby harms the child 's physical or mental health .I do , however , question the age of eight years .In 1994 the Liberal government refused to amend the Young Offenders Act to include 10 and 11 year olds , claiming they were much too young to be held accountable for their criminal behaviour .I therefore have to wonder why the hon .member for Oxford has not at least included 10 and 11 year olds .I would recommend including children up to the age of at least 13 , in recognition of the vulnerability of children within this tender age group .I also find it questionable that the member for Oxford has proposed what can only be considered a heavy penalty , one which would not be supported by a majority of his own 1700 colleagues .In 1995 a majority of Liberal members voted against eliminating the faint hope clause for murderers .I question why this member and his Liberal colleagues would ever agree to put a child molester behind bars for a minimum of 25 years when they have repeatedly failed to keep murderers locked away for at least the 25 years .Let us not forget that it was the Liberal Party which gave us the faint hope clause , claiming some hope must be given to first degree murderers .Clifford Olson raped and killed 11 innocent children and after serving only 15 years of his life sentence this sadistic killer took full advantage of the Liberal made faint hope clause and applied for early release .I might add that the former justice minister is directly responsible for Olson 's full press court .The former justice minister failed to bring in Bill C-45 in time to prevent Olson from once again terrorizing these victims ' families .There was plenty of warning .There was no excuse .I and many of my colleagues were there the day Olson , to the horror of the nation , was once again terrorizing his victims ' families .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.33266"}
