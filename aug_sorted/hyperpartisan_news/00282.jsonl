Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , has backed New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly , a 69-year - old former top Treasury law enforcement official who some believe would rather run for mayor of New York .The FBI Agents Association has recommended Michael Mason , a 23-year bureau veteran who ran the Washington field office and became executive assistant director in charge of the bureau 's criminal investigative division .Mason would be the FBI 's first black director .One possible candidate with a strong background fighting terrorism who served in the Bush administration : Michael J.

{"text": "When the entire country is transfixed on Democrats , when Democrats are forced to compete everywhere , and when large donors are out of money , amazing things can happen .It appears that creating nationwide excitement is a more effective way of building up the party rather than falling sheepishly in line after New Hampshire .Does a divisive primary hurt the general election chances of the nominee who emerges from that primary ?In short , the answer is no .Perhaps the most relevant study is by Lonna Rae Atkeson ( here , gated ) .She examines presidential elections from 1936 - 1996 and finds that the relative divisiveness of the two parties ' primaries is not related to the general election outcome , once other factors , namely the state of the economy and the popularity of the incumbent president , are taken into account .The logic is this : a divisive primary is more likely to arise if an incumbent is unpopular or presiding over a weak economy , simply because this incumbent will attract more challengers .Leaving the economy and presidential popularity out of the equation risks overestimating the effects of divisiveness .Nyhan has the executive summary of the study ( and this is important to note because simplistic comparisons like these can be unintentionally misleading ) : .Divisive Primaries and General Election Outcomes : Another Look at Presidental Campaigns .Lonna Rae Atkeson .American Journal of Political Science , Vol .42 , No . 1 .( Jan. , 1998 ) , pp .256 - 271 .Theory : The divisive primary hypothesis asserts that the more divisive the presidential primary contest compared to that of the other party the fewer votes received in the general election .Thus the party candidate with the most divisive primary will have a more difficult general election fight .However , studies at the presidential level have failed to consider candidate quality , prior vulnerability of the incumbent president or his party , the national nature of the presidential race , and the unique context of each presidential election campaign .Once these factors are taken into account presidential primaries should have a more marginal or even nonexistent effect in understanding general election outcomes .Hypothesis : Including appropriate controls for election year context in a state - by - state model and creating a national model that controls for election year context , candidate quality , and the nature of the times should diminish the effect of nomination divisiveness on general election outcomes .Methods : Regression analysis is used to examine the effect of presidential divisive nomination campaigns on general election outcomes .Results : Once election year context in the state - by - state model is controlled for , divisiveness has a much more modest effect .This modest effect does not appear to change general election outcomes .In addition , the election year model , which posits that presidential elections are national elections and not state - by - state elections , indicated that divisiveness was not significantly different from zero .Like the calls for Al Gore to concede the presidency to George Bush in November 2000 , this anxiety about the imagined consequences of a protracted fight misreads both history and the calendar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.779022"}

Bernie Sanders ( D - VT ) had an astonishingly excellent night ( some might say \" yuge \" ) , it could be his own Little Bighorn .Yes , it 's a big deal that the prohibitive nominee of the Democratic Party got clobbered by double - digits , lost young and suburban women , voters under 50 , and every income bracket below those who make $ 200k or more .Betsy Woodruff and Jackie Kucinich wrote about how the Sanders campaign just out - worked and outmaneuvered the Clinton machine in New Hampshire , along with running into Bernie supporters who voiced their distrust of Clinton - and their disgust over Madeline Albright and feminist Gloria Steinem 's remarks .Albright said there is a special place in hell for women who do n't back Hillary ; Steinem said that women support Sanders because they want to attract men , or something .In fact , support for Sanders is so deep , that some will back the disheveled democratic socialist - and no one else .Numerous Sanders supporters flatly stated that they would under no circumstances back Clinton , citing the criticisms of her that Sanders brings up on the stump every day .Ashley Bays of Quincy , Massachusetts , who came to New Hampshire to volunteer for Sanders , said she would \" absolutely not \" back Clinton , ever .\" It would be completely against my ideals , \" she said .\" Hillary is obviously not thinking about the best interests of the people , \" she continued .\" She 's thinking about the corporations that fund her , Goldman Sachs . \"Peggie Greenough , a New Hampshire voter who came to the party along with her husband and three sons , said she would n't vote for Clinton if she 's the nominee .\" I do n't trust her , \" she said .\" I do n't trust her at all . \"Marilyn DeLuca , of Londonderry , New Hampshire also said Sanders is \" the only candidate out there \" with integrity .And she was n't exactly enthralled by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem 's goofy arguments that women are obligated to back Clinton .\" They 're irrelevant , \" DeLuca said .\" Their time has come and gone . \"\" I have two daughters in their twenties , \" she added , \" and they were so angry when they heard that . \"Based on the exits , it 's an old Guard vs. new order rumble , and the new order won - or did it ?As Stephen wrote earlier today , Clinton got slaughtered , but left with more delegates than Sanders thanks to the Democratic superdelegate system that allows party officials who can back anyone in this contest .So , even if Sanders won , he lost .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.18525"}

Clinton completely understands the need to focus on regions that are outside the traditional \" safe \" zones for Democrats .For her Senate race , she certainly did not need to focus on Republican strongholds in one of the bluest states ( NY ) but she did - repeatedly - and it paid dividends for her .In fact , in so many states , Sen.

{"text": "If Mr. Kennedy is feeling no great financial pressure to get out of the race , \" the New York Times reported on June 11 , \" he also appears to be feeling no great pressure to withdraw to avoid splitting the Democratic party . \"Days before the convention , Kennedy announced he would break precedent to become the first Democrat since William Jennings Bryan to address the convention before the first roll call - the gesture of an active candidate , not a peacemaker .He ultimately surrendered at the convention itself .A swift resolution eluded the Democrats once more in 1984 .Starting with an upset in the New Hampshire primary , Colorado Sen. Gary Hart mounted a surprisingly effective challenge to former Vice President Walter Mondale , who had long been the presumptive nominee .Mondale retook the lead in a March 12 debate when he punctured the image of Hart as a bearer of new ideas with the line from a Wendy 's commercial , \" Where 's the beef ? \" Hart , however , refused to quit , scoring primary wins in Wisconsin , Ohio , California , and elsewhere .Though trailing in delegates , Hart sought ways to stay alive after the primaries , threatening a challenge to some of Mondale 's delegates .At length , on June 25 , he effectively threw in the towel , appearing with Mondale to announce the end of his delegate challenge , though he still had his name placed in nomination at the July convention .In the last two decades , Democrats have arrived at a nominee faster - yet the contests still dragged on longer than popular memory suggests .Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis is remembered as having sewn up his nomination rapidly .But he did n't earn the label of presumptive nominee until April 21 , when he beat Tennessee 's Al Gore in the New York primary .And Jesse Jackson - whom the press never treated as a viable candidate , despite numerous primary victories - stayed in the race into June , when Dukakis nailed down the delegates he needed .June was also the magic month for Bill Clinton in 1992 , as Hillary has been reminding us recently .Clinton had been confident of getting the party 's nod since March , when his chief adversary , former Massachusetts Sen. Paul Tsongas , suspended his bid .But Jerry Brown , again playing spoiler , dogged Clinton throughout the remaining primaries , forcing him to limp rather than sprint to victory , as the New York Times put it .Although the intraparty warfare sometimes got ugly in these races , and pundits warned of its harmful consequences , there 's little evidence to suggest that it ever made a substantial difference in the fall election .In 1976 and 1992 , the Democrats won .In 1972 , 1980 , and 1984 , they surely would have lost anyway .In 1988 , Dukakis met defeat because of his weak general - election campaign , not his springtime battles with Gore and Jackson .It 's true that Gore had attacked him over a Massachusetts prison furlough program and that George H.W. Bush infamously followed suit , making Willie Horton part of the annals of negative campaigning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.69775"}

[ ... ] .Right now we have a decentralized system where students can take much of their student aid with them to the institution of their choosing .This enables a wide variety of organizations - public and private - to offer a range of different educational programs .In contrast , free public college would limit choice as many private institutions , now trying to compete with a highly - subsidized , free public option , would likely struggle to survive .In addition to reducing options , this would significantly reduce pressure on public institutions to serve students effectively .Many free college proponents would likely point out that by providing aid directly to institutions , the government can actually exert more direct control over how they operate .For example , Sanders ' bill would require institutions to reduce their reliance on adjunct professors .But are such top - down controls really likely to create the dynamic and innovative system that we need ?By trying to dictate innovation from Washington , such a proposal is more likely to create a system that is rigid , bureaucratic and unresponsive to the changing needs of students and the economy over time .[ ... ] . ...there are a remarkable number of regulatory barriers preventing new and innovative educational institutions from gaining a foothold .Thus , what occurs naturally in other industries - innovative market entrants shaking up the status quo - rarely occurs in higher education .Policymakers must work to clear out unnecessary regulatory underbrush that impedes new options .Fundamentally , the \" price \" of free public college is more than the money taxpayers would spend on it .By moving us to a system based largely on public institutions managed through top - down regulation , Sanders ' proposal would exacerbate the challenges above , not solve them .He also wrote that we should \" foster more entrepreneurship in higher education , \" and force colleges to have more skin in the game , instead of just worrying about meeting enrollment quotas and graduation rates ; they should be invested more in the outcome of their students .The huge part of this will come from the entrepreneurial side , which under socialism , can not thrive .Here We Go : Voting Underway New Hampshire , Trump and Sanders Are Frontrunners .Tuesday , February 9 .By Guy Benson .MANCHESTER , NH -- Coming out of Iowa , a few narratives began to congeal : Hillary is going to struggle to put Bernie away .Trump is n't a mirage , but his support is overstated , and he 's beatable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.73274"}

Roosevelt Jr. to suggest that Humphrey had been a draft dodger during World War ll .The accusations were mendacious in that Humphrey failed his medical examination because of a hernia .Roosevelt later withdrew his charge , but the damage was done .Kennedy won the nomination .Romney first sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 .Though Romney had waged a vigorous campaign in Iowa , spending millions , he lost by nine points to former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee .Half of the state 's caucus goers were evangelical voters , and that group backed Huckabee , a fellow evangelical , over Romney by 27 percentage points .Romney was then embarrassed by U.S. Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) in Romney 's neighboring state of New Hampshire .By working the townhall circuit , McCain overcame a 12-point deficit to defeat Romney .Romney was also hurt by opponents who portrayed him as a \" flip flopper \" for his change of position on a litany of issues , including abortion , climate change , and his support for President Ronald Reagan .McCain later bested Romney in Romney 's birth state of Michigan and went on to pocket the nomination .Despite a bitter campaign , McCain considered picking Romney as his vice presidential running mate , but ultimately chose the more provocative and charismatic Alaska Governor Sarah Palin .In 1964 , Humphrey was selected by Kennedy 's successor , Lyndon B. Johnson , to be his vice presidential runningmate .In 1968 , when Johnson , fatigued from the escalation of the war in Vietnam , announced that he would not seek re - election as President , Humphrey entered the race as the establishment Democrat candidate .While Humphrey garnered support with the blue - collar base of the Democratic Party , and much of party high command , he became an anathema to the party 's \" new left .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.85599"}

Bernie Sanders , former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has whole - heartedly embraced Obamacare , promising to build on it .\" Before it was called Obamacare , it was called Hillarycare , \" she has been saying regularly on the campaign trail .She 'll own Obamacare and its problems going into the general election assuming she 's the nominee , and according to the schedule put out by HHS , insurers who wish to participate in Obamacare will have to submit their initial rates in the late spring .After back and forth with HHS over the summer , they 'll start to become finalized in the fall .That means for months leading up to the election , voters are going to be hearing more and more about staggering rate increases coming in 2017 .And this year , open enrollment - when individuals shopping for insurance can start to go online and see the premiums on new plans -- begins on Nov. 1 , or just one week before the election .Considering that Republicans owe their current House and Senate majorities to Obamacare , this should be a scary thought for Democrats .Yes , Obamacare is Hillary care -- and yes , she 's doubling - down on its failure as a means of bludgeoning Bernie Sanders ' unaffordable single - payer fantasy .Klein runs through additional indicators of Obamacare 's \" rocky start \" to 2016 : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.87816"}

Long .Coolidge won largely because of his association as Lieutenant Governor with the popular outgoing Republican Governor Samuel W. McCall .The next year , the unassuming , low key Coolidge became a hero in conservative quarters .The Boston Police went on strike after the city 's police commissioner , Edwin U. Curtis , denied them the right to join the American Federation of Labor ( AFL ) .With the city in a near state of anarchy , Coolidge ordered the Massachusetts National Guard to supplant the Boston police officers during the strike .The Guard succeeded in reestablishing order in the city .Coolidge became a political folk hero to conservatives when his response to a letter written to him by AFL President Samuel Gompers was disseminated .Coolidge wrote to Gompers : \" There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody , anywhere , at any time .\" Similar to the recall election with Walker , Coolidge 's 1919 re - election campaign became a referendum on Coolidge 's leadership during that strike ( At the time , Massachusetts Governors were elected to one - year terms ) .Unions worked feverishly for Richard H.

{"text": "There is a cap on votes a candidate can muster from urban areas .To be victorious , he / she must appeal to voters throughout the state .Under a national popular vote , we would see the same scenario .It would be politically foolhardy , if not politically suicidal for any candidate to focus solely on urban areas .Does Your Vote Count ?Maybe Not !Under the current winner - take - all electoral scheme , millions of votes across the nation are not being counted in the official national tally .In the 2008 Presidential election , Republican nominee John McCain received more than five million votes in the state of California .Despite this achievement , all 55 electors in California cast their vote for Democrat Barack Obama .This inequity occurred solely because California uses the winner - take - all system of awarding electoral votes , meaning that despite how close the popular vote may be , the winning candidate takes home \" all \" the electoral votes of that particular state .Similarly , more than 3.5 million Texans marked ballots for Barack Obama , yet because John McCain won the state , those 3.5 million votes were disregarded .Again , because Texas also uses the winner - take - all system of electoral voting , the winning candidate , John McCain , was able to take home \" all \" of Texas ' 33 electoral votes .This all - to - common outcome disenfranchises voters from \" safe states \" ( non - battlefield states ) and discourages them from going to the polls .They know that their votes are not likely to even be figured in the final national tally .In addition , non - major party candidates who appeal mainly to just one region of the country can take full advantage of the winner - take - all system .Their vote totals are magnified in the Electoral College .In 1948 , Strom Thurmond , the nominee of the States Rights Democratic Party , captured just 2.4 % of the national vote , yet he received 39 electoral votes from four southern states .This scenario repeated itself in 1968 when American Independence Party nominee George Wallace , who won just 13.5 % of the national vote , won 46 electoral votes because he managed to win five southern states .Alternatively , those who vote for centrist Independent candidates who appeal to a more widespread cross - section of constituencies and garner votes from all regions of the nation , have seen their votes completely nullified by the Electoral College .In 1980 , Independent Presidential candidate John B. Anderson garnered 6.6 % of the national vote , yet the over 5.7 million people who voted for him were not counted in the final tally because he failed to win a single state .This scenario was experienced on a larger scale in 1992 , when Independent Presidential candidate H. Ross Perot mustered a very respectable 18.9 % of the vote .Despite the fact that nearly one in five American voters cast their vote for Perot , Perot received \" 0 \" votes in the Electoral College .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.37149"}
{"text": "There was actually an election where one vote literally decided the winner of a statewide election .The closest Gubernatorial election ever recorded in U.S. history occurred in Massachusetts in 1839 .At the time , a candidate was required to garner a majority of the votes to win the election .Otherwise , the State legislature would choose the winner .The legislature was controlled by the Whig Party , which would almost assuredly have voted to re - elect incumbent Governor Edward Everett , the Whig nominee .However , his opponent , Democrat Marcus Morton , garnered 51,034 votes of 102,066 votes cast , giving Morton a majority by a single vote margin .Had just one vote switched , Morton would not have won the majority , and thus would have lost the election .Amazingly , the Secretary of the Commonwealth , H.A.S. Dearborn , a devoted Whig and Everett supporter , did not cast a vote .Neither did some members of the Whig high command , prompting Everett to bemoan : \" A better mode of showing [ their support ] would have been to vote . \"Similarly , in 1974 , a U.S. Senate election in New Hampshire was decided by just two votes out of 223,363 votes cast .On Election Day , Republican Louis Wyman was declared the winner by just 355 votes .His Democratic opponent , John A. Durkin , subsequently asked for a recount .The recount showed Durkin had actually won the election by 10 votes .Wyman then asked for another recount .This time it was Wyman who was the winner by a measly two votes .Undeterred , Drukin then appealed the election to the Democratically - controlled U.S. Senate .But the Senate could not resolve the dispute .Finally , after a seven - month deadlock , Wyman asked Durkin to run in a Special election .Durkin agreed .The election garnered national attention because it was the only Congressional election during the off year .It became a referendum on the economic policies of President Gerald R. Ford .In fact , Ford participated in a 136-mile motorcade in the state five days prior to the election in a futile attempt to keep the seat in Republican hands .Durkin won the Special election by 27,000 votes .South Dakota has been the epicenter of close elections .In 1962 , George McGovern was elected to the U.S. Senate by just 597 votes out of 254,139 cast .In 1978 , Tom Daschle was elected to the U.S. House by just 139 votes out of 129,227 votes .In 2002 , South Dakota Democrat Tim Johnson was re - elected by just 524 votes out of 334,458 votes tabulated .Close elections can alter the course of history .The 1948 election to the U.S. Senate of Lyndon B. Johnson illustrates this point .In 1941 , Johnson lost a special election to fill the seat of the late U.S. Senator Morris Sheppard by just 1,311 votes out of 988,295 cast .In 1948 , Johnson was on the other side of a photo finish , defeating former Governor Coke Stevenson by just 87 votes out of 988,395 cast .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.39875"}

Bush in 2000 , were both early frontrunners with the preponderance of the GOP grand poobahs backing them .However , both candidates faltered , then recovered to pocket the nomination .The elder Bush finished an embarrassing third place in Iowa before coming back to win in New Hampshire .The junior Bush lost New Hampshire by a bone crushing 18 percentage points before reviving his campaign by winning in South Carolina .The best example of an early frontrunner faltering and then rebounding was U.S. Senator John Kerry ( D - MA ) in 2004 .In many respects , Kerry 's predicament is a mirror image of Jeb Bush 's predicament today .Both candidates have milquetoast personalities , a patrician pedigree , and a cerebral persona .In 2003 , former Vermont Governor Howard Dean took a commanding lead in the polls by spotlighting his opposition to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2002 .Kerry had voted for the resolution to invade .The resolution gave President George W. Bush the authorization to invade .Just a month prior to the Iowa caucuses , Kerry was mustering just 4 % of the vote .However , under the stewardship of campaign manager Mary Beth Cahill , union support , and an improved ground game , Kerry became focused like a laser beam on winning in Iowa .Fortunately for Kerry , many voters came to think Dean as too far left and thus unelectable .In addition , Dean and U.S. Representative Richard Gephardt ( D - MO ) engaged in mutually assured destruction by assiduously attacking each other on the airwaves .The result is that both candidates fell in the polls .Kerry , as the default choice , rose to the top and won the caucuses .His momentum continued into the New Hampshire primaries and propelled him to the nomination .Contrariwise , in 1963 , New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller was the establishment choice for the Republican nomination and was the early frontrunner .At the time , the establishment was comprised of mostly moderate and liberal Republicans .Like Bush and Kerry , he had the backing of his party 's high command .However , Rockefeller failed to excite the GOP base .The party had not nominated a bone fide conservative since Calvin Coolidge in 1924 , and the party 's conservative base , situated mostly in the South and Midwest , launched a mutiny on the establishment in an effort to nominate an indubitably conservative candidate .In response , Rockefeller antagonized conservatives by waging war on what he called \" extremist groups .\" Riled conservatives who resented the characterization of being branded as extreme , campaigned full - throttle for U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater ( R - AZ ) , an unreserved conservative who called for the party to move to the right .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.676926"}

Roosevelt , particularly with respect to public utilities .A draft movement began for Willkie to run for the 1940 GOP presidential nomination .The party was split among four candidates .Willkie pocketed the nomination on the sixth ballot at the convention .While most rank - and - file Republicans supported him in the general election , many were wary of a nominee who was not a politician and who had just recently joined the party .U.S. Senator James E. Watson ( R - IN ) quipped : \" I do n't mind the Church converting a whore , but I do n't like her to lead the choir the first night .\"During the general election , Willkie often appeared to be uncomfortable with his new party affiliation .He would often refer to Republicans as : \" You Republicans , \" and appeared uncomfortable in the Republican Party .Willkie ran a respectable presidential campaign , but could not overcome the popular Roosevelt who won an unprecedented third term as president .In 1992 , billionaire industrialist H. Ross Perot issued a challenge to his supporters on the CNN program Larry King Live to get him on the ballot in all 50 states and the District of Columbia .His supporters rose to the occasion .At a time when Americans were disaffected with the partisan paralysis , Perot 's independent candidacy appealed to a widespread cross - section of constituencies .In addition to Independent voters , Perot 's economic nationalism appealed to voters who had supported Democrat Jerry Brown and Republican Pat Buchanan in the presidential primaries .Perot 's focus on deficit reduction appealed to supporters of Democrat Paul Tsongas , who had made fiscal austerity his flagship issue during the primary .A June Gallup poll showed Perot actually leading in the popular vote at 39 percent .However , Perot soon abandoned his presidential candidacy , stating that he did not want to split the vote in the Electoral College , resulting in the election being thrown into the U.S. Congress .Perot later reentered the race , explaining that the real reason he had dropped out was that a Republican operative had threatened to sabotage his daughter 's wedding .Despite this erratic episode , Perot performed well in the presidential debates and won 18.9 percent of the vote .Perot ran again in 1996 , but did not muster enough support to be invited into the debates .He garnered just 8.4 percent of the vote in that election .In 1996 , Morry Taylor , the CEO of Titan Tire Corporation , spent about $ 6 million in his bid for the GOP presidential nomination , only to pull out of the race after garnering less than 1 percent of the vote .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.06596"}

Security Council Resolution 1973 for military intervention in Libya .On that day Clinton ordered a general within the Pentagon to refuse to take a call from Gadhafi 's son Seif and other high - level members within the regime , to help negotiate a resolution .A day later , on March 18 , 2011 , Gadhafi himself called for a cease - fire , another action the administration dismissed .In released , but redacted emails , Clinton expressed interest in arming Libyan opposition groups using private security contractors , though at the time , the opposition was not formally recognized by the U.S. or United Nations , which prohibited arming without following strict guidelines and oversight .In an April 8 , 2011 email to her then - deputy chief of staff , Jake Sullivan , Clinton wrote : \" FYI .The idea of using private security experts to arm the opposition should be considered , \" attaching an intelligence report from adviser Sidney Blumenthal , her preferred source of intelligence .Many of those weapons would ultimately be destined for Syria .The cargo reportedly included surface - to - air anti - aircraft missiles , RPG 's and Russian - designed shoulder - launched missiles known as MANPADS , all believed destined for Syrian rebel groups .Both Obama and Clinton had a vested interest in lying about Benghazi and permanently concealing the truth ; Obama to ensure his reelection prospects in 2012 and Hillary to protect hers for 2016 .It is significant , however , that Clinton was the most aggressive administration official promoting the arming of the Libyan Islamists and the first to associate the video with the Benghazi attack ( see timeline ) as well as its most vigorous and persistent advocate . \"The present Shia - Sunni civil war in Iraq was fueled by American abdication of a foreign policy in Syria , where we sub - contracted our interests to Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Turkey .Instead of dealing directly with the moderate Free Syrian Army , we outsourced the funding and arming responsibilities .They then pursued their own interests ; the Saudis supporting radical Islamic Salafis , while the Turks and Qataris backed the Muslim Brotherhood , all of which was at least partially meant to counter growing Iranian influences in the region , but complicating America 's anti - terrorism efforts . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.33029"}

Arthur , also a supporter of Conkling .As with Morton , Conkling beseeched Arthur not to accept the nomination .Arthur refused Conkling 's request and was nominated as Vice president .The ticket scraped out a victory and Garfield assumed the Presidency .Garfield was subsequently assassinated in just his first year in office .Arthur , not Morton , assumed the Presidency .Four years later , James G. Blaine , now the GOP presidential nominee , made a strategic blunder by not dissociating himself from a supporter .This faux pas likely cost Blaine the election .A few days before the 1884 presidential election , Republican presidential nominee James G. Blaine made a campaign appearance in New York , where Presbyterian Minister Samuel Burchard , a Blaine supporter , excoriated the Democrats as the Party of \" Rum , Romanticism , and Rebellion .\" Blaine sat silent during this tirade , making no effort to disassociate himself from these volatile remarks .Unfortunately for the unsuspecting Blaine , many Irish voters took umbrage by the use of the word \" rum , \" believing that the Minister was perpetuating a stereotype that Irish - Americans , who were mostly Democrats , were alcoholics .This galvanized the Irish vote against Blaine in the swing state of New York , where Democrat Grover Cleveland eked out a razor - thin victory , defeating Blaine by just 1,047 votes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.08435"}

Bernie Sanders ' ( D - VT ) numbers , given that young voters are overwhelmingly backing him in this primary .The publication added that there would be something of a \" political earthquake \" if either Sanders or Trump should lose .The chances of that , albeit very slim , is more on the Republican side , though that still does n't mean that people will be watching who will be the runner - up in the GOP contest .The historic high turnout could also help the anti - establishment wings of both parties , and if Christie , Fiorina , Carson , Kasich , and Bush do poorly tonight , they should all consider doing something else than running for president .Top Clinton Aides Abedin and Sullivan Sent Classified Info on Personal Email Accounts , Too .Tuesday , February 9 .By Katie Pavlich .The rest , she reassured , was turned over to the Department as required .Considering the Inspector General reviewing the case had to obtain special clearance to handle a number of Clinton 's emails because of the high level of sensitive material contained within them , the answer to that question is likely no .Judicial Watch today released nearly 70 pages of State Department records that show that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides , Deputy Chiefs of Staff Huma Abedin and Jake Sullivan , received and sent classified information on their non - state .gov email accounts .gov email account ) to print two March 2011 emails , which were sent from former British Prime Minister Tony Blair ( using the moniker \" aclb \" ) to Jake Sullivan on Sullivan 's non - state .gov email account .The Obama State Department redacted the Blair emails under Exemption ( b)(1 ) which allows the withholding of classified material .The material is marked as being classified as \" Foreign government information \" and \" foreign relations or foreign activities of the US , including confidential sources .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.16463"}

Palmer of the Pro - Gold Standard National Democratic Party .In response , the Republican Party countered by straying away from its liberal beginnings and nominating the moderate - conservative Ohio Governor William McKinley , who , like Harrison , was a proponent of a strong protective tariff , but who , unlike Harrison , favored the Gold Standard .This incensed many old - line progressive Republicans .Some even defected to the Democratic Party to support Bryan .McKinley won handily and was re - elected in a rematch with Bryan in 1900 .The paradigm of the Democrats being the center - right party and the Republicans being the center - left party remained for much of the nineteenth century .The Bryan nomination ushered in a period of ideological bifurcation within the two major parties , resulting in an era where both parties had a liberal and a conservative bloodline .Liberals and conservatives had a long cohabitation in both parties .In the South , for much of the twentieth century , the Republican Party was near dormant .Winning the Democratic nomination in the South was tantamount to winning the election .Yet most Democrats who were elected to office in the South were conservatives .Much of the opposition to the New Deal and the Great Society of Lyndon B. Johnson derived from what came to be known as \" the conservative coalition \" consisting of conservative ( mostly southern ) Democrats and Western Republicans .Two of the most conservative members of the U.S. Senate were Democrats James Eastland and John Stennis of Mississippi .In 1972 , Democratic Alabama Governor George Wallace , who railed against \" pointy headed intellectuals , \" welfare , and big Government , won six Democratic Presidential primaries including Florida where he won all 67 of the sunshine state 's counties before being shot at a political rally .Liberal Republicans were once a respected part of the Republican establishment .For example , New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller increased welfare spending and raised taxes to pay for it .He was the party establishment 's favorite for the GOP Presidential nomination in 1964 .However , he lost to conservative insurgent Barry Goldwater .As recently as 1976 , Ronald Reagan announced that if he garnered the Presidential nomination , he would select U.S. Senator Richard Schweiker ( R - PA ) , a moderate , as his running mate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.536736"}

Platt , a rival of New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt , successfully urged the Republican Party to select Roosevelt as the running mate to President William McKinley in 1900 .Platt did this to get Roosevelt out of the Governorship because Roosevelt was challenging the Platt political machine in New York .Platt thought with Roosevelt gone that Lieutenant Governor Benjamin Barker Odell Jr. would become the Governor and would be more compliant to Platt 's political machine .The thinking was that Roosevelt would be rendered inconsequential in that the Vice Presidency has little power .As circumstances would have it , President McKinley was assassinated in 1901 , during the first year of his second term in office , and Roosevelt became president .Upon hearing the news , a shocked Platt exclaimed : \" Oh God , now that dammed cowboy is president of the United States . \" To add insult to injury , Governor Odell , similar to Theodore Roosevelt , became a crusader for reform , shunning the Thomas C.

Nixon resigned his office in 1974 and was succeeded by Gerald R. Ford , the only man to succeed to the Presidency without ever being elected vice president or president .But , if Nixon had his way , Ford would not have succeeded him as president .When Vice President Spiro Agnew was forced to resign his office nolo contender ( no contest ) to charges of failure to report income , President Richard M.

Eisenhower .In 1952 , Eisenhower , who like Carson had been a lifelong Independent , became a Republican to run for the nomination .Eisenhower ran as a non - ideological pragmatist .His main opponent for the nomination was conservative U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft ( R - OH ) .The Republican Party had not held the presidency since 1933 , and the party 's rank - and - file voters were willing to hold their noses and support the more moderate but popular Eisenhower over the ideologically impeccable Taft .Eisenhower won the GOP nomination and easily defeated Democrat Adlai Stevenson in the general election .Similar to Eisenhower , two other military generals with no political experience were elected president : Whig Zachary Taylor in 1848 and Republican Ulysses S. Grant in 1868 .Grant had only voted once prior to his own election .In 1856 he voted for Democratic presidential nominee James Buchanan over Republican nominee James C. Freemont , who Grant viewed as an egotist .Grant said : \" I voted for Buchanan because I did n't know him and voted against Freemont because I did know him . \" In Taylor 's case , he had not even registered to vote until he was 62 years old .In contrast to Eisenhower , Taylor , and Grant , two other military men who were recent converts to a new political party saw their respective candidacies falter .In 1900 , the Democrats recruited Admiral George Dewey to run for their party 's presidential nomination .On paper , Dewey was a dream candidate to challenge the popular Republican William McKinley .Dewey had become a national icon for his role in defeating the Spanish during the Spanish - American War at the critical Battle of Manila Bay .When Dewey returned home , parades were held in his honor .However , Dewey did not seem to fathom that the American people had come to expect an activist president who serves as a leader , not a figurehead who is subservient to the prerogatives of the U.S. Congress .Rather than laying out his own ambitious agenda , Dewey asserted that as president he would : \" execute the laws of Congress as faithfully as I have always executed the orders of my superiors . \"In addition , Dewey came across as supercilious by suggesting that the presidency would not be a difficult job : \" I am convinced that the office of the President is not such a very difficult one to fill . \"Dewey never recovered from these gaffes and consequently abandoned his candidacy .To add insult to injury , and proving that he was not really much of a Democrat , Dewey endorsed Republican McKinley over the eventual Democratic nominee , William Jennings Bryan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.117905"}

{"text": "This significant ideological shift on the issue is evinced by future U.S. House Speaker Tip O'Neill 's ( D - MA ) transmogrification in thinking on this matter .In 1966 , Speaking at a rally at the Massachusetts State House in favor of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War , O'Neill took aim at those who opposed the war , including many in academia who were his Cambridge constituents .O'Neill said : \" I believe in Academic Freedom , but not as it is expounded by kooks , commies , and egghead professors .\" A year later , O'Neill became an opponent of the war .Similarly , Jeb Bush 's position on immigration reform reflects the Republican Party of the past and not the contemporaneous GOP .Make it possible for them to come here legally with a work permit , and then , while they 're working and earning here , they 'd pay taxes here .And when they want to go back , they can go back .They can cross .Open the borders both ways . \" In 1986 , Reagan signed the Immigration and Control Act , which included a provision legalizing amnesty to about three million illegal immigrants who had come to the U.S. prior to 1982 .The statute contained certain caveats such as the requirement of paying back - taxes owed to the Federal Government and proving one 's ability to speak English .The act also included more federal funding to secure the U.S - Mexican border .The Reagan position was also the mainstream GOP position in 2000 .The two main Republican Presidential candidates , U.S. Senator John McCain ( R - AZ ) and Texas Governor George W. Bush , opposed deploying U.S. troops to defend the Mexican border .They were both sympathetic to the plight of illegal immigrants .Bush asserted during the primary : \" Family values does not stop at the Rio Grande River . \"Furthermore , President Bush unsuccessfully sought comprehensive immigration reform that would include a pathway to legalization for illegal immigrants .Since that time , the Republican Party has moved away from plans to grant a pathway to citizenship for illegal aliens , and now supports utilizing resources to construct a border - fence .A Republican candidate will assuredly muster uproarious applause by declaring \" no amnesty \" to a GOP audience .In fact , U.S. Representative Steve King ( R - IA ) , a vociferous critic of illegal immigration , has become a leading \" King - maker \" in the Republican Party .He is currently slated to hold forums for GOP Presidential candidates .King has branded illegal immigration \" a slow - motion - terrorist attack . \" In the 1972 race for the Democratic Presidential nomination , most of the Democratic field vociferously lambasted the U.S. policy in Vietnam .Even candidate Hubert Humphrey , who as Vice President to Lyndon B. Johnson had been a public supporter of the war , began advocating for \" a total military withdrawal \" from Southeast Asia .Contrariwise , Senator Jackson made no effort to tone down his hawkish foreign policy views or his support for the war .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.14809"}
{"text": "2004 : Anybody But Bush .THE 2004 election exposed the Green Party 's internal political damage .As the party 's 2004 convention approached , a majority of the Green Party leadership and a part of its activist base turned openly against Nader and backed the little - known David Cobb .Cobb 's strategy was to run a \" safe state \" campaign that would n't challenge the Democrats where it might cost them votes in the Electoral College .The left wing of the Green Party did fight for Nader 's nomination , but it was n't helped by Nader 's decision to stand aloof from the nomination procedure .Cobb won the nomination , and his campaign went on to serve its purpose , signaling to the Democrats that the Greens would not fight them .Cobb got just 100,000 votes ( less than 0.1 percent ) across the U.S. .Nader chose an independent campaign with Peter Camejo as his running mate and tried to duplicate his success in 2000 .However , with grassroots movements in a shambles , the Green Party running away from the fight , and the strong desire among liberals to get rid of Bush , even if that meant voting for pro - war Democrat John Kerry , Nader 's campaign was very weak .This did n't prevent the national Democratic Party from spending millions of dollars to keep Nader off state ballots and tie up his campaign with dozens of spurious lawsuits .Nader 's final vote total was just 500,000 .Nader 's clear antiwar message stood out in sharp contrast to Kerry , and the campaign did demonstrate that there was still an audience for radical politics , but it also showed that there was virtually no organization to reach out to and orient that audience .The 2004 campaign was run by a small core group of radicals and longtime Nader supporters -- there was nothing like the participation of thousands of people , especially young people , in 2000 .Worse , this difficult situation led Nader to make some desperate moves that partially undermined the clear left - wing message of the campaign -- such as accepting the nomination of the rump of the right - wing Reform Party in exchange for ballot lines in a couple states .In 2006 , the left wing of the Green Party as well as antiwar and socialist activists tried to organize antiwar campaigns in several states .Despite much hard work , these campaigns all failed to win either a substantial protest vote or make a serious contribution to reorganizing the antiwar movement .For instance , my campaign for Senate against pro - war Democrat Dianne Feinstein got just 2 percent of the vote .The lack of enthusiasm for these campaigns demonstrated that the majority of Green Party activists had retreated from the idea of building a genuine alternative to the Democrats -- and that the antiwar movement was severely disoriented .In the end , the Democrats took back Congress .Though , as we predicted , they would n't do anything with their victory , the Democrats will benefit again this year from the popular hatred of Bush and the Republicans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.43921"}

{"text": "One of the few Americans who was admired as much as Eisenhower in the party and in the nation as a whole was retired General Douglas MacArthur who had served as the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in the Southwest Pacific Theater .In a political masterstroke , Taft , with the help of former President Herbert Hoover , persuaded MacArthur to publicly agree to be his Vice Presidential running mate should Taft win the nomination .MacArthur was experiencing an upsurge in popularity after being fired for insubordination by the unpopular Democratic President Harry S. Truman in 1951 .The General had publicly disparaged Truman for refusing to attack the Peoples Republic of China during the Korean War .MacArthur returned home from Korea to multiple ticker tape parades .He subsequently received an avalanche of applause when addressing the U.S. Congress .Taft promised that if the ticket were elected , he would \" deputize the General to assume responsibility for the national security as a Deputy Commander in Chief in the Armed Forces and give him a voice in the formulation of all foreign policy bearing upon national security .However , the proposed ticket had the adverse effect of being a \" kangaroo ticket \" in which the candidate at the bottom of the ticket upstaged the candidate at the top .In fact , a large contingent of Republicans , led by U.S. Senator Francis H. Case of South Dakota , called on the cerebral Taft to withdraw from the race and endorse the charismatic MacArthur for the Presidential nomination instead .Taft refused , but told MacArthur that should the ticket not win on the first ballot , he would entertain the notion of endorsing MacArthur to supplant him at the top of the ticket .However , Taft miscalculated the strength of the Eisenhower forces .Eisenhower defeated Taft on the first ballot and won the nomination .A second ballot might have resulted in an epic electoral bout between the two former generals .The second example where a President announced his choice of a running mate before the nomination was settled occurred in 1976 .Former California Governor Ronald Reagan was locked in a whisker - close battle for the Republican Presidential nomination with President Gerald R. Ford .With the primary season over , and no clear winner , the winner was to be decided at the convention .The moderate Republican establishment supported Ford , while Reagan was the preferred candidate of the party 's emerging conservative bloodline .In a move to wrest enough moderate delegates at the GOP Convention to support his candidacy , Reagan teamed up with one of the party 's most liberal Senators , Richard Schweiker of Pennsylvania .However , this move attracted few moderates to Reagan , as many saw this as a cynical political ploy .Moreover , this action inflamed many conservatives who saw it as a sellout to the ideological agenda Reagan was espousing .The stout conservative U.S. Senator Jesse Helms ( R - NC ) , whose endorsement of Reagan in the North Carolina primary was instrumental in providing Reagan with his first victory ( which helped to keep the campaign afloat ) , was appalled .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.02167"}
{"text": "The two terms refer to ideological outliers who deviate from their respective party 's contemporary orthodoxy .The founders of both political parties would not recognize the modern incantations .The Democratic Party grew out of the Democratic - Republican Party of Thomas Jefferson , which favored a strict constructionist interpretation of the U.S. Constitution , opposed a central banking system , and favored decentralized power .The Democratic Party was the counterpart of the Federalist Party , which favored the more energetic government synomomous today with the Democratic Party .In contrast , the ideological architects of the GOP never envisioned the Republican Party to be conservative .In fact , the Republican Party was founded in 1854 as a liberal alternative to the conservative Democratic Party of Presidents Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan .While most know the GOP was founded in opposition to the expansion to slavery , the Party 's platform also included support for railroad construction , Public Education , and a more liberal immigration policy .For much of the latter - half of the Nineteenth Century , the GOP was viewed as the liberal party .In 1888 , Republican nominee Benjamin Harrison won the Presidency by advocating an expanded money supply , a protective tariff , and more funding for social services .This was in sharp contrast to the Conservative Policies of Democratic President Grover Cleveland .Cleveland 's platform would be anathema to today 's conservatives .Even as recently as 1940 , the party 's Presidential nominee , Wendell Willkee , said : \" The opposition have attempted to picture me as an opponent of liberalism .But I was a liberal before many of them heard the word .\" Perhaps it makes more sense in today 's world to apply the label RINO to conservative Republicans and the label DINO to liberal Democrats .Would Iraq have been Part of the Democratic Revolution ?I wonder what would have happened in Iraq had the U.S. lifted the economic sanctions instead of invading the country ?Would the Iraqis have taken to the streets and revolted like their fellow freedom - seekers in Tunesia and in Egypt , and ousted or forced President Saddam Hussein 's despotic regime from power ?His government was similar to the two aformentioned , in that it was a secular autocratic regime which oppressed its own people and subjugated the Islamists .Maybe there would have been an internecine revolution instead of what actually happened , which caused 100,000 dead Iraqis , resulted in half a million widows and orphans , 4 million refugees , and 4,400 dead American military personnel and 35,000 Americans wounded .The Narrowing Political Appeal of Sarah Palin My overall assessment of Sarah Palin is that she was a reasonably successful Governor of Alaska who challenged the Republican establishment by defeating an incumbent Republican Governor in the 2006 GOP primaries .As Governor , she forged an alliance with reform - minded Democrats and Republicans on ethics reform , and cut capital projects .She was far from the ideologue she became when she entered the national stage .Instead , Palin was an anti - establishmentarian maverick with Transpartisan appeal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.10536"}

Roosevelt , by a mutual friend , Harry Morgenthau Jr. Wallace , the Editor of The Farmer , advised and helped write speeches for Roosevelt on farm policy during the campaign .Impressed , Roosevelt nominated Wallace as U.S. Agricultural Secretary .Wallace 's populist proclivities were more welcomed in the Democratic Party than in the Republican Party that he had been born into .In 1940 , the GOP nominated U.S. Senate Minority Leader Charles McNary ( R - OR ) as its Vice Presidential nominee .McNary was popular in the agricultural community .In a move partly to counter that selection , Roosevelt asked the Democratic National Convention to chose Wallace as his Vice Presidential Runningmate .However , the choice was met with consternation by many Democratic partisans .In fact , when Wallace 's name was placed in nomination , he was booed , with one Democratic stalwart commandeering an open microphone and demanding : \" Give us a Democrat !We do n't want a Republican ! \"However , the delegates knew Wallace was Roosevelt 's choice , and he was nominated on the first ballot .The losing candidates reluctantly coalesced around the nominee .Interestingly , Wallace continued to move to the left .In 1948 he was the Presidential nominee of the Progressive Party .Unlike the Democratic Party , which called for a hard - line against Communists , Wallace called for \" a peaceful understanding between the United States and Soviet Russia .\" In 1940 , while the Democrats nominated a former Republican for Vice President , the Republican Party nominated Utilities Executive Wendell Willkie , a former Democrat for President .Willkie had actually been a delegate to the 1928 Democratic National Convention , which nominated New York Governor Al Smith for President .Willkie was put on the political radar screen of many Republicans after a strong debate performance against Assistant U.S. Attorney General Robert Jackson on a national radio program on the issue of Free Enterprise .This resulted in an attendant movement to draft Willkie by some in the Republican Party .Willkie shocked many Republicans by winning the GOP nomination on the sixth ballot at the Republican National Convention .Many Republicans were wary of a nominee who had so recently pledged his allegiance to the Party .Relative to this sentiment , U.S. Senator James E.

Nixon in his 1974 State of the Union Address , and later proposed by U.S. Senate Minority Leader Robert J. Dole ( R - KS ) .Conservatives argued that forcing citizens to purchase Health Insurance promoted personal responsibility .Interestingly , when Nixon proposed a federal mandate , liberal Democrats , including U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy ( D - MA ) , opposed it , arguing that the proposal was a boon to the insurance companies .Kennedy argued for a Medicare - for - all , Canadian - style , single - payer type system .The ideological debate transmogrified when the Conservative movement became more Libertarian - oriented , allowing Americans to chose weather to purchase Heath Insurance .Now support for an individual mandate is considered the center - left position .One can only speculate whether Romney , at the time laying the political spadework for a Presidential campaign , would have signed the legislation if he had known that Republican orthodoxy would materially change on this issue .Is There Categorical Proof of My Existence ?Here is a question I have been pondering a lot lately .Is there any way to prove that the world beyond me does indeed exist ?Let me first preface this by saying that I am taking it on faith that there are indeed people reading this .They are not just figments of my imagination and there is a life beyond me .I am not a solipsist who maintains that they are the only person in existence , and that the world was designed only for that person .Still , I have no way to prove it .I would be curious if anyone has confronted this existential issue .I think that Seventeenth Century French Philosopher Rene Descartes had the best possible argument for his own existence , asserting : \" I think therefore I am .\" But I have never heard a compelling intellectual case that everyone else exists , or that there is a physical world that continues when I walk away .Taking it on faith that there is in fact a physical world , and that the people reading this article are actual beings , I am curious if there is any way to prove that there really is a world beyond me .RINOS And DINOS : Losing Relevancy It is time to retire the terms \" RINO \" and \" DINO .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.77604"}

Dawes also had an antagonistic relationship .It began in 1925 when both Coolidge and Dawes were inaugurated .At that time in history both the President and Vice President gave Inauguration Addresses on the same day .Dawes ' Inauguration Address took the form of a fiery and controversial lecture about the fecklessness of the U.S. Senate rules .The press gave Dawes ' Inaugural diatribe almost as much coverage as Coolidge 's Inaugural Address .Dawes added to the tension by sending the President a letter stating that he would not be attending Cabinet meetings .Vice President John Nance Gardner ( 1933 - 1941 ) , who served with President Franklin D. Roosevelt , was a business - oriented Democrat from rural Texas .Gardner came to think that Roosevelt had veered too far to the left ideologically .He even called his domestic programs \" foolishness . \"Vice President Gardner sought the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1940 , only to be resoundingly defeated by Roosevelt , and in turn , Roosevelt selected a new Vice Presidential running mate , U.S. Agricultural Secretary Henry A.
