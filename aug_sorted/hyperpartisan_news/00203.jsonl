Tuch , both of George Washington University , to examine the causation of negative perceptions of police in the Black community .The study 's findings revealed that Black Americans face more police corruption , violence , and profiling than our White counterparts , leaving their perception of law enforcement - and Black Americans - colored by personal perspective and not collective reality : .Whites tend to hold a favorable opinion of the police , favor aggressive law enforcement , and are skeptical of criticisms of the police .There is a racial dimension to this orientation .Many Whites view Blacks as inclined to criminal or violent behavior ( Swigert and Farrell 1976 ; Weitzer 2000 ; cf .Hurwitz and Peffley 1997 ) .In response to a question in the 2000 General Social Survey , 48 percent of Whites think that Blacks are \" violence - prone .\" For many Whites , controlling crime is roughly equivalent to intensifying law enforcement against minority individuals or in minority communities .Next in our series , NewsOne asked readers , \" Is it fair to call police officers ' killers behind the badge ' ?\"Of the more than 200 responses , 191 readers agreed with that assessment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.834015"}

{"text": "Instead , Holmes and Smith focus on the social - psychological roots of this \" urban dilemma , \" devoting particular attention to the cognitive processes underlying the use of excessive force by the police .Sociological and criminological studies , according to the authors , do not adequately explain police brutality , though Holmes and Smith are quick to note the important contributions of this scholarship .Analyses that emphasize the flawed organizational structures of local law enforcement , for example , fail to account for the persistence of police brutality .Moreover , models based on conflict theory , which typically treats law enforcers as foot soldiers for the power establishment , stop short of explaining the behavior of the police .Too often , conflict theories deny agency to local cops , treating them as the unthinking pawns of the dominant group in society .Furthermore , Holmes and Smith argue that a compelling examination of the use of excessive force must account for the seemingly irrational and self - destructive nature of police brutality .The use of excessive force heightens tensions and alienates residents , thus making inner - city police work more difficult and more dangerous .Similarly , the most brutal , violent cops risk incurring career - threatening sanctions for their actions .To address these shortcomings in sociological and criminological theory , the authors look to social psychology .Applying insights from studies of emotional and cognitive processes , Holmes and Smith argue that humans , to navigate through complex conditions , formulate \" category - based reactions \" ( p. 37 ) .Individuals forge powerful connections to social groups and develop bonds of loyalty and solidarity .As a part of the same process , humans are hardwired to form negative images of \" outgroups , \" exaggerating the boundaries between social groups and hence reinforcing their ties to their \" ingroups .\" Such stereotyping , Holmes and Smith argue , is a \" generic human quality \" and permits people to automatically and unconsciously recognize potential dangers and respond accordingly , either by fleeing or by employing aggression ( p. 74 ) .\" The brain evolved fully while our ancestors still lived in simple foraging societies , \" the authors explain , and the instinctive ability to identify threats proved to be an important survival skill ( p. 144 ) .These cognitive processes , however , interact with modern inner - city conditions in ways that increase the potential for police brutality .Police activities and a cop subculture generate powerful bonds of loyalty among law enforcers .Furthermore , police officers are socialized and trained to anticipate danger and to respond quickly to threats .In such a hypercharged work environment , perceptions of disorder feed innate category - based assessments and trigger \" automatic stereotype activation , \" in this case casting African American city dwellers as dangerous ( p. 60 ) .But Holmes and Smith chart a parallel cognitive process among minority residents .Blending personal experience , anecdotal evidence , and their own category - based assessments , African American city dwellers stereotype police officers as potential threats and interact with them in ways that reinforce mutual fears and suspicions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.41872"}

{"text": "In addition to programs and courses , most universities require online access to basic course information , such as the syllabus and resource lists .Even when not mandated by their institutions , educators are increasingly developing a presence for their courses on the Internet ( Song , Singleton , Hill , & Koh , 2004 ; Smart & Cappel , 2006 ) .Literature Review .Online learning may be defined as instruction delivered electronically via the Internet , an intranet , or multimedia platforms such as CD - ROM or DVD ( Smart & Cappel , 2006 ) .Online learning may be delivered either synchronously , where the instructor and students must be online simultaneously , or asynchronously , where there are no time restrictions and students and teachers do not have to be online at the same time ( Tanner et al . , 2009 ) .In contrast to the classic classroom environment , in an online environment there is no face - to - face contact .According to Tanner et al . , context clues are more difficult to read in an online environment , and immediate dyadic communication is more challenging than in traditional face - to - face classrooms .Like any other learning medium , online learning has both strengths and challenges .Research has consistently documented many of these important strengths .For instance , Song et al .( 2004 ) found that online technology can allow for greater student reflection and foster more thoughtful and responsible comments than what might occur in face - to - face classrooms .Flexibility and convenience are additional strengths , as it is often viewed as easier to work in collaborative groups and schedule meetings because students can meet online instead of in - person ( Song et al ., 2004 ) .While the strengths of online learning are impressive , research indicates it also brings with it many challenges .Additionally , Muilenburg and Berge ( 2005 ) identified the lack of social interaction as the single most important barrier to students learning online .Administrative and instructor issues , time and support for studies , and learner motivation came in very closely as the next most significant barriers , with technical problems and cost being the least significant .Due to both the strengths and weaknesses that exist , instructors and designers need a better understanding of how students perceive online learning .Smart and Cappel ( 2006 ) note that investigating student perceptions informs instructors and designers on how best to foster active participation and engagement in the learning process , which effectively enhances students ' learning and motivation .Young and Norgard ( 2006 ) state that \" in order to assure quality and consumer satisfaction , institutions and their faculty must pay close attention to their students ' perceptions of online courses and programs \" ( p. 113 ) .Meyer ( 2002 ) also recommended that research on quality online learning focus on student perceptions .In this study , the Online Learning Environment Survey ( OLES ) ( Trinidad et al ., 2004 ) was chosen because it incorporates scales from five other instruments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.01351"}
{"text": "Ong and Lai ( 2006 ) explored gender differences in perceptions and relationships among factors affecting online learning acceptance .In a survey of 67 female and 89 male Taiwanese employees , males ' ratings of computer self - efficacy , perceived usefulness , perceived ease of use , and behavioral intention to use e - learning were higher than those of females .Similarly , Li and Kirkup ( 2007 ) investigated differences in use and attitudes toward the Internet and computers generally for 220 Chinese and 245 British students .Responses to a self - report survey questionnaire indicated significant gender differences in both national groups .Males in both countries were more likely than females to use e - mail or chat rooms .Males played more computer games than females , with Chinese males being the most active gamers .Males in both countries were more self - confident about their computer skills than females , and were more likely to express the opinion that using computers was a \" male \" activity and skill than were females .Gender differences were higher in the British group than the Chinese group ( Li & Kirkup , 2007 ) .U.S.-based studies conducted by Kay ( 2009 ) and Tsai and Tsai ( 2010 ) respectively have produced evidence suggesting that male students are significantly more comfortable with computers than females , and that males have significantly higher Internet use intensity than females .However , in Tsai and Tsai 's study , females were found to be more communication - oriented Internet users , seeking interaction with others , while males were more exploration oriented in their use .These differences have been found to result in females experiencing a richer , more connected , and more valuable online learning experience than males ( Johnson , 2011 ) .While there is a persistent pattern of small differences in males ' favor in terms of computer attitude , ability , and use , the results are not necessarily the same when it comes to perceptions and experiences of online learning .A recent study by Johnson ( 2011 ) , for example , interestingly found that females perceived greater social presence in online learning , performed better , and were more satisfied with the experience than males .Purpose .The purpose of the present study was to investigate the impact of two key student characteristics - namely , ethnicity and gender - on perceptions of online learning .Overall perceptions of online learning were examined , but specific emphasis was placed on African - American students ' perceptions as compared to those of their White counterparts .The decision to focus on African - American students was fuelled by the dearth of research done on perceptions of online learning with this ethnic group , and by a desire to \" give voice \" to an important and growing population group within the U.S. higher education sector .The study also examined African - American males ' versus females ' perceptions of online learning to determine whether gender differences in perceptions of online learning previously reported in the literature are reflected within this population group .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.138916"}
