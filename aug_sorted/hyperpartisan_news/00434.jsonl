{"text": "[ The Washington Post ] .Reality Check : Repealing Obamacare Would Not Increase the Deficit . by Kathryn Nix , The Heritage Foundation : As the new Congress settles in , the House of Representatives prepares to vote on January 12 on a measure to repeal Obamacare .Proponents of the health care law claim that repeal would increase the federal deficit and that a vote to kill Obamacare without offsetting the \" cost \" is hypocritical .This could n't be more wrong .For starters , Obamacare will not reduce the deficit .Though the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) projected that the health law would create $ 124 billion in savings , the CBO is required to make unlikely assumptions and disregard budget gimmicks included in the legislation .Taking this into account causes the cost of Obamacare to skyrocket .First , Obamacare does not include the \" doc fix \" to prevent an automatic cut to physicians ' reimbursement rates under Medicare .Earlier versions of reform included a fix , which made those proposals tip heavily into the red .Congress recently passed a one - year fix and will continue to prevent the cuts in the future , but it will still not solve the ongoing problem .Nevertheless , pretending it will not happen wo n't reduce the deficit .Obamacare also includes billions in double - counted savings .Over the next decade , Obamacare includes $ 529 billion in cuts to Medicare and $ 70 billion in revenue from the new CLASS program .CBO 's score assumes that these savings and revenues will offset the cost of new programs in the legislation .But Medicare savings are also pledged to extend the program 's solvency .Revenue from CLASS , a new long - term care insurance program , is the result of premiums collected to pay out benefits in outlying years and will not pay for new programs , either .Claiming that these dollars will pay for Obamacare is akin to trying to make a mortgage payment and buy a Macbook with the same paycheck : In the real world , you can spend money only once .Obamacare also creates a new subsidy program for low- and middle - income Americans to purchase insurance .CBO predicts that 19 million Americans will benefit from this generous new entitlement program .But this does n't take into account Obamacare 's huge incentives for employers to drop their insurance programs and allow employees to instead purchase taxpayer - subsidized coverage .Former CBO director Doug Holtz - Eakin points out that businesses , especially those with mostly low - income employees , could drop their health plan , raise wages to make up for the lost benefit , pay the Obamacare employer penalty for not offering insurance , and still come out ahead .These incentives , combined with the various new insurance rules that will increase premiums on employer plans , will cause the cost of the subsidy program to greatly exceed initial projections .Finally , repealing Obamacare does not need to be offset under pay - as - you - go rules ( PAYGO ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "40.836388"}

{"text": "ObamaCare pursues an expansion of coverage through government mandates at the expense of lowering costs and expanding freedom .As I 've argued before , this is exactly the wrong approach to health care reform .It 'll only continue the skyrocketing cost growth of health care in America .Unsurprisingly , we can already see the effect of ObamaCare on insurance premiums , which have risen by about $ 2,100 for Americans buying their own insurance , on average .Let 's not forget that ObamaCare also imposes de facto health care rationing via IPAB , the Independent Payment Advisory Board .As I 've explained before , \" ...The mission of IPAB is to reduce Medicare costs by cutting reimbursement rates to doctors and hospitals .Since Medicare already underpays the health care industry , another round of deep cuts to reimbursement payments will doubtlessly push even more physicians and hospitals to stop accepting Medicare recipients .For rural recipients of Medicare with limited access to health care providers as it is , these cuts could make it difficult if not impossible to get health care .This is rationing in its most basic form .\" It 's an insertion of more government bureaucracy in the doctor - patient relationship .As Dr. Robert Moffitt of The Heritage Foundation writes , \" Specifically , physicians will be subject to more government regulation and oversight , and will be increasingly dependent on unreliable government reimbursement for medical services .Doctors , already under tremendous pressure , will only see their jobs become more difficult .\" It 's allowed powerful government officials to set onerous mandates on the vast majority of the American people , while they grant waivers to their friends .As Representative Cliff Stearns ( R - FL ) put it , \" Many of those waivers went to the president 's union buddies .\" FreedomWorks has even started a petition to poke fun at the disproportionate number of waivers given to those with money and influence .It 's ( still ) unconstitutional .Chief Justice John Roberts ' opinion relied on a very generous reading of Congress 's power to tax .According to that opinion , Congress 's power to tax is realistically without limit .As Dr. Paul Moreno of Hillsdale College writes , \" Some conservatives have cheered that part of Justice Roberts 's decision that limits Congress 's Commerce Clause power .But an unlimited taxing power is equally dangerous to constitutional government . \"Still , Court rulings are n't the final word on the Constitution .If they were , then past rulings would form an unbreakable precedent for future rulings , instead of merely being a helpful guide .In that case , the Supreme Court would still be bound by 19th - century rulings on Congress 's power to tax , and the ObamaCare decision would 've gone very differently , indeed .We have a better plan .Despite what the media likes to claim , conservatives have set out a comprehensive health care reform plan that will lower costs and expand freedom for Americans , thereby naturally expanding coverage as a result .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.40018"}

Graham is the director of health care studies at the Pacific Research Institute .There is no question that Medicare needs to be modernized since its expenditures are out of control , and that is why a reform proposal by U.S. Congressman Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) is welcome news .Proponents persuasively argue that its implementation by Congress would ease the burden on taxpayers while introducing private market competition to dramatically control costs nationwide .Now that the first anniversary of Obamacare has passed , it should be clear to almost all that the federal government bureaucracy is basically in charge of healthcare policy .This expensive legislation , with its transition period of several years , is already leading to steep declines of healthcare choice and quality .With regard to Medicare , the government sets prices for thousands of services , then pays any physician or medical facility based on a visit .This absurd fee schedule applies to the best and the worst medical facility , and bills for the patient visit continue to be sent to the overburdened taxpayer .The Ryan proposal seeks to end this growing and unsustainable problem .Under the Ryan premium support model , seniors would be able to pick from an array of private insurance options of the kind that younger workers in the private sector utilize .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.18897"}

Ben Nelson of Nebraska seems to understand this as well .He told the Omaha World - Herald today , \" The last thing we need to do is start changing rules , with 51 votes and simple majority , and make the Senate a smaller version of the House .\" McConnell also points out that these changes could backfire on Democrats , writing , \" A change in the rules by a bare majority aimed at benefiting Democrats today could just as easily be used to benefit Republicans tomorrow . . . .And have those pushing for these changes forgotten how their party used the rules of the Senate to block legislation when Republicans were in the majority ?Given the ease with which majorities can shift these days , Democrats might want to be careful what they wish for .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.698135"}
