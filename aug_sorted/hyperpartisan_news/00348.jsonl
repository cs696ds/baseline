'Some churchgoers sympathised with him . 'We can understand his frustrations .Many of us are also upset that our people are so inconsiderate , ' said housewife Evelyn Ng , 34 .Residents along Siglap Hill , a quiet neighbourhood off Changi Road , have complained about parking problems to the police and Land Transport Authority ( LTA ) on many occasions in the past .Some of the older residents said the problems had been around for 20 years , but worsened when the church finished renovation works a few years ago and more worshippers started attending mass .Churchgoers park their cars along the road when all 160 lots in the church have been taken up , as they often are on weekends when more than 1,000 people attend services .Priests at the church have reminded churchgoers not to park along Siglap Hill as this obstructs traffic along the narrow two - way street , said members of the congregation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.94882"}

{"text": "Help England 's community pharmacies do more for health , researchers urge .A new study published in BMJ Open urges the government to do more to help community pharmacies in England tackle major public health concerns such as smoking and obesity .The study , by a team from Durham University , is the first to show that most people in England , particularly in more deprived areas , live within walking distance of a community pharmacy .The findings suggest that access to pharmacy services does not follow the \" inverse care law \" often quoted in respect of medical care - whereby the best medical care is most available to those who least need it .Instead , it follows its own \" positive pharmacy care law , \" note the authors .Lead author Dr. Adam Todd , of Durham 's School of Medicine , Pharmacy and Health , says the role of the local pharmacist has changed considerably in the last few years .Community pharmacies are increasingly more concerned with promoting healthier living and helping people change their health - related behavior .Community pharmacies well placed to deliver public health services .The new study calls on the government to help local pharmacies provide more services to tackle public health concerns .He adds that their study shows England 's local pharmacists are well placed \" in the community to deliver public health services .This is particularly important for the poorest areas where more people die from conditions such as smoking , alcohol misuse and obesity compared to people from more affluent areas . \"He and his team urge the government to help community pharmacies bolster their role and provide more services to tackle major public health concerns .For the study , the team analyzed pharmacy location and local population data for all community pharmacies in England .The main outcome measure was whether or not the households in an area - as defined by postcodes - had access to a community pharmacy within a 20-minute walk .A person walks about 1.6 km in 20 minutes , so the team placed 1.6 km \" buffers \" around each pharmacy to represent a 20- minute walk and then clipped the population postcodes to the pharmacy buffers .They admit that one of the study 's limitations is they had to represent the 20-minute walking distance as a straight line , which is not necessarily the case in real life .89 % of households in England within 20-minute walk of their community pharmacy .They found that overall , 89 % of England 's households are situated within a 20-minute walk of their community pharmacy .In areas of high deprivation , the percentage is even higher , reaching nearly 100 % for some postcodes .Dr. David Branford , chair of the English Pharmacy Board , suggests pharmacists are well placed to understand and deliver solutions for individual patients , and : . \" The less formal approach and sheer convenience provided by a high street presence means they are a beacon of wellbeing and advice to many who would simply never engage with other healthcare settings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "123.31038"}

{"text": "\" It was bound to happen , but it 's definitely quite a shock to hear that news , \" says Scot Henley , Executive Director of the Mount Washington Observatory .\" While we are disappointed that it appears that Mount Washington may have been bumped from the top , at our core we are all weather fans and we are very impressed with the magnitude of that typhoon and the work of the committee that studied it . \"Mount Washington 's famous wind gust of 231 mph , recorded on April 12 , 1934 at the Mount Washington Observatory , stands as the record for the fastest surface wind measured in the Northern and Western Hemispheres .\" It 's natural to treat news like this with some level of skepticism , \" said Henley .\" Dr. Cerveny was kind enough to share the panel 's findings in advance of next month 's WMO meeting in Turkey .We 're going to spend some time reviewing the materials to learn more about the instrumentation , calibration , the methods used to calculate the wind speed and everything else that went into their investigation . \"\" The new record does not diminish the fact that Mount Washington is one of the fiercest places on the planet , \" says Ken Rancourt , Mount Washington Observatory 's Director of Summit Operations .\" It remains consistently one of the windiest places on Earth and a location that begs further study of wind , weather and climate . \"\" Work continues atop Mount Washington , \" says Henley .\" Our crew of meteorologists and educators at the Observatory stands ready to measure and study the next big wind , whenever it may come . \"Mount Washington Observatory , which operates within the 59-acre Mt. Washington State Park , is a private , non - profit , membership - supported organization .Since 1932 , the Observatory has been monitoring the elements in one of the most extreme locations on Earth , using this unique site for scientific research and educational outreach .The weather in the north tends to be far harsher than south of the 49th .and we simply so not measure it in those regions to the same extent .Anyone who has worked outside \" up north \" in Canada , can tell you about cold that is literally mind altering and there are colder regions in the \" eastern Arctic \" of this vast country than in the Yukon .Australia , IS a land of extremes and this report does not surprise me .It is tough and requires very careful consideration of every action so that you do not end up an icicle .I would expect that such temps .would freeze your hide almost instantly , not an experience I would find appealing .Combine Arctic or Antarctic cold plus a bit of breeze ( the \" wind chill \" factor ) , and you can get virtually instant freezing of the skin , aka frostbite .An interesting point is that the \" instant \" freezing is less than \" skin - deep \" , affecting the outermost layer of the skin ( yes , skin has several layers ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "131.00943"}
