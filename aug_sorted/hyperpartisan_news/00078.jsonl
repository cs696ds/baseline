Jan Brewer 's office has received nearly $ 20,000 in private donations to help the state mount a legal defense against lawsuits related to its tough new immigration law .Nearly 440 people in 46 states and the District of Columbia have contributed to the fund .According to a list of donors provided to The Arizona Republic newspaper , the smallest contribution is $ 1 and the largest is $ 750 .Brewer announced last month that she had hired private counsel to represent her in the federal lawsuits pending against the state .She is named as a defendant in four of the five cases .Arizona 's new immigration law is scheduled to take effect July 29 .It requires police , while enforcing other laws , to question a person 's immigration status if officers have a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the country illegally .U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will realign its duties to promote criminal investigations over immigrant deportation , officials have announced .By streamlining and renaming several offices , officials hope to highlight the agency 's counterterrorism , money laundering and other complex criminal investigations and in the process \" re - brand \" ICE , turning the public -- and political -- spotlight away from its immigration work .It 's a serious change , long overdue .I 'm not certain that it is possible to \" rebrand \" the agency to diminish the idea that being undocumented is not a major crime .But it 's a move in the right direction .Corey Stewart loves to be in the spotlight .He announced today via his website that : .Prince William County 's crackdown on illegal immigration worked : Illegal Aliens fled the county , and the violent crime rate plummeted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.53412"}

Russell Pearce .The man 's words are fanatical and frankly embarrassing to anyone with a sense of human decency .The neo - Nazis eat what he says up like candy , and even worse , he 's quoted them in return to support his position .Bob , do you mean to say that there 's any greater law than the one Christ gave : Love God , and love your neighbor ?Do you think the Lord exempted illegal immigrants from that ?I agree with the church 's feelings here : Illegal immigrants should not be treated inhumanely .It 's not a question about who does or does n't join the Church .Come on , Bob , that 's just flat - out silly .Penalties that match the severity of the crime can definitely be discussed .But we should never forget that illegal immigrants are people , too , and deserve humane treatment .That 's the core principle here .They have n't said anything about being against ' obedience to immigration laws ' .They stated that when looking at ways to deal with the illegal immigration issue , we all need to remember we 're dealing with people , families , children , etc . .So I do n't understand how you can find it ' amusing ' that a religious organization is promoting the idea that we deal with people humanely and compassionately .I thought that the LDS church believed in being obedient to the laws of the land ?I find it hypocritical that they are now compelling our lawmakers to indulge our illegal immigrant population in their law breaking ways .Bob , you misinterpret the position of the Church on obedience .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.34326"}

{"text": "Similar immigration measures have been adopted in Mississippi , Oklahoma , Utah , Tennessee , Louisiana , West Virginia , Colorado , Minnesota , Georgia , and Rhode Island .In 2009 , more than 1,500 bills were introduced at the local and state level in an attempt to beef up immigration enforcement .Of the 1,500 bills , 222 became law and 131 were adopted as resolutions .In appealing to the Supreme Court , lawyers for Hazleton said the local ordinances work in concert with federal immigration law , not at cross purposes with it .Hazleton is a city of 30,000 in northeastern Pennsylvania .During the past decade the town saw an influx of more than 10,000 new residents .Most of them were Hispanic and moved to the town from New York and New Jersey .The city government believed that many of the new residents were not legally present in the US .After concluding that illegal immigrants were contributing to a higher crime rate and imposing greater costs in terms of government social services , local officials passed two ordinances designed to deter illegal immigrants from settling in Hazleton .One ordinance made it illegal to hire or continue to employ an illegal immigrant in Hazleton .A second ordinance made it illegal to rent a house or apartment to an illegal immigrant .Like the Arizona law upheld by the Supreme Court , the Hazleton ordinances were tied to local licensing schemes .Under the employment ordinance , the city would revoke a company 's business license if it employed an illegal immigrant .The rental ordinance threatened to revoke an individual 's rental license if the landlord was found to be renting to an illegal immigrant .The city said the provisions did not clash with federal immigration law , rather they complimented the federal framework .A group of immigrants - including some illegal immigrants - and a Hispanic business group filed suit with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union .They sought to block enforcement of the two provisions .Although it is illegal under federal law to harbor an illegal immigrant and to hire an illegal immigrant , the a federal judge and the Third Circuit ruled that the local ordinances were preempted by federal immigration laws .Lawyers for the city had argued local officials were forced to pass the ordinances because the federal government was not effectively enforcing federal immigration laws .Lawyers for the immigrants countered that Congress established a comprehensive regulation of immigration that carefully balanced the goal of deterring illegal immigration while protecting employers from harm and authorized workers from discrimination .The case is Hazleton v.

{"text": "It is possible to have legal low - skilled immigration ; the benefits of low - skilled immigration need not come with the costs of illegal immigration , which are significant .There are perhaps 12 million illegal immigrants in the United States , and the number of undocumented workers is probably more than 8 million .Some 60 percent of illegal immigrants live in six states , where their share of the population is about 6 percent on average , compared to less than 3 percent in the rest of the United States .Like low - skilled immigration in general , illegal immigration generates economic benefits for native Americans .However , illegal immigration also imposes significant costs : .Illegal immigrants are often hesitant to cooperate with law enforcement , which increases their own vulnerability and makes it difficult for the police to obtain necessary information .The failure to enforce immigration laws erodes respect for the legal system , encouraging vigilantism and violence against ethnic minorities .The presence of large numbers of people who live outside the law 's protection and have little long - term stake in the country erodes the social contract and impedes the cooperation required to establish safe and vibrant communities .And some efforts to address illegal immigration threaten the civil liberties that Americans view as their birthright .Moreover , their vulnerable position may cause illegal immigrants to accept lower wages6-again , some employers and U.S. households benefit from this .Policy Must Change .Recognizing the economic value of low - skilled immigration and the large economic and social costs of illegal immigration provides a useful guide to policies : .Instead , illegal immigration should be reduced by compelling large employers to check documents , as well as imposing significant fines for violations and devising efficient but minimally - obtrusive schemes for policing these efforts .The Arizona Law is Misguided .Since about 30 percent of Arizona 's population is Hispanic , the potential for social conflict is great .Arizona 's recent law will be damaging and counterproductive .Nevertheless , this law highlights how the failure of federal policy increases the potential for ill - conceived state decisions , perhaps giving impetus to more sensible solutions at the national level .The proposal to reinterpret the fourteenth amendment to exclude children of illegal immigrants from citizenship is another dead end .Refusing to educate or provide health care to children who could become long - term members of American society would be stupid and brutal , as would be deporting children or adults who grew up in the United States to foreign countries that they have never seen .In addition , such measures would have only a limited impact on the level of illegal immigration , since wage differentials are sufficient incentive for migration .Illegal immigration is inevitably a difficult and divisive issue , given its distributional implications and the infections of racism and xenophobia .At a minimum , we should reject policies that would make a bad situation worse .William Shaw is a visiting scholar in Carnegie 's International Economics Program .Most studies find that tax revenues from both legal and illegal immigrants exceed the cost of services provided to them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.162384"}

{"text": "\" Throughout this phase of the research , we asked residents about a number of changes in their community .What we found is that Manassas had changed significantly over the last 20 years , and many residents viewed those changes as unsettling .We also discovered that a majority of the people we talked to had strong negative feelings about immigrants .We interviewed 103 households and then went back and did an additional 30 in - depth interviews .These ranged from 1 - 3 hours in length , depending on the informant .In the second phase of this study , we went into two predominantly Latino neighborhoods and interviewed a non - random sample of residents .There we interviewed 60 people .These residents reported feeling alienated from the community , and in some cases , extreme fear .In fact , the responses of the documented indicated that they were just as likely to fear leaving their homes or sending their children out to play as others .[ Note : for reasons of confidentiality , we did not directly ask people about their documentation status .However , those who were documented were forthcoming about their residency status .] When I read Ms. Chumley 's article , I was disappointed with her report because she clearly misrepresented our work .For my part , most of the work that I have done in the last 15 years with immigration has focused equally on American - born residents in new destinations of Mexican migration .I recently published an essay on this , which is linked here .In short , I may disagree with some of my informants about their perspectives on immigration , but that is not to say that I do n't think their perspectives should be ignored .And please note : Prof. Cleaveland and I did not have to go into Weems or Sumner Lakes and do interviews .We could have followed the path of many of our colleagues and only focused on the perspectives of Latinos .We could also have simply published our work in peer - reviewed journals and no one would have questioned us regarding why we did not talk to American - born residents .However , we decided that , in light of the ordinances , the people in these communities deserved to have a say , and we gave them the opportunity to share their perspectives .Getting back to the article written by Ms Chumley yesterday , there were a number of errors in it , and in places she clearly misrepresented us . Prof. Cleaveland and I wrote a letter to the editor of the newspaper , and to date we have not had a response from the editor or Ms. Chumley .Below is a excerpt from that letter : .We agreed to an interview with Cynthia Chumley on the assumption that as a reporter , she would adhere to basic principles of fairness .Reporters are taught early on in journalism programs to offer subjects of an article the chance to respond to allegations -- especially those that can harm the reputation of people either professionally or personally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.2983"}

{"text": "See Card ( 2005 ) for a summary of the literature from the dominant view that the impact of low - skilled immigration on the wages of native low - skilled workers is small , and Borjas ( 2003 ) for the higher estimates of this effect .Only about 8 percent of native Americans in ages 25 - 64 lack a high school diploma , while many low - skilled immigrants have little schooling and speak little English .The supply of low - skilled native workers is further reduced by those who are unsuited or unwilling to work , for example due to drug addiction .It is possible that a sharp reduction in low - skilled immigration could assist low - skilled native workers by improving incentives for businesses and the government to invest in education , training , and rehabilitation , but it would also encourage automation , which would limit the increased demand for low - skilled workers .Controlling for observable skills , legalization through the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act raised wages by 6 percent compared to wage levels if workers had remained undocumented .( Kossoudji and Cobb - Clark 2002 ) .Legalization also improved incentives for learning skills that further boosted wages .Rivera - Batiz ( 1999 ) finds that observable characteristics accounted for less than half of the substantial difference between the wages of legal and illegal immigrants .However , Duncan and Trejo ( 2009 ) conclude that labor market skills are much more important than legal status in determining immigrants ' wages .Estimates of the share of illegal immigrants that pay federal , state , and local taxes range between 50 and 75 percent ( CBO 2007 ) .Illegal immigrants are not eligible for most federal safety net programs .And some illegal immigrants pay into social security ( they provided fake social security numbers as proof of citizenship to employers ) but will never collect benefits .For example , the Supreme Court has determined that children can not be excluded from public education due to their immigration status .There are about 2 million school - age children who are unauthorized immigrants , and 3 million school - age children are U.S. citizens born to illegal immigrants ( Urban Institute 2006 ) .Together , these groups constitute about 9 percent of school - age children .Other unavoidable costs from illegal immigrants include emergency health care ( since 59 percent of adult illegal immigrants lack health insurance - Passel 2009 ) and law enforcement .Dixon and Rimmer ( 2009 ) find that legalization coupled with a tax on visas could generate $ 180 billion in welfare gains for U.S. households .As part of ongoing research that is still subject to revision , Aguiar and Walmsley ( forthcoming ) estimate that legalization of undocumented Mexican workers in the United States coupled with effective border controls would raise U.S. GDP by 0.17 percent .For example , since the tightening of border security in 1994 , an estimated 5,600 people have died in the wasteland that straddles part of the U.S./Mexican border ( Jiminez 2009 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.64795"}
