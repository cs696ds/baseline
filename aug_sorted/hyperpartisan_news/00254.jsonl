Perlman posted in Criminal Defense on Thursday , December 17 , 2015 .If you have ever been arrested and questioned by police , you know how frightening that situation can be .Police officers and investigators will use any number of tactics to get a confession from you .Below we outline what it means to be arrested , and the tactics to be aware of should you be arrested .Being Arrested by a Police Officer .When you are arrested by a police officer , there is a specific set of events that occur .A police officer must follow legal procedures from arrest to actual placement of a suspect in jail .It 's important to be aware of what these procedures are , as if any of these are violated , a criminal defense attorney may be able to build a strong defense off of those violations .Mike Vitar , the actor that played Benny \" The Jet \" Rodriguez in 1993 movie , \" The Sandlot \" has been charged with assault .Child Actor Accused of Halloween Night Assault .On Halloween night of this year , Vitar , now a Los Angeles firefighter , fellow firefighter Eric Carpenter , and another man , Thomas Molnar allegedly assaulted a 22-year - old man that was handing out Halloween candy to kids .The three were in attendance at a northwest Los Angeles party that was being hosted by Carpenter , 38 , when they noticed the victim was handing out candy to children as they passed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.062294"}

{"text": "In other words , a retraction regarding an article that appeared in the front page of a newspaper should not run in the classifieds section .Publishers and broadcasters would generally be wise to consider publishing corrections or retractions , even when the demand suffers from a procedural defect , because the retraction statute provides a relatively cost - free method of eliminating a potential plaintiff 's claim for general damages .Oregon courts have held that the retraction statute does not violate the Oregon constitution and that it applies only to publishers and broadcasters , and not to individual defendants whose statements happened to be published or broadcast .In a case entitled Schenck v. Oregon Television , Inc. , the Oregon Court of Appeals recently decided that each time an allegedly defamatory statement is republished , the defamed person is allowed a two - week opportunity to demand retraction .In the Schenck case , a television station broadcast a news report in October 1993 that contained an allegedly defamatory statement about the plaintiff .In March of 1994 , the same report was re - broadcast .Although he was aware of the October 1993 broadcast , the plaintiff did not demand a retraction until April 11 , 1994 , within 20 days after the March 1994 broadcast .The Court of Appeals held that the plaintiff 's demand for retraction was not untimely - notwithstanding the fact that he had actual knowledge of the defamatory statement five months earlier - because \" each publication is a discrete tort . \" Privileges : .A media defendant might also be protected by the common law 's doctrine regarding privileges .A privilege is a right to make a statement , even if that statement is defamatory .Privileges fall into two categories : absolute and qualified .An absolute privilege protects the speaker or publisher from any liability for defamation ; the privilege is also referred to as \" absolute immunity \" because the speaker is immunized from liability .The doctrine of absolute privilege arose from the theory that there are certain circumstances in which the ability to speak freely - usually in the context of governmental functions - is so important that it outweighs the interest that an individual has in his or her reputation .Absolute privileges attach to statements made in the course of or incident to judicial proceedings , including statements made by witnesses and parties .An absolute privilege also attaches to statements made during quasi - judicial proceedings , such as proceedings before administrative boards , commissions , and disbarment actions .Statements made as part of a legislator 's duties are also absolutely privileged , although it should be noted that statements made by a legislator to the press outside the actual legislative meeting place and not during the legislative process are not absolutely privileged .Finally , an absolute privilege attaches to publications that are consented to ( if the defamed person had reason to know that the published statement might be defamatory ) and to statements that are made to carry out a statutory requirement .Unlike an absolute privilege , a qualified privilege does not bar a defamation claim .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.747154"}
