{"text": "If the police started filling our jails with people who might have made a mistake on their tax filings , citizens would be outraged .Yet under 287(g ) , people are jailed when their civil immigration status is in question .287(g ) represents the fusion of two separate systems of law enforcement power .Once in place , it can lead to further entanglement of these powers as state and local politicians jump into the campaign to \" crackdown \" on immigrants .But civil immigration and criminal law are fundamentally incompatible .The grey area between civil and criminal law creates a situation ripe for abuse .The Constitution 's protections against arrest without probable cause , indefinite detention , trial without counsel , double jeopardy , and self - incrimination , as well as the statute of limitations , do not apply equally ( or in some cases at all ) in the civil immigration context .In Phoenix , Arizona , efforts to combine civil immigration and criminal law enforcement have wreaked havoc in the courts and overburdened the local criminal justice system .Under a state law that denies bail to immigrants for most crimes , judicial officers who were neutral arbiters in the court 's criminal process have become investigators of possible immigration violations .The first state - level trafficking law in US history has been used to target the victims of trafficking , as prosecutors charge them with conspiring to smuggle themselves across the border from Mexico .The over - burdened courts and jails have swelled with immigrants who are in no sense a danger to public safety .287(g ) provides no money to pay local police salaries , and it shifts immigrant detention costs to local governments .Counties that sign up for the program have found that costs skyrocket .Prince William County , Virginia spent $ 5 million more in local tax monies than anticipated for the first year of its 287(g ) program .The county had to raise property taxes and cut police and fire safety budgets to compensate .While the economic downturn has hamstrung state and regional governments , this is an additional cost that they can not afford .The statute requires that ICE officers \" supervise and direct \" all local police partners , but in practice this does not happen .Poor training and lack of oversight means that local authorities are not equipped to deal with the complexities associated with civil immigration law .Local politicians are using 287(g ) as an opportunity to raise their political profiles as tough on crime and restrictionist on immigration policy .In Butler County , Ohio , ICE extended the powerful civil immigration search , arrest and detention authorities to the sheriff after he campaigned on an anti - immigrant platform .In Phoenix , ICE refuses to revoke the largest 287(g ) agreement , with Sheriff Joe Arpaio , despite charges of racial profiling and national criticism of his posse 's street sweeps of day laborers .Sheriff Arpaio promotes himself as the nation 's most prominent face of the 287(g ) program , calling in the media to film the spectacle of thousands of detainees confined in his Tent City jail under the blazing desert sun .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.134445"}
