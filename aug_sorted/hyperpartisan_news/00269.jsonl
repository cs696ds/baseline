However , other meteorological agencies do not credit Vamei with reaching typhoon strength , so this record is disputed .The record most southerly super typhoon was Kate , which reached super typhoon intensity at 6.0 \u00b0 N , 126.3 \u00b0 E. Kate struck the Philippine island of Mindanao as a Category 4 storm , killing 631 people .Bopha further intensified into a Category 5 typhoon on Monday at 7.4 \u00b0 N latitude , becoming the second most southerly Category 5 typhoon on record , next to Typhoon Louise of 1964 , which was a Category 5 storm at 7.3 \u00b0 N.
