Newton .Background Checks .Free Searches .Background Checks .Criminal Records DUI Offenses Much More .Government and State Records .Thanks first to Bob \" Weeda Claus \" Constantine for having the courage to take his cannabis growing case to trial .Bob 's courage made what happened today possible .Because Bob took his case to trial , the state had to call its undercover agents to the stand and despite their desperate efforts to keep them away from cameras , they were still all seen personally by those of us in the courtroom .The first to testify against Bob was NH Drug Task Force detective Charles I. Newton , the most undercover - looking of them all .He looks like a pretty cool guy and if only he were n't engaging in deception for the purposes of caging peaceful people , maybe he would be .We were unable to get a decent picture of him on the day of Bob 's trial .However , here 's what happened today : .We were going to breakfast in Newport after attending a fellow activist 's speeding ticket trial , when I noticed two cars parked drivers ' side - window - to - window in the parking lot of the Country Kitchen restaurant .He confirmed it and shouted out Charles ' name .Then Charles high - tailed it ( complete with screeching tires ) out of the parking lot .We consulted the young man in the red car and informed him that he 'd been talking to an undercover cop .At least in this instance , we saved the man from going to prison .Newton had already given the young man cash in order to allegedly purchase narcotics , so the deal was almost done when we managed to intervene .Now , if I 'm recalling correctly , Newton testified during Bob 's trial that he lives in Cheshire county .Undercover officers tend to live in one place and work in others so there is a lower chance of them being recognized by locals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.05211"}

{"text": "Wormtail went the other way and betrayed his friends when faced with possibility of death .Snape ran to Dumbledore because he realised than , the magnitude of his mistake by snitching to the Dark Lord about the prophesy .He told Dumbledore he only cared about Lily but relented and told him to protect the whole family in any way possible .His wish to die , was a result of the failure of the concealment .I do n't think he realised until than that Voldemort would stop at nothing .Snape 's strength of character and redeeming quality was his love for Lily Evans .He lost all of that on October 31st .His wish to die had nothing to do with self - preservation .Nor did Dumbledore 's wish to take the rage of Gellert Grindelwald when he was using the cruciatus curse on his brother and whatever evil he committed against his sister .Its true that Lily had no idea how her action would affect Harry but my point was that she wanted to prevent Harry 's death in whichever way she could .Failing that , she did n't want to be around to see her son getting murdered .The statement that Lily placed herself in front of a killing curse by Voldemort simply because she did n't want to live in a world without Harry or James is ludicrous .Mind boggling , I think you are forgetting that neither James nor Lily had a wand on them when Voldemort burst in .They could not fight back , they could not disapparate .Well , let me ask you this .Where is the source in the books that claims that she had no idea of what she did by dying in protection of Harry ?Harry evoked the ancient magic of protective love by thinking about it , by wishing it , by desiring it when he sacrificed himself in the Forbidden Forest .It worked , Voldemort was unable to cast spells which could last against those that Harry loved ; his two best friends , Luna , Neville , the Weasley family , Professor McGonagall and the rest of the Order .That whole scene with Voldemort was just utter desperation and panic from Lily .Of course she was desperate and in a state of panic , they had been shocked by the fact that Tom found them .They had put faith in a person they were sure would not betray them .They suffered from cabin fever , but had let their guard down .Mind you , their guard against Lord Voldemort would have undoubtedly not given them much in store for potential protection .I said it was not necessarily the bravest action .I do think there are instances where dying is one of the bravest things you can do .I was simply stating that in this particular case , I did n't think it was .Its true that people are scared of death .I was taking about situations where the fear of death is overwhelmed by the fear of something else .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.06672"}
