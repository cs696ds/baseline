''This may be a divorce , but it 's a divorce with children , ' ' one negotiator said .Disney and Miramax representatives have declined to comment publicly regarding their split .Matthew Hiltzik , a Miramax spokesman , said , ' 'The Weinsteins are focused on continuing to maximize profitability of our films and achieving an amiable resolution with Disney . ' 'The two sides have been in talks for more than a year to resolve their dispute over whether Disney would extend the Weinsteins ' employment agreements past September 2005 .Disney bought Miramax from the Weinsteins in 1993 for $ 80 million .The unit , once known for smaller independent films , has since produced star - driven , Academy Award - winning fare like ' ' Shakespeare in Love , ' ' as well as popular franchises like the ' ' Spy Kids ' ' series from its Dimension Films label .Several negotiators involved in the discussions between Disney and the Weinsteins said that both sides had hoped to reach an agreement last fall .Various iterations of a Disney / Miramax partnership have been explored , including one since - abandoned scenario in which Bob Weinstein , Harvey 's brother , who runs the successful Dimension Films , would stay at Disney while his brother left to start a separate production company .In November , Disney was inching toward a split as it prepared to file information with the Securities and Exchange Commission about its businesses .In the December filing Disney made no mention of a separation , but said that the investment in Miramax would not continue ' ' at the same level ' ' after the Weinsteins ' contracts ended .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.55363"}

{"text": "In recent weeks the chilly relations thawed somewhat as both sides began working toward a peaceable resolution , the three negotiators said .Some of those involved estimate that Disney could pay the Weinsteins more than $ 100 million , including bonuses , in ending their contracts .Disney , two of the negotiators said , is not demanding the Weinsteins sign a noncompete clause , something studios often ask in return for letting executives out of their contracts early .But there is still one sticking point : who will own the Miramax name , which is derived from those of the Weinsteins ' parents , Miriam and Max .The two negotiators said both sides have agreed not to discuss whether the Weinsteins can buy back the name until all other issues have been resolved .At one point in the last year , the Weinsteins were threatening legal action over the split , company executives said .Disney countered by saying it would audit the Weinsteins ' travel - and - entertainment expenses , the executives said .The relationship hit an all - time low with the release of ' ' Fahrenheit 9/11 , ' ' which Disney refused to distribute .The movie became one of the most profitable films of the year after it was released by Lions Gate Films , and it won a People 's Choice Award on Sunday .Mr. Brittenham has largely been seen as a peacemaker hired to resolve the dispute amicably , while Mr. Boies and Mr. Fields are viewed as heavyweights if the Weinsteins are forced into a legal tussle .In early December Mr. Boies showed up at a meeting with Disney executives , who had expected Mr. Brittenham , two negotiators who attended said .One of them , the Disney executives were unnerved by the litigator 's presence but resumed talks as expected .Not just the executives , but numerous Hollywood agents and dealmakers have been nervous about the breakup and its possible implications for Miramax projects .One agent , for instance , said he met with Disney executives recently to express his concerns because many of his clients -- and their projects -- were in limbo .A turning point in the negotiations , the three negotiators said , was the recent involvement of the Disney veteran Richard Cook , chairman of Walt Disney Studios , who also held talks with Pixar over the companies ' expiring joint venture .Before that , the discussions with Miramax had been handled largely by Peter Murphy , Disney 's chief strategic officer , who had long been Miramax 's sole contact and negotiated previous agreements with the brothers .Mr. Cook 's participation foretold two things about the future of Miramax , the three negotiators said .First , it showed that Miramax , which has operated independent of Walt Disney Studios , was going to be more closely aligned with the rest of the company 's movie operations .And second , it signaled that Disney was ready to begin negotiating what Miramax projects it would allow the Weinsteins to buy when they left .Both sides say they are cautiously optimistic that an announcement about a separation could come soon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.261387"}

Bush saying that Islam is a religion of peace and going to a mosque the week after 9/11 .These Republican leaders have always resisted the urge to go full demagogue .I think they understood that if they did so , it would have very scary consequences .There was always this boundary of responsibility , the kind of thing enforced by William F. Buckley when he was alive .I think that Donald Trump is the first front - runner in the Republican Party to throw that kind of caution to the wind .As demagogic as so much of the conservative movement has been in the United States , and full of outrageous examples of demagoguery , there 's always been this kind of saving remnant , or fear of stirring up the full measure of anger that exists .I will never forget having to see a female president start her campaign event by addressing misogyny , intended as a \" compliment .\" This , of course , is indicative of Sanders ' entire campaign , where gender , or any identity , is n't what 's important ; the issues are .And oh how absurd it is , truly , when one takes a long gaze at the uninterrogated misogyny that is being lobbed at Clinton , even by ostensible progressives .( That link shared with Erica 's permission . )If gender really did n't matter , then it would n't matter to Clinton 's opponents , either .But it does .Clinton 's womanhood matters .Her clothes matter .Her hair matters .Her voice matters .Her tone matters .Her likeability matters .Her emotions matter .Her \" murderous cackle \" matters .The thing about \" the establishment \" is that it 's impervious to such demeanment .It sets the rules by which Hillary Clinton is judged ever wanting , by virtue of metrics that are inextricably tied to womanhood .There is a person in this Democratic primary who can be visibly angry , who can shout , who can use any tone and show any emotion , who can show up to campaign events looking like they just rolled out of bed after a bender .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.24727"}

Carney , left , gives his opening arguments Tuesday , Aug. 18 , 2015 , in Merrimack County Superior Court in Concord , N.H. ( AP Photo / Jim Cole ) .The cross examination began yesterday and continues today .As I said above , the biggest problem for the prosecution is that this young girl was very focused on not making a scene or being \" bitchy .\" She was seemingly very concerned about upsetting Labrie or generally calling attention to herself .From the MNSNBC article cited above : .Still , the girl was pressed by prosecutor Catherine Ruffle , the Deputy Merrimack County Attorney , about an email exchange she had with Labrie after the incident , in which Labrie described her as \" an angel .Reading from copies of the messages displayed on a courtroom projector , the girl told the court that she replied : \" You 're quite an angel yourself , but would you mind keeping the events of this evening to yourself for now ?Asked why she had called Labrie an angel , the girl said she was trying not to upset him .It was almost like I was sticking to the script that he was offering , \" she said of his email .\" I thought it would be rude otherwise to ignore it , or it would cause him to approach me again if I ignored it .I was afraid of him coming after me again .In subsequent messages over Facebook , the girl told the court , she asked Labrie if he wore a condom and he assured her he had , and inquired if she was taking birth control medication .Why else would she chat and giggle and seemingly flirt in some cases if what happened was rape and not a consensual encounter between two teens ?The explanation of the girl , now 16 and on the witness stand in a Concord , New Hampshire courtroom : She did n't want to offend him .She was trying to be polite .She did n't want to be \" bitchy , \" or a \" withering little girl .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.77002"}
