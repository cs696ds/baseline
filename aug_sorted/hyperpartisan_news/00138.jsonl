Paul McHale ( Pa. ) , the first Democrat to call for Clinton 's resignation and a member viewed as a likely impeachment supporter , yesterday circulating the House 's first formal censure proposal .A senior Republican aide acknowledged that McHale 's move could carry \" tremendous weight \" in the debate over whether Clinton should be impeached for concealing his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky in the Paula Jones case and subsequent criminal investigation .The aide said the vote count found that while full House approval of impeachment on a perjury charge was \" definitely in play , \" an obstruction of justice charge , \" at the present time , has no chance . \"Should an impeachment vote fail on the House floor , Republicans said , it was increasingly likely that the leadership would allow a vote on censure .In an interview , Rules Committee Chairman Gerald B.H. Solomon suggested the form a censure resolution could take : a measure , like McHale 's proposal , that would be passed by both the House and Senate and require Clinton 's signature .Forcing the president to sign the resolution , Solomon suggested , \" might be the same kind of embarrassment \" as other censure options that are unlikely to pass the House .Yesterday 's vote survey and Solomon 's comments were among the first indications since Speaker - designate Bob Livingston ( R - La . ) assumed leadership of the House GOP that Republicans outside the Judiciary Committee have begun seriously to explore possible outcomes to the impeachment inquiry .The Judiciary panel itself now seems intent on wrapping up its investigation as soon as possible in order to meet Chairman Henry J. Hyde 's ( R - Ill . ) current plan for a vote on articles of impeachment the week of Dec. 7 and a House floor vote the following week .Judiciary Committee sources said the panel has no plans to depose any witnesses beyond the three expected to appear next week regarding Clinton 's involvement with former White House volunteer Kathleen E.

Russ Feingold was hoping his fellow Democrats would offer a groundswell of support for his maverick resolution calling for President Bush 's censure over warrantless eavesdropping , he did n't get it Friday at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on his proposal .Besides Feingold , the only Democrat to speak at the three - hour hearing was Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont .He indicated he might support censure , which would bring the number of Feingold 's co - sponsors in his lonely quest to four of the Senate 's 44 Democrats .The two others who have signed on to support censure are Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Sen. Barbara Boxer of California , who quietly offered her support last week .Neither are members of the judiciary panel .\" The president told the American people on more than one occasion that if domestic wiretapping were taking place , it was being done with a court order .That simply was n't true , and this president has to be held accountable for breaking a very clear law , which requires a warrant when spying on Americans on U.S. soil , \" Boxer said Friday in a statement .California 's other senator , Judiciary Committee member Dianne Feinstein , did n't attend the hearing .\" Other scheduling commitments , \" her spokesman Howard Gantman said .Most Democrats are nervous , if not dismayed , by Feingold 's election - year proposal .It excoriates Bush , accusing him of breaking the law by violating civil liberties while skirting congressionally approved provisions for going to court to get domestic wiretapping warrants .Some Democrats feel Feingold 's proposal goes too far by attacking a president while the country is involved in war .Others fear it could energize Republicans , much as GOP efforts to impeach Democratic President Bill Clinton backfired on Republican candidates in the 1998 congressional elections .Republicans say the resolution is a partisan move by Wisconsin 's Feingold , who is interested in running for president in 2008 , and could weaken Bush in his effort to defeat international terrorism .Feingold said he was n't deterred .\" If we in the Congress do n't stand up for ourselves and for the American people , we become complicit in the lawbreaking .A resolution of censure is the appropriate response , even a modest approach , \" he said .The committee 's chairman , Sen.

Simpson , a professor at Arizona State University , is a leading historian of 19th - century American political and military history whose work concentrates on the Civil War and Reconstruction era .In recent years , he has followed the development of an increasingly shrill neo - Confederate movement and particularly the use of misleading or plainly false information by many of its ideologues .Intelligence Report : Let 's talk about some of the unorthodox views of modern neo - Confederate ideologues .One of their key contentions is that the Civil War was n't about slavery at all , that it was fundamentally a clash of two differing economic systems .Is there anything to that ?Simpson : First of all , without slavery there 's no Civil War in the first place , there 's no irreconcilable conflict , so that 's a sine qua non .Second , when people talk about conflicting economic systems , obviously the root of the conflict was that the South 's economic system was based upon plantation slavery .So one ca n't talk about different economic systems without once again coming back to the issue of slavery .That was fundamental to what the South was about .There is a strange paradox here .These people deride what they call political correctness , and yet one of their first missions is to whitewash the Confederacy of any connection with slavery .They actually seem sensitive to any possibility that the Confederacy is linked with race , and want to absolve the Confederacy of any charges of racism at all .You can see that in the fight over the Confederate flag , where the neo - Confederates say , \" This is heritage , not hate .It has nothing to do with race at all .\" At the same time they 're essentially defending white supremacy , they deny race has anything to do with it .IR : So you see these neo - Confederates , the leaders and thinkers of groups like the League of the South ( LOS ) , as basically white supremacist ?Simpson : They certainly want the revival of the principles of the Confederacy , and one those principles would in fact be white supremacy , unquestioned and explicit .The racism that 's woven into their comments is often quite astonishing .IR : What actually was the Confederate view of slavery ?Simpson : Confederates during the Civil War had no problem whatsoever in associating their cause with the protection of slavery and a system of white supremacy which they thought was inherent in the Confederate world order .The Confederates of 1861 - 65 were much more honest about the importance of slavery than are the neo - Confederates of today .In a famous address [ known to historians as the \" Cornerstone Speech \" ] , the vice president of the Confederacy , Alexander Stephens , said in 1861 that \" slavery is the cornerstone of the Confederacy . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.508156"}

Helper , argued that non - slaveholding Southern whites ought to wake up to their economic exploitation by slaveholding whites .That 's the kind of message that many slaveholding whites took to heart , and so they spoke about reopening the international slave trade with the idea that if you increase the supply , you lower the price .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.03163"}
