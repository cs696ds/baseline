Bush wanted a solution that relied on the market rather than on government regulation .So in the Clean Air Act of 1990 , he proposed a plan that would cap sulfur - dioxide emissions but let the market decide how to allocate the permits .That was \" more compatible with economic growth than using only the command and control approaches of the past , \" he said .The plan passed easily , with \" aye \" votes from Sen.

Mitt Romney passed an individual mandate in Massachusetts and drove its number of uninsured below 5 percent .The Clean Air Act of 1990 solved the sulfur - dioxide problem .The 1990 budget deal helped cut the deficit and set the stage for a remarkable run of growth .Rather , it appears that as Democrats moved to the right to pick up Republican votes , Republicans moved to the right to oppose Democratic proposals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.02778"}
