{"text": "Unfortunately , there are people who continue to spearhead efforts to discredit him with inaccurate biographical information and out and out lies .Fortunately , all one has to do is see and listen to Senator Kerry to realize his attackers are just plain wrong about him and are just demostrating malice towards Senator Kerry .The Senator deserves another try at the White House , it 's time the Democrats realize they harm themselves by ignoring their best people simply because of a loss .I wholeheartedly agree with those saying that the Democrats must be able to appeal to the Great American Middle .The public must be confident that the Democratic nominee will be a credible commander - in - chief .Since Vietnam , ther have been only 2 Democrats elected president .Carter won only because of the Watergate backlash and was also helped by being a Southerner .It might seem strange to younger people ( I am over 50 ) but Carter was seen as a moderate to conservative Democrat in 1976 .His opponents for the nomination were to his left .While he has been an admirable ex - president , his presidency was a failure .Clinton was elected only because Ross Perot siphoned off many Republican votes and because , with the recent collapse of the Soviet Union , the commander - in - chief issue did not seem so important .You can make a strong argument that Carter 's and Clinton 's elections were aberrations .Forty years of poor Democratic showings in presidential elections can be traced to the fact that a large number of people simply do not trust the Democrats on national security issues .I believe that the breathtaking incompetence of the Bush administration leaves an opening for the Democrats to regain credibility on national security and win back the White House .My ideas are : 1 .I see a lot of hyper - ventilating on the left about Democratic Senators who voted for the Iraq war .Although we now know that Bush & Co. hyped the intelligence and ignored contradictory intelligence , remember that every major intelligence agency thought Sadaam had an active WMD program .The Clinton administration thought so .The New York Times was editorializing about Sadaam and WMDs even before Judith Miller became a mouthpiece for the neo - cons .The correct position for those who voted for the war is that Bush and Rumsfeld bungled it by not following military advice , specifically from General Shineski .I do not believe it would be possible , moral or prudent to simply withdraw from Iraq after the mess we have created .Furthermore , if a Democratic president did do that , I believe that the resulting chaos would be a political disaster for the Democrats .Katrina is a tragedy but a great example to use of how Bush and company have a very narrow vision of security .That can lead to a re - definition of national security that encompasses economic matters as well .The port fiasco also plays into that .So does the alienation of so many of our allies ( although this critique has to be handled carefully - making it seem as if , say France , has a veto over US actions is a definite non - starter ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.16858"}

W. Bush and Secretary of State John Kerry - all showed great judgment in considering , but not bowing to , the advice of the foreign policy establishment .Reagan proved wise in choosing to withdraw from Lebanon and negotiate with Mikhail Gorbachev , and Obama has smartly avoided getting involved in the Syrian civil war , negotiated an arms - control deal with Iran and set a deadline to end the surge in Afghanistan .I have no doubt that Sanders will be willing to challenge the foreign policy establishment , as Obama did on such issues .Does Sanders have the same amount of foreign policy experience as Hillary Clinton ?Obviously not .But Bill Clinton had far less foreign policy experience than George H.

Kennedy would not mobilize them -- nor would he repudiate them .The vice presidential nomination must be offered him by the president of the United States -- and at that point , it if were offered , they could discuss the terms of their partnership . \"With a nod from Clinton on Tuesday , the Clinton loyalists swung into action .Lanny Davis , the ever - present advocate , announced a petition drive to put her on the ticket .Robert L. Johnson , the billionaire founder of Black Entertainment Television who was forced to apologize for a tawdry reference to Obama in South Carolina , sent a letter to Rep. James Clyburn on Wednesday morning calling on him to encourage Obama to put Clinton on the ticket .That the Clinton constituency is , for now , a separate force within the party is without question -- as she made clear on Tuesday night .Many are women but others are part of the network that Hillary and Bill Clinton have seeded and watered and nurtured for decades .Obama now must court them , delicately , as he turns his attention to the general election .And Obama must feel the same way Johnson did in 1964 .This is how White described it : \" A president must be president in his own right ....To attach a Kennedy name to his own name would mean forever sharing the title of the presidency with a ghost of the past ....If Johnson were to prove himself in a campaign for the presidency , he must prove himself alone .\" Obama may never be free of the Clintons .Certainly he will not be if he selects her as his vice president .That may seem an unlikely pairing , given what appears to be a chilly personal relationship and the enormous problem of what to do about Bill Clinton .But is it any more unlikely that Jack Kennedy selecting Johnson in 1960 ?And , can he risk spurning her if she genuinely wants to be vice president ?Even if the so - called dream ticket never materializes , Obama and his team will be dealing with the Clintons .Will the Clintons ever give Obama the respect and deference owed the leader of the party , or will resentments at having lost the nomination to him color their attitudes and control their actions ?The former president , whose reputation has been hurt by this campaign , will have ambitions to restore his prestige .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.00882"}

{"text": "The above electoral map prediction from Western Illinois University has received a lot of attention , especially among supporters of Bernie Sanders , for showing Sanders winning in a landslide .Some argue that we should take this seriously because the mock election model has been right in every election it was used in since 1975 .The catch is that it was only used three times since 1975 .They deserve some credit for correctly predicting victories for Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford before many people had heard of Carter , and for predicting the election of Obama when many were ( as with Sanders now ) claiming he was unelectable .While I would love for this to be true , it is also very hard to accept the results in specific states , such as Sanders winning Mississippi and Georgia but losing in Hawaii and Maryland .Of course the claims of being right are limited to the final results and not accuracy of state by state predictions .A victory for Sanders , even if closer and involving a different set of states , would still be welcome .It is easy to dismiss this prediction , and I could not blame either Clinton or the Republicans for denying any meaning to it beyond the enthusiasm of college students for Sanders .The bigger question this year is whether we can believe the conventional polls , especially when they are being used to determine who qualifies for the debates , which can potentially influence the outcome .Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie have been eliminated from Tuesday 's main debate , along with George Pataki and Lindsay Graham being excluded from the undercard debate .Even some pollsters have argued that the polls should not be used in this manner .One problem is that the Republican candidates are too close together to use the polls to separate them .Then there is the question of whether the polls are all that accurate in predicting a primary election well before the vote .I 've followed the Democratic primaries far more closely , and have noted many times how little predictive value the polls have .This polling report from December 2007 described how Clinton had a huge lead over Obama .In December 2003 , Howard Dean was pulling away in the polls .Eventual winner John Kerry was in sixth place with only 4 percent , even trailing Al Sharpton .Among the problems with these polls , many voters in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire do not decide until the last minute .People are far more likely to switch between relatively similar members of their own party than they are to switch from a liberal Democrat to a conservative Republican in a general election .Pollsters also adjust the raw results based upon projections as to who will actually vote , but that is difficult to predict .Some polls this year are basing their prediction upon whether someone voted in previous Democratic primaries , but this excludes the people are who , at least from discussions on line , are saying they have just recently registered to vote Democratic in order to vote for Sanders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.196075"}

W. Bush and Secretary of State John Kerry - all showed great judgment in considering , but not bowing to , the advice of the foreign policy establishment .Reagan proved wise in choosing to withdraw from Lebanon and negotiate with Mikhail Gorbachev , and Obama has smartly avoided getting involved in the Syrian civil war , negotiated an arms - control deal with Iran and set a deadline to end the surge in Afghanistan .I have no doubt that Sanders will be willing to challenge the foreign policy establishment , as Obama did on such issues .Does Sanders have the same amount of foreign policy experience as Hillary Clinton ?Obviously not .But Bill Clinton had far less foreign policy experience than George H.

{"text": "How does he plan to do that and how much will this cost the US ?Henry Kissinger was the master of Realpolitik - the amoral assessment of national interests .He was certainly aware of humanitarian concerns and doing the right thing and all that idealistic talk about spreading freedom and democracy , but that was irrelevant to his work .His work was diplomacy and he was the ultimate pragmatist .We could support brutal dictators , or those who overthrew brutal dictators - it did n't matter .He held that the only thing that really mattered was our basic national interests - safety and prosperity - and that usually left only one geopolitical alternative .Sometimes you do awful things - send in a team to take out an newly elected leader who is obvious going to cause trouble , support a genocidal murderer who will be on our side in important other matters , bomb the crap out of Cambodia or whatever .This does ignore an array of values that almost everyone has - common decency and the sense that killing a whole lot of people might be a bit wrong .Kissinger pretty much shrugged at anyone who had that sort of sense of right and wrong .That that nothing to do with his work .Kissinger obviously got no points for being warm and fuzzy , and many came to see him as a bit of a moral monster .We got neither from that Paris treaty - the war would actually end two years later when our last chopper lifted off from the roof of our embassy in Saigon - we ended up giving up everything - but somehow Kissinger 's reputation did n't suffer .He was a wise man .He knew things .He was n't a nice man , but he knew things , and he could get things done .He was born in F\u00fcrth , Bavaria , in Germany .He never lost the accent .Germans get things done , and he was our secretary of state for most of the seventies .He defined those times .It was a brutal time .Henry Kissinger is ninety - two now .No one any longer asks him for advice - the world has changed and he 's a frail old man - but somehow he 's back in the news .Gary Bass at Politico explains how that happened : .Of all the dastardly deeds for which Henry Kissinger can be blamed , here 's an especially odd one : he made Hillary Clinton lose a foreign policy debate with Bernie Sanders .Yes , that happened , and it was odd : .Kissinger usually gets a free pass in Washington , where celebrity has a way of overshadowing historical analysis , but it 's still jarring to see Hillary Clinton embracing him .After all , in her youth , she protested against the Vietnam War and served as a staffer on the House Judiciary Committee considering impeaching President Richard Nixon for Watergate .It takes a stone - cold pragmatist to know one , but Bass notes that this one is troublesome : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.60582"}

Kennedy had great enmity for one another but shared a deep and authentic care for \" the poor \" of the country .Johnson had started out as a teacher of immigrant children in the hill country of Texas and never forgot that one reason he ran for office was to create better opportunities for such children to succeed in life .When he became president on the death of John F.

{"text": "All of a sudden the rules are changed .Yesterday I attended an event sponsored by the World Affairs Council of Portland , Oregon .Tom Bartlett , past President of the American University of Cairo , spoke of the context of what is happening in Egypt .He emphasized that the population there has exploded over the past few decades , now at 85 million people .The average age is 24 years old , so these demonstrations represent a revolt of the young against a regime that has not provided adequate economic and political opportunities .Bartlett also said that a key fact to realize about Egypt is that it has to import forty percent of its food .That means that it has to raise the income to buy this food from others , which it obtains through tourism and charges for use of the Suez Canal , among other sources .Even groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood realize this .Bartlett said the Brotherhood is only one and not a significant factor in political reconstitution of the country .Note this , because the neoconservative right wing in this country has already begun to raise great fear about this .Also , he said Iran will not have influence in Egypt , as Juan Cole explains in an article I placed on this website .It may be helpful to keep three factors in mind as you watch the unfolding of these events .First on religion , Egypt is a Sunni Muslim nation , not Shia like Iran .The Sunni are more likely to affirm secular government than the Shia .That 's why when George W. Bush began the war in Iraq he did n't really know what he was doing .The Shia are dominant in Iraq , Saddam Hussein , a Sunni , had kept the lid on the Shia in Iraq the years he was in power .With \" democracy \" in Iraq the Shia are now in power , just as the Shia are in power in Iran .( Iran is ethnically Persian , Iraq is Arab ) .This distinction between Shia and Sunni is critical to understanding the differences among Muslims .Egypt is much less likely to adopt an Islamist extremist government due to its history as a more secular and Sunni culture .A second factor is the role of Israel .Policy in the United States tends to focus on Israel because of the strength of the Israel lobby and neoconservative propaganda .This is the source of hysteria over changes in the Muslim world , and why so many are expressing fear and worry over what is happening in Egypt .The various dictators in Arab countries have been able to keep their populations in check , and keep the oil flowing , through political repression , and the United States has supported these dictators since they maintained the power balance with Israel .A democratic Egypt would certainly change that equation ; there would be a different orientation to Israel , and anything \" different \" is to be feared according to those who put Israel at the absolute top of their priorities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.70697"}

Daley .A few weeks ago I was watching a program on C - Span pertaining to the impact of foreign court opinions upon the U.S. justice system .The primary participants in the discussion were Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer , and the event took place at the American University Law School in Washington D.C. rtsp://video.c - span .org / archive / sc / sc011305_scalia .rm .The debate revolved around questions asked by a moderator named Professor Norman Dorsen , and the first multi - part question asked was , \" When we talk about the use of foreign court decisions in U.S. Constitutional cases , what body of foreign law are we talking about ?Are we limiting this to foreign constitutional law ?What about cases involving international law , such as the interpretation of treaties , including treaties to which the U.S. is a party ?When we talk about the use of foreign court decisions in U.S. law , do we mean them to be authority , or persuasive , or rhetorical ?If , for example , foreign court decisions are not understood to be precedent in U.S. Constitutional cases , are they nevertheless able to strengthen the sense that U.S. law assures a common moral and legal framework with the rest of the world ?If this is so , is that in order to strengthen the legitimacy of a decision within the U.S. , or to strengthen a decision 's legitimacy in the rest of the world ? \" Some question , huh ?I do n't think I 'd be comfortable trying to answer it all in one fell swoop , and apparently neither did the two justices .Justice Scalia began his reply by stating that most of the parts of it should be posed to Justice Breyer , simply because Scalia does not use foreign law in the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution .He stated that he will use it when interpreting a treaty , because treaties are based upon a mutual understanding of the law by the signatories thereof .That seemed like a no - brainer to me , and the point was not argued by Breyer .Scalia went on to say that , aside from that , he refuses to use foreign decisions in Constitutional law .He argued that some justices refer to foreign law because they want to feel assured that we have the same \" moral and legal framework as the rest of the world . \"He then pointed out , quite matter - of - factly , that we do n't have the same moral and legal framework , and we never have .He continued by referring to the Federalist Papers , saying that they are full of statements which make it clear that our founding fathers had little respect for the laws of European countries in that day and age , citing a passage by James Madison to that effect .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.94298"}
