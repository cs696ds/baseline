Nelson 's request , however , would broaden the scope of that investigation to include more than a dozen other states that have implemented similar laws .We are especially concerned about how such laws will affect the Latino voting population in Florida and the several other states that have decided voter suppression is a priority .In Florida alone , there are 1.6 million Latinos currently registered to vote - that 's more than 13 percent of the state 's entire registered voter population .In 2008 , Latinos made up almost 12 percent of all of those who voted in Florida .And , next year ( and each year for the next 20 after it ) , 500,000 Latinos will become eligible to vote in the entire United States .We think this is encouraging news for our community , but the reality is that there are some elected officials who see these numbers as a threat .They will do anything they can to preserve their power , even if that means disenfranchising an entire community .The situation has become so critical in Florida that the non - partisan League of Women Voters , concerned about violating the misguided law , recently announced that after 72 years they would not be running their regular voter registration drive .The American Civil Liberties Union works daily in courts , legislatures and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties that the Constitution and laws of the United States guarantee everyone in this country .In November 1919 and January 1920 , in what notoriously became known as the \" Palmer Raids , \" Attorney General Mitchell Palmer began rounding up and deporting so - called radicals .Thousands of people were arrested without warrants and without regard to constitutional protections against unlawful search and seizure .In reaction to these egregious civil liberties abuses , a small group of people formed the American Civil Liberties Union .In the website of the ACLU , they make this statement about voter suppression : .During the 2011 legislative sessions , states across the country passed measures to make it harder for Americans - particularly African - Americans , the elderly , students and people with disabilities - to exercise their fundamental right to cast a ballot .Over thirty states considered laws that would require voters to present government - issued photo ID in order to vote .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.138405"}

BUSH :The attorney general went up and gave a very candid assessment and answered every question he could possibly answer , honestly answer , and in a way that increased my confidence in his ability to do the job .AMY GOODMAN : While last week 's Senate hearing focused on the firing of the eight U.S. attorneys , another related scandal is brewing inside Alberto Gonzales 's Justice Department .Former Justice Department attorneys have publicly accused the Bush administration of politicizing the department 's Civil Rights Division which was formed half a century ago to protect the voting rights of African Americans .According to a recent report by the McClatchy newspapers , the Bush administration has pursued an aggressive legal effort to restrict voter turnout in key battleground states in ways that favor Republican political candidates .The administration did this in part by alleging widespread election fraud in largely Democratic areas and to push new voter ID rules .Civil rights advocates contend the administration 's policies were intended to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of poor and minority voters who tend to support Democrats .At least two U.S. attorneys were fired after failing to bring voter fraud cases .Last year The Boston Globe reported the Bush administration is filling the permanent ranks of the Civil Rights Division with lawyers who have strong conservative credentials , but little experience in civil rights .This has led to the Civil Rights Division focusing more on cases alleging reverse discrimination against whites and religious discrimination against Christians .The former head of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department joins us now on the program .Joseph Rich worked at the Justice Department from 1968 to 2005 .He joins us in Washington , D.C. , where he now works for the Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law .Here in New York in our firehouse studio , we 're joined by Bertha Lewis .She is the executive director of New York ACORN , also co - chairs the Working Families Party .And we welcome you both to Democracy Now !Joseph Rich , you have written an op - ed column about this .First of all , talk about the attorneys general you have worked for over time .This administration is the first administration that I felt had politicized the department to the extent that it has .AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about what you see happening right now ?Why do you see it , and where do you see it happening ?JOSEPH RICH :Well , when I was there through 2005 , there was two major things that concerned me the most .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.03879"}

{"text": "Once it was because they were n't as well educated .What 's holding them back now ?Though headway has been made in bringing women 's wages more in line with men 's in the past several decades , that convergence seems to have stalled in more recent years .To help determine why , Francine D. Blau and Lawrence M. Kahn , the authors of a new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research parse data on wages and occupations from 1980 to 2010 .They find that as more women attended and graduated college and headed into the working world , education and professional experience levels stopped playing a significant role in the the difference between men and women 's wages .Whatever remains of the discrepancy ca n't be explained by women not having basic skills and credentials .So what does explain it ?A maverick investor is buying up water rights .Will he rescue a region , or just end up hurting the poor ?O n a brisk , cloudless day last january , Disque Deane Jr. stepped out of his SUV , kicked his cowboy boots in the dirt , and looked around .He had driven two hours from Reno on one of the loneliest stretches of interstate in the United States to visit the Diamond S Ranch , just outside the town of Winnemucca , Nevada .Before him , open fields stretched all the way to the Santa Rosa mountains , 30 miles away .But the land was barren .The fields had been chewed down to the roots by cattle , and the ranch 's equipment had been stripped for parts .A steel trestle bridge lay pitched into the Humboldt River .Surveying the dilapidated structures and the gopher - riddled soil , Deane saw something few others might : potential .The ranch and an adjoining property , totaling about 11,400 acres-14 times the size of Central Park - were for sale for $ 10.5 million , and he was thinking about buying them .When four American women were murdered during El Salvador 's dirty war , a young U.S. official and his unlikely partner risked their lives to solve the case .On December 1 , 1980 , two American Catholic churchwomen - an Ursuline nun and a lay missionary - sat down to dinner with Robert White , the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador .They worked in rural areas ministering to El Salvador 's desperately impoverished peasants , and White admired their commitment and courage .The talk turned to the government 's brutal tactics for fighting the country 's left - wing guerrillas , in a dirty war waged by death squads that dumped bodies in the streets and an army that massacred civilians .The women were alarmed by the incoming Reagan administration 's plans for a closer relationship with the military - led government .Because of a curfew , the women spent the night at the ambassador 's residence .The next day , after breakfast with the ambassador 's wife , they drove to San Salvador 's international airport to pick up two colleagues who were flying back from a conference in Nicaragua .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.87041"}
