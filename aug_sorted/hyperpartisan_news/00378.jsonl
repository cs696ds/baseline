Daley .A few weeks ago I was watching a program on C - Span pertaining to the impact of foreign court opinions upon the U.S. justice system .The primary participants in the discussion were Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer , and the event took place at the American University Law School in Washington D.C. rtsp://video.c - span .org / archive / sc / sc011305_scalia .rm .The debate revolved around questions asked by a moderator named Professor Norman Dorsen , and the first multi - part question asked was , \" When we talk about the use of foreign court decisions in U.S. Constitutional cases , what body of foreign law are we talking about ?Are we limiting this to foreign constitutional law ?What about cases involving international law , such as the interpretation of treaties , including treaties to which the U.S. is a party ?When we talk about the use of foreign court decisions in U.S. law , do we mean them to be authority , or persuasive , or rhetorical ?If , for example , foreign court decisions are not understood to be precedent in U.S. Constitutional cases , are they nevertheless able to strengthen the sense that U.S. law assures a common moral and legal framework with the rest of the world ?If this is so , is that in order to strengthen the legitimacy of a decision within the U.S. , or to strengthen a decision 's legitimacy in the rest of the world ? \" Some question , huh ?I do n't think I 'd be comfortable trying to answer it all in one fell swoop , and apparently neither did the two justices .Justice Scalia began his reply by stating that most of the parts of it should be posed to Justice Breyer , simply because Scalia does not use foreign law in the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution .He stated that he will use it when interpreting a treaty , because treaties are based upon a mutual understanding of the law by the signatories thereof .That seemed like a no - brainer to me , and the point was not argued by Breyer .Scalia went on to say that , aside from that , he refuses to use foreign decisions in Constitutional law .He argued that some justices refer to foreign law because they want to feel assured that we have the same \" moral and legal framework as the rest of the world . \"He then pointed out , quite matter - of - factly , that we do n't have the same moral and legal framework , and we never have .He continued by referring to the Federalist Papers , saying that they are full of statements which make it clear that our founding fathers had little respect for the laws of European countries in that day and age , citing a passage by James Madison to that effect .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.56395"}

Security Council Resolution 1973 for military intervention in Libya .On that day Clinton ordered a general within the Pentagon to refuse to take a call from Gadhafi 's son Seif and other high - level members within the regime , to help negotiate a resolution .A day later , on March 18 , 2011 , Gadhafi himself called for a cease - fire , another action the administration dismissed .In released , but redacted emails , Clinton expressed interest in arming Libyan opposition groups using private security contractors , though at the time , the opposition was not formally recognized by the U.S. or United Nations , which prohibited arming without following strict guidelines and oversight .In an April 8 , 2011 email to her then - deputy chief of staff , Jake Sullivan , Clinton wrote : \" FYI .The idea of using private security experts to arm the opposition should be considered , \" attaching an intelligence report from adviser Sidney Blumenthal , her preferred source of intelligence .Many of those weapons would ultimately be destined for Syria .The cargo reportedly included surface - to - air anti - aircraft missiles , RPG 's and Russian - designed shoulder - launched missiles known as MANPADS , all believed destined for Syrian rebel groups .Both Obama and Clinton had a vested interest in lying about Benghazi and permanently concealing the truth ; Obama to ensure his reelection prospects in 2012 and Hillary to protect hers for 2016 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.556885"}

'The South Dakota Department of Social Services has paid $ 49.7 million so far for a new Medicaid processing system that at this point remains inoperable .The company that eventually won the contract , Client Network Services Inc. of Maryland , submitted a proposal in 2007 , later participated in another final - and - best offer round , and was awarded the contract in June 2008 .The cost of the Obamacare website - which has reportedly run \" north of $ 600 million \" - has also become a scandalous issue .In Michigan , The Southeast Michigan Health Care Exchange - which set up a state Obamacare exchange - pursued a suit initially valued at $ 7 million for breach of contract involving services provided by CNSI for IT services with that website .In 2006 , CNSI was the subject of a lengthy expose in the IT trade journal , CIO Magazine , which detailed allegations that CNSI produced a low ball bid in order to win a contract , only to have the final cost balloon exponentially .A company from Gaithersburg , Maryland , Client Network Services Incorporated or CNSI , already has a contract in Michigan to perform similar services .By forming an alliance with Michigan , Illinois was able to bypass a drawn - out , expensive bidding process because the state procurement code says HFS does n't need one if there is an intergovernmental agreement .According to the war room notes , CNSI was in constant communications with staffers at HHS on the Obamacare website .CNSI is working on items to be able to provide to us management reports .It probably wo n't be a daily email update ; it will likely be a portal log - in to view the information , which would be cumulative and provide trending analysis .When it comes to nailing major criminals , the FBI does n't have a problem turning a blind eye to the law .The FBI caught major criticism for doing this over ten years ago , when it admitted to overlooking James \" Whitey \" Bulger 's brutal Boston crime ring in exchange for information on the Mafia .Since then , it has had to submit a record of overlooked crimes to the Justice Department every year .Agents authorized 15 crimes a day , on average , including everything from buying and selling illegal drugs to bribing government officials and plotting robberies .FBI officials have said in the past that permitting their informants - who are often criminals themselves - to break the law is an indispensable , if sometimes distasteful , part of investigating criminal organizations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.91829"}

Allard , 634 F.2d 1182 ( 9th Cir.1980 ) .The rule is aimed more at the unlawful conduct than at the lawful availability or unavailability of the evidence .See United States v. Taheri , 648 F.2d 598 ( 9th Cir.1981 ) ; 634 F.2d at 1182 .The decision in McGarry rested upon the fact that the government not only could have summonsed the documents but was actually in the process of so doing before the illegal seizure took place .See United States v. Romero , 692 F.2d 699 ( 10th Cir.1982 ) ( exclusionary rule does not apply where lawful search underway prior to illegal search would have discovered evidence ) .Thus in McGarry the court believed that lawful efforts , begun prior to the illegal seizure , would inevitably have come up with the same documents .See United States v. Bienvenue , 632 F.2d 910 ( 1st Cir.1980 ) .While the government argues that would have happened here also , the lower court was not compelled to agree with that proposition .See LaFave , Search and Seizure Sec . 11.4 ( 1978 ) ( inevitable discovery exception to exclusionary rule should only be applied where it is in fact certain that evidence would have been lawfully obtained had it not been for illegal search ) .C. Evidence Obtained after January 9 , 1980 .The district court also ordered suppression of all of the evidence obtained by government agents after the illegal search , consisting primarily of documents obtained during interviews with dealers .The government argues that these were obtained independently of the search and , even if not , could have been so acquired .The government further claims that even if the district court were correct in suppressing some of the evidence obtained after January 9 , 1980 , it erred in ordering a blanket suppression of all such evidence .We first consider the former contention and then discuss the sweep of the district court 's order .Wong Sun v.

{"text": "Moreover , Houle stated that it took him four months to review the materials taken from Rocca 's house , suggesting that they provided a wealth of information to the government .Given this , there was sufficient basis for the district court to have concluded that some of the evidence acquired after January 9 , 1980 was tainted fruit of the poisonous tree .We do not agree with the government that United States v. Ceccolini , 435 U.S. 268 , 98 S.Ct .1054 , 55 L.Ed.2d 268 ( 1978 ) , precludes suppression of documentary evidence later acquired from the dealer interviews .Stressing our adversary system 's preference for live testimony , the Court in Ceccolini declined to treat a witness 's voluntary testimony as derivative of an illegal search or seizure .435 U.S. at 277 , 98 S.Ct . at 1060 .But the question here is not rejection of live testimony but rather suppression of documents obtained from third parties .While the intervening role of third parties should be considered in determining whether documentary evidence was discovered independently of an illegal search or seizure , i d .at 288 , 98 S.Ct . at 1066 , it is but one of the factors to be weighed .See United States v. Carsello , 578 F.2d 199 , 203 n. 3 ( 7th Cir . ) , cert .denied , 439 U.S. 979 , 99 S.Ct .565 , 58 L.Ed.2d 650 ( 1978 ) .Here the district court could have found that this factor was outweighed by other considerations .Absent the illegal search , the investigators might not have known the identity of all of the third parties nor what to ask them .Compare 435 U.S. at 279 , 98 S.Ct . at 1061 .There was some indication , moreover , that the government anticipated that the illegal search would help lead it to the other dealers and documents .Compare 435 U.S. at 280 , 98 S.Ct . at 1062 .Finally , there is no indication the third parties would have come forward on their own had the investigators not sought them out .Nor can we say the district court erred in not giving effect to the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule .Prior to the search the government lacked sufficient knowledge about Auto Alley to obtain a valid search warrant .And although much of the information the government obtained after the search was theoretically available in the computers of state motor vehicle departments , Kinney testified that the very problem in the investigation was that many of the titles being searched were mysteriously absent from state data banks .In Bienvenue the government knew prior to the search that the defendant had booked flights with a Manchester travel agent .It could easily have located the agent and uncovered the evidence .Here the government was looking for information on hundreds of cars , registered in numerous states , each of which passed through several hands .Given the enormous difficulty and expense of uncovering all of this information , plus Kinney 's statement that some of the information was found to be missing from state computers , the district court could have found that discovery of some of the documents was far from inevitable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.25506"}

{"text": "That 's true , too , because this seems to be tied to a specific investigation , rather than the enterprise counterterrorism investigation that underlies the phone dragnet ( and presumably the CIA program ) .So while this practice generated enough attention to be the investigation , I doubt it is .The Scary Car Broker Plot .Then there 's what I call the Scary Car Broker Plot , which I wrote about here .Basically , it 's a giant investigation into drug trafficking from Colombia through Western Africa that contributes some money to Hezbollah and therefore has been treated as a terror terror terror investigation when in reality it is a drug investigation .Treasury named Ayman Joumaa , the ultimate target of that investigation , a Specially Designated Trafficker in February 2011 , so presumably the investigation was very active in November 2010 , when FISC issued the order .The case 's domestic component involves the car broker businesses of a slew of ( probably completely innocent ) Lebanese - Americans , who did business with the larger network via wire transfers .Perhaps most interesting , the government got at these businessmen by suing them , rather than charging them , which raised significant Fifth Amendment Issues .So between that tactic and Joumaa 's rather celebrated status , I believe this is a possible case .And the timing - from 2007 until 2011 , when Joumaa got listed - would certainly make sense .All that said , this aspect of the investigation was made public in the suit naming the car brokers , so FBI would be hard - pressed to claim that providing more details would compromise the investigation .HSBC 's Material Support for Terrorism .Then there 's a very enticing possibility : that this is an investigation into HSBC for its material support for terrorism , in the form of providing cash dollars to the al Rajhi bank which went on to support terrorist attacks ( including 9/11 ) .HSBC 's wrist slap for money laundering is one of the most noted legal atrocities in recent memory , but most people focus on the bank 's role laundering money for drug cartels .Yet as I 've always emphasized , HSBC also played a key role in providing money to al Qaeda - related terrorists .As the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations ' report made clear , HSBC 's material support for terror continued until 2010 .After the 9 - 11 terrorist attack in 2001 , evidence began to emerge that Al Rajhi Bank and some of its owners had links to financing organizations associated with terrorism , including evidence that the bank 's key founder was an early financial benefactor of al Qaeda .In 2005 , HSBC announced internally that its affiliates should sever ties with Al Rajhi Bank , but then reversed itself four months later , leaving the decision up to each affiliate .HSBC Middle East , among other HSBC affiliates , continued to do business with the bank .Due to terrorist financing concerns , HBUS closed the correspondent banking and banknotes accounts it had provided to Al Rajhi Bank .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.692"}

United States , 251 U.S. 385 , 40 S.Ct .182 , 64 L.Ed .That holding was reaffirmed when McGarry appealed his criminal conviction on the basis of the admission of the once seized documents .388 F.2d at 862 .The McGarry cases do not dictate reversal of the suppression order here .An important factor in them was the district court 's finding that the IRS knew of the records independently of the illegal search and was in the process of lawfully obtaining the documents at the time of the agent 's illegal seizure .The return of the documents thus restored the status quo ante , the ultimate result being no different than had the illegal search never taken place .Here the record did not require the court to find , and it did not find , that the government would inevitably have come to these records apart from the illegal search .While Houle had unearthed much information , it is not clear he had encountered , or necessarily would have encountered , much of the material found at Rocca 's house , including the damning registry stamps and the documents linking Auto Alley to the three Vermont dealers .Furthermore , unlike the situation in McGarry , the government did not regain possession of the documents by a means wholly independent of the illegal activity .The documents eventually came back to the government as the result of Ralph Alley 's plea bargain -- and this was the product of a criminal prosecution reinforced by the illegally seized evidence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.20743"}

New York , 401 U.S. 222 , 226 , 91 S.Ct .643 , 646 , 28 L.Ed.2d 1 ( 1971 ) ( Miranda violation \" can not be perverted into a license to use perjury by way of a defense , free from the risk of confrontation with prior inconsistent utterances \" ) .At the same time , the admission of the evidence will ordinarily have little if any impact on the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule .As the Fifth Circuit stated in Turk : . 526 F.2d at 667 .This is particularly so in cases like the present where , although the illegal search and seizure was carried out by state officials , the perjury counts are being federally prosecuted .We thus hold that the illegally obtained evidence was not suppressible on fourth amendment grounds as to the perjury indictment .But while evidence of this character is not , in the ordinary sense , suppressible at trials for subsequent acts of perjury , there may be ample reason to exclude it at this single trial involving both the perjury counts and the conspiracy and motor vehicle counts .The suppression order as to the latter counts would be meaningless if the suppressed evidence could be presented to the same jury as part of the government 's perjury case .Cf .Bruton v. United States , 391 U.S. 123 , 88 S.Ct .1620 , 20 L.Ed.2d 476 ( 1968 ) ( limiting instructions do not cure sixth amendment violation where defendant can not cross - examine as to statement of codefendant admitted only against the codefendant ) .The illegally acquired evidence here was vast in quantity and highly probative of the conspiracy and motor vehicle charges .An instruction would insufficiently remove the prejudice .Under such circumstances , while the material is technically not \" suppressible \" as to the perjury counts , it is excludable from the trial as a whole .4 We thus affirm the \" suppression \" order relative to the perjury counts insofar as it is taken to be an advance ruling forbidding use of the evidence at a single trial involving the conspiracy and motor vehicle counts .Were the government to request a severed trial and the district court to grant it , or were the government to proceed only on the perjury counts , there would cease to be any proper reason to withhold this evidence .We hold only that the district court did not abuse its discretion in barring the admission of the evidence from a proceeding trying both the perjury and the other counts .

Materials Seized in the Course of the Illegal Search on January 9 , 1980 .In arguing against suppression of the materials unlawfully seized at Rocca 's house on January 9 , 1980 , the government relies primarily upon our opinions in the related cases of Lord v.

{"text": "The Muslim Brotherhood was founded in Egypt in 1928 as a Sunni Islamist religious , political and social movement .Founder Hassan al - Banna 's fundamental goal was Islam 's global domination .That effort quickly turned violent .As its influence grew , its tentacles spread to 80 other nations , laying the groundwork for an envisioned global caliphate .An early influential Brotherhood member , Sayyid Qutb , wrote of the need to cleanse the world of Western influence by imposing sharia .Years later , his work became Osama bin Laden 's and Ayman al - Zawahri 's \" bible .\" But , feeling the Brotherhood was not moving fast enough to achieve global Islam , they created an offshoot group - al - Qaeda - to quicken the pace .At various times , as the Brotherhood gained influence causing domestic instability , nations cracked down on it .To survive , it renounced violence - birthing numerous splinter groups to do its violent bidding .In 1981 , one such group assassinated a Middle East peace apostle - Egyptian President Anwar Sadat - for his peace treaty with Israel .Hamas was another terrorist splinter group .Viewing America as an obstacle to Islam 's global dominance , the Brotherhood - to this day - seeks to destroy America , informing followers to be \" patient \" as it so plots to do so .In the 1990s , Brotherhood leaders mapped out a secret war plan to accomplish this - one discovered completely by accident in 2004 .Despite this discovery and our knowledge about what is in the plan ( such as using Muslim Brotherhood front companies within the U.S. and making claims of Islamophobia whenever Islam is criticized ) , the Brotherhood openly continues implementing that plan today .Meanwhile , under Obama 's tutelage , the federal agencies responsible for protecting us from such a threat fail to do so .Just like Osama bin Laden 's 1997 declaration of war against America received little media attention , so too did the Brotherhood 's 2010 war declaration against America by its Supreme Guide , Muhammad Badi .Badi called for jihad against \" the Muslim 's real enemies , not only Israel but also the United States .Waging jihad against both of these infidels is a commandment of Allah that can not be disregarded .\" The Brotherhood 's long running anti - American platform properly inhibited U.S. recognition of the group .But , incredibly , under the Obama / Clinton team , that changed overnight .The skeleton in Hillary 's closet now in need of close scrutiny is how the Muslim Brotherhood instantly converted - in the Administration 's eyes but not those of the Brotherhood itself - from foe to friend .Of note in all this is that the family of Hillary 's now longest serving assistant , Huma Abedin , has enjoyed an intensely close relationship with the Brotherhood for decades .Her father , Zyed Abedin , served as editor of an anti - Semitic journal funded by an Islamist ; her mother , Saleha Mahmood Abedin , replaced him as editor in 1993 when he died .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.71593"}
