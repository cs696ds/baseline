{"text": "I 'm not sure if I completely follow you , Rades : you 're saying a person getting upset by a player 's use of the word \" rape \" in PVP is doing more to trivialize the horror of sexual assault than the person who uses the word ?I could not disagree more .There are two very good reasons why we should n't use \" rape \" in that context .The first and foremost is not that it 's \" offensive \" but that it is potentially triggering .Triggering means that the use of the word can evoke emotional , psychological , and even physical reactions , causing a survivor of sexual assault to relive the trauma .Not all victims have PTSD but a lot of them are triggered by certain things - sometimes it 's benign like a certain aftershave , sometimes it 's more direct , like hearing a guy bragging about raping a paladin in AV .My objections to the word are n't because they offend my delicate sensibilities : I think it 's safe to say that most WoW players have been on the internet and have read some pretty abhorrent things .We can tune out a lot of it .But \" rape \" is a word that can evoke emotions like fear and anger , and that 's much , much worse than the rest of the crap we find online .The second reason is that using the word rape in such a manner contributes to our rape culture .Our society reinforces the idea that sexual violence against women is normal .We should be having seminars where we talk to men and women and tell them about enthusiastic consent , but instead we just teach women to be afraid and let the men do what they want .The use of the word rape so casually plays into this culture : it 's okay to joke about something that affects as many as 1 in 4 women .I do believe people can joke about taboo subjects .However , I believe that those jokes need to be done with awareness , in safe spaces , and handled in such a way that it 's clear you 're being satirical in your commentary .That is absolutely not the case with the word \" rape \" in gaming culture .And every time this gets brought up , someone trots out the dictionary definition and points out that it also means plunder , but that 's just bullshit .Words have meanings , and the primary meaning for \" rape \" is to have sex with someone against their will .The people who object to this term know damn well that the speaker does n't mean rape in that sense , but intent is n't magical .You can still be saying things that are offensive and insulting without intending to do it .Basically , it comes down to this : you ( general you , not just you , Rades ) have the right to choose what you want to say .But if you choose to use the word \" rape \" in that fashion , you 're choosing a path that is potentially triggering and emotionally damaging to your listeners .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.80391"}
