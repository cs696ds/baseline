{"text": "I thought Biden did a good job being an attack dog and clearly is most comfortable discussing foreign policy .But Ryan was surprisingly adept at foreign policy and has a better grasp of the economic numbers than Biden .Ryan does a much better job of monitoring his facial expressions than Biden .The Vice President has a tendency to smirk and laugh at inappropriate times which might turnoff some voters .I did find it surprising that in the monitoring of undecided voter reactions used by CNN , Ryan consistently did better with women than men , much more so than Biden .I guess those women did n't know that Ryan is involved on the so - called \" War on Women .\"Or perhaps , outside of hard - core Democrats , women do n't buy that nonsense .Of course , in the end last night 's debate wo n't amount to a hill of beans .This morning , the Indianapolis Star published an editorial entitled \" CIB ca n't afford this big hit . \"In arguing against the proposal , the Star editorial opined : . \" As CIB President Ann Lathrop noted Tuesday , the agency has built up reserves in part because it has large loans that will come due in the next few years .That starts in 2017 with $ 33.7 million that the city owes to private investors that helped initially with funding for Circle Centre mall and later Bankers Life Fieldhouse .... \" .What the Star 's editors failed to disclose to its readers is that the owner of the Indianapolis Star , Gannet Co. , Inc. , is one of those private investors .On September 13 , 1994 , Central Newspapers , Inc. approved investing $ 2.3 million into the Circle Centre Mall , which debt has been rolled into the debt on the Bankers Life Fieldhouse .In 2000 , Gannett bought Central Newspapers .Thus , Gannett is now one of those investors it was saying in the editorial needs to be paid back , even if it means higher property taxes for Indianapolis residents .Under even the most forgiving standards of judicial ethics , the Indianapolis Star 's editors at the very least had a duty to disclose in the editorial Gannett 's ownership interest .This breach of judicial ethics by the Star points to another one .A newspaper should never become an investor in a major city project that will be the subject of numerous stories in the newspaper .Disclosure alone is n't enough to avoid the inevitable conflicts of interest that arise when a newspaper abandons its role of unbiased observer to become a player in local politics .Jeff Taylor , Editor and Vice President of the Indianapolis Star , owes the newspaper 's readers an apology for its breach of judicial ethics .On October 11 , 2011 , almost three months before the first Republican primary , Romney led 45.9 % to 45.3 % in a head - to - head matchup with President Obama in the Real Clear Politics Average of Polls .That was the last lead Romney enjoyed until today .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.585915"}

{"text": "Neither side much believes in the inexact science of polling when the polls do n't come down in their favor .I , on the other hand , believe strongly in the science of polls .Most of these pollsters take their craft seriously .While a flawed methodology might affect the result of the poll , generally you 're only talking a few points .Each pollster has to make adjustments to adapt to changing circumstances .For example , the fact is many people no longer have land lines with a published name and address that can be cross - referenced against voter registration lists .When you 're making those land line calls , you have to call people who are specifically on the list in order to get a representative sample of the electorate .If a husband;s name is on the list , you ca n't instead talk to his wife who answers the phone .However , when pollsters start calling cell phones they are dialing into the dark .In the last two days , four polls have been released showing Obama with leads of 3 , 3 , 4 and 2 points .The most recent poll released late yesterday was CNN 's which showed President Obama ahead of Romney 50 - 47 % .Looking at the cross tabs on the poll , 756 interviews were conducted of people with landlines and 257 interviews were with cell phone users .The CNN poll interviewed 305 people who identify themselves as Democrats and 107 who call themselves as independents who lean Democratic , for 412 Registered Democrats in total .People who identified themselves as Republicans in the poll was 270 with 143 identifying themselves as independents who lean Republican , for a total of 413 Registered Republicans .Apparently the rest are independent voters who refuse to identify with either party .What head - to - head poll results do n't do , however , is capture enthusiasm which drives turnout to the polls .You get elections where the polls are close , but once side wins by a landslide because of the enthusiasm factor .The presidential election of 1980 is the classic example .The polls were very close , but Republicans were enthusiastic about Ronald Reagan while the Democrats were not thrilled about another four years of President Carter .Republican voters flocked to the polls while Democratic voters stayed home .Reagan won an enormous landslide win that year that was not at all reflected in the polls .I sensed that enthusiasm for the Romney had been waning .The CNN cross tabs showed that .When asked about how enthusiastic they were about voting in the presidential election , here are the results : .Registered Democrats v. Republicans ( first number is Democrats )Extremely enthusiastic : 39 - 38 Very enthusiastic : 25 - 27 Somewhat enthusiastic : 21 - 17 Not too enthusiastic : 8 - 11 Not at all enthusiastic : 7 - 7 .The CNN poll shows that Obama has more than closed the enthusiasm gap .Romney needs to get Republicans and Republican - leaning independents re - excited about his candidacy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.53693"}

{"text": "INDIANAPOLIS - With Republican Dan Coats entering the race to challenge Democrat Evan Bayh for his U.S. Senate seat from Indiana , the GOP smells an upset while the opposition looks to discredit the former senator .Coats jumped into the fray recently after U.S. Rep. Mike Pence , R - Ind . , decided not to challenge Bayh .Other Republican candidates for the nomination to run against Bayh include former U.S. Rep. John Hostettler and state Sen. Marlin Stutzman .But Coats ' candidacy clearly scares Democrats , who have been trying to portray him as a carpetbagging lobbyist from Washington , D.C. , because he was ambassador to Germany from 2001 to 2004 and has represented companies as a lobbyist in the nation 's capital since then .At the top of the Republican ticket , Coats could remove what has historically been a big plus for Indiana Democrats whenever Bayh has run for office .He is the most popular Democrat in the state 's history , with two terms as governor and two terms as a U.S. senator .His more liberal father , Birch Bayh , also was a U.S. senator from the state for three terms .We see you 've been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website .Ready to get unlimited access to all of WORLD 's member content ?Get your risk - free , 30-Day FREE Trial Membership right now .( Do n't worry .It only takes a sec - and you do n't have to give us payment information right now . )This year Evan Bayh is more vulnerable than usual because of voter reaction against the Obama administration and its policies .He also is no longer the young and fresh face of the late 1980s , as he has run for president and been on the short list for a vice presidential nomination .Yet Bayh has never developed a political identity much beyond a passion for the middle of left - right political debates .He also has not faced a strong political challenge in Indiana since he won his 1988 race for governor against then - Lt .Gov. John Mutz .Coats will at least give Bayh some real competition , similar to what Pence would have brought to the race .Coats represented the Fort Wayne , Ind. , area in Congress during the 1980s , and was named to the U.S. Senate seat of Dan Quayle when he became vice president in 1989 .In Congress , Coats came up with positive conservative alternatives to big government efforts to end poverty , and his thinking contributed to the compassionate conservative ideas that eventually landed the presidency for George W. Bush .In their personalities , Coats and Bayh share a modesty and reserve that seem to fit the profile of what Indiana voters like .Flashy , charismatic types like Bill Clinton or Sarah Palin need not apply .Rep. Mark Souder , a Republican representing Indiana 's 3rd Congressional District , thinks Coats will have to show some fire in the belly to mount a good challenge against Bayh . \" What Dan has to prove is he wants it , \" Souder said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.81812"}

{"text": "In interviews afterward , President Obama himself placed the blame on what happened in Benghazi on the YouTube video , not on terrorism .It 's hard to believe Candy Crowley would not have understood this .Instead of being honest about the statement , she decided to misrepresent the facts during the debate .Following the first debate , Mitt Romney surged in the polls for the first time in nearly a year passing President Barack Obama in the Real Clear Politics Average of Polls ( RCPAP ) .His lead reached its apex at 1.5 % .Now , with the next debate a little over 24 hours away , the Romney RCPAP lead is down to .2 % .( Update : the race is now listed as a tie in the RCPAP ) .I 've been tracking state polls as well .While Romney made clear gains in most of the battleground states , Ohio post - debate remained stubbornly in the Obama camp in most polls .Losing Ohio would make the math for a Republican win quite challenging , but not impossible .My belief is still that Romney is going to sweep the Atlantic coast battleground states , including Virginia , North Carolina and Florida .I more and more think Colorado will go to Romney .I assume New Hampshire goes in the Obama column , though Romney has an outside chance there .Two states where Romney has trailed , barely , in most polls are Nevada and Iowa .I think he has a real shot at winning both of them .If those states are won by Romney and the Republican loses Ohio , you have a 269 - 269 tie in the Electoral College .I had time tonight to watch and make detailed notes of the gubernatorial debate involving Republican Mike Pence , Democrat John Gregg and Libertarian Rupert Boneham .Disclaimer upfront is that I am a supporter of Pence .Our paths crossed at Hanover College and again at Indiana University School of Law at Indianapolis , where I followed Pence as an unabashed advocate of conservative views , something not always popular in a student body filled with liberals .With that disclaimer out there , here is my scoring of the debate .DEBATE FORMAT : Political candidates are often faulted for speaking in sound bites instead of providing details detailed answers during debates .But the problem is the rules .The rules of this debate called for one minute opening statements , one minute answers to questions , 30 second rebuttals , and a 90 second closing statement .Candidates , facing those ridiculously short time restrictions , are placed in a position where they can give little more than soundbites .ROUND ONE ( OPENING STATEMENTS ) : .All the candidates talked about their background .In addition to the biography , Gregg emphasized jobs , education , bipartisanship , Gregg talked about his mentoring program and empowerment , Pence talked about the importance of economic growth and plugged his road map .The candidates did n't get much time to do anything in the 60 second introduction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.647"}

{"text": "But then again , he has n't really been challenged .I ca n't finish though without mentioning the fine campaign Rupert ran .He showed himself to be a person of energy and worthwhile ideas .Hopefully a Governor Pence will make room in his administration for his ideas on criminal justice reform .During the debates , Pence showed some interest in addressing this issue raised so knowledgeably by Rupert during the campaign .In examining polls , it is best to compare apples to apples .A NPR poll released today , showing Romney with a 48 - 47 lead , provides just that opportunity .NPR did a poll just a month ago which had President Obama ahead of Romney 51 - 44 .That 's an eight point swing in just a month .Meanwhile it looks like there may be a new state entering the outer orbit of battleground states .A poll by the Oregonian released on Sunday showed President Obama 's lead in Oregon narrowing to six points .This follows a poll by Hoffman Research last week showing Obama 's lead in Oregon down to five points .In both polls , President Obama is polling at 47 % , which is below the all important 50 % threshold .In Oregon , the polls show undecided voters in the double digits , a far higher percentof such voters than is found in battleground states .Once again , the Indianapolis Star fails its readers .Once again , the Indianapolis Star fails in its role as watchdog .One again , the Star demonstrates why it - deservedly - is losing readers .In a city that 's long had safe -- or , to be blunt , boring -- architecture , the proposed design of a $ 43 million development on Mass Ave . is indeed startling .But in a good way . ...Such projects are important for the city 's future for multiple reasons , including a stronger tax base , higher - population density in core neighborhoods and a more vibrant urban feel that 's attractive to highly sought - after young professionals .So , yes , the city is taking a small risk with a flashier - than - ordinary design on Mass Ave . , and even bigger risks by backing other developments .But playing it safe , with design or development in general , wo n't move Indy forward .What the Star fails to even mention in its editorial is that the project involves the City simply giving away public property worth millions of dollars .This is a paragraph from a previous Star story , I reported on : .The city is selling the property to developers , officials said , for $ 5.4 million .Those funds will be placed in escrow , according to a release , and can be accessed by the developer to help fund construction on the site .That 's not a \" sale .\" It 's a giveaway of public property worth millions of dollars .Of course though , the Star 's editors can never bring themselves to criticize the giveaway of the public 's money to private developers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.86325"}
