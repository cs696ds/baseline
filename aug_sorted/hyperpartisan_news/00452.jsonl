{"text": "The Gowdy selection was read by some as a blow to House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa , R - Calif . , and his probe into the 2012 attacks , which resulted in the deaths of four Americans including Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens .In fact , some sources on Capitol Hill argue that one of the reasons a select committee has been commissioned is to specifically sideline Issa .Issa 's staff and the staff of the House Armed Services Committee got into a public dispute last week about the credibility of a Benghazi witness at an oversight committee hearing .Issa , though , praised the selection on Monday , saying Boehner \" could not have chosen a Member more committed to getting the full truth about the before , during , and after of the Benghazi terrorist attacks than Congressman Trey Gowdy .\" It has been suggested that Democrats might try to boycott this investigation , putting all their chips behind their new coordinated strategy to portray Benghazi as a conspiracy - nut obsession and political witch hunt : .That would be a serious mistake on the Democrats ' part .This story has blown far beyond their ability to dismiss it out of hand .No serious segment of the American public , beyond die - hard Democrat partisans , is interested in their opinion about whether it 's a \" real story \" or not .There is mounting anger about the Benghazi lies , which will only be stoked by Democrats pulling some spoiled - child routine and sitting in the corner with their fingers in their ears .Whatever might come next , it seems pretty clear that most of the American public is no longer in a mood to be patronized over this issue , or listen to Democrats shriek about partisanship while they 're playing partisan games .From a purely strategic standpoint , it could only be a winning play for Democrats to blow off the renewed Benghazi probe if they were absolutely certain nothing newsworthy would emerge from them .They probably ca n't count on their media pals to ignore anything significant ; a few members of the Non - Fox Media seem exasperated with the White House runaround .Before he was announced as head of the select committee , Rep. Gowdy told Fox 's Greta van Susteren that he has \" evidence that there was a systematic , intentional decision to withhold certain documents from Congress .\" That 's not going to be something the media can bury on Page A-26 .Unless they 're absolutely certain he 's bluffing , the Democrats really want to have some people at the table when Gowdy plays those cards .The other big political problem for Democrats is that Gowdy 's hearings will occur in the context of President Obama 's rising unpopularity , and a growing sense that the Beltway - media access has been yanking their chains about a number of important issues .That 's also the problem with trying to spin away the unpopularity of ObamaCare by telling Americans its problems are just figments of their imagination .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.64852"}
