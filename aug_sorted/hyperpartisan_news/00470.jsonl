{"text": "Below we 'll take a look at the standout stress stats for each city and wrap the whole thing up with a detailed ranking of the top 50 most stressed out cities .Our nation 's capital is home to countless politicians and their staff who , all jokes and jeers aside , actually do have pretty stressful jobs when you really think about it .However , the city is also home to countless normal people just going about their normal - profile lives , working at normal jobs , and , as it turns out , being exposed to supernormal levels of stress .For all the cracks about politicians never really working , it turns out that the more than 601,000 people who call D.C. home are putting in plenty of hours on the job .The city came in third for this category , with residents working an average of 40.1 hours a week .That 's not even the top - end , but the average .Commute time was another big factor in D.C. 's placement at the top of this ranking .At 33 minutes on average , it was ranked ninth overall .As for the rest of the stats , they spanned from 35th to 11th , but were all consistently high enough for the city 's average score to put it on top as America 's stress capital .The Big Apple 's more than eight million residents could probably stand to eat an apple right now , seeing as how they 'll need those vitamins to counteract all the stress they 're under .In fact , New York ranked first in three criteria that did n't come as any surprise : commute time , population density , and the percentage of income spent on rent .Anyone who 's ever commuted in NYC can tell you it 's rough , but we can put a number on it .The average commute time there is 44 minutes , and that 's taking to account the millions of people who make the trip to and from work each day .Speaking of people , this city has more than just a lot of them - it has 27,092 per square mile .Finally , NYC lived up to all the ribbing it gets for being an expensive place to live .Its residents spend an average of 38 percent of their annual household income on rent .Again , if you live there , we do n't have to tell you how bad it is , but for everyone else : it 's really bad .Normally when we think about Miami , we picture a laid - back place filled with beaches and people relaxing on said beaches with drinks in - hand .As it turns out , there 's not a whole lot of relaxing going on here for the non - vacationers .The biggest contributor to stress here is what we were just talking about with regard to NYC : affording a place to live .Miami residents put an average of 37 percent of their yearly household income towards rent , so just slightly less than NYC , placing this city at third overall for that criterion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.285896"}

{"text": "One key advantage for these areas is housing prices .Even after the real estate bust , according to the National Association of Homebuilders , barely one - third of median - income households in Los Angeles can afford to own a median - priced home ; in New York only one - fourth can .In the four American cities on our list , between two - thirds and four - fifths of the median - income households can afford the American Dream .Advocates of dense megacities often point out that many poorer places , including old Rust Belt cities , enjoy high levels of affordability , while more prosperous regions , such as New York , do not .But lack of affordability itself is a problem ; areas with the lowest affordability , including New York , also have suffered from high rates of domestic outmigration .The true success formula for a dynamic region mixes affordability with a growing economy .Our future cities also are often easier for workers and entrepreneurs alike .Despite the presence of the nation 's best - developed mass transit systems , the longest commutes can be found in the New York area ; the worst are for people living in the boroughs of Queens and Staten Island .As a general rule , commuting times tend to be longer than average in some other biggest cities , including Chicago and Washington .In contrast , the average commutes in places like Raleigh or San Antonio are as little as 22 minutes on average -- roughly one - third of the biggest - city commutes .Figure over a year , and moving to these smaller cities can add 120 hours or more a year for the average commuter to do productive work or spend time with the family .Similar dynamics -- convenience , less congestion , rapid job growth and affordability -- also are at work in Canada , where two cities , Ottawa ( which stretches from Ontario into Quebec ) and Calgary , stand out with the best prospects .Many Canadians , particularly from Vancouver , would dispute this assertion .But Vancouver , the beloved poster child of urban planners , also suffers extraordinarily high housing prices -- by some measurements the highest in the English - speaking world .This can be traced in part to the presence of buyers from other parts of Canada and abroad , particularly from East Asia , but also to land - use controls that keep suburban properties off the market .Calgary , located on the Canadian plains , not much more than an hour from the Rockies , retains plenty of room to grow , and its housing price - to - income ratio is roughly half that of Vancouver 's .Calgary is also the center of the country 's powerful energy industry , which seems likely to expand during the next few decades , and its future is largely assured by soaring demand from China and other developing countries .The other Canadian candidate , the capital city of Ottawa and its surrounding region , has developed a strong high - tech sector to go along with steady government employment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.259697"}
