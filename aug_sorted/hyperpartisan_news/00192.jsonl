Monckton , pictured above ) who have been brought in to testify as climate experts by right - wing politicians and who speak on climate science regularly , have no scientific credentials at all .NOT \" disproving \" mainstream climate science : First , science is not mathematics and can not be either \" proved \" or \" disproved \" .Second , the arguments made by those few contrarians with appropriate credentials do not actually attempt to attack the main fundamentals of climate science .What they do is to argue about the details - notably how much global warming can be expected and how much global warming is attributable to humans .The \" contrarian \" label is applicable since they search for arguments minimizing the amount of future global warming / climate change and/or minimizing the amount of past global warming / climate change attributable to humans .These contrarian arguments have been singularly unsuccessful , e.g. containing major flaws or unsupported claims or being in contradiction with data .The contrarian arguments have not been widely accepted by most other climate scientists with appropriate credentials .Essentially the contrarian arguments constitute \" fringe science \" , discussed above .Bottom Line : Any field of science has its mavericks arguing against the prevailing scientific paradigms .The scientific process and data weed out the arguments .The real problem here is not the contrarian arguments per se .The problem is that right - wing media and politicians use contrarian arguments as weapons to argue against acting responsibly for risk management of climate change .We have seen the tactics of climate contrarians before with cigarette propaganda tactics , as noted HERE : \" An identical strategy succeeded in delaying government action against tobacco companies for years despite overwhelming evidence of the hazards of cigarettes \" .HERE is a University of California paper using the words of the tobacco industry , including this on page 9 : \" A demand for scientific proof is always a formula for inaction and delay \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.258636"}

{"text": "The same , inevitably , will true of climate control .Eric , nice to see someone else pick up on the Kuhn model of scientific endeavors .While many a scientist may be working on research that he has a firm belief in , I think that Kuhn fairly well lays out that concensus is a very necessary component for any type of scientific establishment to form .Obviously , the science is different ( ID is not testable in any way ) .The report you 're referring to might ( you 're description is a little to vague for me to be sure ) be the ipcc climate report , in particular its section for policy makers : ipcc policy report .and your claim that global warming may actually create new arable land has some support behind it : article on greenland .however , considering many of the areas that would be under the sea under many global warming areas are highly developed and populated areas , its unlikely that the increase in arable land would offset any of the negative effects of global warming .the potential costs of combatting hypothetical global warming may still be too great however .fishbane : I do n't know if you 're being naieve or witty , but your question \" Who has done a C / B on the destroyed coastal cities , homes , businesses , and shipping lanes and compared that to the benefit of industry heating our environment ? \" is ridiculous .The C / B analysis is not the costs and benefits of global warming itself but any solution to global warming .It 's entirely possible that the ( probable ) costs of fixing global warming could outweigh the ( probable ) benefits of the solution .This is likely the case if there is no solution with even a moderate chance of success ( i.e. we 're already doomed , so spend it if you got it ) .Also , it may just be cheaper to build cities on moutains and floating cities than to stop polluting .WHO knows .No one has seriously talked about any response other than reducing emissions .Obviously , the science is different ( ID is not testable in any way ) .It 's still not appropriate .The scientific burden is always on the claimant of a theory .Thus it is the the theory of global warming which has to be verfied to such a substantial degree that it is accepted without any serious questions about its verity .In fact the only way to scientifically test theories is to put them under the stress of applying the theory under numerous novel and unusual circumstances .If this was n't the case classical mechanics would still be the uncontested king .As for minor quibbles , I can ensure you that many of the objections to particular theories of global warming ( there is n't a concrete one endorsed by say a majority of scientists ) are very substantial .Remember that climate data records do n't exist that far into the past and much of the science done in the area is done by modelling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.567825"}

Alley , Chair Committee on Abrupt Climate Change , National Research Council .How much the planet will warm in the next century , and what kind of impacts will result , depends on how high CO 2 concentrations rise .In turn , this depends largely on human choices about fossil fuel consumption .Because fossil fuel accounts for 80 percent of global energy use , CO 2 levels will continue to rise for at least the next 30 or 40 years , so additional impacts are certain to be felt .This means that it is essential both to mitigate global climate change by reducing CO 2 emissions and to adapt to the changes that have already been set in motion .( For more on options for mitigating and adapting to climate change , see Unit 13 , \" Looking Forward : Our Global Experiment . \" ) Coralline Algae and the Case for Natural Climate Change .Guest post by Jim Steele Director Sierra Nevada Field Campus , emeritus , San Francisco State University .There was a very revealing 2012 paper demonstrating the power and interconnections of natural ocean oscillations , \" Marine proxy evidence linking decadal North Pacific and Atlantic Climate \" .If you have ever played in the tide pools , you may have noticed the coralline algae : a pinkish\u2011red algae with holdfasts that encrust the rocks , as shown in the picture .Just as tropical coral allow scientists to reconstruct tropical ocean temperatures , a chemical analysis of the thick crusts of some coralline algae provides a record of temperatures in sub\u2011arctic oceans .A quick review of the PDO illustrates the value of this new re\u2011construction .From a biological point of view the PDO is a \" regime shift \" that totally alters currents , winds and marine life approximately every 20 years .Salmon abundance alternates between Oregon and Alaska , abundant sardines alternate with abundant anchovies , and a host of other related changes that would require a book to properly address(see Chavez 2003 , 2011 ) .The PDO is driven in part by El Nino cycles and internal climate feedbacks .In the PDO 's warm phase , ocean temperatures in the Pacific resemble an El Nino year with warmer temperatures in the eastern Pacific and cooler temperatures to the north and west .In the cool phase , the PDO resembles a La Nina .Not only does the PDO 's regime shift totally reorganize marine ecosystems , the changing currents redistribute the ocean 's heat .Because the upper 10 feet of the ocean contains more heat than the entire atmosphere , the PDO , like an EL Nino , can dramatically alter the climate .As the PDO entered its warm phase beginning in the early 1900 's to the late 1940 's , global temperatures rose .The unadjusted maximum temperatures for the overwhelming majority of USHCN weather stations show a corresponding 1940 's warm peak that has yet to be surpassed .During that time the Arctic Ocean warmed similar to today(see Bengstonn , 2004 ) , and ice cores on the Antarctic peninsula show a similar 1940 's warm peak that remains the warmest for the 20 th century(see Schneider 2008 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.55451"}

{"text": "As noted above , climate models have been used by the IPCC to anticipate a warming of 1.4 \u00b0 C to 5.8 \u00b0 C between 1990 and 2100 [ 43 ] .They have also been used to help investigate the causes of recent climate change by comparing the observed changes to those that the models predict from various natural and human derived forcing factors .The most recent climate models can produce a good match to observations of global temperature changes over the last century .These models do not unambiguously attribute the warming that occurred from approximately 1910 to 1945 to either natural variation or human effects ; however , they suggest that the warming since 1975 is dominated by man - made greenhouse gas emissions .Another suggested mechanism whereby a warming trend may be amplified involves the thawing of tundra , which can release the potent greenhouse gas , methane , that is trapped in large quantities in permafrost and ice clathrate compounds [ 45 ] .Uncertainties in the representation of clouds are a dominant source of uncertainty in existing models , despite clear progress in modeling of clouds [ 46 ] .There is also an ongoing discussion as to whether climate models are neglecting important indirect and feedback effects of solar variability .Further , all such models are limited by available computational power , so that they may overlook changes related to small scale processes and weather ( e.g. storm systems , hurricanes ) .However , despite these and other limitations , the IPCC considered climate models \" to be suitable tools to provide useful projections of future climates \" [ 47 ] .In December , 2005 Bellouin et al suggested in Nature that the reflectivity effect of airborne pollutants was about double that previously expected , and that therefore some global warming was being masked .If supported by further studies , this would imply that existing models underpredict future global warming .[ 48 ] .Other related issues .Relationship to ozone depletion .Although they are often interlinked in the mass media , the connection between global warming and ozone depletion is not strong .There are four areas of linkage : .Global warming from carbon dioxide radiative forcing is expected ( perhaps somewhat surprisingly ) to cool the stratosphere .This , in turn , would lead to a relative increase in ozone depletion and the frequency of ozone holes .Conversely , ozone depletion represents a radiative forcing of the climate system .There are two opposed effects : reduced ozone allows more solar radiation to penetrate , thus warming the troposphere .But a colder stratosphere emits less long - wave radiation , tending to cool the troposphere .One of the strongest predictions of the greenhouse effect theory is that the stratosphere will cool .However , although this is observed , it is difficult to use it as an attribution of recent climate change .One of the difficulties of this conclusion includes the fact that warming induced by increased solar radiation would not have this upper cooling effect .However , similar cooling is caused by ozone depletion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.81559"}

{"text": "The significance of sea ice loss in the Arctic relates to a serious tipping point in the Arctic marine ecosystem which is given by the temperature at which water changes state from solid to liquid .Ice responds suddenly to changes at this temperature .This causes warming and loss of sea ice to amplify the potential changes to the climate including a reduction in albedo with the declining sea ice .Crossing the tipping point sets in motion many changes that further increases temperature in the Arctic region on top of current global warming ( Duarte et al .2012 ) .The ice that encompasses the Arctic has slowly been dwindling ever since a catastrophic collapse in the Arctic region in 2007 .Since that point , close to two thirds of the ice has vanished compared to a decade earlier when the loss of sea ice was significantly smaller ( Anderson , 2009 ) .Scientists had previously predicted that the ice in the Arctic region would not be reduced to the point that it reached in 2007 until at least 2050 , and in 2012 it dropped to levels much lower than in 2007 ( Fig . 7 ) .It is now predicted that the Arctic summer ice could disappear entirely as early as 2013 .The vulnerable setting of the Arctic region has certainly made it easy for global warming to have significant influences on the natural climate processes .The white ice naturally reflects sunlight back into space , but with the melting of the ice and subsequent open , dark sea water , the reflectivity is reduced and therefore the heat is retained instead .The arctic seas warm up , melting more ice , and then even more is absorbed and melted by the increasing water temperature change .This creates a dangerous feedback loop that intensifies melting and overall temperatures .Observations and climate models are in agreement that through the 21st century , Arctic sea ice extent will continue to decline in response to fossil fuels being burnt and greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere .Through the influxes of heat being circulated , temperature for the terrestrial and aquatic systems continues to increase , delaying ice growth during winter and autumn only to increase the temperature on the region .One of the most worrisome scenarios of a positive feedback is the thawing of huge quantities of organic material locked in frozen soil beneath Arctic landscapes .Vast quantities of carbon and methane from once rotting vegetation are stored in the frozen soil .This frozen soil is called permafrost and it contains significantly more carbon than is currently in the atmosphere .Permafrost is defined as subsurface Earth materials remaining below 0 \u00b0 C for two consecutive years .It is thoroughly widespread in the Northern Hemisphere where permafrost regions occupy 22 % of the land surface ( Schuur et al .2008 ) .The temperature , thickness and geographic continuity of permafrost are controlled by the surface energy balance .Permafrost thickness geographically ranges from 1 meter to 1450 meters depending on where the permafrost is situated .The layer that thaws in the summer and refreezes in the winter is referred to as the active layer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.86731"}

A warmer climate might even end the drying out of North Africa , because it would increase the amount of rainfall .Finally , the idea that temperatures were never more ideal than they were in the 1960s suggests to me that some ex - hippies are unwilling to accept the end of their glory years .CO 2 is not a pollutant , but an essential plant food .You put a little more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , and it will make it easier for crops and rainforests to grow .Anything wrong with that ?The ice - core samples mentioned in # 13 above also preserve a record of carbon dioxide levels in ancient times .They show that the percentage of atmospheric CO 2 has gone up and down in the past , but the CO 2 increases happened as late as 800 years after temperature increases .Thus , one could argue that rising temperatures cause rising CO 2 levels , instead of the opposite .Global warming made headlines in 2007 when the United Nations got on the bandwagon , by issuing a 21-page report from a group called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .Like the environmentalists , this report predicted that disaster was about to happen , and that it would go on for centuries , no matter what we do .Well , all we have to do is remember the messenger .The UN is a corrupt , anti - American , anti - Semitic , anti - capitalist , dictator - loving organization .It never does a very good job of solving problems , whether it is preventing wars , or helping the victims of disasters like the 2004 tsunami .What is does best is provide job security for those who want to talk about such problems indefinitely .The infamous Kyoto Accords were designed specifically to cut down the economies of powerful capitalist countries , especially the United States , but they exempt two of the world 's biggest polluters , China and India .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.182625"}

{"text": "In each case the changes can be thought of in terms of \" radiative forcing . \" As defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , radiative forcing is a measure of the influence a given climatic factor has on the amount of downward - directed radiant energy impinging upon Earth 's surface .\" Positive forcing \" is exerted by climatic factors that contribute to the warming of Earth 's surface , whereas \" negative forcing \" is exerted by factors that cool Earth 's surface .On average about 342 watts of solar radiation strike each square metre of Earth 's surface per year , and this quantity can in turn be related to a rise or fall in Earth 's surface temperature .Temperatures at the surface may also rise or fall through a change in the distribution of terrestrial radiation ( that is , radiation emitted by Earth ) within the atmosphere .In some cases , radiative forcing has a natural origin , such as during explosive eruptions from volcanoes where vented gases and ash block some portion of solar radiation from the surface .In other cases , radiative forcing has an anthropogenic , or exclusively human , origin .For example , anthropogenic increases in carbon dioxide , methane , and nitrous oxide are estimated to account for 2.3 watts per square metre of positive radiative forcing .When all values of positive and negative radiative forcing are taken together and all interactions between climatic factors are accounted for , the total net increase in surface radiation due to human activities since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution is 1.6 watts per square metre .The influences of human activity on climate .Human activity has influenced global surface temperatures by changing the radiative balance governing the Earth on various timescales and at varying spatial scales .The most profound and well - known anthropogenic influence is the elevation of concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .Humans also influence climate by changing the concentrations of aerosols and ozone and by modifying the land cover of Earth 's surface .Greenhouse gases .As discussed above , greenhouse gases warm Earth 's surface by increasing the net downward longwave radiation reaching the surface .The relationship between atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases and the associated positive radiative forcing of the surface is different for each gas .A complicated relationship exists between the chemical properties of each greenhouse gas and the relative amount of longwave radiation that each can absorb .What follows is a discussion of the radiative behaviour of each major greenhouse gas .Water vapour .Water vapour is the most potent of the greenhouse gases in Earth 's atmosphere , but its behaviour is fundamentally different from that of the other greenhouse gases .The primary role of water vapour is not as a direct agent of radiative forcing but rather as a climate feedback - that is , as a response within the climate system that influences the system 's continued activity ( see below Water vapour feedback ) .This distinction arises from the fact that the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere can not , in general , be directly modified by human behaviour but is instead set by air temperatures .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.474106"}

{"text": "Land - use changes can also influence climate through their influence on the exchange of heat between Earth 's surface and the atmosphere .For example , vegetation helps to facilitate the evaporation of water into the atmosphere through evapotranspiration .In this process , plants take up liquid water from the soil through their root systems .Eventually this water is released through transpiration into the atmosphere , as water vapour through the stomata in leaves .While deforestation generally leads to surface cooling due to the albedo factor discussed above , the land surface may also be warmed as a result of the release of latent heat by the evapotranspiration process .The relative importance of these two factors , one exerting a cooling effect and the other a warming effect , varies by both season and region .While the albedo effect is likely to dominate in middle latitudes , especially during the period from autumn through spring , the evapotranspiration effect may dominate during the summer in the midlatitudes and year - round in the tropics .The latter case is particularly important in assessing the potential impacts of continued tropical deforestation .The rate at which tropical regions are deforested is also relevant to the process of carbon sequestration ( see Carbon cycle feedbacks ) , the long - term storage of carbon in underground cavities and biomass rather than in the atmosphere .By removing carbon from the atmosphere , carbon sequestration acts to mitigate global warming .Deforestation contributes to global warming as fewer plants are available to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .In addition , as fallen trees , shrubs , and other plants are burned or allowed to slowly decompose , they release as carbon dioxide the carbon they stored during their lifetimes .Furthermore , any land - use change that influences the amount , distribution , or type of vegetation in a region can affect the concentrations of biogenic aerosols ; however , the impact of such changes on climate is indirect and relatively minor .Stratospheric ozone depletion .Since the 1970s the loss of ozone ( O3 ) from the stratosphere has led to a small amount of negative radiative forcing of the surface .This negative forcing represents a competition between two distinct effects caused by the fact that ozone absorbs solar radiation .In the first case , as ozone levels in the stratosphere are depleted , more solar radiation reaches Earth 's surface .In the absence of any other influence , this rise in insolation would represent a positive radiative forcing of the surface .However , there is a second effect of ozone depletion that is related to its greenhouse properties .As the amount of ozone in the stratosphere is decreased , there is also less ozone to absorb longwave radiation emitted by Earth 's surface .With less absorption of radiation by ozone , there is a corresponding decrease in the downward re - emission of radiation .This second effect overwhelms the first and results in a modest negative radiative forcing of Earth 's surface and a modest cooling of the lower stratosphere by approximately 0.5 \u00b0 C ( 0.9 \u00b0 F ) per decade since the 1970s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.98282"}

{"text": "Thus far , neither process has been incorporated into the theoretical models used to predict sea - level rise .Ocean circulation changes .Another possible consequence of global warming is a decrease in the global ocean circulation system known as the \" thermohaline circulation \" or \" great ocean conveyor belt .\" This system involves the sinking of cold saline waters in the subpolar regions of the oceans , an action that helps to drive warmer surface waters poleward from the subtropics .As a result of this process , a warming influence is carried to Iceland and the coastal regions of Europe that moderates the climate in those regions .Some scientists believe that global warming could shut down this ocean current system by creating an influx of fresh water from melting ice sheets and glaciers into the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean .Since fresh water is less dense than saline water , a significant intrusion of fresh water would lower the density of the surface waters and thus inhibit the sinking motion that drives the large - scale thermohaline circulation .It has also been speculated that , as a consequence of large - scale surface warming , such changes could even trigger colder conditions in regions surrounding the North Atlantic .Experiments with modern climate models suggest that such an event would be unlikely .Instead , a moderate weakening of the thermohaline circulation might occur that would lead to a dampening of surface warming - rather than actual cooling - in the higher latitudes of the North Atlantic Ocean .Tropical cyclones .One of the more controversial topics in the science of climate change involves the impact of global warming on tropical cyclone activity .It appears likely that rising tropical ocean temperatures associated with global warming will lead to an increase in the intensity ( and the associated destructive potential ) of tropical cyclones .In the Atlantic a close relationship has been observed between rising ocean temperatures and a rise in the strength of hurricanes .Trends in the intensities of tropical cyclones in other regions , such as in the tropical Pacific and Indian oceans , are more uncertain due to a paucity of reliable long - term measurements .While the warming of oceans favours increased tropical cyclone intensities , it is unclear to what extent rising temperatures affect the number of tropical cyclones that occur each year .Other factors , such as wind shear , could play a role .If climate change increases the amount of wind shear - a factor that discourages the formation of tropical cyclones - in regions where such storms tend to form , it might partially mitigate the impact of warmer temperatures .On the other hand , changes in atmospheric winds are themselves uncertain - because of , for example , uncertainties in how climate change will affect ENSO .Environmental consequences of global warming .Global warming and climate change have the potential to alter biological systems .More specifically , changes to near - surface air temperatures will likely influence ecosystem functioning and thus the biodiversity of plants , animals , and other forms of life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.88639"}

{"text": "Orbital variations thus exerted a primary control on the extent of continental ice sheets .However , Earth 's orbital changes are generally believed to have had little impact on climate over the past few millennia , and so they are not considered to be significant factors in present - day climate variability .Feedback mechanisms and climate sensitivity .There are a number of feedback processes important to Earth 's climate system and , in particular , its response to external radiative forcing .The most fundamental of these feedback mechanisms involves the loss of longwave radiation to space from the surface .Since this radiative loss increases with increasing surface temperatures according to the Stefan - Boltzmann law , it represents a stabilizing factor ( that is , a negative feedback ) with respect to near - surface air temperature .Climate sensitivity can be defined as the amount of surface warming resulting from each additional watt per square metre of radiative forcing .Alternatively , it is sometimes defined as the warming that would result from a doubling of CO2 concentrations and the associated addition of 4 watts per square metre of radiative forcing .In the absence of any additional feedbacks , climate sensitivity would be approximately 0.25 \u00b0 C ( 0.45 \u00b0 F ) for each additional watt per square metre of radiative forcing .Water vapour feedback .Unlike concentrations of other greenhouse gases , the concentration of water vapour in the atmosphere can not freely vary .Instead , it is determined by the temperature of the lower atmosphere and surface through a physical relationship known as the Clausius - Clapeyron equation , named for 19th - century German physicist Rudolf Clausius and 19th - century French engineer \u00c9mile Clapeyron .Under the assumption that there is a liquid water surface in equilibrium with the atmosphere , this relationship indicates that an increase in the capacity of air to hold water vapour is a function of increasing temperature of that volume of air .This assumption is relatively good over the oceans , where water is plentiful , but not over the continents .For this reason the relative humidity ( the percent of water vapour the air contains relative to its capacity ) is approximately 100 percent over ocean regions and much lower over continental regions ( approaching 0 percent in arid regions ) .Not surprisingly , the average relative humidity of Earth 's lower atmosphere is similar to the fraction of Earth 's surface covered by the oceans ( that is , roughly 70 percent ) .This quantity is expected to remain approximately constant as Earth warms or cools .Slight changes to global relative humidity may result from human land - use modification , such as tropical deforestation and irrigation , which can affect the relative humidity over land areas up to regional scales .The amount of water vapour in the atmosphere will rise as the temperature of the atmosphere rises .Since water vapour is a very potent greenhouse gas , even more potent than CO2 , the net greenhouse effect actually becomes stronger as the surface warms , which leads to even greater warming .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.75807"}

{"text": "Relationship to global dimming .Some scientists now consider that the effects of the recently recognized phenomenon of global dimming ( the reduction in sunlight reaching the surface of the planet , possibly due to aerosols ) may have masked some of the effect of global warming .If this is so , the indirect aerosol effect is stronger than previously believed , which would imply that the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases is also stronger .Concerns about the effect of aerosol on the global climate were first researched as part of concerns over global cooling in the 1970s .Pre - human global warming .Rock weathering locks away carbon in calcite and dolomite , which are minerals with various degrees of carbon oxides .As a result of this , carbon dioxide levels dropped back to normal over roughly the next 150,000 years .The greenhouse effect has also been invoked to explain how the Earth made it out of the Snowball Earth period .During this period all silicate rocks were covered by ice , thereby preventing them from combining with atmospheric carbon dioxide .The atmospheric carbon dioxide level gradually increased until it reached about 350 times current levels .At this point temperatures were raised to an average of 50 \u00b0 C , hot enough to melt the ice .Increased amounts of rainfall would quickly wash the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere .Thick layers of abiotic carbonate sediment which can be found on top of the glacial rocks from this period are believed to have been formed by this rapid carbon dioxide removal process .Using paleoclimate data for the last 500 million years ( Veizer et al .2000 , Nature 408 , pp .698 - 701 ) concluded that long - term temperature variations are only weakly coupled to carbon dioxide variations .Shaviv and Veizer ( 2003 , [ 54 ] ) extended this by arguing that the biggest long - term influence on temperature is actually the solar system 's motion around the galaxy .Afterwards , they argued that over geologic time a change in carbon dioxide concentrations comparable to doubling preindustrial levels , only results in about 0.75 \u00b0 C warming rather than the usual 1.5 - 4.5 \u00b0 C reported by climate models [ 55 ] .In turn Veizer 's recent work has been discussed and criticised on RealClimate.org [ 56 ] .Palaeoclimatologist William Ruddiman has argued ( e.g. Scientific American , March 2005 ) that human influence on the global climate began around 8000 years ago with the development of agriculture .This prevented carbon dioxide ( and later methane ) levels falling as rapidly as they would have done otherwise .Ruddiman argues that without this effect , the Earth would be entering , or already have entered , a new ice age .References .Choi , O. and A.

{"text": "This process appears to be responsible for some of the increased aerosol pollution in regions undergoing rapid urbanization .Human activity has greatly increased the amount of aerosol in the atmosphere compared with the background levels of preindustrial times .In contrast to the global effects of greenhouse gases , the impact of anthropogenic aerosols is confined primarily to the Northern Hemisphere , where most of the world 's industrial activity occurs .The pattern of increases in anthropogenic aerosol over time is also somewhat different from that of greenhouse gases .During the middle of the 20th century , there was a substantial increase in aerosol emissions .This appears to have been at least partially responsible for a cessation of surface warming that took place in the Northern Hemisphere from the 1940s through the 1970s .Since that time , aerosol emissions have leveled off due to antipollution measures undertaken in the industrialized countries since the 1960s .Aerosol emissions may rise in the future , however , as a result of the rapid emergence of coal - fired electric power generation in China and India .The total radiative forcing of all anthropogenic aerosols is approximately -1.2 watts per square metre .Of this total , -0.5 watt per square metre comes from direct effects ( such as the reflection of solar energy back into space ) , and -0.7 watt per square metre comes from indirect effects ( such as the influence of aerosols on cloud formation ) .This negative radiative forcing represents an offset of roughly 40 percent from the positive radiative forcing caused by human activity .However , the relative uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing ( approximately 90 percent ) is much greater than that of greenhouse gases .In addition , future emissions of aerosols from human activities , and the influence of these emissions on future climate change , are not known with any certainty .Nevertheless , it can be said that , if concentrations of anthropogenic aerosols continue to decrease as they have since the 1970s , a significant offset to the effects of greenhouse gases will be reduced , opening future climate to further warming .Land - use change .There are a number of ways in which changes in land use can influence climate .The most direct influence is through the alteration of Earth 's albedo , or surface reflectance .For example , the replacement of forest by cropland and pasture in the middle latitudes over the past several centuries has led to an increase in albedo , which in turn has led to greater reflection of incoming solar radiation in those regions .This replacement of forest by agriculture has been associated with a change in global average radiative forcing of approximately -0.2 watt per square metre since 1750 .In Europe and other major agricultural regions , such land - use conversion began more than 1,000 years ago and has proceeded nearly to completion .For Europe , the negative radiative forcing due to land - use change has probably been substantial , perhaps approaching -5 watts per square metre .The influence of early land use on radiative forcing may help to explain a long period of cooling in Europe that followed a period of relatively mild conditions roughly 1,000 years ago .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.08188"}

{"text": "In the southwestern United States , alternations between drought and flooding related in part to the ENSO phenomenon have created conditions favourable for the spread of hantaviruses by rodents .The spread of mosquito - borne Rift Valley fever in equatorial East Africa has also been related to wet conditions in the region associated with ENSO .Severe weather conditions conducive to rodents or insects have been implicated in infectious disease outbreaks - for instance , the outbreaks of cholera and leptospirosis that occurred after Hurricane Mitch struck Central America in 1998 .Global warming could therefore affect the spread of infectious disease through its influence on ENSO or on severe weather conditions .Socioeconomic consequences of global warming .Socioeconomic impacts of global warming could be substantial depending on the actual temperature increases over the next century .Models predict that a net global warming of 1 to 3 \u00b0 C ( 1.8 to 5.4 \u00b0 F ) beyond the late-20th - century global average would produce economic losses in some regions ( particularly the tropics and high latitudes ) and economic benefits in others .For warming beyond these levels , benefits would tend to decline and costs increase .For warming in excess of 4 \u00b0 C ( 7.2 \u00b0 F ) , models predict that costs will exceed benefits on average , with global mean economic losses estimated between 1 and 5 percent of gross domestic product .Substantial disruptions could be expected under these conditions , specifically in the areas of agriculture , food and forest products , water and energy supply , and human health .Agricultural productivity might increase modestly in temperate regions for some crops in response to a local warming of 1 - 3 \u00b0 C ( 1.8 - 5.4 \u00b0 F ) , but productivity will generally decrease with further warming .For tropical and subtropical regions , models predict decreases in crop productivity for even small increases in local warming .In some cases , adaptations such as altered planting practices are projected to ameliorate losses in productivity for modest amounts of warming .An increased incidence of drought and flood events would likely lead to further decreases in agricultural productivity and to decreases in livestock production , particularly among subsistence farmers in tropical regions .In regions such as the African Sahel , decreases in agricultural productivity have already been observed as a result of shortened growing seasons , which in turn have occurred as a result of warmer and drier climatic conditions .In other regions , changes in agricultural practice , such as planting crops earlier in the growing season , have been undertaken .The warming of oceans is predicted to have an adverse impact on commercial fisheries by changing the distribution and productivity of various fish species , whereas commercial timber productivity may increase globally with modest warming .Water resources are likely to be affected substantially by global warming .This would be particularly severe during the summer season .In many cases water availability is already decreasing or expected to decrease in regions that have been stressed for water resources since the turn of the 21st century .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.75855"}

{"text": "As a result , increased evaporation leads to a greater concentration of water vapour in the lower atmosphere capable of absorbing longwave radiation and emitting it downward .Carbon dioxide .Of the greenhouse gases , carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) is most significant .Natural sources of atmospheric CO2 include outgassing from volcanoes , the combustion and natural decay of organic matter , and respiration by aerobic ( oxygen - using ) organisms .These sources are balanced , on average , by a set of physical , chemical , or biological processes , called \" sinks , \" that tend to remove CO2 from the atmosphere .Significant natural sinks include terrestrial vegetation , which takes up CO2 during the process of photosynthesis .A number of oceanic processes also act as carbon sinks .One such process , called the \" solubility pump , \" involves the descent of surface sea water containing dissolved CO2 .As these organisms expire and fall to the ocean floor , the carbon they contain is transported downward and eventually buried at depth .A long - term balance between these natural sources and sinks leads to the background , or natural , level of CO2 in the atmosphere .In contrast , human activities increase atmospheric CO2 levels primarily through the burning of fossil fuels ( principally oil and coal , and secondarily natural gas , for use in transportation , heating , and the generation of electrical power ) and through the production of cement .Other anthropogenic sources include the burning of forests and the clearing of land .Anthropogenic emissions currently account for the annual release of about 7 gigatons ( 7 billion tons ) of carbon into the atmosphere .Anthropogenic emissions are equal to approximately 3 percent of the total emissions of CO2 by natural sources , and this amplified carbon load from human activities far exceeds the offsetting capacity of natural sinks ( by perhaps as much as 2 - 3 gigatons per year ) .CO2 has consequently accumulated in the atmosphere at an average rate of 1.4 parts per million ( ppm ) by volume per year between 1959 and 2006 , and this rate of accumulation has been linear ( that is , uniform over time ) .However , certain current sinks , such as the oceans , could become sources in the future ( see Carbon cycle feedbacks ) .This may lead to a situation in which the concentration of atmospheric CO2 builds at an exponential rate .The natural background level of carbon dioxide varies on timescales of millions of years due to slow changes in outgassing through volcanic activity .For example , roughly 100 million years ago , during the Cretaceous Period ( 145.5 million to 65.5 million years ago ) , CO2 concentrations appear to have been several times higher than today ( perhaps close to 2,000 ppm ) .By the early 21st century , CO2 levels reached 384 ppm , which is approximately 37 percent above the natural background level of roughly 280 ppm that existed at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution .According to ice core measurements , this level ( 384 ppm ) is believed to be the highest in at least 650,000 years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.52753"}

{"text": "Climate is always changing .However , many of the observed changes noted above are beyond what can be explained by the natural variability of the climate .It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human - induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , chlorofluorocarbons , methane , and nitrous oxide .The most important of these over the long term is CO2 , whose concentration in the atmosphere is rising principally as a result of fossil - fuel combustion and deforestation .While large amounts of CO2 enter and leave the atmosphere through natural processes , these human activities are increasing the total amount in the air and the oceans .Approximately half of the CO2 put into the atmosphere through human activity in the past 250 years has been taken up by the ocean and terrestrial biosphere , with the other half remaining in the atmosphere .Since long - term measurements began in the 1950s , the atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increasing at a rate much faster than at any time in the last 800,000 years .Having been introduced into the atmosphere it will take a thousand years for the majority of the added atmospheric CO2 to be removed by natural processes , and some will remain for thousands of subsequent years .Water vapor also is an important atmospheric greenhouse gas .Unlike other greenhouse gases , however , the concentration of water vapor depends on atmospheric temperature and is controlled by the global climate system through its hydrological cycle of evaporation - condensation - precipitation .Water vapor is highly variable in space and time with a short lifetime , because of weather variability .Observations indicate an increase in globally averaged water vapor in the atmosphere in recent decades , at a rate consistent with the response produced by climate models that simulate human - induced increases in greenhouse gases .This increase in water vapor also strengthens the greenhouse effect , amplifying the impact of human - induced increases in other greenhouse gases .Human activity also affects climate through changes in the number and physical properties of tiny solid particles and liquid droplets in the atmosphere , known collectively as atmospheric aerosols .Examples of aerosols include dust , sea salt , and sulfates from air pollution .Aerosols have a variety of climate effects .They absorb and redirect solar energy from the sun and thermal energy emitted by Earth , emit energy themselves , and modify the ability of clouds to reflect sunlight and to produce precipitation .Aerosols can both strengthen and weaken greenhouse warming , depending on their characteristics .Most aerosols originating from human activity act to cool the planet and so partly counteract greenhouse gas warming effects .Aerosols lofted into the stratosphere [ between about 13 km ( 8 miles ) and 50 km ( 30 miles ) altitude above the surface ] by occasional large sulfur - rich volcanic eruptions can reduce global surface temperature for several years .By contrast , carbon soot from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels warms the planet , so that decreases in soot would reduce warming .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.853714"}

{"text": "Since the late 1980s , global emissions of SO2 have decreased from about 73 million tons to about 54 million tons of sulfur per year .Nitrate aerosol is not as important as sulfate aerosol , but it has the potential to become a significant source of negative forcing .One major source of nitrate aerosol is smog ( the combination of ozone with oxides of nitrogen in the lower atmosphere ) released from the incomplete burning of fuel in internal - combustion engines .Another source is ammonia ( NH3 ) , which is often used in fertilizers or released by the burning of plants and other organic materials .If greater amounts of atmospheric nitrogen are converted to ammonia and agricultural ammonia emissions continue to increase as projected , the influence of nitrate aerosols on radiative forcing is expected to grow .Both sulfate and nitrate aerosols act primarily by reflecting incoming solar radiation , thereby reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the surface .Most aerosols , unlike greenhouse gases , impart a cooling rather than warming influence on Earth 's surface .One prominent exception is carbonaceous aerosols such as carbon black or soot , which are produced by the burning of fossil fuels and biomass .Carbon black tends to absorb rather than reflect incident solar radiation , and so it has a warming impact on the lower atmosphere , where it resides .Because of its absorptive properties , carbon black is also capable of having an additional indirect effect on climate .Through its deposition in snowfall , it can decrease the albedo of snow cover .This reduction in the amount of solar radiation reflected back to space by snow surfaces creates a minor positive radiative forcing .Natural forms of aerosol include windblown mineral dust generated in arid and semiarid regions and sea salt produced by the action of waves breaking in the ocean .Changes to wind patterns as a result of climate modification could alter the emissions of these aerosols .The influence of climate change on regional patterns of aridity could shift both the sources and the destinations of dust clouds .In addition , since the concentration of sea salt aerosol , or sea aerosol , increases with the strength of the winds near the ocean surface , changes in wind speed due to global warming and climate change could influence the concentration of sea salt aerosol .For example , some studies suggest that climate change might lead to stronger winds over parts of the North Atlantic Ocean .Areas with stronger winds may experience an increase in the concentration of sea salt aerosol .Other natural sources of aerosols include volcanic eruptions , which produce sulfate aerosol , and biogenic sources ( e.g. , phytoplankton ) , which produce dimethyl sulfide ( DMS ) .Other important biogenic aerosols , such as terpenes , are produced naturally by certain kinds of trees or other plants .For example , the dense forests of the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia in the United States emit terpenes during the summer months , which in turn interact with the high humidity and warm temperatures to produce a natural photochemical smog .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.32968"}

{"text": "There are a number of natural factors that influence Earth 's climate .These factors include external influences such as explosive volcanic eruptions , natural variations in the output of the Sun , and slow changes in the configuration of Earth 's orbit relative to the Sun .In addition , there are natural oscillations in Earth 's climate that alter global patterns of wind circulation , precipitation , and surface temperatures .One such phenomenon is the El Ni\u00f1o / Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) , a coupled atmospheric and oceanic event that occurs in the Pacific Ocean every three to seven years .In addition , the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation ( AMO ) is a similar phenomenon that occurs over decades in the North Atlantic Ocean .Other types of oscillatory behaviour that produce dramatic shifts in climate may occur across timescales of centuries and millennia ( see climatic variation and change ) .Volcanic aerosols .Explosive volcanic eruptions have the potential to inject substantial amounts of sulfate aerosols into the lower stratosphere .In contrast to aerosol emissions in the lower troposphere ( see above Aerosols ) , aerosols that enter the stratosphere may remain for several years before settling out , because of the relative absence of turbulent motions there .Consequently , aerosols from explosive volcanic eruptions have the potential to affect Earth 's climate .Less explosive eruptions , or eruptions that are less vertical in orientation , have a lower potential for substantial climate impact .Furthermore , because of large - scale circulation patterns within the stratosphere , aerosols injected within tropical regions tend to spread out over the globe , whereas aerosols injected within midlatitude and polar regions tend to remain confined to the middle and high latitudes of that hemisphere .Tropical eruptions , therefore , tend to have a greater climatic impact than eruptions occurring toward the poles .In 1991 the moderate eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines provided a peak forcing of approximately -4 watts per square metre and cooled the climate by about 0.5 \u00b0 C ( 0.9 \u00b0 F ) over the following few years .By comparison , the 1815 Mount Tambora eruption in present - day Indonesia , typically implicated for the 1816 \" year without a summer \" in Europe and North America , is believed to have been associated with a radiative forcing of approximately -6 watts per square metre .While in the stratosphere , volcanic sulfate aerosol actually absorbs longwave radiation emitted by Earth 's surface , and absorption in the stratosphere tends to result in a cooling of the troposphere below .This vertical pattern of temperature change in the atmosphere influences the behaviour of winds in the lower atmosphere , primarily in winter .Thus , while there is essentially a global cooling effect for the first few years following an explosive volcanic eruption , changes in the winter patterns of surface winds may actually lead to warmer winters in some areas , such as Europe .Some modern examples of major eruptions include Krakatoa ( Indonesia ) in 1883 , El Chich\u00f3n ( Mexico ) in 1982 , and Mount Pinatubo in 1991 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "117.05142"}
{"text": "Responses become drivers .The PDO is a long - lived response to the El NIno cycles .Some scientists like Dr. Chavez like to call the PDO phases EL Viejo(old man ) and La Vieja(old woman ) because the ocean temperatures are long - lived versions of the short lived El Nino La Nina .They also refer to the warm PDO phase as the sardine regime versus the cold anchovy regime .Although El Nino drives the PDO , it is the PDO that drives many 20 year regime shifts in ocean ecosystems .PDO also creates a background climate that intensifies or weakens the global response to El NIno cycles .For example , La Nina events cause droughts in the American west , but the coincidence of both a La NIna and a negative PDO intensifies those droughts .Since 1700 , a La NIna coincided with the negative PDO only 29 % of the time .However in Rocky Mountain National Park , 79 % of the wild fires occurred when a La Nina a La Vieja coincided .The 2012 fires in Colorado were just another manifestation of that pattern .SImilarly depending on how those phases coincide , temperatures in Alaska are colder or warmer .Schoennagel , T. , ( 2005 ) ENSO and PDO Variability Affect Drought induced Fire Occurrence in Rocky Mounain Subalpine Forests .Ecological Applications , vol .15 , pp .2000 - 2014 .Now you can get all sad and weepy about that unalterable fact if you want , but all that shows is that you have n't looked at history .In any case , since you claim that more than 300 plants and animals are going extinct every year , I 'm sure that you could name say a dozen of the plants and animals you are talking about , so we could discuss whether your claim is correct .You probably should answer on the relevant thread , though , which would be my thread on extinction called \" Always Trust Your Gut Extinct \" . jim Steele says : January 28 , 2013 at 9:21 am \" Why does the data stop in 1967 ? \"The study was simply looking for proxies that faithfully captured extra - tropical marine temperatures .They used data from extensive studies of the algae that were conducted up to 1967 .And the vindication of the method would be to see if it would give the same result with data up to today [ realizing there may not be any]. ...What does it tell us about the integrity of CO2 theory when advocates claim CO2 drives both the warm phase and cold phase of natural oscillations ?Why are they trying to portray natural variations as a climate gone crazy ?It tells us one should never use the word \" integrity \" to describe advocates of CO2-driven global warming .They 're not to be trusted , believed , or called \" scientists \" .However , they do make great politicial activists .\" the upper 10 feet of the ocean contains more heat than the entire atmosphere \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.20882"}
{"text": "Variations in solar output .Direct measurements of solar irradiance , or solar output , have been available from satellites only since the late 1970s .These measurements show a very small peak - to - peak variation in solar irradiance ( roughly 0.1 percent of the 1,366 watts per square metre received at the top of the atmosphere , for approximately 0.12 watt per square metre ) .However , indirect measures of solar activity are available from historical sunspot measurements dating back through the early 17th century .Different assumptions regarding the relationship between the amplitudes of 11-year solar cycles and long - period solar output changes can lead to considerable differences in the resulting solar reconstructions .These differences in turn lead to fairly large uncertainty in estimating positive forcing by changes in solar irradiance since 1750 .( Estimates range from 0.06 to 0.3 watt per square metre . )Even more challenging , given the lack of any modern analog , is the estimation of solar irradiance during the so - called Maunder Minimum , a period lasting from the mid-17th century to the early 18th century when very few sunspots were observed .While it is likely that solar irradiance was reduced at this time , it is difficult to calculate by how much .However , additional proxies of solar output exist that match reasonably well with the sunspot - derived records following the Maunder Minimum ; these may be used as crude estimates of the solar irradiance variations .In theory it is possible to estimate solar irradiance even farther back in time , over at least the past millennium , by measuring levels of cosmogenic isotopes such as carbon-14 and beryllium-10 .Cosmogenic isotopes are isotopes that are formed by interactions of cosmic rays with atomic nuclei in the atmosphere and that subsequently fall to Earth , where they can be measured in the annual layers found in ice cores .Since their production rate in the upper atmosphere is modulated by changes in solar activity , cosmogenic isotopes may be used as indirect indicators of solar irradiance .However , as with the sunspot data , there is still considerable uncertainty in the amplitude of past solar variability implied by these data .Solar forcing also affects the photochemical reactions that manufacture ozone in the stratosphere .Through this modulation of stratospheric ozone concentrations , changes in solar irradiance ( particularly in the ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum ) can modify how both shortwave and longwave radiation in the lower stratosphere are absorbed .As a result , the vertical temperature profile of the atmospheric can change , and this change in turn can influence phenomena such as the strength of the winter jet streams .Variations in Earth 's orbit .On timescales of tens of millennia , the dominant radiative forcing of Earth 's climate is associated with slow variations in the geometry of Earth 's orbit about the Sun .Changes in eccentricity slightly influence the mean annual solar radiation at the top of Earth 's atmosphere , but the primary influence of all the orbital variations listed above is on the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of incoming solar radiation over Earth 's surface .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.84604"}
