{"text": "The simplest way to define a warrant is : a court document that commands police to take a particular action .There are several different types of warrants , but the most common are arrest warrants and search warrants .While arrest warrants command police to arrest individuals , search warrants command of the police to search specified locations .A warrant is a legal document , signed by a judge and administered by the police .The Definition of an Arrest Warrant .Fortunately in the United States , Police Departments are not allowed to randomly arrest its citizens .First , a judge must sign a legal document called an arrest warrant before law enforcement can make an arrest .Arrest warrants can be issued for various reasons , but , failure to appear at court is the most common cause .Keep in mind that police officers will enter homes and places of business to incarcerate fugitives with arrest warrants on their record .How to Find Out If You Have a Warrant in Bartow Florida FL : .Whether you 're searching for a warrant on yourself or others , you have a few options to get the job done .The first option is to head down to your local police department and make a warrant request .The only problem with this option is that you usually need a good reason to do a search on someone else .If you convinced the officer that you have a good reason - obtaining a warrant report will cost a nominal fee , and a bit of patience .Keep in mind that this is a low priority request , and the police officer at the front desk will often take their time with your arrest warrant search .A word of warning : this method is not suggested if you are doing an arrest warrant search on yourself .If the police determine that you have an active warrant , they will arrest you and you will not have a chance to prepare your defense .You also should n't use this method when checking on the status of family members or close friends as well .This is because the police will attempt to gather information about the person 's whereabouts .You could even be brought into the situation if you attempt to deceive the police , as obstructing justice is a crime .The easiest and safest way to check if someone has an outstanding warrant on file is by using a public online search engine , like govwarrantsearch.org .This site will allow you to instantly investigate anyone 's background using all national databases and receive the information that you need without having to go anywhere in person .You can easily gather information from many databases with a single click , and either conduct an in - state search for warrants in Bartow Florida FL , or use the \" Nationwide \" option to search for warrants anywhere else in the entire United States .Aside from being quick and easy , an online search is also beneficial because of the privacy that it affords you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.51188"}

{"text": "By the turn of the century , Bartow had become the most populous city south of Tampa on the Florida peninsula- larger than either Miami or West Palm Beach .As the city grew , a number of industries moved into the Bartow area .In the first few decades of the 1900s , thousands of acres of land around the city were purchased by the phosphate industry and Bartow would become the hub of the largest phosphate industry in the United States .Polk County was the leading citrus county in the United States for much of the 20th century and the city has several large groves .In 1941 , the city built an airport northeast of town .The airport was taken over by the federal government during World War II and was the training location for many Army Air Corps pilots during the war .The airport was returned to the city in 1967 and renamed Bartow Municipal Airport .For most of the 20th century , Bartow 's growth was modest , especially in comparison to the rest of the county and state .While other cities in Polk County aggressively annexed adjacent land and allowed rapid growth , the government of Bartow generally took a more cautious approach .Another reason why Bartow 's growth had been slow was that most of the land surrounding the city was owned by phosphate mining companies making residential growth unpractical .Although Bartow had been the largest city in Polk county in 1900 , by the 1910 U.S. Census Lakeland had surpassed Bartow in population .Bartow remained the second largest city in the county until sometime in the 1950s when Winter Haven become more populous than Bartow .In the late 1990s as phosphate operations in the area moved southward , much of the former phosphate land became available for sale .In 1999 Connecticut financier Stanford Phelps purchased the former Clear Springs phosphate lands east and south of city limits and announced plans for the largest development project in Polk County history .After nearly a decade of delays , the plan received final approval in 2009 .The Clear Springs Development includes plans for more than 11,000 new homes , 1,000,000 square feet ( 93,000 m2 ) of commercial space , three schools , and a golf course .According to the Central Florida Regional Planning Council , Bartow 's population is projected to grow to over 25,000 people by 2015 .When buildout of the Clear Springs Development is completed by 2030 , the population of the city is projected to be over 45,000 residents .Geography Bartow is located slightly southwest of both the geographical centers of Polk County and peninsular Florida .Bartow is approximately 39 miles ( 63 km ) east of Tampa and 51 miles ( 82 km ) southwest of Orlando .The cities of Bartow , Lakeland , and Winter Haven roughly form an equilateral triangle pointed downward with Bartow being the south point , Lakeland the west point , and Winter Haven the east point .The city is located near the headwaters of the Peace River at Lake Hancock .Bartow is located within the Central Florida Highlands area of the Atlantic coastal plain with a terrain consisting of flatland interspersed with gently rolling hills .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.06435"}

Bartow the first brigade commander to die in combat during the American Civil War .According to the U.S. Census Bureau 2000 Census , the city had a population of 15,340 and an estimated population of 16,959 in 2009 .As of 2010 , the mayor of Bartow is Wayne Lewis .Located near the source of the Peace River , Bartow is approximately 39 miles ( 63 km ) east of the Tampa Bay Area and 50 miles ( 80 km ) southwest of the Greater Orlando area .The city is near the center of ' Lightning Alley ' and has frequent afternoon thunderstorms in the summer , but typically has sunny and mild winters .Government , mining , and agriculture are the major sectors of the area 's economy .Three districts within the city are on the National Register of Historical Places .Other historic landmarks include the Old Polk County Courthouse built in 1909 and Bartow High School , formerly Summerlin Institute , the oldest high school in the county .Although Bartow has been eclipsed in population , importance and name recognition by other cities in the county , particularly Lakeland and Winter Haven , the city has retained its small city heritage and its distinctive Southern culture .With the annexation of 18,000 acres ( 73 km2 ) of former phosphate mining land owned by the Clear Springs Land Company , Bartow 's population is projected to increase to over 25,000 by 2015 and over 45,000 by 2030 .History A Spanish map of the Florida peninsula drawn in 1527 shows a native settlement called Rio de la Paz near present day Bartow .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.08577"}

'During the war , the area 's major contribution to the Confederacy was food supplies .The Union army and navy had effective control of the west coast of Florida , and many cattlemen retreated inland and formed the ' Cow Cavalry ' as a defense against Union troops .One of the wealthiest members of the Cow Cavalry was Jacob Summerlin .Summerlin purchased the Blount property in 1862 and donated a large parcel of land to build a county courthouse , two churches and a school .The first Polk County Courthouse was built in 1867 and this did solidify the city 's position as county seat .Although Florida formally rejoined the union in 1868 , Reconstruction did not end in Florida until 1877 .The 1880s and 90s were a period of growth for the city of Bartow ; from 1880 to 1900 , the city would grow from 386 residents to 1,983 .On July 1 , 1882 the town was incorporated as a city .In 1885 , the Florida Southern Railroad , a north - south route from North Florida to Southwest Florida opened in Bartow .A year later , the Bartow Branch of the South Florida Railroad which connected Tampa and Orlando was completed .The railroads would become a catalyst to the growth of the area ; during the Spanish American War , the Bartow rail yards became a crucial part of the supply line headed for troops in Cuba .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.50661"}
