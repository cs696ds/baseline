{"text": "44 comments : .The causes of the Civil War were numerous and diverse .It is often argued that slavery was the sole issue for the start of the Civil War in America .The issues , however , are more deeply rooted than that ; slavery simply has the most important role of these reasons .When America gained its independence from England in 1783 , the country was already divided by the many differences between the different colonists who had settled in the new lands .These original differences eventually progressed into conflicts over different ideologies , particularly over the question of slavery and its function and purpose , or lack thereof , in the United States .It is also important to note that the first southern state to succeed was South Carolina , a state that had threatened secession during the time of Andrew Jackson when a new tax was implemented that which they wanted no part of .Historians can also look to the fact that some slave states such as Kentucky , Missouri and Maryland sided with the union in the war ; contradicting the idea that slavery was the only cause of the war if states in favour of slavery supported the union .These points highlight how the idea of secession was implanted long before the issue of slavery was at the forefront , and , proves that slavery was not the sole reason for the Civil War .Instead , many fighting in the south , the most notable of which being General Lee , were fighting for their own state , with General Lee refusing to fight for the Union in fear of fighting against his state of Virginia .As such it is clear that the secession and deeper original differences in ideology contributed to the emergence of slavery as a key issue in the war .As everyone historian would agree , when it comes to determining the causes of certain events , we must not only consider the facts of that time , but the lead up to that moment .When we look back to the American Revolution , when American was able to gain their independence from Britain , the nation was already split amongst different ideals .The main ideal that came to split the nation was the difference between the Federalists and the anti - Federalists .The anti - Federalists , most of the Southern states ' governments , believed that the power to maintain slavery remained in the hands of the states ' government , according to the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution .One thing led to another ; the dichotomy between beliefs eventually grew into the contrast in beliefs of the overall significance of slavery .The southern states , starting with South Carolina , started to succeed , threatening to secede during Jackson 's presidency .When the new tax was implemented , the southern state did not want to be a part of it , starting to practice sectionalism - a rather arrogant belief that the South was more important than the country as a whole .To further substantiate the fact that the Civil War was not solely based on slavery can be seen when we look at the key players on each side .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "41.517616"}

Lincoln would not allow this .Some less educated ( or willfully ignorant ) neoconfederates will tell you that there could have been an amicable split , with the Slavocracy allowed to go its own way .This is a ridiculous fallacy .There would have been and immediate and inevitable conflict over the remaining Western Territories , not to mention the continued prescence of European Empires in Canada and Mexico .Lincoln did what he must to preserve government of the people , by the people , for the people , against the Slavocracy and Tyranny of all stripes .That is true , in a certain sense .The antebellum Southern economy was extremely dependent on slavery for its economic viability ; if slavery had been abolished immediately , it would have been chaos , so there is a certain amount of truth to the idea that economics was at the heart of the issue .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "44.176254"}

{"text": "The logical answer is , I think , no .Slavery .Lincoln never said during the election that he was going to do anything to the institution of slavery in the South .Since the Missouri Compromise , the only debates concerning slavery concerned the expansion of slavery into the western territories , and the return of fugitive slaves .Therefore , the supposed Southern fear that Lincoln posed a threat to their \" peculiar institution \" were nothing but fantasy .As for expansion of slaver since that the institution of slavery is per se illegitmate and immoral , I think the Federal Government had every right to restrict its expansion into territory that was under its control .Yes , I am aware of the fact that slavery was if not protected at least recognized under the Constitution .That is an historical travesty , but it does n't mean that the nation had to stand by and do nothing while the territories to the West were turned into slave camps .Finally , if a slave was lucky enough to escape the hell he or she lived in , then they should 've been allowed to stay free .Dred Scott was a horrid decision , legally and morally .States ' Rights .This was the final argument used by the seceding states , and the one most often cited by supporters today .As I said above , I do not intend today to address the issue of whether the states retained some degree of sovereignty under the Constitution .Let 's assume for the sake of argument that they did .The question is whether there was a sufficient threat to that sovereignty in the wake of the 1860 election to justify rebellion .For the reasons addressed above , the answer is no .Lincoln had said nothing , and certainly in the months prior to his Inauguration , had done nothing , to indicate that such a threat existed .Moreover , if the South had stayed in the Union and sent its Congressmen and Senators to Washington in 1861 , they would have represented a voting bloc large enough that they would have been able to block any legislation they did n't like , especially in the Senate .They choose instead to rebel against their nation .For that , while history may not condemn them , it 's clear to me that they should not be honored .Like this : .Generally speaking , since the Constitution has very specific provisions for admitting new states , but no provision for secession , it therefore does not sanction secession .This is an uncontroversial doctrine of statutory interpretation known as \" Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius . \" In the specific context of the Civil War , the Southern states had engaged in a serious constitutional violation , namely Article IV 's guarantee of a republican form of government , by disenfranchising slaves .Therefore , the actions of those state legislatures that endorsed secession were , by definition , null and void .Kip , .I agree with you , but I wanted to address the comments of some of my fellow citizens of the Old Dominion who were equating the Confederacy with the American Revolution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.96346"}

{"text": "There are more but I think these two are enough to make my point .Another point but one that might not fit as squarely on this list is this : The individualistic attitudes that followed states ' secession also led to widespread desertion among Confederate troops leading to a massive desertion of 40 % of forces east of the Mississippi in 1864 .In any case , the Union had none of these problems due to its centralized government .Also , this disparity in resources and war - making ability can also be found in the American Revolution ; but we won that one .The American revolution also saw the Americans succeeding despite overcoming their being a decentralized government fighting a centralized one ( which can also support your point in downplaying the role of a centralized government , to be fair ) .In my opinion , it was the disparity in leadership between Lincoln and Davis that tipped the scales in the Union 's favor .Davis was an ego - driven and petty man who was incapable of remaining out of petty internal squabbles with his political opponents , let alone forging important compromises and holding his country together .He also forced his generals to send their every decision through Richmond for approval and made it impossible for Confederate forces to communicate effectively with one another to form a cohesive war plan - in favor of Davis micromanaging the war effort out of the hands of his generals .Lincoln was able to compromise within his government with people who openly despised him and acted against him ( the Radical republicans hated their own party leader with a fury ) .Lincoln deployed his diplomatic forces to quell any rising Confederate sympathy abroad ( and although it was n't entirely successful it ) resulted in no official recognition of the Confederacy .The quotes were a response to \" Damn Yankee and Proud , \" in his or her post at 12:39 : \" They lost , and slavery ended .\" They did n't , and it did n't ; the southern \" redemptionists \" substantially won the peace with mass violence , economic manipulation , and political fraud .As you note , it took another century to consolidate the most basic victories won in the Civil War .The destruction of slavery was the critical moral issue facing the country , but it did n't really happen .The Civil War failed , which should make us willing to at least discuss other paths that may have taken the country to the same morally necessary goal .That discussion is not neo - Confederate nostalgia .David Blight has done some exceptionally perceptive recent work on the tensions between the war aim of preserving the nation and the later war aim of providing substantial freedom to emancipated slaves .These were irreconcilable goals ; northern and southern whites looked to one another as countrymen again , after the war , by throwing their black countrymen under the bus .As Brooks Simpson wrote , \" Reconstruction began at Fort Sumter .\" The war was fought over two goals that pushed in opposite directions - national reconciliation , and black freedom and equality - and so could not have fully succeeded .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.167282"}

Taney , ruled that blacks are not citizens , and there fore can not bring a suit to court .This outraged many northerners , one of which decided to take action against the pro - slavery movement .John Brown took matters into his own hands when he and his sons armed slaves to fight against their owners .Abraham Lincoln wanted to end these types of skirmishes between the north and south by destroying slavery once and for all .When he won the Election of 1860 the southern states felt that they had no choice but to secede from the union .Jefferson Davis , the president of the Confederate States , and his southern followers were willing to fight to preserve slavery .The Union and Confederacy fought for many years until over 600,000 people had died , and the south had surrendered , thus abolishing slavery forever .The American civil war was different from any other war we had fought because it was fought internally between the North and the South .Americans were fighting each other over the right to own slaves .Most of the north though it was morally wrong , but in the south it was part of their culture .Cotton was the biggest industry in the south .Slavery was the second biggest Industry and was worth approximately four billion dollars .The south was predominantly a one - crop nation , therefore depended on slavery for a majority of their income .The north would be less affected by slavery because our economy was more diverse and based more on industries .The nation was divided between slavery and war was inevitable .Northerners were fighting to preserve the union and the south to protect their way of life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.54692"}

Ferguson , which addressed a Louisiana Jim Crow law that segregated rail cars .Homer Plessy , a black man , tried to board a \" whites - only \" train in Louisiana when the car designated for blacks was full .Once he boarded , he was forcibly removed and jailed .He sued the state , claiming the Louisiana segregation laws violated both his 13th and 14th Amendment rights .The Supreme Court , by a vote of 8 - 1 , ruled that the 14th Amendment did not include a requirement that the races needed to be co - mingled and therefore upheld the doctrine of \" Separate but Equal \" when it came to facilities for blacks .Segregation was justified , providing the facilities and services were essentially equal .Plessy marked the beginning of a 58-year period where Jim Crow laws were largely unchallenged and condoned by the federal government .It not only perpetuated the white supremacist beliefs of the time , but also made it possible for states to make and enforce Jim Crow laws with impunity .As admirable and inspiring as blacks were in the years following their liberation , a stark contrast in human nature was seen by the forces against them .Groups like the KKK and southern democrats behaved shamefully , deplorably , and inhumanely .Blacks began a distinguished , dignified , and long - overdue chapter in their history after the Civil War , but the opposite was true for the groups who acted in opposition to their freedom and to their rapid success .Many southern Democrats despised blacks and Republicans and they utilized every means possible to keep them from voting - including not only the use of devious and cunning means but also the direct use of violence .Here 's the thing .After slavery was abolished , ALL freed slaves and other blacks were Republicans .[In the South , whites were mostly Democratic , but some could be Republican .Southern whites loyal to the antebellum South were mostly Democratic .Whites who sympathized with the North and wanted civil rights for blacks were Republican ( scalawags ) .The worst thing you could be in the Reconstruction era South , and in the years that followed , was a Republican .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.92032"}

Sandford , the Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether a slave who escaped from a slave state to a free state is considered free .And the words and thought which flowed from the minds of such supposed constitutional scholars entrusted with the bench of the highest court in the land represented the lowest point in American constitutional jurisprudence .On March 6th , 1857 , Chief Justice Roger B. Taney , a Democrat , a staunch supporter of slavery , and one intent on protecting the South from northern aggression , delivered the majority opinion .One of which rights is the privilege of suing in a court of the United States in the cases specified in the Constitution . \" Seven of the nine justices agreed that Dred Scott should remain a slave , but Taney did not stop there .He referred to blacks as an \" inferior race \" and an \" unfortunate race \" and a degraded and unhappy race . \"He ruled that blacks , whether slaves or as free men , are descended from an inferior race which was never intended to be included among the class of persons protected by our Declaration of Independence or Constitution .As he explained , the framers of the Constitution believed that blacks \" had no rights which the white man was bound to respect ; and that the negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his benefit .He was bought and sold and treated as an ordinary article of merchandise and traffic , whenever profit could be made by it .In other words , because blacks ( Africans , as Taney referred to them ) are an inferior race , they are only fit to serve the interests of other human beings .No African , therefore , can ever be protected by the Constitution .In addition , he declared that Scott had never been free , due to the fact that slaves were personal property ; thus the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was unconstitutional , and the Federal Government had no right to prohibit slavery in the new territories .The court appeared to be sanctioning slavery under the terms of the Constitution itself , and saying that slavery could not be outlawed or restricted within the United States .There was a growing abolitionist movement in the United States at the time , particularly in the northern states .And the Dred Scott decision gave further fuel to ignite the movement .As mentioned above , Abraham Lincoln ran in 1860 on a platform which promised to end the spread of slavery .He would prohibit slavery in any territory of the United States ; only those states already established would be able to keep the institution .He believed if slavery was contained , it would easily die a natural death .[ 3 ] .When Lincoln won the election , and even before he was inaugurated , the southern states began to secede from the Union .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.361687"}

{"text": "As soon as the Senate confirmed him , he told his colleagues on the bench that he believed racial segregation violated the Constitution and that only if one considered African Americans inferior to whites could the practice be upheld .Chief Justice Earl Warren was a Republican .In fact , he ran as a Republican for the seat of Governor of California , which he won .He served three terms .Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U.S. 483 ( 1954 ) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students unconstitutional .The decision overturned the Plessy v. Ferguson decision of 1896 which allowed state - sponsored segregation .Handed down on May 17 , 1954 , the Warren Court 's unanimous ( 9 - 0 ) decision stated that \" separate educational facilities are inherently unequal . \" As a result , de jure racial segregation was ruled a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution .This ruling paved the way for integration and was a major victory of the civil rights movement .It is said that the case was decided by the results of a \" doll test .The doll test at the heart of the Brown decision was designed by Mamie and Kenneth Clark , African - American ( husband and wife ) psychologists , to study the effects of segregation and racism on the self - esteem of black children .In the test , black children were put in a room with two types of dolls - a white doll with blonde hair and a brown doll with black hair - and then observed to see which dolls they preferred to play with .The children were then asked questions inquiring as to which doll is the nice doll , which one looks bad , which one has the nicer color , etc .( Mamie used a similar test as the basis of her master 's thesis ) .All the black children preferred the white dolls .The findings of the Clarks ' doll test were submitted to the Supreme Court as evidence of the negative impact of segregation on the mental and psychological status of black schoolchildren .The Clarks concluded that the children felt the impact of segregation and felt a sense of inferiority .The key holding of the Court was that , even if segregated black and white schools were of equal quality in facilities and teachers , segregation by itself was harmful to black students and unconstitutional .They found that a significant psychological and social disadvantage was given to black children from the nature of segregation itself ( drawing on the \" doll study \" research ) .This aspect was vital because the question was not whether the schools were \" equal , \" which under the Plessy standard , they should have been , but whether the doctrine of \" separate - but - equal \" was constitutional with respect to public education .The justices answered with a strong \" no . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.3076"}

{"text": "But as for me re - thinking my support for Ron Paul - not a chance - the Civil War happened a long time ago - now Americans have to deal with an Imperial Presidency , a war based on lies , and a threat to our liberties .And who lied their way into this war ?Bush and the Congressional Republican Party .The structure of our political system prevents any third party from being effective , so the choice is Republican and Democrat .The option is to choose the lesser of the two evils , and then try to take it over .That is what the religious right did with the Republicans , and now for the rest of us that is what will drive us to the Democratic Party .Ron Paul would be worse as President than the worst President that American has ever had - George W. Bush .But Ron Paul has one major advantage .Frequently it takes a truly insane person to ; publicly state the truth to the public .That insane person in this election season is Ron Paul , but there has not been a candidate if equivalent insanity with similar public support in the last hundred years at least .And Huckabee would be even worse .Bush , Cheney , Paul , Huckabee - tells you a lot about the current Republican Party , does n't it ?As bad as it is , ( and it 's pretty bad ) the Democratic Party ca n't approach that level of pure insanity .I 'm glad to see a couple people already commenting on the unfiltered event surrounding the Civil War .Everyone should remember that history books are written by the victor and learning both sides is n't easy .I 'd like to chime in with a few historical facts ... .It seems that most people are acknowledging that the Civil War was n't initiated because of slavery , but that this was a lucky coincidence .Every agrees that slavery was bad , Paul is saying that there were alternatives to killing 600,000 Americans .The next defense of going to war some appear to be using is that secession was somehow illegal and Lincoln had the right to force them to stay .If the idea of forcing people to remain in a democracy does n't seem a bit odd , then perhaps Lincolns approval of the secession of West Virginia away from Virginia will make you scratch your head .So clearly secession was n't illegal as long as it was in the north 's favor .Imagine for a moment that Poland was to leave the European Union , would you really expect the then to be invaded to force them back in !The third defense appears to go along the lines that the South started things by attacking Fort Sumter .That s a debatable position because South Carolina was no longer part of the US and all land at that time was forfeited to the new government .Despite this obvious logic , they still attempted to purchase the land from the Union , but Lincoln refused to accept this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.51384"}
