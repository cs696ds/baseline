'The figures for declining discoveries are particularly striking because exploration activity in 2014 showed little impact from the sharp fall in oil prices in the second half of the year .Last year , the number of exploration and appraisal wells drilled worldwide was only 1 per cent lower than in 2013 .This year , exploration budgets are being cut back across the industry and the number of wells drilled is likely to fall further .New discoveries are not the only sources of future oil supply .The weakness of new discoveries increases the need for production from those sources to rise if , as expected , global demand for oil continues to increase .There are also very large shale oil reserves in countries including Russia , China , Argentina and Libya , but the industries there are still in their infancy .Shale is also a relatively high cost source of oil compared with reserves in the Middle East , and requires higher crude prices to be commercially viable .Mr Jackson said that with crude prices around their present levels , it would be ' very difficult ' to start up new shale production projects . \"Discoveries of new oil and gas reserves drop to 20-year low Financial Times , 15 February 2015 . \" Energy consumption in the European Union has fallen to levels last seen more than two decades ago , statistics published on Monday showed .Despite the plunge , Europe remains heavily dependent on fuel imports , with more than half of energy needs supplied by production from abroad , including the Middle East and Norway .The UK was one of the least dependent on imports of the biggest member states , buoyed by its offshore fossil fuel supplies , with 46.4 % of primary energy coming from overseas .That relative independence is likely to be eroded further in future years , however , as the North Sea supplies of oil and gas are dwindling fast .France , where nuclear reactors supply the vast majority of electricity needs , was also less dependent than the average , at 48 % of supplies imported .Just behind came renewable sources of energy , which in total generated just under a quarter of homegrown power . \"EU energy consumption level falls to 20-year low Guardian , 9 February 2015 . \"Claims that nuclear power is a ' low carbon ' energy source fall apart under scrutiny , writes Keith Barnham .Far from coming in at six grams of CO2 per unit of electricity for Hinkley C , as the Climate Change Committee believes , the true figure is probably well above 50 grams - breaching the CCC 's recommended limit for new sources of power generation beyond 2030 ....", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.61879"}

{"text": "\" The reason behind developments in Macedonia is a desire to influence the government of Nikola Gruevski in connection with its refusal to join anti - Russian sanctions , Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday , speaking at the Federation Council .While pointing to the need to rule out support for coups patterned after events in Ukraine and Yemen , Lavrov noted that ' there were attempts to organize something similar in Macedonia using the Albanian factor in an unconstructive fashion . ' 'The Macedonian events are blatantly controlled from the outside , ' he said . 'However , the reason behind this is a desire to influence it in connection with its refusal to join anti - Russian sanctions , support of the South Stream and willingness to be involved in the implementation of other options of fuel delivery , including the so - called Turkish Stream . ' 'It is very sad and dangerous that they are trying to use the Albanian factor for that , ' the minister added . 'Many years ago there were serious contradictions , and then the Ohrid Agreement was signed [ in 2001].While industrial value added actually grew 6 % from January to April , coal output fell by 6.1 % and power generation from coal , gas and other thermal plants fell by 3.5 % .Cement output fell by 4.8 % and crude steel output by 1.3 % , while higher value industries such as electronics and chemicals maintained high growth .At the same time as industrial output is becoming less carbon intensive , energy production from low - carbon sources is increasing .Most of the added generation continues to come from hydropower .It has also been alleged that the Chinese state has displaced millions of residents to make room for these projects .A recent projection by a Chinese government think tank sees the country getting half of its electricity from renewable energy in 15 years , and almost phasing out fossil fuels in power generation by mid - century .Under these projections China in 2050 would produce half of the current electricity consumption of the entire world from wind and solar alone , or more than twice as much as as China currently does from coal .The trend only accentuated in 2010 - 2013 , pushing global CO2 emissions and CO2 levels already in the atmosphere to ever more dangerous levels and making the task of peaking and declining global emissions very urgent .By 2040 , the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( Opec ) predicts the world will need to produce 111 m bpd of crude to meet world demand .That represents another 20 m bpd on top of existing output which means the world needs to find and develop and additional 800,000 bpd of oil a year on average to keep up with supply .To put that challenge into perspective , this figure represents repeating the US shale oil boom all over again , or finding a developing a new North Sea 20 times over .That time is now upon us .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.046036"}

'The fall in prices is trumping the efficiency gains for the summer , ' says Amrita Sen , chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects .Saudi Arabia is likely to maintain or even extend its use of domestic crude and fuel in power plants this summer , according to Sen and other analysts .Yet the country appears to be making some progress toward slowing its dependence on one of the most costly forms of electricity .Saudi use of oil for power will be ' continually growing , but not at the sort of growth rates of the past 10 years , ' Stevens said .\" U.S. drivers yield ' swing ' oil demand crown to Saudis Reuters , 22 May 2015 . \" In the past year yet another technology that seems to produce cheap , pollution - free energy has emerged .If this technology proves viable , it could join with cold fusion and hydrinos as an alternative to the combustion of fossil fuels .At first glance , this third new technology sounds ridiculous for it seems to be a form of perpetual motion , which we all learned in 7th grade science is impossible .Production of energy from nothing but gravity seems to violate a fundamental law of physics which says that energy can neither be created nor destroyed , only transferred into another form .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.86646"}

{"text": "Some speculate that future technology will make further extraction possible , but to some , this future technology is already considered in proven and probable reserve numbers .In many major producing countries , the majority of reserves claims have not been subject to outside audit or examination .Most of the easy - to - extract oil has been found .Recent price increases have led to oil exploration in areas where extraction is much more expensive , such as in extremely deep wells with extreme downhole temperatures , and environmentally sensitive areas or where high technology will be required to extract the oil .A lower rate of discoveries per explorations has led to a shortage of drilling rigs , increases in steel prices , and overall increases in costs due to complexity .Reserves in effect peaked in 1980 , when production first surpassed new discoveries , though creative methods of recalculating reserves has made this difficult to establish exactly .- Concerns over stated oil reserves .According to former vice president of Aramco , Sadad I. Al Husseini , ' world reserves are confused and in fact inflated .Many of the so - called reserves are in fact resources .They 're not delineated , they 're not accessible , they 're not available for production . 'By Al - Husseini 's estimate , 300 billion of the world 's 1,200 billion barrels of proven reserves should be re - categorized as speculative resources .One difficulty in forecasting the date of peak oil is the opacity surrounding the oil reserves classified as ' proven ' .Many worrying signs concerning the depletion of ' proven reserves ' have emerged in recent years .This was best exemplified by the 2004 scandal surrounding the ' evaporation ' of 20 % of Shell 's reserves .For the most part , ' proven reserves ' are stated by the oil companies , the producer states and the consumer states .All three have reasons to overstate their proven reserves : .The Energy Watch Group ( EWG ) 2007 report shows total world proven ( P95 ) and probable ( P50 ) reserves to be between 854 and 1,255 billion barrels which means 30 to 40 years of supply if demand growth were to stop immediately .Major discrepancies arise from accuracy issues with OPEC 's self - reported numbers .Besides the possibility that these nations have overstated their reserves for political reasons during periods of no substantial discoveries , over 70 nations also follow a practice of not reducing their reserves to account for yearly production , therefore 1,255 billion barrels is a best - case scenario in this situation .Analysts have suggested that OPEC member nations have economic incentives to exaggerate their reserves , as the OPEC quota system allows greater output for countries with greater reserves .On the other hand investigative journalist Greg Palast has argued that oil companies have an interest in making oil look more rare than it is in order to justify higher prices .Other analysts in 2003 argued that oil producing countries understated the extent of their reserves in order to drive up the price of oil . -", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.63231"}

'These rapid changes in the price of oil will be a feast - and - famine set of economic consequences for the next few years , with much instability , ' Olson said .For the last nine years , American oil production has only climbed , growing steadily from 5 million barrels per day in 2005 to 8.6 million last year .Drillers in the top seven U.S. shale plays get 43 to 64 percent of the oil out of their wells in the first three years of pumping , according to research by David Hughes , a fellow at the Post Carbon Institute .In reports published in 2013 and 2014 , Hughes has said that the U.S. Energy Information Administration 's long - term oil output projections are overly optimistic .The problem at present is that so - called ' tight oil ' drillers are cutting capital expenditure budgets , and creating new wells is a front - loaded investment .Nearly all of the costs come in the first two phases : drilling for exploration and hydrofracking , the process of pumping a mixture of water and chemicals into the ground to break up rock formations and release oil and gas .The number of rigs drilling new oil and gas wells in the United States has fallen 25 percent from the highs in September .The slide has accelerated in the last two weeks , with another 177 rig reductions , bringing the total number of operating rigs to 1,456 .To be sure , some new wells have been drilled , but producers have delayed fracking them .In its most recent report , the North Dakota Industrial Commission pointed out that 775 drilled wells in the state 's Bakken Shale were waiting to be completed at the end of November .While some of the wells were not being completed due to a backlog of work for fracking crews , some companies have made the strategic decision to put off the investment in the second phase , Hughes told CNBC .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.70517"}

Pratt [ 8 ] , in the Report of the Panel on the Impact of the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy , gave as the proved reserves of liquid hydrocarbons for the Middle East the figure of 230 billion barrels .Since probably not less than 200 billion barrels of this is represented by crude oil , the estimate of the ultimate potential reserves of crude oil in the Middle East has been increased to 375 billion barrels , which can only be regarded as a rough order - of - magnitude figure .In the case of the United States , Weeks ' estimate of 110 billion barrels ( based upon production practices of about 1948 ) was for the land area .The United States Geological Survey [ 9 ] has estimated potential offshore reserves of the United States , based upon the productivity of comparable adjacent land areas , to be as follows : .Texas : 9 billion barrels .Louisiana : 4 billion barrels .California : 2 billion barrels .Total : 15 billion barrels .Olaf P. Jenkins [ 10 ] of the California Division of Mines has estimated the offshore reserves of California to be 4 billion barrels .Combining this with the U.S. Geological Survey estimate for Louisiana and Texas gives 17 billion barrels , which has here been rounded off to 20 billion .The production record of the past two decades , due in part to Improved recovery practices , indicates that Weeks ' figure of 110 billion barrels for the land may also be somewhat low .This has accordingly been increased to 130 billion , giving a total ultimate potential reserve of 150 billion barrels of crude oil for both the land and offshore areas of the United States .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.46005"}

'They 've been building out strategic storage .The goal is to build out to about 500 million barrels , compared to the U.S. capacity of 700 million to 800 million barrels , ' said Jeff Brown of Singapore - based energy consultants FGE .Brown said that while the numbers are a little murky , China has already built out about 150 million barrels of extra storage , with more capacity planned through the end of the year . 'They take a lot of pride in buying oil when it 's cheap , ' he said .Despite the massive capacity boom , China is still buying more oil than it can store -- and all that crude has to go somewhere .The solution lies in the Strait of Malacca .At anchor just a few kilometers off the coast of Malaysia lies the TI Europe , brimming with about 3 million barrels of oil destined for China .This 440,000 tonne monster is the world 's biggest tanker .She has been leased by the China 's state owned oil company at an estimated cost of $ 40,000 a day , to store oil until it can be shipped to China in smaller vessels .And she 's not the only one .Oil tanker analyst Richard Matthews of Gibson Shipbroking in the U.K. says there has been a surge in the number of supertankers being leased for storage . 'Normally , excluding Iranian ships , you might see only two or three ships storing , and they could be supporting offshore projects , ' he said . 'Now there are up to 17 or 18 non - Iranian tankers . 'Supertankers can also be used to store oil in a market where the future price of crude is expected to be significantly higher than the current price .Speculators buy cheap , bear the huge cost of storage and finance , and still make a profit when they sell a few months later .But analysts say that , for now , the difference between the current and future price is not wide enough to rake in speculative profits , which points to China filling its boats .China could also turn to land facilities for storage , mainly in South Africa .But the Strait of Malacca has an advantageous location , situated halfway between the big oil producers and the Chinese mainland .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.20788"}

{"text": "One other contingency merits comment .By means of present production techniques , only about a third of the oil underground is being recovered .The reserve figures cited are for oil capable of being extracted by present techniques .However , secondary recovery techniques are gradually being improved so that ultimately a somewhat larger but still unknown fraction of the oil underground should be extracted than is now the case .Because of the slowness of the secondary recovery process , however , it appears unlikely that any improvement that can be made within the next 10 or 15 years can have any significant effect upon the date of culmination .A more probable effect of improved recovery will be to reduce the rate of decline after the culmination with respect to the rates shown in Figure 21 .The corresponding extrapolation of the United States production curve for natural gas is shown in Figure 22 .Here the ultimate potential reserves are taken to be the 850 trillion cubic feet recently estimated by Pratt .In this case the unit rectangle of the graph represents 100 trillion cubic feet so that the total area under the curve is limited to eight and one - half rectangles of which one and one - half represent the approximately 150 trillion cubic feet produced already .The present production rate is about 10 trillion cubic feet per year and the curve is still rising steeply .An ultimate rate of about l4 trillion cubic feet per year is about the maximum that appears likely while allowing for the necessary period of prolonged decline .Assuming this value for the maximum , then the curve as drawn in Figure 22 is a reasonable extrapolation .The date of culmination in this case should be approximately 1970 .Shown also on the graph are two points indicating the rates of gas consumption for 1965 and 1975 postulated by Pratt [ 21 ] .The consumption rate for 1965 fits the curve very satisfactorily , but it is almost impossible to make the curve pass through Pratt 's point for 1975 without requiring an ultimate gas production considerably in excess of the 850 trillion cubic feet assumed .Curves for the ultimate production of crude oil and natural gas , respectively , for Texas are shown in Figures 23 and 24 .These are based on the assumed ultimate potential reserves of 60 billion barrels and 340 trillion cubic feet for oil and gas , respectively .The behavior of the curves is very similar to that of the corresponding curves for the United States , with the oil production culminating about 1965 and the gas production about 1970 .Improved methods of secondary recovery will probably make the rate of decline of the oil production curve less steep than is shown here , but are not likely seriously to postpone the date of the culmination .Production of the world 's coal has already consumed about 3.7 percent of the minable reserves initially present , that of oil and gas about 7 percent , while the production from shale and tar sands has barely been started .However , because of the versatility and usefulness of the liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons , and also because of their relative ease of extraction , the rate of exploitation of the latter has increased disproportionately to their magnitude as compared with coal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.423134"}

King Hubbert ( 1903 - 1989 ) was an American geophysicist best known for his accurate prediction of the peak in oil production in the lower 48 United States .In this paper , he published what is now known as the Hubbert Curve , a simple mathematical model of oil supply , and he used this to predict that the peak of crude - oil production in the United States would occur between 1966 and 1971 .It actually occurred in 1970 .The foundations of the Hubbert Curve were laid down in a 1949 paper that describes the production growth cycle for fossil fuels .The evolution of our knowledge of petroleum since Colonel Drake 's discovery of oil in Titusville , Pennsylvania , nearly a century ago , resembles in many striking respects the evolution of knowledge of world geography which occurred during the century following Columbus ' discovery of America .During that period several continents , a number of large islands , and numerous smaller islands were discovered , but how many more might there be ?Also during that period geographical charts had to be continuously revised in order to incorporate the new discoveries that were repeatedly being made , and also to correct some earlier speculations which had proved to be seriously in error .In addition , more detailed knowledge of the shore lines and other features of the areas discovered earlier was rapidly accruing , which also had to be added to the charts .Then , as now , a voyager starting out on a major expedition of discovery needed to equip himself with charts of two kinds .He needed the large - scale detailed charts for piloting along known shores , and the comprehensive charts of whole oceans , or even of the known world , as a guide for his major navigations .Likewise , for the petroleum industry the last century has been a period of bold adventure and discovery .Whole petroleum provinces analogous to the continents have been discovered and partly explored ; a few tens of very large fields , corresponding to the large islands , and hundreds of small fields , the small islands , have been discovered .But how far along have we come on our way to complete exploration ?Longer - range reviews have had to be made with respect to specific problems , such as whether to build a given pipeline or refinery .But for the most part our outlook has been dominantly contemporary with concern principally for the next few years , and with only occasionally [ 2 ] a bolder adventure into the more distant future .The object of this discourse will be to see what can be done in this direction with the information presently available .As a general orientation , let us consider that the petroleum industry is primarily an energy industry and secondarily a chemical industry .As an energy industry it utilizes the energy content of certain naturally occurring chemicals , namely the liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.45055"}

{"text": "More may follow .Earlier this year , Exelon , the nation 's largest operator of nuclear power plants , announced that it , too , is considering early retirements for some of its Midwest reactors .What 's it take to replace the nuclear power we 're losing ?To replace the power from five nuclear plants , you 'd need 16 natural gas combined cycle power plants , which would emit a total of 12 million metric tons of carbon dioxide per year .If you turned to renewables , you 'd need a lot -- roughly 7,600 wind turbines or 3.7 million solar PV rooftop panels -- to generate the same amount of electricity as five nuclear reactors .And , as I pointed out , wind and solar ca n't currently provide baseload power .I call these nuclear retirements \" unexpected \" because some reactors are closing earlier than their useful lifetime .This is happening for a variety of reasons , including depressed power prices , higher operating costs , and power market design challenges .Those were among the reasons cited for the early retirement of Entergy 's Vermont Yankee nuclear power station .By the way , an official with New England 's grid operator recently said Vermont Yankee 's shutdown will mean burning more oil and natural gas next winter .Again : the wrong direction .As we outline in our brief , lower natural gas prices and increases in wind power generation - both of which , we have to point out , have climate benefits - are contributing to lower wholesale market prices for electricity .The power markets are technology - agnostic .They do n't value zero - carbon or baseload sources more highly than their alternatives .Meanwhile , life - extending capital investments and post - Fukushima safety improvements are adding to nuclear costs .The combination of these forces has led to unsustainably low revenue for several nuclear power plants .A member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently expressed concern about the loss of baseload nuclear power .Commissioner John Norris said nuclear is critical to lowering emissions in the coming decades and that , in his words , \" if we do n't do something ... we are letting some pretty big bridges be torn down .\" What can be done to address these challenges ?I hope we get some of those answers from our discussion today .At C2ES , we 've long felt the best approach for advancing low - carbon solutions , including nuclear power , is to put a price on carbon .Unfortunately , we 're unlikely to see Congress enact a national carbon price any time soon .But there may be things that can be done at the state or regional level to help maintain the existing nuclear fleet .Hopefully , the carbon standards for power plants being developed by EPA will allow states the flexibility to meet them through market - based programs - effectively creating a price on carbon .This could integrate the carbon markets we already have in California and the Northeast , and encourage other states to follow suit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.61218"}
{"text": "For more than 50 years , LNG has been imported into the U.S. market for use as a fuel that will generate electricity , heat and cool homes and offices , cook meals , and a whole lot more .And it does all this without causing major accidents , and without creating any major security concerns .Liquefied natural gas is n't stored under pressure , and its vapors are not explosive - even if they mix with air - unless there 's a source of ignition .LNG is odorless and is n't toxic or corrosive .In fact , if we look at it from an environmental standpoint , it really is the \" clean fuel \" that the CLNG trade group claims : Should a leak or spill occur , liquefied natural gas just evaporates quickly , without leaving any residue .And once it 's been converted back into gas form , LNG produces low emissions when it 's burned .So we know that this is a safe , proven fuel .But is it cheap , and is there demand ?It 's only by answering those questions that we can determine whether there 's a good investment case for liquefied natural gas .Why Natural Gas Prices Must Rise .Natural gas competes closely with coal as fuel to generate electricity .Nearly 25 % of all the energy used in the United States comes from natural gas .Between 1999 and 2009 , natural gas typically cost more than coal .In 2010 , however , coal leapfrogged natural gas , making \" natty \" the cheaper option .That differential continues today .At its current price near $ 4 per thousand cubic feet ( mcf ) , most natural gas producers are losing money , as they need $ 4.50 or better to keep the lights on .Many shale plays need even higher prices .So extended low prices are causing supply to gradually fall off .But these same technological advances that make shale production possible have expanded America 's energy reserves exponentially , perhaps helping to explain the current state of the oil - to - gas ratio .Over the past decade , the oil - to - natural - gas ratio has typically hovered in the 6-to-1 to 12-to-1 range .Before global financial panic of 2008 , that ratio was in the 10-to-1 to 12-to-1 range .Before 2009 , you 'd have to go all the way back to 1990 to see this ratio spike above the 20-to-1 level .And that quickly corrected , netting serious profits for those who grasped the anomaly .Today , that oil - to - natural - gas ratio has soared to 26-to-1 .That means utilities have begun switching to natural gas , which is much cleaner to burn than coal , and helps lessen the effects of pollution and greenhouse gases .Legislation pushing for lower emissions is helping to make natural gas more attractive , too .Those are all great selling points for natural gas - both as a fuel and as an investment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.62284"}

{"text": "( Online version in colour . )( d ) Oil resources .The oil resource may refer to all the oil in an area , regardless of whether or not it is dispersed or accumulated , discovered or undiscovered , technically recoverable or economic to produce .Confusingly , the term sometimes refers solely to potentially recoverable oil .Estimates may be made of the technically recoverable resource ( TRR ) and/or the economically recoverable resource ( ERR ) , but the range of uncertainty is usually very wide and these terms are often used interchangeably .The term ultimately recoverable resource ( URR ) refers to the oil that is estimated to be recoverable from a field or region over all time - from when production begins to when it finally ends .For conventional oil , the regional URR represents the sum of cumulative production , declared reserves , the anticipated reserve growth at known fields and the resources estimated to be recoverable from undiscovered fields - commonly termed the yet - to - find ( YTF ) .The latter term is less appropriate for tight oil and oil sands , since these are located in continuous formations rather than discrete fields .However , extensive drilling is required to establish the spatial boundaries , geological characteristics and recoverable resources of these formations , and the productivity of individual wells varies widely both within and between such formations [ 22 - 25 ] .Estimates of the global URR for conventional oil fall within the range 2000 - 4300 Gb , compared to cumulative production of 1248 Gb through to 2011 [ 11 ] .The IEA 's [ 8 ] most recent estimate is 3926 Gb which is higher than earlier estimates and reflects recent reassessments of the non - US YTF ( 731 Gb ) 10 and future reserve growth ( 681 Gb ) [ 27 , 28 ] .Estimates of the URR of all - oil are much larger ( e.g. 7119 Gb from the IEA [ 8 ] ) and suggest that only one - sixth of the total recoverable resources has been produced ( figure 9 ) .However , the confidence intervals for such estimates are very wide [ 11 , 27 - 29 ] .In interpreting these numbers , it is essential to recognize that large quantities of resources within the Earth 's crust provide no guarantee that these can be produced at particular rates and/or at reasonable cost .Compare , for example , the monetary and energy investment required to produce 100 kb per day from the giant oil fields of the Middle East to that required to achieve comparable rates of production from deep - water oil fields , subarctic resources or the Canadian oil sands .To quote a widely used phrase in this context , it is not so much the size of the tank that matters but the size of the tap .This is not simply an issue of the steeply rising production costs of poorer quality resources because technical and net energy constraints may make some resources inaccessible and some production rates unachievable regardless of cost .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.12277"}

{"text": "For example , coal has been mined continuously for about 800 years , and by the end of 1955 the cumulative production for all of this time was 95 billion metric tons .It is somewhat surprising , however , to discover that the entire period of coal mining up until 1925 was required to produce the first half , while only the last 30 years has been required for the second half .Similarly , petroleum has been produced in the United States since l859 , and by the end of 1955 the cumulative production amounted to about 53 billion barrels .The first half of this required from 1859 to 1939 , or 80 years , to be produced ; whereas , the second half has been produced during the last 16 years .In the case of the production curve plotted against time on an arithmetical scale , we have as the ordinate . where dQ is the quantity of the resource produced in time dt .Likewise , from equation ( l ) the area under the curve up to anytime t is given by .where Q is the cumulative production up to the time t .Likewise , the ultimate production will he given by .and will be represented on the graph of production - versus - time as the total area beneath the curve .These basic relationships are indicated in Figure 11 .The only a priori information concerning the magnitude of the ultimate cumulative production of which we may be certain is that it will be less than , or at most equal to , the quantity of the resource initially present .Consequently , if we knew the quantity initially present , we could draw a family of possible production curves , all of which would exhibit the common property of beginning and ending at zero , and encompassing an area equal to or less than the initial quantity .That the production of exhaustible resources does behave in this way can be seen by examining the production curves of some of the older producing areas .In Figure 12 , for example , there is shown the crude - oil production curve for the state of Ohio .In this case the production began its initial sharp rise in 1884 , passed through three maxima between 1890 and 1900 with the peak about 1896 , and since then has undergone a slow , steady decline .In Figure 13 is shown the corresponding curve for the state of Illinois , which is distinguished by having two widely separated and well - defined maxima , the second considerably larger than the first .The reason for these two maxima is well known .With the exception of occasional outcrops in local areas , the state of Illinois is almost completely blanketed by glacial drift .The first period of discovery , beginning about 1905 , was based on surface geology with meager outcrop data .Consequently in about five years most of the discoveries amenable to this method had been made and for the next 25 years these fields continued to produce at declining rates with no new discoveries being made .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.724884"}

{"text": "The production of crude oil in Texas is shown in Figure 7 , and that of marketed natural gas in Figure 8 .Since these curves embody just about all that is essential in our knowledge of the production of energy from the fossil fuels on the world , a national , and a state scale , it is worth our attention to study them briefly .In the first place , it will be noted that there is a strong family resemblance among them .Each curve starts slowly and then rises more steeply until finally an inflection point is reached after which it becomes concave downward .For the world coal production this point was reached about the beginning of World War I , and for world petroleum production it appears to have been as recently as 1951 or 1952 .For the production of coal in the United States the inflection point also occurred about 1914 , and the inflection points for petroleum and natural gas apparently about 1952 .The inflection points for the Texas production of oil and gas occur at about the same dates as those for the United States .A more informative representation of the rate of growth of the production can be obtained by plotting the logarithm of the production rate versus time on semilogarithmic graph paper .This has been done in Figures 9 and 10 for the United States production of coal and crude oil , respectively .It will be noted in each case that the curve approximates a straight line until some definite date and then breaks away sharply downward .In the case of coal this departure from a straight line occurred about 1910 , and for crude oil about 1930 .All the other production curves shown in the preceding figures behave in a similar manner .The significance of this is that during the initial stages all of these rates of production tend to increase exponentially with time .Goal production in the United States from 1850 to 1910 increased at a rate of 6.6 percent per year , with the production doubling every 10.5 years .Crude - oil production from l880 until 1930 increased at the rate of 7.9 percent per year , with the output doubling every 8.7 years .These facts alone force one to ask how long such rates of growth can be kept up .How many periods of doubling can be sustained before the production rate would reach astronomical magnitudes ?That the number must be small can be inferred from the fact that after n doubling periods the production rate will be increased by a factor of 2n .Thus in ten doubling periods the production rate would increase by a thousandfold ; in twenty by a millionfold .For example , if at a certain time the production rate were 100 million barrels of oil per year - the U.S. production in 1903 - then in ten doubling periods this would have increased to 100 billion barrels per year .No finite resource can sustain for longer than a brief period such a rate of growth of production ; therefore , although production rates tend initially to increase exponentially , physical limits prevent their continuing to do so .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.39672"}

{"text": "In becoming acquainted with futures markets , it is useful to have at least a general understanding of who these various market participants are , what they are doing and why .The details of hedging can be somewhat complex but the principle is simple .In this way they attempt to protect themselves against the risk of an unfavorable price change in the interim .Or hedgers may use futures to lock in an acceptable margin between their purchase cost and their selling price .Consider this example : .A jewelry manufacturer will need to buy additional gold from his supplier in six months .Between now and then , however , he fears the price of gold may increase .That could be a problem because he has already published his catalog for a year ahead .To lock in the price level at which gold is presently being quoted for delivery in six months , he buys a futures contract at a price of , say , $ 350 an ounce .If , six months later , the cash market price of gold has risen to $ 370 , he will have to pay his supplier that amount to acquire gold .However , the extra $ 20 an ounce cost will be offset by a $ 20 an ounce profit when the futures contract bought at $ 350 is sold for $ 370 .In effect , the hedge provided insurance against an increase in the price of gold .It locked in a net cost of $ 350 , regardless of what happened to the cash market price of gold .Had the price of gold declined instead of risen , he would have incurred a loss on his futures position but this would have been offset by the lower cost of acquiring gold in the cash market .The number and variety of hedging possibilities is practically limitless .A cattle feeder can hedge against a decline in livestock prices and a meat packer or supermarket chain can hedge against an increase in livestock prices .Borrowers can hedge against higher interest rates , and lenders against lower interest rates .Investors can hedge against an overall decline in stock prices , and those who anticipate having money to invest can hedge against an increase in the over - all level of stock prices .And the list goes on .Whatever the hedging strategy , the common denominator is that hedgers willingly give up the opportunity to benefit from favorable price changes in order to achieve protection against unfavorable price changes .Were you to speculate in futures contracts , the person taking the opposite side of your trade on any given occasion could be a hedger or it might well be another speculator -- someone whose opinion about the probable direction of prices differs from your own .The arithmetic of speculation in futures contracts -- including the opportunities it offers and the risks it involves -- will be discussed in detail later on .For now , suffice it to say that speculators are individuals and firms who seek to profit from anticipated increases or decreases in futures prices .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.56546"}

{"text": "The process just described is known as a daily cash settlement and is an important feature of futures trading .As will be seen when we discuss margin requirements , it is also the reason a customer who incurs a loss on a futures position may be called on to deposit additional funds to his account .To say that gains and losses in futures trading are the result of price changes is an accurate explanation but by no means a complete explanation .Perhaps more so than in any other form of speculation or investment , gains and losses in futures trading are highly leveraged .An understanding of leverage -- and of how it can work to your advantage or disadvantage -- is crucial to an understanding of futures trading .As mentioned in the introduction , the leverage of futures trading stems from the fact that only a relatively small amount of money ( known as initial margin ) is required to buy or sell a futures contract .On a particular day , a margin deposit of only $ 1,000 might enable you to buy or sell a futures contract covering $ 25,000 worth of soybeans .Or for $ 10,000 , you might be able to purchase a futures contract covering common stocks worth $ 260,000 .The smaller the margin in relation to the value of the futures contract , the greater the leverage .If you speculate in futures contracts and the price moves in the direction you anticipated , high leverage can produce large profits in relation to your initial margin .Conversely , if prices move in the opposite direction , high leverage can produce large losses in relation to your initial margin .Leverage is a two - edged sword .For example , assume that in anticipation of rising stock prices you buy one June S&P 500 stock index futures contract at a time when the June index is trading at 1000 .And assume your initial margin requirement is $ 10,000 .Since the value of the futures contract is $ 250 times the index , each 1 point change in the index represents a $ 250 gain or loss .Thus , an increase in the index from 1000 to 1040 would double your $ 10,000 margin deposit and a decrease from 1000 to 960 would wipe it out .That 's a 100 % gain or loss as the result of only a 4 % change in the stock index !Futures trading thus requires not only the necessary financial resources but also the necessary financial and emotional temperament .If you can not afford the risk , or even if you are uncomfortable with the risk , the only sound advice is do n't trade .Futures trading is not for everyone .As is apparent from the preceding discussion , the arithmetic of leverage is the arithmetic of margins .An understanding of margins -- and of the several different kinds of margin -- is essential to an understanding of futures trading .If your previous investment experience has mainly involved common stocks , you know that the term margin -- as used in connection with securities -- has to do with the cash down payment and money borrowed from a broker to purchase stocks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.35073"}

{"text": "Hence , very great importance attaches to the possibility of converting the fertile materials , U-238 and Th-232 , into fissionable materials by means of the breeder reaction .The breeder reaction for U-238 is shown schematically in Figure 26 .In this case , the neutrons from the fissioning of U-235 are used to cause a radioactive transformation of U-238 to Pu-239 which is then fissionable .By a similar reaction Th-232 can be converted to U-233 which is also fissionable .It has been experimentally demonstrated that both of these reactions are possible and are capable of producing from the fertile materials more fuel material than is consumed .Thus , in principle , by means of properly developed breeder reactors , it is possible to consume whole uranium and thorium .In the subsequent discussion it will be assumed that complete breeding will have become the standard practice within the comparatively near future .Now for the energy that is released by the fissioning of a given amount of uranium ( or thorium ) .As indicated in Table 2 , the fissioning of 1 gram of U-235 releases 2.28 x 10 4 kw - hr of heat , which is equivalent to the heat of combustion of 3 tons of coal or of 13 barrels of oil .One pound of U-235 is equivalent to 1400 tons of coal or 6000 barrels of oil .Within narrow limits the same values are valid for U-238 and for thorium .Using the foregoing data , the uranium equivalents of the fossil - fuel reserves of the United States are shown in Table 3 .The energy of 358,000 metric tons ( l metric ton is equal to 10 grams or 2205 pounds ) of uranium is equal to that of all the fossil - fuel reserves of the United States .In Table 4 it is shown that the uranium equivalent of all the coal , oil , gas , and water power to be consumed in the United States during 1956 amounts to only 553 metric tons .In addition to the uranium used as fuel , there is also an amount which must be permanently tied up in inventory in the reactors and processing plants as indicated in Table 5 .This is estimated to be about 600 metric tons per million kilowatts of generating capacity .The present capacity of the United States is about 100 million kilowatts , which would require an inventory of about 60,000 tons of uranium .The inventory per ton of uranium consumed per year is about 740 tons , so if the fuels and water power of Table 4 were entirely replaced by nuclear power , the inventory requirements would be about 410,000 metric tons .It is clear , therefore , that during the period in which the power capacity is expanding the requirements of uranium for inventory will greatly exceed those for fuel .When growth ceases , the annual increment to inventory will become zero .The relative requirements of uranium for inventory and for fuel of an expanding nuclear - power system are shown in Figure 27 .The initial rate of expansion is taken to be 10 percent per year , with the power capacity becoming asymptotic to 500 million kilowatts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "129.58894"}
