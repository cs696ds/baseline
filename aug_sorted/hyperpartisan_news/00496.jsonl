{"text": "Obama and the Courts - Judicial Nominees . 13 Sep .President Obama has nominated a much more diverse set of judges to the Federal Courts than any of his predecessors .Of course , that has resulted in Republicans fillebustering a higher percentage of his nominees and preventing the confirmation of qualified nominees .Obama has had fewer nominees confirmed than any recent President .Now , Bush stacked the court with 322 far right wing sycophants , reactionary ideologues , and extremist right wing appointments , resulting in a Federal Judicial System and Supreme Court more hostile to minorities and Civil Rights than at any time since Dred Scott .Indeed , the financial association between Bush Supreme Court appointments and right wing financiers such as the Koch brothers have led many to believe the Supreme Court of the United States has been corrupted , by corrupt right wing judges .Of course an Obama Administration too cowardly to prosecute Dick Cheney 's war profiteers and torturers , is n't likely to take on the job of prosecuting a corrupt Supreme Court judge - even if he is caught red - handed taking a $ 500,000 bribe through his wife .Undeniably , the fact that President Obama has nominated more women and minorities is also difficult for Republicans to swallow , with the confirmation of minorities taking nearly twice as long as their white , male counterparts .I think Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , is fully justified in exercising \" the Nuclear Option \" , and should do so ASAP .President Barack Obama is moving at a historic pace to try to diversify the nation 's federal judiciary : Nearly three of every four people he has gotten confirmed to the federal bench are women or minorities .He is the first president who has n't selected a majority of white males for lifetime judgeships .More than 70 percent of Obama 's confirmed judicial nominees during his first two years were \" non - traditional , \" or nominees who were not white males .That far exceeds the percentages in the two - term administrations of Bill Clinton ( 48.1 percent ) and George W. Bush ( 32.9 percent ) , according to Sheldon Goldman , author of the authoritative book \" Picking Federal Judges . \"\" It is an absolutely remarkable diversity achievement , \" said Goldman , a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst , who is only counting judges once , even if they fit more than one category .The White House recently has been touting its efforts to diversify the federal bench during Obama 's tenure , now approaching three years in office .The president won Senate confirmation of the first Latina to the Supreme Court , Justice Sonia Sotomayor .And with the confirmation of Justice Elena Kagan , he increased the number of women on the high court to three for the first time .The Obama administration also nominated and won confirmation of the first openly gay man to a federal judgeship : former Clinton administration official J.

{"text": "For district court nominees , a 20-day wait for Bush 's nominees has become a 103-day wait for Obama 's .Judicial vacancies have grown from 55 in 2009 to 91 today .People are forced to wait an average of more than two years for a civil jury trial .As we like to remind anyone who will listen , the current GOP senate has been shameless in its enthusiasm for obstructing judicial nominees just for the sake of obstruction .For instance , a PFAW memo on August 2 reported that of 24 nominees then waiting for confirmation votes , 21 had been voted through the Senate Judiciary Committee with no recorded opposition .Ultimately , 4 of those nominees were confirmed by the Senate before it left for its August recess , and 20 remain waiting .( The Washington Post this morning lamented that such \" gamesmanship is not only frustrating but also destructive \" ) .This sort of thing is a clear example of obstruction for obstruction 's sake .But what about the nominees who do face some GOP opposition ?Last week , The Atlantic 's Andrew Cohen took an in - depth look at some of President Obama 's nominees who were ultimately confirmed by the Senate , but who received more than 25 \" no \" votes .The reason ?Most were opposed because of a record fighting for civil liberties or against big corporations .Here are a few of Cohen 's examples : .7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge David Hamilton ( Votes 59 - 39 ) .Even though his local Federalist Society endorsed this nephew of former Congressional leader Lee Hamilton , Senate Republicans mostly did n't because , as a trial judge , Hamilton had issued this 2005 ruling which had infuriated the religious right .Citing Supreme Court precedent , Judge Hamilton had ruled that Indiana 's legislative prayer before each session could no longer be \" sectarian \" and regularly invoke the name of Jesus Christ .Northern District of Ohio Judge Benita Y. Pearson ( Votes 56 - 39 ) .The first black female federal jurist in Ohio almost did n't get the gig .The precise reasons why are unclear .The People for the American Way suggested that she was a member of an animal rights group and thus earned the wrath of those in the cattle industries -- although 39 \" no \" votes is quite a lot of beef to have against a pioneering jurist .District of Colorado Judge William J. Martinez ( Votes 58 - 37 ) .By contrast , it is not hard to understand why this Mexico - born nominee roused so much Republican opposition on the floor of the Senate .Before he was nominated , Martinez advised the Americans with Civil Liberties Union and was a lawyer for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( just like Clarence Thomas before him , only Justice Thomas ' EEOC experience evidently was a boon for his nomination ) .Of nominee Martinez , Sen.

Bush 's runner - up choice for the high court behind David Souter in 1990 .She is a stout conservative , but her partisan background as legal counsel to the Texas GOP might lead some Senate Democrats to question her impartiality .Clement , 57 , was appointed to the federal bench by the first President Bush in 1991 and to the appeals court by the current president in 2001 .She is seen as a consistent conservative in her opinions but is not a prolific writer , making it somewhat difficult to precisely assess her judicial philosophy .And Owen , a former Texas Supreme Court colleague of Gonzales , was among a handful of Bush judicial nominees deemed too extreme by Senate Democrats , who threatened to filibuster her confirmation proceedings .She was grudgingly confirmed in May after centrist senators from both parties worked out a compromise that allowed most of the president 's choices to win approval .Owen , 50 , would be a lightning rod for pro - abortion rights groups because of state court rulings that narrowed conditions under which teenagers could procure abortions in Texas .Giving added ammunition to Democratic critics , Owen once was sharply criticized by Gonzales for \" an unconscionable act of judicial activism \" in one of her rulings in a Texas abortion case .Gonzales has since said his remarks were misconstrued .Another recent , controversial Bush appeals court appointee , Janice Rogers Brown of the influential District of Columbia Circuit , is another possibility , although probably a long shot .Brown also survived the filibuster battle in the Senate .A former California Supreme Court justice , Brown , 56 , has the kind of compelling personal story Bush often finds attractive .She is the daughter of an Alabama sharecropper and would be the first black woman on the high court .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.057575"}

Gore , one of the most controversial decisions in the court 's history , the country is already aware of how risky it is for the court to intervene in the electoral process without the guidance of a workable analytic framework .Both Bush v. Gore and Vieth are part of a story that began four decades ago .The court has long tried to use a conventional individual rights framework to resolve election - related claims that are really about the structure of the political process .An individual rights framework is suitable for addressing a concrete and personal harm , such as the disenfranchisement of a voter blocked from the polls by an illegal tax or a literacy test .But the framework does not provide adequate tools for resolving other types of election law cases , including the claim in Vieth challenging the fairness of a redistricting plan .As a result , the court now finds itself mired in a doctrinal holding pattern .If the justices do n't radically change course , we face two unappealing prospects .Either the court will withdraw from the field , leaving the fate of our democracy to self - interested legislators , or it will render more incoherent opinions that do as much harm as good .Fortunately , there are better options .Either the court should develop a new way to decide election law cases , or voters and their representatives should create nonpartisan institutions to regulate the electoral process , thus relieving the court of the need to police the politicians who now make the rules .While these solutions may seem abstract this late in the election season , their consequences are tangible .For this reason , we need a new regulatory strategy .Samuel Issacharoff of Columbia Law School has argued that the court ought to give its stamp of approval only to districting plans that have been drawn by nonpartisan districting commissions like Iowa 's , whose members ' jobs do not depend on the lines they draw .If every state had a nonpartisan commission , the court might decide to intervene only when necessary to ensure that the process , rather than the outcome , was fair .A more radically democratic solution comes from British Columbia , which is redesigning its electoral process from scratch .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.08956"}

Gabrielle Giffords .Roll had stopped by the Giffords event to tell the congresswoman about the urgent need to fill vacancies on the court .Senate Republicans ' commitment to delay was made particularly clear when they refused to allow a floor vote on 20 pending nominees , most of whom had advanced with no opposition .The Senate GOP 's foot - dragging on judicial nominees is clearly meant to hobble the president 's attempts at basic governance and preserve the dominance of conservative George W. Bush - appointed judges .But it also amounts to the shirking of a basic duty of the Senate : to fill the judiciary with capable , non - politically - motivated judges .This morning , Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee did something they have done only a handful of times : They exercised their discretion NOT to obstruct one of President Obama 's judicial nominees .The Committee was scheduled to vote on ten nominations this morning .With only four exceptions during the entirety of Obama 's presidency , Republicans have exercised their prerogative to delay a committee vote for judicial nominees , even when those nominees are unopposed and are desperately needed to address burgeoning judicial emergencies .It is part of their larger strategy to throw sand in the wheels of the confirmation process in every way possible .This morning , they did not request a delay for Jennifer Guerin Zipps , who has been nominated to be a district judge in Arizona .What makes Guerin Zipps different ?The seat is a judicial emergency , but that has not mattered before .The nominee is unopposed , but even nominees without opposition and with the strong support of their Republican home - state senators have seen their votes delayed .Only one thing makes this nomination different : Republicans know that the American people are paying attention , because this is to fill the seat that was held by Judge John Roll , who was among those killed in Tucson last January when Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was shot .Roll was seeking to meet Giffords to discuss the worsening caseload crisis overwhelming the area 's federal judges .Americans were appalled by the violence , which brings this particular vacancy far more public attention than usual .Knowing the American people are somberly watching , Senate Republicans declined to play political games with this nomination .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.2796"}
