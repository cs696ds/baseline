{"text": "Suggestions for future research .Paternal postpartum depression has only been studied by a small number of researchers , so it is not surprising that there is a long list of questions yet to be addressed .Because the existing studies focus heavily on Caucasian , middle - class , married fathers , we have a serious lack of understanding about depression of fathers of different cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds .It is important to identify at - risk groups of fathers for paternal PPD , such as fathers with lower incomes , fathers of very young or old age , or ethnic minority background .It is also important to study fathers in non - traditional settings , such as stay - at - home fathers , nonbiological fathers ( e.g. , stepfathers ) or single fathers , in order to understand unique risk factors that may increase the risk for paternal PPD .Furthermore , we need to further investigate risk factors not only in fathers but also in their families , such as physical or mental health status with their partner or infant .Besides the homogeneous samples in paternal PPD studies , the single time point observation limits our understanding of the long - term effects of postpartum depression .Because the experience of fathers changes in the course of the first postpartum year , we need a prospective study , with multiple sampling points , that allows follow - up of fathers at risk starting from their partners ' pregnancies .The study would provide much information about the developmental course of paternal postpartum depression .Longitudinal studies would help us understand the long - term effects of paternal PPD on fathers ' lives as well as on their families , including development of their children .Conducting international and cross - cultural studies would determine if there are similarities and differences in paternal PPD in different cultures and countries .It would provide us with a better picture to develop more accurate diagnostic tools and treatment programs for fathers with different backgrounds .Most of the studies on paternal PPD have been done by using self - report questionnaires .Studies on hormonal and physiological changes during the postpartum period among fathers would provide information on biological factors of depression and biological mechanisms of father - infant attachment .In addition , brain imaging studies of paternal PPD will enrich our understanding of different brain circuits and neurohormonal systems that govern the processes of parenting in health and , in particular , among fathers with PPD .Contributor Information .Pilyoung Kim , Ms. Kim is from the Department of Human Development , Cornell University , Ithaca , New York ; .James E.

{"text": "So , it is easy to see how a sex hormone imbalance can affect multiple aspects of sexuality , with a domino - like effect .In men , one of the first signs of a testosterone deficiency is a diminished libido , which can lead to problems with sexual function and fulfillment , which then further compounds the problem because these are often tied to a man 's sense of overall well - being and self - worth .In this way , sexual problems can contribute to mental or emotional problems ( such as a damaged self - esteem , moodiness , and depression ) , which can further compound the sexual problems , and without treatment the cycle continues .How Does Estrogen Affect Testosterone ?The effects of testosterone are further complicated by its relationship to another sex hormone - estrogen , especially estradiol .As discussed earlier , the yin - yang balance between the estrogen hormones and testosterone is key for both men and women ; together , they define our sexuality .Fortunately , the human body is amazingly adept at converting what it has to what it needs .In the male body , an abundant supply of testosterone combines with a plentiful enzyme called aromatase to produce estrogen when and where it is needed .Dr. Shippen believes that \" men 's bodies would not have a process for making estrogen if it were useless to them . \"He identifies many estrogen - sensitive areas of the male body , including the brain , and explains that estrogen is an extremely important aspect of the brain chemistry that triggers natural sexual functions .He states , \" Too little estrogen will neuter a man just as effectively as too little testosterone . \"However , for most adult men , the problem is not too little estrogen , but too much !A primary cause of hormone imbalance in men as they age is that testosterone is increasingly converted to estrogen , resulting in an excess of estradiol .Life Extension recommends that men maintain estradiol levels between 21.8 and 30.1 pg / mL. Similar to how women react to minute amounts of testosterone , men have a very small window of optimum effectiveness when it comes to estrogen .Because the estrogen derived from aromatase actually displaces testosterone at the receptor sites , it has the effect of \" turning off \" testosterone - driven activities or regulating the force of those actions .In this way , estrogen and testosterone exist in a delicate yin - yang balance .Estrogen is necessary to complete the whole , but it also keeps testosterone in check .While men need estrogen to make sexuality possible , it is also the complementary off switch .Unfortunately , that switch can get stuck in the off position .As Shippen puts it , \" Like so many things that work well when we are young , the control mechanism aspect of estrogen can get out of hand as we grow older .Illness , drugs , dietary imbalances , lifestyle , and certain aspects of normal aging help accelerate this process and raise estrogen levels to unhealthy heights . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.525024"}

{"text": "In 2000 , Anne Storey and colleagues published a study showing that expectant fathers had higher testosterone late in their partners ' pregnancies compared to new fathers shortly after their infants were born .In 2009 , we published our first article on testosterone and fatherhood in the Cebu Study that was the focus of the recent PNAS article .Consistent with findings in these other societies , we found that fathers in committed relationships had lower testosterone than single non - fathers .We also showed that fathers who reported being a primary caregiver to their children had low testosterone , especially in the evening , compared to fathers who did not consider themselves one of their child 's primary childcare providers .Thus , many biologists and anthropologists , including our research team , have assumed for some time that fatherhood likely lowers a man 's testosterone levels , as many of the past studies suggested that men likely conform to the pattern seen in other species with paternal care .However , this evidence , although fascinating , did not allow definitive conclusions to be reached about whether fatherhood reduced a man 's testosterone levels .This was because these studies were \" cross - sectional \" , meaning that they only measured fatherhood status and hormones as a single snapshot during one visit and interview .Had the act of becoming fathers reduced these men 's testosterone ?Or alternatively , were the men who had low testosterone to begin with simply more likely to have become fathers ?Both scenarios could explain these findings equally well , and so the matter remained unsettled .What we found in our new study .As noted above , when we first measured testosterone among the men in our study in 2005 we found that fathers had lower testosterone levels than the men who were single at that time .What makes our new study unique is that we measured these same men a second time about 5 years later .Importantly , because the men were quite young , many of them became fathers for the first time during this 5 year period , which allowed us to test whether new fathers experienced a greater drop in their hormone levels compared to men who remained single and childless .We found that the single men who ended up being partnered fathers 5 years later had higher testosterone when the study began .This is important , because it allowed us to rule out the other possible interpretation of our data - that men with low testosterone were simply more likely to become fathers .That was clearly not the case in our sample .We also found that , once these men became fathers , their testosterone levels went down substantially , and more dramatically than other groups of men .In fact , most of the men in the sample experienced some decline in testosterone during this 5 year period .Testosterone levels tend to peak in early adulthood and then gradually decline with age , so this was expected .But the new fathers experienced much greater declines than would be expected based upon age alone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.81041"}

{"text": "Although there are very few available studies that have evaluated the effects of testosterone on fathering behaviors , there is preliminary evidence that lower testosterone can sensitize men to being more involved as caregivers .As we noted above , in our study we found that fathers who reported being involved in childcare had the lowest levels of evening testosterone .Perhaps more compelling evidence is reported by a study which showed that fathers with lower testosterone expressed greater sympathy towards , and a need to respond to , infant cries .Similarly , a recent study , released just this week , found that men 's testosterone decreased when they heard recorded infant cries , but only if they felt a need to nurture the upset infant .In a separate study examining hormonal changes during father - toddler interaction , Dr. Anne Storey and colleagues concluded that \" ... low baseline testosterone levels or greater testosterone decreases are associated with men being more responsive or attentive to their toddlers . \" Much more research will be needed to clarify the possible effects of lower testosterone on men 's abilities to perform as effective caregivers .However , as we see above , there is at least preliminary evidence that having high testosterone can focus a male 's attentions and energies on social activities , while low testosterone appears to improve the attention and care that men provide their own young .Both point to the potential benefits of reducing levels of the hormone as social duties shift with the onset of fatherhood .What is the cause of the decline in testosterone among fathers ?In our study we found that fathers who reported spending the most time ( 3 or more hours each day ) with their offspring had lower testosterone levels compared to other fathers who reported spending no time caring for their young .Here once again it is difficult to know what is \" cause \" and what is \" effect \" : does childcare reduce a father 's testosterone , or were fathers with lower testosterone simply more inclined to be involved caregivers ?The short answer is that we can not say for sure , but we do have some hints .Our best guess is that not only did fatherhood lead to a decline in testosterone , but interacting with a child , or some correlate of time spent with a child , influenced how far the levels dipped once men became fathers .Let us explain how we reached this tentative conclusion .Researchers had previously speculated that providing direct care might lead testosterone levels to drop in new fathers .For instance , in a study in Senegal , fathers who showed greater investment in their children , including hands - on childcare , had lower testosterone than fathers who were reported to be less invested .Similarly , another fascinating study looked at testosterone levels in fathers in two cultural groups in Tanzania .Testosterone was only lower among the fathers in the cultural group in which fathers are expected to be involved in offspring care - in the second group , among whom fathers typically are not involved caregivers , fathers did not have lower testosterone than non - fathers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.59497"}

{"text": "Testosterone thus has exciting therapeutic potential in the treatment of depression in men .Testosterone and Aging .We know that many of the degenerative diseases of aging in men such as Type II diabetes , osteoporosis , and cardiovascular disease are related to a testosterone deficiency .We also know that common characteristics of middle - age and older age such as depression , abdominal fat deposition , muscle atrophy , low energy , and cognitive decline are also associated with less than optimal levels of free testosterone .A consistent pattern that deals with fundamental aging shows that low testosterone causes excess production of a dangerous hormone called cortisol .Some anti - aging experts call cortisol a \" death hormone \" because of the multiple degenerative effects it produces such as immune dysfunction , brain cell injury , arterial wall damage , etc . .A group of scientists conducted two double - blind studies where they administered supplemental testosterone to groups of aging men and observed the typical responses of lower levels of cholesterol , glucose and triglycerides , reductions in blood pressure , and decreased abdominal fat mass .These scientists then showed that excess cortisol suppressed testosterone and growth hormone production and that the administration of testosterone acted as a \" shield \" against the over - production of cortisol in the adrenal gland .It is important to point out that testosterone is an anabolic ( or protein building ) hormone while cortisol is a catabolic hormone that breaks down proteins in the body .Normal aging consists of a progressive decrease in free testosterone with a marked increase in cortisol .As men age past 40 , cortisol begins to dominate , and the catabolic effects associated with growing older begin to dominate .These findings have significant implications in the battle to maintain youthful hormone balance for the purpose of staving off normal aging and its associated degenerative diseases .The Testosterone Doctor .Eugene Shippen , M.D. , authored a book in 1998 called The Testosterone Syndrome .He was a speaker at the American Academy of Anti - Aging Medicine Conference held in December 1998 where he provided extensive evidence documenting the pathology of the testosterone deficiency syndrome in men .Here are some excerpts from Dr. Shippen 's presentation that appeared in the March 1999 issue of Life Extension Magazine : .First , Testosterone is not just a \" sex hormone .\" It should be seen as a \" total body hormone , \" affecting every cell in the body .The changes seen in aging , such as the loss of lean body mass , the decline in energy , strength , and stamina , unexplained depression , and decrease in sexual sensation and performance , are all directly related to testosterone deficiency .Degenerative diseases such as heart disease , stroke , diabetes , arthritis , osteoporosis , and hypertension are all directly or indirectly linked to testosterone decline .( 220 - 223 )Secondly , testosterone functions also as a prohormone .( 99 ) Local tissue conversion to estrogens , dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) , or other active metabolites plays an important part in cellular physiology .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.080635"}

{"text": "One report showed that estrogen levels of the average 54-year - old man is higher than those of the average 59-year - old women .While there are studies showing that testosterone replacement therapy does not increase estrogen beyond normal reference ranges , we are going to show later how the standard laboratory reference ranges do not adequately address the issue of estrogen overload .Estrogen is a necessary hormone for men , but too much causes a wide range of health problems .The most dangerous acute effect of excess estrogen and too little testosterone is an increased risk of heart attack or stroke .( 39 - 43 , 261 - 270 ) High levels of estrogen have been implicated as a cause of benign prostatic hypertrophy ( BPH ) ( 35 - 44,46,47 ) and one mechanism by which nettle extract works is to block the binding of growth - stimulating estrogen to prostate cells .When there is too little testosterone present , estrogen attaches to testosterone cell receptor sites throughout the body and creates many problems in aging men .In youth , low amounts of estrogen are used to turn off the powerful cell - stimulating effects of testosterone .As estrogen levels increase with age , testosterone cell stimulation may be locked in the \" off \" position , thus reducing sexual arousal and sensation and causing the common loss of libido so common in aging men .High serum levels of estrogen also trick the brain into thinking that enough testosterone is being produced , thereby slowing down the natural production of testosterone .This happens when estrogen saturates testosterone receptors in the hypothalamus region of the brain .The saturated hypothalamus then stops sending out a hormone to the pituitary gland to stimulate secretion of luteinizing hormone , which the gonads require to produce testosterone .High estrogen can thus shut down the normal testicular production of testosterone .One further complication of excess estrogen is that it increases the body 's production of sex hormone - binding globulin ( SHBG ) .( 280 ) SHBG binds free testosterone in the blood and makes it unavailable to cell receptor sites .Based on the multiple deleterious effects of excess estrogen in men , aggressive actions should be taken to reduce estrogen to a safe range if a blood test reveals elevated levels .We will discuss the appropriate blood tests and steps that can be taken to lower estrogen levels later in this protocol .The Critical Importance of Free Testosterone .Testosterone is much more than a sex hormone .There are testosterone receptor sites in cells throughout the body , most notably in the brain and heart .( 60 , 180 ) Youthful protein synthesis for maintaining muscle mass and bone formation requires testosterone .( 59,61 - 74 , 87 - 90,261 - 264,287 ) Testosterone improves oxygen uptake throughout the body , helps control blood sugar , ( 68,75 - 78 - 80 ) regulate cholesterol , ( 67,69,81 ) and maintain immune surveillance .( 82,83 )The body requires testosterone to maintain youthful cardiac output and neurological function .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.465336"}
{"text": "While there have not been studies done examining families with two depressed parents , maternal postpartum depression has been linked to adverse emotional and behavioral effects in boys and girls , while the paternal condition appears to adversely affect behavior in boys .Whatever be the case , it is clear that postpartum depression is not the sole provenance of new mothers , and increasing awareness is opening up a world of treatment options to help men be better fathers .If you suspect that you or your partner is suffering from depression , seek the advice of a mental health professional .Abstract .Background .There are limited data on the parenting stress ( PS ) levels in sub - Saharan African mothers and on the association between ante- and postnatal depression and anxiety on PS .Methods .A longitudinal birth cohort of 577 women from Ghana and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was followed from the 3 rd trimester in pregnancy to 2 years postpartum between 2010 and 2013 .Depression and anxiety were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire depression module ( PHQ-9 ) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD-7 ) at baseline , 3 month , 12 month and 24 month postpartum .PS was measured using the Parenting Stress Index - Short Form ( PSI - SF ) at 3 , 12 and 24 month .The mean total PS score and the subscale scores were compared among depressed vs. non - depressed and among anxious vs. non - anxious mothers at 3 , 12 and 24 month postpartum .A generalized estimating equation ( GEE ) approach was used to estimate population - averaged associations between women 's depression / anxiety and PS adjusting for age , child sex , women 's anemia , education , occupation , spouse 's education , and number of sick child visits .Results .At all three time points , the PS scores were significantly higher among depressed mothers vs. non - depressed mothers .In the multivariate regression analyses , antepartum and postpartum depression were consistently associated with PS after adjusting for other variables .Conclusions .Parenting stress is frequent and levels are high compared with previous studies from high - income countries .Antepartum and postpartum depression were both associated with PS , while antepartum and postpartum anxiety were not after adjusting for confounders .More quantitative and qualitative data are needed in sub - Saharan African populations to assess the burden of PS and understand associated mechanisms .Should our findings be replicated , it appears prudent to design and subsequently evaluate intervention strategies .Keywords .Africa Children Mothers Parenting stress Depression Perinatal Antepartum Post - partum Pregnancy Generalized estimating equation .Background .Becoming a mother and caring for an infant is both a joyful experience and a challenging and stressful one , with stress levels usually lessening as mothers gain confidence with their parenting abilities [ 1 ] .Parenting stress ( PS ) refers to specific difficulties in adjusting to the parenting role and arises when demands associated with parenting can not be met by perceived resources [ 2 ] .PS has been associated with a range of negative outcomes , including less sensitive caregiver - child interaction , aversive and coercive disciplinary strategies , and increased risk of family dysfunction and child maltreatment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.58039"}

Paulson , of Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk , who was not involved in the study .While postpartum depression is now widely recognized , there has been some debate about whether women actually are more likely to develop depression soon after giving birth than they are at any other time , said Paulson , who has studied depression in both new mothers and fathers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.640076"}

{"text": "Personality differences between men , and cultural variation in social norms , can modify the relationships between hormones and behaviors like these .But the general assumption among many anthropologists who study the role of hormones in human fatherhood is that these behaviors represent time investments that would likely detract from a man 's ability to be an effective and attentive father and caregiver .Although there are very few available studies that have evaluated the effects of testosterone on fathering behaviors , there is preliminary evidence that lower testosterone can sensitize men to being more involved as caregivers .As we noted above , in our study we found that fathers who reported being involved in childcare had the lowest levels of evening testosterone .Perhaps more compelling evidence is reported by a study which showed that fathers with lower testosterone expressed greater sympathy towards , and a need to respond to , infant cries .Similarly , a recent study , released just this week , found that men 's testosterone decreased when they heard recorded infant cries , but only if they felt a need to nurture the upset infant .In a separate study examining hormonal changes during father - toddler interaction , Dr. Anne Storey and colleagues concluded that \" ... low baseline testosterone levels or greater testosterone decreases are associated with men being more responsive or attentive to their toddlers . \" Much more research will be needed to clarify the possible effects of lower testosterone on men 's abilities to perform as effective caregivers .However , as we see above , there is at least preliminary evidence that having high testosterone can focus a male 's attentions and energies on social activities , while low testosterone appears to improve the attention and care that men provide their own young .Both point to the potential benefits of reducing levels of the hormone as social duties shift with the onset of fatherhood .What is the cause of the decline in testosterone among fathers ?In our study we found that fathers who reported spending the most time ( 3 or more hours each day ) with their offspring had lower testosterone levels compared to other fathers who reported spending no time caring for their young .Here once again it is difficult to know what is \" cause \" and what is \" effect \" : does childcare reduce a father 's testosterone , or were fathers with lower testosterone simply more inclined to be involved caregivers ?The short answer is that we can not say for sure , but we do have some hints .Our best guess is that not only did fatherhood lead to a decline in testosterone , but interacting with a child , or some correlate of time spent with a child , influenced how far the levels dipped once men became fathers .Let us explain how we reached this tentative conclusion .Researchers had previously speculated that providing direct care might lead testosterone levels to drop in new fathers .For instance , in a study in Senegal , fathers who showed greater investment in their children , including hands - on childcare , had lower testosterone than fathers who were reported to be less invested .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.87596"}

{"text": "Too Much Estrogen .The most significant hormone imbalance in aging men is a decrease in free testosterone while estrogen levels remain the same or precipitously increase .Through a variety of mechanisms , as men grow older , they suffer from the dual effects of having too little testosterone and excess estrogen .The result is a testosterone / estrogen imbalance that directly causes many of the debilitating health problems associated with normal aging .One cause of hormone imbalance in men is that their testosterone is increasingly converted to estrogen .One report showed that estrogen levels of the average 54-year - old man is higher than those of the average 59-year - old women .While there are studies showing that testosterone replacement therapy does not increase estrogen beyond normal reference ranges , we are going to show later how the standard laboratory reference ranges do not adequately address the issue of estrogen overload .Estrogen is a necessary hormone for men , but too much causes a wide range of health problems .The most dangerous acute effect of excess estrogen and too little testosterone is an increased risk of heart attack or stroke .( 39 - 43 , 261 - 270 ) High levels of estrogen have been implicated as a cause of benign prostatic hypertrophy ( BPH ) ( 35 - 44,46,47 ) and one mechanism by which nettle extract works is to block the binding of growth - stimulating estrogen to prostate cells .When there is too little testosterone present , estrogen attaches to testosterone cell receptor sites throughout the body and creates many problems in aging men .In youth , low amounts of estrogen are used to turn off the powerful cell - stimulating effects of testosterone .As estrogen levels increase with age , testosterone cell stimulation may be locked in the \" off \" position , thus reducing sexual arousal and sensation and causing the common loss of libido so common in aging men .High serum levels of estrogen also trick the brain into thinking that enough testosterone is being produced , thereby slowing down the natural production of testosterone .This happens when estrogen saturates testosterone receptors in the hypothalamus region of the brain .The saturated hypothalamus then stops sending out a hormone to the pituitary gland to stimulate secretion of luteinizing hormone , which the gonads require to produce testosterone .High estrogen can thus shut down the normal testicular production of testosterone .One further complication of excess estrogen is that it increases the body 's production of sex hormone - binding globulin ( SHBG ) .( 280 ) SHBG binds free testosterone in the blood and makes it unavailable to cell receptor sites .Based on the multiple deleterious effects of excess estrogen in men , aggressive actions should be taken to reduce estrogen to a safe range if a blood test reveals elevated levels .We will discuss the appropriate blood tests and steps that can be taken to lower estrogen levels later in this protocol .The Critical Importance of Free Testosterone .Testosterone is much more than a sex hormone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.05301"}

{"text": "In a prospective longitudinal study of 82 parents , the course of early preoccupations has been shown to peak around the time of delivery .41Although fathers and mothers displayed a similar time course , the degree of preoccupation was significantly less for fathers .For example , at two weeks after delivery , mothers of normal infants , on average , reported spending nearly 14 hours per day focused exclusively on the infant , while father reported spending approximately half that amount of time .The mental content of these preoccupations includes thoughts of reciprocity and unity with the infant , as well as thoughts about the perfection of the infant .Further , 73 percent of mothers and 66 percent of fathers reported having the thought that their baby was ' perfect ' at three months of age .41 These idealizing thoughts may be especially important in the establishment of psychological resiliency and the perception of self - efficacy during this time of stress and reorganized priorities .As such , their absence may be an indication of problematic early bonding .These parental preoccupations also include anxious , intrusive thoughts about the infant .In the few studies done so far , it was found that 95 percent of mothers and 80 percent of fathers experienced recurrent thoughts about the possibility of something bad happening to their babies at eight months of gestation .In the weeks following delivery , this percentage declined only slightly to 80 and 73 percent for mothers and fathers , respectively , and at three months these figures were unchanged .41 , 42 After delivery and on returning home , most frequently cited concerns related to feeding the baby , the baby 's crying , adequacy as a new parent , and baby 's wellbeing .41 Such thoughts are more commonly reported among parents of very sick preterm infants , infants with serious congenital disorders or malformations , or infants with serious birth complications .41 Parents also endorse fantasies or worries that they may in some way inadvertently harm their infant , for example , by dropping the baby in a time of exhaustion or frustration or even ignoring or injuring the baby .Perhaps these intrusive thoughts of injuring the child can beset some at - risk new fathers and lead to postpartum obsessive compulsive disorder and/or depression .Indeed , depression and anxiety during the postpartum year can also be correlated with OCD .Typical symptoms of postpartum OCD include intrusive thoughts ( such as harming their infant ) and/or compulsive behaviors ( such as checking babies ) .43 In the literature on maternal postpartum depression , 41 percent of mothers with major depression reported unwanted intrusive thoughts of harming their infant , compared to only seven percent of nondepressed mothers .44Although Abramowitz and his colleagues 45 did not find a significant association between severity of intrusions and depressive symptoms among fathers , it might be that such disturbing thoughts are not easily disclosed and need to be asked directly .In the same study , around 45 percent of men reported worries about whether their babies would be suffocated , around 25 percent of men reported worries about doing intentional harm to babies , and around three percent of the men reported worries about losing their babies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.290295"}

Phillips at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons discovered the answer while conducting a cross - sectional study of 55 men who were undergoing coronary angiography .At the time of the angiography , none of these men had ever had a heart attack or stroke .When serum testosterone levels from these men were analyzed , they revealed that as testosterone levels decreased , the degree of arterial occlusion increased .Phillips observed that low testosterone levels were associated with several risk factors for heart attack such as high insulin levels , abnormal glucose metabolism , low levels of HDL cholesterol and high blood pressure .Moreover , he further proposed that the converse was also true : testosterone protects against heart disease in men .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.394005"}

{"text": "Thus , many biologists and anthropologists , including our research team , have assumed for some time that fatherhood likely lowers a man 's testosterone levels , as many of the past studies suggested that men likely conform to the pattern seen in other species with paternal care .However , this evidence , although fascinating , did not allow definitive conclusions to be reached about whether fatherhood reduced a man 's testosterone levels .This was because these studies were \" cross - sectional \" , meaning that they only measured fatherhood status and hormones as a single snapshot during one visit and interview .Had the act of becoming fathers reduced these men 's testosterone ?Or alternatively , were the men who had low testosterone to begin with simply more likely to have become fathers ?Both scenarios could explain these findings equally well , and so the matter remained unsettled .What we found in our new study .As noted above , when we first measured testosterone among the men in our study in 2005 we found that fathers had lower testosterone levels than the men who were single at that time .What makes our new study unique is that we measured these same men a second time about 5 years later .Importantly , because the men were quite young , many of them became fathers for the first time during this 5 year period , which allowed us to test whether new fathers experienced a greater drop in their hormone levels compared to men who remained single and childless .We found that the single men who ended up being partnered fathers 5 years later had higher testosterone when the study began .This is important , because it allowed us to rule out the other possible interpretation of our data - that men with low testosterone were simply more likely to become fathers .That was clearly not the case in our sample .We also found that , once these men became fathers , their testosterone levels went down substantially , and more dramatically than other groups of men .In fact , most of the men in the sample experienced some decline in testosterone during this 5 year period .Testosterone levels tend to peak in early adulthood and then gradually decline with age , so this was expected .But the new fathers experienced much greater declines than would be expected based upon age alone .Because researchers had previously speculated that the act of providing direct care of offspring might cause a decline in testosterone ( see for instance here and here ) , we made sure to ask men in 2009 about the amount time they spent in childcare each day .We found that men who reported spending more time in childcare also had the lowest testosterone levels in 2009 , which provided additional support for this hypothesis .There were other nuances to our findings , some of which we were surprised to see .For instance , although all fathers as a group had comparatively greater drops in their testosterone across the 5 years of the study , the hormonal drop was much larger among men who had newborn babies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.6616"}

{"text": "Mothers are n't the only ones who are biologically adapted to respond to children .New research from the University of Notre Dame shows that dads who sleep near their children experience a drop in testosterone .Previous research from humans and other species suggests this decrease might make men more responsive to their children 's needs and help them focus on the demands of parenthood .In a recent study , Notre Dame Anthropologist Lee Gettler shows that close sleep proximity between fathers and their children ( on the same sleeping surface ) results in lower testosterone compared to fathers who sleep alone .The study will appear in the September 5 issue of the journal PLoS ONE .Fathers ' testosterone levels were measured from saliva samples collected upon waking and again just prior to sleep .Though the waking hormone levels of the three groups showed no significant differences , fathers who slept on the same surface as their children showed the lowest evening testosterone .\" Human fathers ' physiology has the capacity to respond to children , \" Gettler says .\" Our prior research has shown that when men become fathers , their testosterone decreases , sometimes dramatically , and that those who spend the most time in hands - on care -- playing with their children , feeding them or reading to them -- had lower testosterone .These new results complement the original research by taking it one step further , showing that nighttime closeness or proximity between fathers and their kids has effects on men 's biology , and it appears to be independent of what they are doing during the day . \"In other species , testosterone is known to enhance male mating effort through its influence on muscle mass and behaviors related to competing with other males and attracting female attention .The hormone is thought to operate similarly in humans , and higher testosterone has been linked to behaviors that might conflict with effective fathering , such as risk taking and sensation seeking .Prior research found that men with lower testosterone reported greater sympathy or need to respond to infant cries relative to men with higher testosterone .\" There are so many intriguing possibilities here for future research : Why do fathers have lower testosterone when they sleep very close to their children ?Does it reflect human fathers ' roles in our evolutionary past ?How much do fathers vary in their nighttime care when their kids are close by ?How does co - sleeping change fathers ' sleep architecture when we know that co - sleeping increases mothers ' arousals and mothers sync to their infants ' sleep patterns , \" says Gettler .\" Testosterone is a hormone that frequently is a part of public discourse , but the false idea that ' manliness ' is exclusively driven by testosterone often dominates the conversation .There is growing evidence that men 's physiology can respond to involved parenthood -- something that was long thought to be limited to women .This suggests to us that active fatherhood has a deep history in the human species and our ancestors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.86831"}

Abstract .Background .Studies of prenatal exposure to sex steroid hormones predict autistic traits in children at 18 to 24 and at 96 months of age .However , it is not known whether postnatal exposure to these hormones has a similar effect .This study compares prenatal and postnatal sex steroid hormone levels in relation to autistic traits in 18 to 24-month - old children .Saliva samples were collected from these children when they reached three to four months of age and were analyzed for postnatal testosterone ( pT ) levels .Mothers were asked to complete the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers ( Q - CHAT ) , a measure of autistic traits in children 18 to 24 months old .Finding .fT ( but not pT ) levels were positively associated with scores on the Q - CHAT .fE and pT levels showed no sex differences and no relationships with fT levels .fT levels were the only variable that predicted Q - CHAT scores .Conclusions .These preliminary findings are consistent with the hypothesis that prenatal ( but not postnatal ) androgen exposure , coinciding with the critical period for sexual differentiation of the brain , is associated with the development of autistic traits in 18 to 24 month old toddlers .However , it is recognized that further work with a larger sample population is needed before the effects of postnatal androgen exposure on autistic traits can be ruled out .These results are also in line with the fetal androgen theory of autism , which suggests that prenatal , organizational effects of androgen hormones influence the development of autistic traits in later life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.183586"}

{"text": "The major concern that has kept men from restoring their testosterone to youthful levels is fear of prostate cancer .The theory is that since most prostate cancer cell lines need testosterone to proliferate , it is better to not replace the testosterone that is lost with aging .The problem with this theory is that most men who contract prostate cancer have low levels of testosterone and the majority of published studies show that serum testosterone levels do not affect one 's risk for contracting prostate cancer .Since the perception is so strong that any augmentation of testosterone can increase the risk of prostate cancer , we did a MEDLINE search on all the published studies relating to serum testosterone and prostate cancer .The appendix at the end of this article provides quotations from the published literature as it relates to the issue of whether testosterone causes prostate disease .Out of 27 MEDLINE studies we found , five indicated that men with higher testosterone levels had a greater incidence of prostate cancer , whereas 21 studies showed that testosterone was not a risk factor .One study was considered neutral .The score was therefore : .Before anyone starts a testosterone replacement program , they should have a serum PSA test and a digital rectal exam to rule out prostate cancer .Nothing is risk free .A small minority of men with low testosterone and prostate cancer will not have an elevated PSA or palpable lesion detectable by digital rectal exam .If these men use supplemental testosterone , they risk an acute flare up in their disease state .That is why PSA monitoring is so important every 30 - 45 days during the first 6 months of any type of testosterone augmentation therapy .If an underlying prostate cancer is detected because of testosterone therapy , it is usually treatable with non - surgical means .We acknowledge that some aging men will not want to take this risk .As stated above , the MEDLINE score was 21 to 5 against the theory that testosterone plays a role in the development of prostate cancer .None of these studies took into account the prostate cancer prevention effects of men who take lycopene , selenium , and vitamins A and E.

{"text": "A Perspective on Male Hormones : The Yin - Yang of Estrogen and Testosterone .Everyone knows that testosterone is the essence of maleness .It is what makes men feel better , look better , and perform better- both physically and sexually .But most people would be surprised to learn that estrogen also plays a key role in men 's sexuality , and is essential to their cardiovascular and circulatory health , as well as their muscle mass and bone strength .Just as women need a small amount of testosterone , men need a small amount of estrogen .The ancient Chinese concept of yin - yang , where two seemingly opposite things complement each other to make a whole , depicts this delicate hormone balance that affects not only our physical and emotional well - being , but our sexual health as well .What Does Testosterone Do ?Before we go any further with how estrogen and testosterone complement each other , let 's review the various functions of testosterone in men 's health .Testosterone 's effects can be grouped into two categories : androgenic and anabolic .Androgenic refers to the masculinizing or virilizing effects , including the growth of facial and body hair , sex organ development , deepening of the voice , and male pattern baldness .The anabolic effects are those that stimulate the growth of muscle , bone , and red blood cells .The male body systems affected by testosterone include the brain , voice , hair , muscles and fat , organs , bones , and libido ( see figure below ) .The effects of testosterone on these body systems differ during each stage of life .During fetal development , testosterone and its metabolite , dihydrotestosterone or DHT , are necessary for the formation of the internal and external male genitalia .During puberty , testosterone triggers a deepening of the voice , prompts the growth of facial and body hair , stimulates sexual behavior , and initiates sperm production .In adult males , testosterone is necessary to maintain muscle mass and strength , bone mass , normal hair growth , libido , and sperm production .What is \" Normal \" ?The \" normal \" range of testosterone levels is quite broad , which is one of the reasons why an excess or deficiency is difficult to detect .The average adult male has somewhere between 260 and 1,000 nanograms ( ng ) of testosterone per deciliter ( dl ) of blood plasma .For comparison , the range for women is approximately 50 to 70 ng / dl .While some reference ranges consider male testosterone levels as low as 193 ng / dL to be considered adequate , Life Extension recommends a \" moderately youthful \" range of between 700 and 900 ng / dL. Each person 's body chemistry is different , such that a person whose testosterone level is at the low end of the range may still have what is needed for development .On the other hand , someone whose testosterone level is at the high end of the range may still have a slight deficiency with respect to his ( or her ) \" normal \" level .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.30895"}

{"text": "40 This may include the usual thoughts and activities that contribute to mental health .In a prospective longitudinal study of 82 parents , the course of early preoccupations has been shown to peak around the time of delivery .41Although fathers and mothers displayed a similar time course , the degree of preoccupation was significantly less for fathers .For example , at two weeks after delivery , mothers of normal infants , on average , reported spending nearly 14 hours per day focused exclusively on the infant , while father reported spending approximately half that amount of time .The mental content of these preoccupations includes thoughts of reciprocity and unity with the infant , as well as thoughts about the perfection of the infant .Further , 73 percent of mothers and 66 percent of fathers reported having the thought that their baby was ' perfect ' at three months of age .41 These idealizing thoughts may be especially important in the establishment of psychological resiliency and the perception of self - efficacy during this time of stress and reorganized priorities .As such , their absence may be an indication of problematic early bonding .These parental preoccupations also include anxious , intrusive thoughts about the infant .In the few studies done so far , it was found that 95 percent of mothers and 80 percent of fathers experienced recurrent thoughts about the possibility of something bad happening to their babies at eight months of gestation .In the weeks following delivery , this percentage declined only slightly to 80 and 73 percent for mothers and fathers , respectively , and at three months these figures were unchanged .41 , 42 After delivery and on returning home , most frequently cited concerns related to feeding the baby , the baby 's crying , adequacy as a new parent , and baby 's wellbeing .41 Such thoughts are more commonly reported among parents of very sick preterm infants , infants with serious congenital disorders or malformations , or infants with serious birth complications .41 Parents also endorse fantasies or worries that they may in some way inadvertently harm their infant , for example , by dropping the baby in a time of exhaustion or frustration or even ignoring or injuring the baby .Perhaps these intrusive thoughts of injuring the child can beset some at - risk new fathers and lead to postpartum obsessive compulsive disorder and/or depression .Indeed , depression and anxiety during the postpartum year can also be correlated with OCD .Typical symptoms of postpartum OCD include intrusive thoughts ( such as harming their infant ) and/or compulsive behaviors ( such as checking babies ) .43 In the literature on maternal postpartum depression , 41 percent of mothers with major depression reported unwanted intrusive thoughts of harming their infant , compared to only seven percent of nondepressed mothers .44Although Abramowitz and his colleagues 45 did not find a significant association between severity of intrusions and depressive symptoms among fathers , it might be that such disturbing thoughts are not easily disclosed and need to be asked directly .In the same study , around 45 percent of men reported worries about whether their babies would be suffocated , around 25 percent of men reported worries about doing intentional harm to babies , and around three percent of the men reported worries about losing their babies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.2612"}

Phillips at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons discovered the answer while conducting a cross - sectional study of 55 men who were undergoing coronary angiography .At the time of the angiography , none of these men had ever had a heart attack or stroke .When serum testosterone levels from these men were analyzed , they revealed that as testosterone levels decreased , the degree of arterial occlusion increased .Phillips observed that low testosterone levels were associated with several risk factors for heart attack such as high insulin levels , abnormal glucose metabolism , low levels of HDL cholesterol and high blood pressure .Moreover , he further proposed that the converse was also true : testosterone protects against heart disease in men .The research continues .Since Dr. Phillips published his findings , an enormous body of research has gone on to confirm the cardiovascular benefits of testosterone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.55888"}

{"text": "Cognitive and motor impulsivity emerged from stepwise multiple regression analysis as the most important predictors of self - reported aggression , explaining significant proportions of variance at different time points .These results generally do not offer support to the hypothesis that supraphysiological levels of T lead to increased self and partner reported aggression .The role of testosterone in competitive aggression is still open to debate in humans .An important problem is the difficulty of finding adequate behavioral measures .In fact , it has been repeatedly claimed that a main challenge for this topic of research is identifying social situations which permit the study of the role of testosterone in overt behavior comparable to investigation carried out in other species .Sports competitions present several important opportunities to analyse behavior associated with high competitiveness .In particular , contact sports have an especialpropensity to develop into aggressive behavior .With this in mind , the relationships between testosterone levels measured before and after a judo combat and the behaviour displayed during the combat itself were examined .An observational scale was designed from activities usually shown by fighters in judo contests .This scale grouped a number of different elements toform seven behavioural categories that covered the entire period studied .These were threat , fighting , domination , attack / counterattack , defense , observation and stop .Positive correlations were found between offensive behaviours displayed in this kind of competition and testosterone .Furthermore , this relationship supports previous data indicating an association of testosterone with involvement and anger displayed during judo contests as assessed by the coaches .Sports competitions appear to be socially accepted situations that may be used to obtain information about behavior / hormone relationships in our own species .IS-5.4-PULSATING CORTICOSTERONE SECRETION IN MALE RATS : FAST EFFECTS ON AGGRESSIVENESS .Ultradian fluctuations in plasma corticosterone have been demonstrated in monkeys and humans .It has been recently shown that corticosterone secretion pulsates in female rats and an attempt was made to assess whether levels also fluctuate in male rats .The amplitude of oscillations was similar with that reported for females but the period was larger in males ( a phenomenon perhaps related to the shorter corticosterone half - life in females ) .Male rats were studied in aggressive encounters lasting only 5 min to reduce interference from fight - induced stress reactions .Male rats were significantly more aggressive in the increasing phase of their corticosterone fluctuation when confronting a male intruder than counterparts in the decreasing phase of their corticosterone fluctuations facing such opponents .Corticosterone fluctuations were artificially mimicked by a combination of treatments with the corticosterone synthesis inhibitor metyrapone and corticosterone .Again , males with increasing plasma corticosterone levels were more aggressive than counterparts with a decreasing plasma corticosterone concentration .It appears that ultradian fluctuations in corticosterone affect the propensity of an animal to behave aggressively .This suggests that the behavioural response to an aggressive challenge may vary in the same animal across the day due to the pulsating nature of corticosterone secretion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.33167"}

{"text": "The other benefits of testosterone .While the relationship between youthful levels of testosterone and a healthy cardiovascular system can not be denied , it is far from the end of the story .Research has slowly started to uncover many of the hidden benefits of testosterone , such as its effect on bone growth and stability , depression , obesity and libido .Osteoporosis .Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease characterized by the serious loss of bone mass and microdisintegration resulting in an increased risk of fracture .Although more commonly associated with post - menopausal women , osteoporosis affects more than five million men in the United States each year .Without a doubt , low testosterone is one of the major causes of osteoporosis in aging men .Researchers in Germany have recently published a report estimating that 50 % of all bone fractures in males over 60 years old is a result of osteoporosis induced by low testosterone levels .31 Complementing that report , researchers in France studying the relationship between testosterone and male osteoporosis have found that by age 80 , as much as 20 % of the bone mass density of males was lost in part due to the lower levels of testosterone .The mechanism behind testosterone 's effect on bone mass and stability was the recent topic of study for a group of Canadian researchers .According to their report , low levels of testosterone indirectly diminished bone mass by extending the longevity , generation and activity of bone - destroying osteoclast cells .The explanation for this is simply that testosterone is an inhibitor of osteoclast function .Lowering the testosterone level removes this inhibitory effect and allows osteoclasts to resorb ( breakdown ) bone .This study suggests that by maintaining youthful levels of testosterone , osteoclast ( bone degrading ) activity and the subsequent loss of bone mass can be reduced .This effect of testosterone on osteoclast activity is also of vital importance in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer .Such patients have biochemical evidence of immediate bone loss .The severity of this problem has led to the use of drugs that inactivate the osteoclast ; these are called bisphosphonates .Common examples of oral bisphosphonates are Fosamax and Actonel , and of intravenous bisphosphonates are Aredia and Zometa .33 When bisphosphonates are given , osteoclast activity is inhibited and bone formation is favored .It is important that such patients receive bone supplements such as Bone Assure to allow for healthy bone formation .Depression .A consistent finding in the scientific literature is that depression is frequently associated with low levels of testosterone .34 However , because practicing physicians often have only a basic understanding of testosterone deficiency , many patients suffering from its effects are misdiagnosed .Furthermore , because of the misplaced stigma associated with testosterone , psychiatrists rarely consider testosterone replacement therapy as a viable course of treatment .Unfortunately for the patient , a common side effect of prescription antidepressants is a suppressed libido .Those suffering from depression must then choose between this drug - induced reaction and a normal sex life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.33795"}

( 135 - 144 ) Nor did they factor in possible prostate disease preventives such as saw palmetto , nettle , soy , and pygeum .In Dr. Jonathan Wright 's book , Maximize Your Vitality and Potency , a persuasive case is made that testosterone and DHEA actually protect against the development of both benign and malignant prostate disease .Dr. Wright also points out that natural therapies such as saw palmetto , nettle , and pygeum provide a considerable degree of protection against the alleged negative effects that higher levels of testosterone might have on the prostate gland .We eagerly await the results of more studies , but the fear of developing prostate cancer in the future should not be a reason to deprive your body today of the life - saving and life - enhancing benefits of restoring a youthful balance .Once a man has prostate cancer , testosterone therapy can not be recommended because most prostate cancer cells use testosterone as a growth promoter .This regrettably denies prostate cancer patients the wonderful benefits of testosterone therapy .Men with severe BPH should cautiously approach testosterone replacement .It would be prudent for those with BPH who are taking testosterone replacement therapy to also use the drug Proscar ( finasteride ) to inhibit 5- alpha - reductase levels , thereby suppressing the formation of dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) .( 171 - 182 ) DHT is ten times more potent than testosterone in promoting prostate growth , and suppressing DHT is a proven therapy in treating benign prostate enlargement .Saw palmetto extract suppresses some DHT in the prostate gland , but its effectiveness in alleviating symptoms of BPH probably has more to do with : .Its blocking of alpha - adrenergic receptor sites on the sphincter muscle surrounding the urethra .( This is how the drug Hytrin works . )Its inhibition of estrogen binding to prostate cells ( like nettle ) .Its inhibition the enzyme 3-ketosteroid ( that causes the binding of DHT to prostate cells ) .Its anti - inflammatory effect on the prostate .It is unfortunate that many people still think that restoring testosterone to youthful levels will increase the risk of prostate disease .This misconception has kept many men from availing themselves to this life - enhancing and life - saving hormone .While it is clear that excess estrogen causes benign prostate enlargement , the evidence for excess estrogen 's role in the development of prostate cancer is uncertain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.729706"}

{"text": "As the new Pope Celestine V , Morrone lacked the assertiveness of his predecessor and soon became a pawn of King Charles II .Unsuited for the job , he abdicated the papacy after four short months .But the next pope , Boniface VIII , so feared Celestine 's popularity that he hunted him down and threw him in jail where , 10 months later , he died .High levels of testosterone , meanwhile , might explain why Boniface went to such extremes to put Celestine in his place .When Josephs arrived on the endocrine scene in the late 1990s , the research connecting sex hormones and human behavior was contradictory .A strong connection had been shown in many animal species .But human experiments found no consistent connection and experts theorized that our developed prefrontal cortex simply overrode messages the sex hormones sent to the midbrain .Josephs soon demonstrated that humans are hardly exempt from the passions of other animals - those passions are just more complex .As with Celestine and Boniface , testosterone plays out differently depending upon whether an individual is driven by status or prefers a more modest leadership role .Men motivated by the quest for power have higher baseline levels of testosterone - and the more they feel threatened , the higher their testosterone ( and their aggression ) .One study , for instance , tracks testosterone after loss of a game .Baseline testosterone drops , it turns out , only in those who do n't much care about dominance or whether they win or lose .These less - competitive players start out with modest testosterone levels and after a loss , their levels fall .But in those with high - baseline testosterone - typically of competitive mindset - the levels soar . \"High - T men react to a loss as if in the throes of testosterone addiction -the more testosterone climbs , the more testosterone they crave , and they can get more only by challenging the winner and playing again , \" Josephs explains .He found the rule applied not just to competition in sports or games , but also to competition for mates .In one study , Josephs paired male college students and sent them into a room with an attractive female confederate .Each was to try to woo her , doing whatever it took .Students with high testosterone routinely slammed the other man , making fun , putting him down , refusing to laugh at his jokes .Josephs also found that high - testosterone men communicate stress to their dogs .In a study of pet owners who had entered their dogs in a contest of agility , high - T men experienced surging testosterone after a loss .They yelled at or shoved their dogs .Josephs compares the phenomenon to injecting steroids .\" If you put testosterone in muscle fibers they will fire more frequently , \" he says .\" The more they fire the more you 'll be able to punch , and the more you punch the more testosterone you need . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.40839"}

{"text": "While the Reggie Perrin stereotype is richly comic , it is n't difficult to see that in real - life cases such drastic behaviour may be motivated by deeper issues that are all too serious .Many of us are aware of feelings of disillusionment and irritability setting in in middle age , attributable perhaps to a heightened sense of our own mortality and/or feelings of dissatisfaction at the way life has turned out .Very often such gloomy insights are brought on by a specific trigger : a redundancy or divorce , perhaps , or a more trivial event like a milestone birthday .In a society which puts a particularly high value on youth , and sidelines older people , it 's difficult for many people to move smoothly into their middle years .Men reaching mid - life may feel a loss of masculinity and confusion about their future role .Divorce , insecurity at work and the changing role of men add to the uncertainty many feel during this time of transition .Many men find the changes in sexual function which come with getting older unsettling .Suddenly , you ca n't do it three times a night any more , it 's harder to get an erection .Is this the start of the slippery slope ?And where will it end ?By middle age , men may have achieved most of their realistic goals and be unclear about their future direction .Relationships may also change , and are often adversely affected , especially when children leave the parental home .Men are better educated , healthier and likely to live longer when they enter mid - life than at any time in the past .This can lead to a greater degree of reflection , and often , introspection , on what has happened during the first part of life and what the future holds .Sleep may be another factor .According to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association , mid - life crises may be linked with a growing inability to sleep deeply .Men in their 30s and 40s sleep far more patchily and lightly than in younger years - even when they sleep the same number of hours as before .By the age of 45 , according to the report , few manage deep sleep at all , leading them to grow fatter and more unfit because they cease to generate growth hormone .Physical causes .Some doctors argue that the crisis of confidence and the unpleasant mid - life symptoms some men experience are not primarily psychological in origin .While there may be common psychological problems arising as a reaction to life events and the consequences of getting older , they argue for the existence of a \" male menopause \" involving hormonal changes in the body , analogous to the female menopause .In fact , it may be possible that some men have to go through both a psychological crisis AND a hormonal one !The very phrase \" male menopause \" is misleading , however , since menopause strictly refers to the cessation of menstruation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.73517"}

Phillips at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons discovered the answer while conducting a cross - sectional study of 55 men who were undergoing coronary angiography .At the time of the angiography , none of these men had ever had a heart attack or stroke .When serum testosterone levels from these men were analyzed , they revealed that as testosterone levels decreased , the degree of arterial occlusion increased .Phillips observed that low testosterone levels were associated with several risk factors for heart attack such as high insulin levels , abnormal glucose metabolism , low levels of HDL cholesterol and high blood pressure .Moreover , he further proposed that the converse was also true : testosterone protects against heart disease in men .The research continues .Since Dr. Phillips published his findings , an enormous body of research has gone on to confirm the cardiovascular benefits of testosterone .In one of the most comprehensive studies , researchers in the Netherlands evaluated the effect of low levels of testosterone in elderly men .Known as the Rotterdam Study , this population - based investigation examined the relationship between total and bio - available testosterone with aortic atherosclerosis among 1,032 nonsmoking men and women aged 55 years and over .For six years , baseline data on the subjects was collected and evaluated and upon final examination , researchers concluded that men with the lowest levels of total and bio - available testosterone had the highest risk for severe aortic atherosclerosis .Conversely , men with the highest levels of both total and bio - available testosterone were protected against atherosclerosis .25 These results confirmed Dr. Phillips ' finding that low serum testosterone is correlated with increased heart disease .With a clear link between atherosclerosis and low levels of testosterone established , researchers have expanded their scope to examine the other cardiovascular benefits of this hormone .For example , recent studies have revealed that testosterone improves insulin sensitivity in healthy men , suggesting a role in preventing Type II diabetes .26 Other studies have found that in men with angina , supplemental testosterone therapy not only clinically improves symptoms but also reduces objective measurements of ischemia ( impaired blood flow ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.862564"}

{"text": "As most studies assessed PS when the children were older , a comparison of mean values with our sample may not be reasonable .The high initial PS scores that we observed in the mothers may be partially explained by phase - specific insecure feelings about parenting , perceived lack of caregiving skills and confidence while confronting the infant 's needs and her difficult or ambiguous signals [ 53 ] .Although we did not investigate attitudes towards childbearing , our observed high levels of perceived maternal PS may be linked to the high proportion of unintended pregnancies occurring in sub - Saharan Africa .Safe birth control can be difficult to access or may be avoided by the women for a variety of reasons [ 56 , 57 ] .Unintended pregnancies may put strain on maternal role assumption and mother - infant relationships [ 58 , 59 ] .According to our longitudinal data , the trajectory of PS from 3 months to 24 months postpartum revealed a clear decline over time in Ghana .Mean scores two years post birth were consistent with those in a sample of disadvantaged single African American mothers of preschool children [ 49 ] .However , scores remained at a high mean level throughout the investigation in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire .Since the Ivorian women experienced a severe political crisis and acute threat of harm due to armed conflict and displacement during the assessment period , these mothers were likely to perceive higher distress , which may have also affected their parenting capacities .In our sample , Parental Distress made the largest contribution to mean general PS scores in both countries , while Parent - Child Dysfunctional Interaction scores contributed less .This result is consistent with findings from a South - African population of HIV - positive children [ 14 ] and implies that in our sample , parental role requirements and contextual conditions were perceived as more burdensome than the relationship with the child as such .Parental Distress and Parent - Child Dysfunctional Interaction resolved with time in Ghana , but not in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire .Interestingly , scores on the Difficult Child subscale , which represents parental interpretation of basic behavioral characteristics of the children , kept constant and at a similar level in the two countries .Means were high , even in relation to studies on infants and toddlers with biological risks or from disadvantaged backgrounds in high - income countries [ 49 , 51 ] .This may imply that the mothers ' perception of their children as being difficult and demanding do not only reflect stable traits of temperament in their offspring , but also normative cultural expectations of obedience and adaptability to parental authority [ 64 ] .In Western surveys , small children reported as being more difficult have been found to receive less responsive mothering , putting them at increased developmental risk [ 5 , 65 ] , while this link has not yet been established for African populations .As hypothesized , we found that antepartum and postpartum depression were associated with PS , while antepartum and postpartum anxiety were not after adjusting for confounders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.43733"}

{"text": "The researchers wanted to know if there was any rhyme or reason to these country - by - country differences .They recruited 2,842 women , average age 26 , from 13 countries .Most of the women completed the study online , with the exception of a group from rural Cameroon .Other nations represented included the United States , the United Kingdom , Finland , Latvia , Russia , Poland , South Africa , Estonia , Japan , Mexico , Sweden and Namibia .The women all saw two sets of four composite images of Caucasian men who had been digitally manipulated to show facial features signaling different levels of testosterone and cortisol .The women simply rated each man 's attractiveness .The researchers then compared the Human Development Index of each country , a measurement involving average life expectancy , education and income .They found that these economic and social factors influenced which faces women found hot .In low - development countries , women preferred higher - testosterone faces .In these societies , women who liked these macho faces were also more likely to rate high - cortisol faces as attractive .In high - development countries , such as the United States , women preferred less testosterone and less cortisol .Stress and masculinity .The study had some limitations , particularly the inclusion of only Caucasian men to rate , Moore said .But the interaction between testosterone and cortisol in low - development countries suggests the need to control for or include the stress hormone in research on hormonal cues , she said .Moore and her colleagues reported their findings Tuesday ( March 26 ) in the journal Biology Letters .Women may find high - testosterone men more appealing in countries where survival is tougher and the need for good genes more crucial , Moore said .In low - development countries , losing a mate to infection is less likely , so choosing a committed , non - aggressive partner may be more important than picking one based on health .Testosterone ( and hormones in general ) often have more complex effects on behavior than stereotypes would suggest .The macho hormone , for example , has been linked to greater acceptance of safe sex , even though common sense might suggest that manly guys would be bigger risk - takers .Testosterone dips during fatherhood , possibly in response to a need to nurture a baby rather than sow wild oats , but the sound of a crying infant can send the hormone spiking .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.82622"}

{"text": "Then the participants read a message suggesting that catharsis really did work .( It claimed that engaging in aggressive action is a good way to relax and reduce anger . )At this point half of the participants were allowed to engage in a cathartic behavior - they were given boxing gloves , some instructions about boxing , and then got a chance to hit a punching bag for two minutes .Then all the participants got a chance to engage in aggression with the same person who had angered them earlier .The participant and the partner played a game in which the losing person on each trial received a blast of noise .Contrary to the catharsis hypothesis , the students who punched the punching bag did not release and reduce their aggression as the message they had read suggested would happen .Rather , these students actually set a higher noise level and delivered longer bursts of noise than did the participants who did not get a chance to hit the punching bag .Bushman , B.

{"text": "For Chinese women in the countryside , where the majority of Chinese live , it is 30 per 100,000 .Michael Phillips , an associate professor of social medicine at Harvard Medical School and head of research at Beijing Hui Long Guan Hospital , studies this discrepancy .He explains Americans assume that virtually everyone who commits suicide has a mental illness .He argues that in China , this is not the case , and the society views suicide as \" normal . \"20 He suggests \" support groups for rural women ... and expanded services for mental health \" as ways to combat the problem.21 .Those women \" have less information and less knowledge about how to seek help , \" he said.23 .Because rural Chinese women lack social support , mental health services and awareness of mental illness , they are not only at risk for suicide , but also for postpartum depression and other mental illnesses .Previous depression , often a predictor of suicide , is also a contributing factor of postpartum depression .A lack of resources to prevent suicide is also a lack of resources to prevent mental illnesses .Isolation is not only a rural problem .Even in cities , urbanization has led to \" social isolation and lack of support from the family , \" according to Esther S. Lee Yao , a historian who wrote Chinese Women : Past & Present .She claimed that \" the imbalance between a rapidly changing society and the slowly growing progressive attitude of women toward their family role \" has meant that \" Chinese housewives are . . .confronted with the same kinds of emotional shock experienced by women in other advanced nations . \"24 In China , urbanization has weakened traditional familial support networks.25 .Both Chinese and American women face the denial and stigmatization of mental illness .The Chinese have traditionally ignored the idea of mental disease , according to He . \"Chinese usually think that psychological problems are shameful to mention , \" she said.26 Psychological problems may not only be shameful to the Chinese , but they may not even be recognized .In fact , in China , no word distinguishes \" depression \" from \" sadness . \" A World Health Organization survey published in 2004 found that 2.5 percent of Chinese reported a mood disorder in the previous year , compared with 9.6 percent of Americans.29 .Over the years , the Chinese have had political reasons to deny the country 's mental health problems .Norman Sartorius , former director of the World Health Organization 's mental - health program , pointed out that the Chinese and other Asians have tended to regard depression as something that plagued other places , but not their own countries .\" It 's a problem of the West , \" he said of the way the argument is characterized .\" The Americans have depression .The English have depression .It 's their disease . \" 32 Officials at the Chinese Psychiatrists ' Association say that China has 17,000 certified psychiatrists , one - tenth the number in developed countries , in proportion to the population .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.96237"}
{"text": "[ Show abstract ] [ Hide abstract ] ABSTRACT : Background : Polyvictimization , experiencing multiple forms of victimization ( e.g. , intimate partner violence ( IPV ) , family violence , peer violence , stranger violence ) , has been strongly associated with mental health problems among adolescents .However , very little research has examined the impact of polyvictimization on sexual health .The current study examined patterns of polyvictimization for females and males ; and their association with sexual risk and psychosocial outcomes .During baseline interviews , participants provided data on victimization , sexual risk , and psychosocial outcomes .Results : Latent class analyses showed three - class models for both females and males .Females ' classes were : No Violence ; Stranger Violence / Prior IPV ; and Prior IPV / Peer Violence ; while , males ' classes were : No Violence ; Prior IPV ; and High Polyvictimization .Conclusions : Polyvictimization impacts the sexual health of adolescents .It may be useful for HIV / STI interventions to identify and address experiences of polyvictimization among adolescent couples .[ Show abstract ] [ Hide abstract ] ABSTRACT : Young expecting parents face a great deal of challenges as they transition into parenthood .This paper sought to identify racial and gender differences in the relationship between general discrimination , neighborhood problems , neighborhood cohesion , and social support on the depressive and stress symptoms among young expecting couples .Results indicated perceived general discrimination and less social support was associated with increased stress and depression .More neighborhood problems were related to increased depression and more neighborhood cohesion was related to less stress .Moderator analyses showed that the influence of general discrimination and stress was stronger for women than men .In addition , neighborhood cohesion was protective on stress for Blacks and Whites but not for Hispanics .These results indicate the need to address the broader social context for young expectant couples .[ Show abstract ] [ Hide abstract ] ABSTRACT : Background : Psychoeducational interventions , tested for efficacy in randomized clinical trials , are seldom implemented in clinical practice where cancer survivors and their family caregivers can benefit from them .Objective : This study examined the effectiveness of the FOCUS Program on cancer survivors ' and their family caregivers ' outcomes when implemented at a Cancer Support Community ( CSC ) affiliate by agency social workers .Study aims were to ( 1 ) test effects of the program on survivor and caregiver outcomes as a unit and ( 2 ) determine program feasibility in terms of enrollment , retention , intervention fidelity , and satisfaction .Methods : A preintervention and postintervention pilot effectiveness study was conducted with 34 cancer survivor - caregiver dyads ( ie , pairs ) .The FOCUS Program , originally delivered by nurses in dyads ' homes , was modified to a small - group format and delivered by CSC social workers .The primary outcome was quality of life ( QOL ) .Intermediary outcomes were benefits of illness / caregiving , communication , support , and self - efficacy .Analyses included repeated - measures analysis of variance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.51917"}

{"text": "Yet the impact is nuanced and often counterintuitive .Testosterone revs aggression in status - hungry men , but has little effect in more laid - back souls .Estrogen has long been thought to keep memory sharp before menopause - but for women who start taking estrogen supplements years after going through menopause , the result may be memory problems instead .Finally , just as sex hormones influence behavior , changing situations often modulate the hormones .\" The causal arrow between hormones and behavior points in both directions , \" says University of Nevada anthropologist Peter Gray .The subject is complex and often confusing .But given the common manipulation of sex hormones through prescription drugs and supplements , unraveling their hidden forces has never been more critical .A humble priest renowned for his wisdom , Peter Morrone wanted nothing more than to live out his days in the hermetic monastery near his home in Italy .But his dream came crashing down when he was tapped to succeed Pope Nicholas IV in 1294 .As the new Pope Celestine V , Morrone lacked the assertiveness of his predecessor and soon became a pawn of King Charles II .Unsuited for the job , he abdicated the papacy after four short months .But the next pope , Boniface VIII , so feared Celestine 's popularity that he hunted him down and threw him in jail where , 10 months later , he died .High levels of testosterone , meanwhile , might explain why Boniface went to such extremes to put Celestine in his place .When Josephs arrived on the endocrine scene in the late 1990s , the research connecting sex hormones and human behavior was contradictory .A strong connection had been shown in many animal species .But human experiments found no consistent connection and experts theorized that our developed prefrontal cortex simply overrode messages the sex hormones sent to the midbrain .Josephs soon demonstrated that humans are hardly exempt from the passions of other animals - those passions are just more complex .As with Celestine and Boniface , testosterone plays out differently depending upon whether an individual is driven by status or prefers a more modest leadership role .Men motivated by the quest for power have higher baseline levels of testosterone - and the more they feel threatened , the higher their testosterone ( and their aggression ) .One study , for instance , tracks testosterone after loss of a game .Baseline testosterone drops , it turns out , only in those who do n't much care about dominance or whether they win or lose .These less - competitive players start out with modest testosterone levels and after a loss , their levels fall .But in those with high - baseline testosterone - typically of competitive mindset - the levels soar . \"High - T men react to a loss as if in the throes of testosterone addiction -the more testosterone climbs , the more testosterone they crave , and they can get more only by challenging the winner and playing again , \" Josephs explains .He found the rule applied not just to competition in sports or games , but also to competition for mates .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.324646"}

All rights reserved .News Categories .News by Colleges Arts Business & Economics Communications Education Engineering & Computer Science Health & Human Development Humanities & Social Sciences Natural Sciences & Mathematics .Researchers Predict Southern California to Face Ongoing Freshwater Challenges .Southern California faces a perennial freshwater availability crisis , according to a newly published study by researchers at California State University , Fullerton and the University of Southern California .To place the region 's modern and future water challenges into context , the researchers and their students looked to the bottom of Lake Elsinore , which contains a thick sequence of sediments deposited over hundreds of thousands of years .Kirby and his student team extracted sediment cores dating back 33,000 years .\" This core represents the highest resolution , deglacial record - 19,000 to 9,000 years - from Southern California , \" he noted .The authors used a variety of sediment - based analyses , such as hydrogen isotopes from leaf waxes and the size of the sediment particles , to determine past water availability .\" The waxy molecules from plant leaves record the isotopic composition of rainfall and shifting storm tracks through time , \" said Sarah J. Feakins , assistant professor of Earth sciences at the USC Dornsife College of Letters , Arts and Sciences who collaborated with Kirby on the study .\" We found that Southern California was wetter during the last glacial ; it probably would have seemed more like Seattle today .\" The researchers are interested particularly in this period in Earth 's climate history because of its \" well - documented large amplitude and abrupt climatic changes , \" noted Kirby .According to the researchers , Southern California was wetter during the last glacial period , experiencing more frequent , North Pacific - sourced winter storms .As the Earth 's climate transitioned from the glacial into the present interglacial period , the frequency of winter storms decreased , along with a change in their dominant source to more sub - tropical .As the frequency and source of winter storms changed , so , too , did San Jacinto River runoff into Lake Elsinore , the researchers found .Grain size data suggest that Lake Elsinore experienced two abrupt decreases in water availability 14,600 and 12,900 years ago .These abrupt changes in water availability occurred in less than 70 years each , according to their findings .\" Perhaps most striking is that the pattern of hydrologic change across the deglacial is not the same between Southern California and the interior southwest United States , \" Kirby said .For Southern California , the pattern follows changes in the concentration of greenhouse gases and the size of North America 's ice sheets .For the interior southwest United States , which includes Arizona and New Mexico , the pattern of deglaciation is related more to changes in oceanic circulation in the North Atlantic .By comparison , the authors conclude that climate models that consider Southern California geographically a part of the interior Southwest , as most do , may not predict accurately how future water availability in Southern California will change over the next century .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.325775"}

Taylor and Ian M. Ehrenreich found that the effects of these genetic variants can depend on four or more other variants in an individual 's genome .Most genetic analyses of heritable physical characteristics , including genome - wide association studies in human populations , focus on so - called \" additive \" variants that have effects that occur regardless of the organism 's genetic background .Taylor and Ehrenreich , however , found that higher - order interactions of five or more places along the genome can have major impacts , and may help explain the so - called \" missing heritability \" problem , in which additive genetic variants do not entirely explain many inherited diseases and traits .\" Studies focused only on additive effects often explain just a fraction of the genetic basis of many traits .The question is , what are we missing ? \" said Ehrenreich , assistant professor of molecular biology at the USC Dornsife College of Letters , Arts and Sciences , and corresponding author of a paper on the study that was published by PLOS Genetics .An alternative view of Taylor and Ehrenreich 's findings is that genetic variants that have the potential to cause major changes in an organism 's phenotype can be completely canceled out if they occur in the \" wrong \" genomic background .\" It 's exciting to provide a characterized example of how genetic background can influence the effects of mutations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.99948"}

M. , & Duntley , J. D. ( Eds . )The evolution of aggression .Madison , CT : Psychosocial Press .Under the right situation , almost all of us will aggress .However , just because we can aggress does not mean that we will .It is not necessarily evolutionarily adaptive to aggress in all situations .For one , aggressing can be costly if the other person aggresses back .Therefore neither people nor animals are always aggressive .Rather , they use aggression only when they feel that they absolutely need to ( Berkowitz , 1993 ) .Berkowitz , L. ( 1993 ) .Aggression : Its causes , consequences and control .New York , NY : McGraw - Hill .In animals , the fight - or - flight response to threat leads them sometimes to attack and sometimes to flee the situation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "122.591515"}
{"text": "Then Daddy brings her to school , helps her get into her indoor shoes and put away her lunch , helps her choose her activities during free time , and heads into work .So we snuggle some more .I ask , \" What do you want for breakfast ? \"She names the local restaurant we go to on the weekends .\" It 's a weekday , honey , you have school soon . \"She said , more forcefully this time , that she wants to go out to breakfast .Hoping to win back her love , I say , \" How about I make you French toast this morning ? \"\" With the sprinkles .\" She is referring to the dusting of powdered sugar that comes with it at the restaurant .\" How about just syrup ?You do n't need both . \"\" With sprinkles !\" I sigh .This is our one morning together during the week .I want it to be a good one .\" Okay , \" I say .I forget to make the beds , almost forget to get her teeth brushed , have to avert several outfit disasters , and forget to call Daddy .Thankfully Daddy calls us , and we chat for a few minutes while the kiddo eats her French toast and glass of warm milk .Then I barely get her to school on time due to a power play about who gets to buckle her up , do n't know how to help her with choices for free time , and only barely manage to get her sneakers off .Parenting , caring for offspring , and the work - life balance are issues usually relegated to women .There are many men who take care of their kids , and increasingly men in the US and other countries who invest at least as much or more than mothers , but these men are considered both outliers and , often , heroes .The biological imperative to parent , and the reproductive burden , is supposed to fall squarely on women , and it is only our wonderful cultural sensitivity broadening that perspective more recently .What if there were a biological imperative to be a loving father ?Or what if being a father was good for you ?Over the last decade or so , biological anthropologists have studied the biology of mating , partnering and fatherhood of men ( e.g. , Burnham et al .2003 ; Gettler et al .2011b ; Gray et al .2002 ; Gray et al .2004 ) .As it turns out , these different periods of men 's lives have distinct hormonal milieus , just like the reproductive states of women like fecund , pregnant , breastfeeding and grandmothering .When men are seeking mating opportunities , testosterone is high to support mating behavior , muscle anabolism , and the other secondary sexual characteristics that allow a man to display his good genes .When men are partnered in long - term relationships or become parents , testosterone often declines .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "123.03549"}
