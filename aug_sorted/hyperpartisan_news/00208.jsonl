Romney still thinks states should take the lead in addressing disasters .But no , he would n't shutter FEMA .And that raises the more interesting question : Why not ?Even as Romney and the GOP condemn government spending , why does federal emergency relief remain a sacred cow for conservatives and liberals alike ?When Herbert Hoover made his famous trip to flood - ravaged Mississippi in 1927 , as secretary of Commerce , he called on state governments and charities - not Uncle Sam - to provide emergency assistance .Even after he ascended to the White House , facing the worst economic crisis in US history , Hoover continued to reject federal relief to struggling localities and individuals .The stopgap measures he implemented late in his term were considered by many - especially voters - to be too little , too late .After Franklin D. Roosevelt defeated Hoover , his New Deal unleashed massive federal spending for public works , farm aid , and much else .Not surprisingly , then , Roosevelt also presided over the first coordinated federal disaster relief .In 1935 , he sent thousands of unemployed World War I veterans to Florida to help clean up after a hurricane ; more than 200 of them died while doing so .But direct assistance to affected individuals came much more slowly .In 1950 , Congress passed a measure allowing presidents to authorize disaster - related spending on pubic facilities .Yet individuals could n't apply for federal aid until the 1969 Disaster Relief Act , passed in the wake of hurricane Camille , which offered temporary housing , unemployment compensation , and small business loans to victims of the tragedy .Alas , Camille 's most impoverished victims rarely received such aid .Applicants for housing trailers had to show they owned a property lot , while loan seekers needed to put up collateral .Meanwhile , complicated paperwork rules made it nearly impossible for African - Americans - the poorest and least - educated hurricane victims - to receive aid .Of 617 small - business loans issued after Camille in Mississippi , which had the highest percentage of black citizens of any state , just 21 went to non - whites .Similar reports led President Jimmy Carter to press for the creation of FEMA , which Congress established in 1979 .But under Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush , the agency became \" a dumping ground for political hacks , \" as a House committee reported in 1993 .To direct it , Bush had appointed a close friend of his chief of staff with no direct experience in emergency relief .The next Bush president put FEMA in the hands of Michael D.
