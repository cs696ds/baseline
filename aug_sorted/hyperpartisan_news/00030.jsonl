{"text": "Referendums are often regarded as conservative devices designed to frustrate progressive initiatives , especially where constitutional change is concerned .In the case of Wales , however , the three referendums of 1979 , 1997 and 2011 had the opposite effect .The experience of living through them had a galvanising impact on the Welsh people .It changed their view of themselves and their country .It made them more Welsh in outlook and identity and more willing to contemplate radical constitutional options .In short , the referendums accelerated Welsh progress towards autonomy .Of course , the 1979 referendum was instigated by those opposed to devolution , and it resulted in a heavy four - to - one defeat for the Welsh Assembly proposed at that time .Yet the overall outcome was to precipitate events and unleash forces that radically changed Welsh society .In the decade following 1979 these events and political and economic forces came together to underpin the emergence of a Welsh political nation .In turn , and within less than two decades this provided the basis for a constitutional advance .Again , the 1997 referendum in Wales was certainly not sought by those advocating constitutional change .Instead , it was a by - product of a decision made in 1996 by Labour 's Opposition leader Tony Blair in response to a problem he had in Scotland .The promise of a referendum was needed there to remove from the agenda of the forthcoming British general election the tax varying powers being proposed for the Scottish Parliament .And if a referendum was necessary for Scottish devolution , it followed that one had to be held in Wales as well .This is an extract from a new IWA paper Accelerating History - the 1979 , 1997 and 2011 referendums in Wales , published today and available here .Although the referendum was not sought in Wales , its impact in September 1997 was profound .It ensured , for instance , that when the National Assembly for Wales was established in 1999 it was elected using a partial form of proportional representation , sufficient to prevent overweening Labour dominance and to ensure a new fluidity in Welsh politics .More immediately , the narrowness of the result - with its tiny 6,721 vote majority , out of a million votes cast - made the affair into something of a melodrama .This had the effect of concentrating the minds of the people of Wales .There is no doubt that their attitudes to possible constitutional futures for their country underwent profound changes as a direct result of living through the 1997 referendum .By the time the 2011 referendum approached it was the pro - devolution forces that were seeking it , in order to secure a further powers for the National Assembly .A referendum was the central feature of the One Wales coalition agreement negotiated between Labour and Plaid Cymru in the wake of the 2007 Assembly election .The prospect of a referendum was contained in the 2006 Wales Act .This stated that one would be needed to give the National Assembly direct legislative powers over the functions for which it was responsible , from education and health to economic development , the environment and rural affairs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.3841"}

{"text": "The same law of unintended consequences applies to the changing role of the civil service .The traditional job of civil servants in Britain 's constitutional order was to provide their political superiors with advice , support , sceptical warnings where necessary and the semblance of an institutional memory where possible .They did this under conditions of more or less complete public anonymity .The job of governments , meanwhile , was to get things done and to carry the can when they went wrong .The British constitution was always marked by a strong notion of political accountability , in that the price politicians in government paid for their considerable discretionary powers was direct exposure to the full weight of public disapproval whenever the public needed someone to blame .We could always kick the bastards out if we wanted to , and more important , we always knew who the bastards were - the government of the day .Recognising this , and accepting it , recent governments have questioned whether they are best served by civil servants who merely advise , when they could have civil servants who actually deliver .One of the biggest recent shifts in British politics has been the move , greatly accelerated under New Labour , from seeing civil servants as mandarins to seeing them as managers .If politicians are ultimately accountable to a restless and easily disgruntled electorate , they want civil servants who produce results , not ones who ask difficult questions .Yet the consequence is that it is much harder to know who is responsible for what .If delivery is what civil servants are for , then failure to deliver can be laid at their door too , and if necessary ( particularly if necessary for a government minister 's survival ) , names can be named .Of course , many civil servants hate their newfound exposure to public scrutiny , but enough of them relish it , and thrive on it , to ensure that there are winners as well as losers .The secret , for civil servants as well as politicians , is to be a safe pair of hands without getting caught holding the ball - not so much power without responsibility , as delivery without fingerprints .This dispersal of responsibility through the system , like the increasing role for judicial oversight , suggests that the prevailing trend in government is not all towards centralisation , as is sometimes imagined .Of course , some aspects of government are being relentlessly centralised .Local authorities have been divested of most of the powers they once had : to raise revenue , to decide what to spend it on , and to decide whether they were getting value for money .A series of central government innovations - from the Audit Commission ( 1982 ) to the Best Value Inspection Service ( 1999 ) - have made sure that it is someone else who decides whether local government is offering value for money .Meanwhile , the Local Government Act of 1999 empowered ministers to intervene in the affairs of local councils , and to stop them straying into areas of which ministers did not approve .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.70662"}

{"text": "Misunderstandings about the Singapore Constitution .The outcome was not in the least bit surprising to me .The Constitution is quite clear -- the President has no discretion on clemency applications , but is instead required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet .To my mind , this judgment is entirely correct in law .Understanding this better requires a little trip back in legal history .Singapore started off with a constitutional presidency -- the President was the head of state , but was a nominal one and was really a ceremonial post .This was consistent with Singapore being a parliamentary democracy in the Westminster tradition , where executive power lay wholly with the elected government of the day .If you will , the President was the republic 's equivalent to the constitutional monarchy in the UK ( i.e. the Queen of England ) .Under this approach , the President ( just like the Queen ) has no discretion and must act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet .A constitutional crisis ensues if the President fails or declines for any reason to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet .But this changed with the Elected Presidency amendments in 1991 .They introduced a hybrid approach whereby the President was to be elected , with some veto powers over executive decisions .These veto powers may be exercised by the President in his / her sole discretion , i.e. the President does not need to follow the advice of the Cabinet on such matters .But on all matters , the President continues to be bound by the advice of the Cabinet .Article 21 of the Singapore Constitution sets out this position .It lists those decisions where the President may use his / her own discretion .All other decisions must be made in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet .It should be clear from Article 21 , that the power to grnat a pardon under Article 22 is one where the President is legally bound to follow the decision of the Cabinet .None of this is actually controversial .When I studied this in law school ( and my graduating class is having our 10-year reunion tomorrow , so this was 12 - 13 years ago ) , this was taught as a straightforward fact and there was no controversy on this .Indeed , even the Wikipedia entry on the President of Singapore ( current last edit being on 18 July 2010 ) correctly correctly describes how the powers of the President may be exercised .I want to be clear that I am talking about the law as it is , i.e. applying a \" positive \" approach to the law here .I am not , in this post , talking about what the law should be ( i.e. applying a \" normative \" approach ) .Finally , I think it has to be said that the courts have been very fair to Yong Vui Kong ever since the appeal process began in earnest .They have given Yong and his lawyer M.

Mill 's ' indispensable requirements ... a readiness to compromise ; a willingness to concede something to opponents and to shape good measures so as to be as little offensive as possible to persons of opposite views .

'The dealers complied , though in fact the Treasurer was telling them to break the law as it stood , comforting them by saying they would not be pursued by the Taxation Office .More blatant contempt for Parliament and interference with a theoretically independent Taxation Office would be difficult to imagine .The Australian Senate has taken effective action to control abuses of legislation by press release , but has not been able to prevent its use .The Australian House of Representatives sits for an average of only about 61 days a year , whereas the UK House of Commons sits for about 170 days , the Canadian for 135 days , and the New Zealand House of Representatives for 95 days .The short sittings in Australia make it almost impossible to give proper consideration to government bills or to provide reasonable time for consideration of private members ' bills .The pressure for the very short sittings in Australia seems to come from two complementary directions : from the backbenchers and from the ministers .Backbenchers want to be in their electorates so they can hold their seats , for their activities in Canberra do not seem to most of them to help much in this regard .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.058426"}

{"text": "For some referenda , it has been claimed that their defeat may have been due in part to their sponsorship in an inappropriate political context .Professor Parker has noted of the 1948 Rents and Prices attempt , that its firm rejection may well have been due to the political times as much as to the specific proposal .By 1948 , the continuation of war - time controls had become an important political issue , with the Liberal and Country Parties calling for the lifting of such controls .In 1949 this became an issue in the Commonwealth election that saw Labor lose office .Parker believes that an attempt by the Commonwealth to gain control over rents and prices , ' clashed too roughly with current attitudes towards \" controls \" ' , and was probably doomed from the start .Similarly , J. C. Finemore , Victorian Parliamentary Counsel , criticised the Whitlam Government 's sponsoring of the 1974 Simultaneous Elections proposal ' at a time when there was a life and death battle between the House of Representatives and the Senate ' .He believed that this ensured the short - term political aspects of the measure , would predominate over any intrinsic merit that it might have had .Parker also asked the question as to why , in a nation apparently so homogenous as Australia , the tallies of referendum votes were not the same in each State .He concluded that there must be different perspectives in the different States , suggesting that the answer to the question must , in part , ' be sought somewhere in State politics ' .Premier John Allan ( CP ) of Victoria was one important opponent of the 1926 changes , a reminder that State Premiers have often been instrumental in leading opposition forces to amendment proposals .This has been the case even when changes are proposed by their own party , as in Allan 's case .In 1944 , the Labor Premiers of New South Wales ( McKell ) and Tasmania ( Cosgrove ) led determined opposition to the Powers amendment proposed by the Curtin Government ( ALP ) .Thirty - three years later , Queensland Premier , Joh Bjelke - Petersen ( NP ) and Western Australian Premier , Charles Court ( LP ) led the successful fight against the Fraser Government 's effort to introduce simultaneous elections .Such cases seem to confirm Parker 's claim concerning the importance of State governments in many referendum defeats .Support for , and opposition to , constitutional referenda is not necessarily limited to political party members .Wildavsky has made the point that on some occasions the explanation for a particular defeat can only be fully appreciated if the activity of other political bodies is understood .In 1926 , for example , the fact that all three parties supported the Industry and Commerce proposal in Parliament clearly left unanswered the question as to why the proposal was defeated .Wildavsky 's analysis noted the importance of many economic groups in the campaign and he came to the conclusion that .The results of the 1926 referendum suggest that group sentiment , while certainly not infallible , was a far more reliable indicator of voting behaviour than Party alignment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.58569"}

{"text": "Interestingly , although a great deal has been written and spoken about Australian constitutional referenda , remarkably little research has been conducted into Australians ' voting behaviour on these occasions .What follows , then , is a brief discussion of the most commonly cited factors that might help us understand the outcomes of s. 128 referenda , but with a marked absence of behavioural data .Among the commentators , the debate is split between those who believe the results reflect Australians ' general awareness and good sense about constitutional matters , opposed by those who speak of voter ignorance and unnecessarily cautious voting behaviour .The truth may lie somewhere between these two points of view .Some writers have criticised the constitutional and legislative arrangements for the holding of constitutional referenda .( 53 )The ' double majority ' has been said to create too high a hurdle , though the figures do not really bear this out .If the double majority had required just half the States - as proposed in 1974-the tally of successes would have been increased by three ( 1946 Primary Produce Marketing and Industrial Employment , plus 1977 Simultaneous Elections ) .If only a national majority had been necessary , to these three would have been added the Air Navigation attempt of 1937 ( the 1984 Simultaneous Elections attempt would have been unnecessary , as this change would have been made in 1977 ) .Against this , however , it seems that a more significant factor has been the difficulty in securing 50 per cent of the national vote for the YES case .( 54 )With more efforts to achieve bipartisan support , it is quite likely that more campaigns would have been able to secure a national YES majority , and thus the double majority would probably have also been achieved in more cases .It does not seem , therefore , that the double majority , of itself , has had a major effect upon constitutional referenda results .Saunders and others have focussed on the ' party political character of constitutional change ' , which is the direct consequence of an amendment procedure which allows only the Commonwealth Government to initiate proposals .Jeffrey Goldsworthy of Monash University has suggested that this partisanship could be lessened if the States had a formal role in the amendment process .Other writers have focussed on the sending of both the YES and a NO arguments to the voters .Professor Richardson has suggested that the printing of the two cases , of equal length , in the same pamphlet , gives the NO case a status it might not have if the votes in parliament are taken as a guide .He noted that an amendment proposal passed by the Parliament is the legal expression of the will of the people , yet this provision does not recognise that legal fact .( 56 ) Professors Colin Howard and Cheryl Saunders have asked whether the totals of the votes in the two houses of parliament ought to be included in the information sent to voters , to make clear the strength of parliamentary support for any measure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.68771"}

{"text": "With government bills , acceptance of the bill and approval of its first reading are automatic , though the debates are sometimes tedious and usurp the role of second reading debates , with much political point scoring .Since 1979 the standing orders of the House of Representatives have required that all government bills ( with the exception of those of a budgetary nature or declared urgent by the government ) be automatically referred to a select committee for further examination .The committee will usually advertise for submissions on the bill from interested individuals and organisations , usually allowing three weeks but frequently longer for the submissions .A program of public hearings will then be arranged .One bill attracted 1200 submissions .Of course others attracted none at all , but even with such bills the public scrutiny is valuable insurance , for an alert individual may be able to detect an unintended ill - consequence in an apparently innocuous bill .Before the introduction of MMP a majority government had the power to declare to be urgent any bill it chose , and the bill could be rushed through the House without consideration by a select committee .Even when a bill was referred to a committee the government , if it wished , could use its majority on that committee to limit the public input .With MMP this is much more difficult .More consultation is required before a bill can be declared urgent , and the government can not expect to have a regular majority on the select committees .The significance of a bill being referred to a committee before its second reading is that it enables the committee to look not only at the details of the bill but also at its principles , and indeed whether it is necessary at all .In New Zealand ( unlike some other parliaments ) the government does not normally attempt to force a committee to rush its consideration of a bill .Having heard all the witnesses it wants , as well as government officials , the committee then starts looking at the detail of the bill , clause by clause , using ordinary parliamentary procedures .A bill is sometimes sent to a committee in a very rough state , leaving it to the committee to tidy it up .An example was the Fisheries Bill of 1995 , on which the committee received 112 submissions , 32 of which requested an appearance before the committee .The committee recommended extensive policy changes as well as re - arrangement of the bill , with the result that only ten of the 370 clauses remained unamended by the committee .The government accepted nearly all of the committee 's recommendations .The downside of giving a bill to a committee in such an undeveloped state is that the amendments it proposes may be incomplete or inconsistent , and in a number of cases resulted in amending legislation being necessary when the act had barely had time to come into effect .For all government bills , the committee has the assistance of a parliamentary counsel in drafting any amendments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.97986"}

'The bill was rejected , and the Speaker , according to his promise , threw it over the table , several members on both sides of the question kicking it as they went out .[54 ] .If it passes the second reading , the bill is examined in detail to see that it achieves the agreed purpose in a clear and efficient manner , and any necessary amendments are made .This stage is usually done by a committee , often consisting of the whole house .The report of this committee is considered by the house , and during this stage further amendments may be made .Finally the bill is given a third reading , which is a chance to look at the bill as it has emerged from the committee and report stages .The debate is confined strictly to the contents of the bill , and is usually a formality .Bills presented to the UK Parliament are divided into three categories : public bills , private bills , and hybrid bills .Public bills deal with subjects of general public interest .Nearly all public bills are government bills , but occasionally an unofficial bill ( one initiated by a private member ) becomes law .In 1998 - 99 , 35 public bills were enacted , which is below the average , which would be about 60 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.81676"}

{"text": "The argument for such grants is that they are needed for urgent or emergency tasks , but the other countries do not seem to need them , and their use is a clear breach of a fundamental principle of responsible government .Australia .Before some reforms were made in 1994 , the Australian House of Representatives was almost totally ineffective as a legislature .It passed an average of 171 government bills a year , almost three times as many as were passed in the UK .Consideration of the detailed wording of bills was perfunctory .Except for a brief experiment , bills were never referred to standing or select committees .The minister in charge could speak for unlimited periods as often as he wanted .To see how ineffective the House of Representatives was as a legislature at this time , it is worth looking at a typical year .In 1971 the House passed 138 bills , but only 34 of them were considered in detail in the committee , the remaining bills simply by - passing this crucial stage .There were two methods by which this was achieved .A procedure adopted in 1963 permitted the House to proceed straight from the second reading to the third reading of the bill , omitting the detailed examination of the bill in the committee .Of course the government would not ask to omit the committee stage if the minister had amendments of his own to move , usually second thoughts from his department or suggestions made by government party backbenchers .A single voice could have insisted on a committee stage for any bill , but none did on 89 bills .Only one opposition amendment was successful during the whole of 1971 .The amendment altered the heading of a schedule to Customs Bill ( No . 2 ) so that it more accurately described the contents of the schedule !Another way to stifle debate on bills was also ruthlessly used .The Australian Parliament sits for only half as many days as do the Canadian and UK parliaments , and it is always a rush to get all the legislation through .The guillotine helps .In the 1971 Parliament the government passed a guillotine motion requiring the passage of twelve bills in six and a half hours , including six bills which were allowed only two minutes each for all stages , which is surely an insult to the parliamentary process .Other national parliaments also use the guillotine , but with nothing like the same ruthlessness .The standing orders of the Canadian House of Commons , for instance , provide for agreements between the parties for time allocations for the stages of a bill .If agreement can not be reached , a minister may move the guillotine , but not less than one sitting day must be provided for each stage of the bill .Things continued very much the same for the next two decades in the Australian Federal Parliament .The Parliament continued to pass an astonishing amount of legislation .The number of bills not considered in detail - that is , for which there were no committee stages - averaged 141 a year , which is an extraordinary dereliction of duty by a legislature .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.408356"}

Finemore , criticised the Whitlam Government 's sponsoring of the Simultaneous Elections ( 1974 ) proposal ' at a time when there was a life and death battle between the House of Representatives and the Senate ' .He believed that this ensured the short - term political aspects of the measure would predominate over any intrinsic merit that it might have had .Parker also wondered about the variation in State votes in referenda .He suggested that differences in State political culture may account for such variations .He concluded that there must be different perspectives in the different States , suggesting that the reason for such differences must , in part , ' be sought somewhere in State politics ' .Premier John Allan ( CP ) , of Victoria , was one important opponent of the 1926 changes , a reminder that State Premiers have often been instrumental in leading opposition forces to amendment proposals .This has been the case even when changes are proposed by their own party , as in Allan 's case .In 1944 , the Labor Premiers of New South Wales ( McKell ) and Tasmania ( Cosgrove ) led determined opposition to the Post - War Reconstruction and Democratic Rights amendment proposed by the Curtin Government ( ALP ) .Thirty - three years later , Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke - Petersen ( NP ) and Western Australian Premier Charles Court ( LP ) led the successful fight against the Fraser Government 's effort to introduce simultaneous elections .Such cases seem to confirm Parker 's claim concerning the importance of State governments in many referendum defeats .When looking at the 1999 referenda , Mr Justice Kirby has drawn attention to what he called the ' small State error ' .He suggests that a major factor in the defeat of these two referenda was the strong disinclination of the smaller States to support them .( 81 )We can extend this to previous cases .As noted above ( see p. 7 ) , Tasmania has said YES to only 10 of the 44 amendment attempts , and the States of Queensland , Western Australia and South Australia have not looked very favourably on referenda over the last 50 years .Support for , and opposition to , constitutional referenda is not necessarily limited to political party members .Wildavsky has made the point that on some occasions the explanation for a particular defeat can only be fully appreciated if the activity of other political bodies is understood .In 1926 , for example , the fact that all three major parties supported the Industry and Commerce proposal in Parliament left unanswered the question as to why the proposal was defeated .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.55098"}
{"text": "\" I think that 's wrong .You can see that our policy to stabilise the eurozone was successful .\" The Troika 's purpose with the 2012 wave of austerity policies that swept through primarily - but not exclusively - the southern rim of the European continent , was not to restore , or even open a path back to growth and full employment .The purpose was instead to end the surge in expectations that Greece and Italy were going to leave the euro zone .Policy makers and analysts in the inner circles of the Troika assumed that if they could put a leash on runaway government deficits the speculators waiting for the return of the Drakhma and the Lira would be convinced that nobody was about to exit the currency union .In the short run , they were correct .In Greece , interest rates dropped almost as dramatically as they increased : .However , this decline could just as well be the result of the ECB 's highly irresponsible pledge to buy any amount of treasury bonds from any country within its jurisdiction .But more importantly , even if the austerity measures calmed down speculations about a currency secession , those measures did not solve the underlying macroeconomic crisis .Greece still suffers from 55-percent youth unemployment ; the economy still is not growing but actually shrinking ; improvements in the Greek government budget over the past year are entirely due to one - time measures related to austerity .Once these one - time effects have worked their way through the budget , there will be no lasting improvement left .This also means that the long - term threat to the unity of the euro zone still remains .It has just fallen under the media radar for now .Greece 's only long - term chance is that the Troika will declare austerity cease - fire .If that happens , the Greek economy will be granted some time to catch its breath and re - structure itself to function under the combination of eroded entitlements and higher taxes .Only then can the private sector begin to create jobs again - and only then will the long - term threat of a Greek secession from the euro go away permanently .This is all common sense , founded in a sound , solid understanding of macroeconomics .Such understanding is , however , a scarce resource among political leaders , especially in Europe .As the EU Business article continues , Mr. Sh\u00e4uble continues his ignorant rant : .[Schaeuble ] also rejected that the tough fiscal medicine and economic restructuring [ that ] Germany promoted were the causes of high unemployment and recession in much of the single currency area , declaring \" that is false \" .\"The long recession is the consequence of a financial crisis whose origin was n't in the eurozone , \" he said , adding in a stab at the United States : \" Remind me where Lehman Brothers was based . \"The 2008 collapse of the US investment bank was the biggest bankruptcy in US history and sparked the global financial crisis from which the world economy is still recovering .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.654335"}

{"text": "It now looks quite certain that the British press wo n't be getting too excited about Brexit this side of Christmas .Der EZB - Rat traf sich am 2 .Dezember und beschloss eine weitere kleine Senkung der bereits negativen Zinss\u00e4tze der Banken , w\u00e4hrend er gleichzeitig das Anleihenkaufprogramm um weitere sechs Monate bis M\u00e4rz 2017 ausdehnte .In ihrer erfolglosen Art und Weise versucht die Europ\u00e4ische Zentralbank ein Trilemma zu l\u00f6sen .Sie will das wirtschaftliche Wachstum durch niedrige bis negative Zinss\u00e4tze ankurbeln , die von ihr anvisierte Inflationsrate von 2 Prozent durch eine steigende Geldmenge erreichen und den finanziellen Druck , der auf den Mitgliedstaaten lastet , durch ein riesiges Anleihenaufkaufprogramm lindern .Dahinter steht der Gedanke , dass die EZB , indem sie negative Zinss\u00e4tze f\u00fcr Einlagen bei den Zentralbanken zahlt , die Gesch\u00e4ftsbanken anspornen will , die Kreditvergabe gegen\u00fcber Unternehmen und Konsumenten zu erh\u00f6hen , anstatt ihre Liquidit\u00e4t zu maximieren .Desweitern wird erwartet , dass die Gesch\u00e4ftsbanken diese negativen Zinss\u00e4tze an die Kontoinhaber weitergeben , um so den Anreiz zum Sparen zu nehmen und den Konsum anzukurbeln .I m M\u00e4rz 2015 startete die EZB die ' Quantitative Lockerung ' , um das Problem der beinahe zahlungsunf\u00e4higen europ\u00e4ischen Staaten zu lindern ihren Schuldendienst zu bedienen .I m Rahmen dieses Programms kauft die Europ\u00e4ische Zentralbank jeden Monat 60 Milliarden Euro an Staatsschulden .Rechnet man die letzte sechsmonatige Erweiterung des Programms hinzu , dann bel\u00e4uft sich die gesamte Finanzspritze , die durch die ' Quantitative Lockerung ' bereitgestellt wird , auf 1,46 Billionen Euro .Die Politik , die Wirtschaft mit Liquidit\u00e4t zu \u00fcberfluten , hat das Wachstum nicht angekurbelt .Wenngleich kosteng\u00fcnstige Kredite eine Expansion in einer gesunden Wirtschaft unterst\u00fctzen k\u00f6nnen , so k\u00f6nnen sie kein Wachstum schaffen .Was billiges Geld tats\u00e4chlich tut , ist Ersparnisse zu zerst\u00f6ren - insbesondere die Altersvorsorge .Zu einem nachhaltigen Wachstum kommt es dann , wenn sich die Unternehmen nach eigenem freien Willen dazu entscheiden zu investieren .Um solche Entscheidungen zu treffen , m\u00fcssen die Unternehmen Vertrauen in die Zukunft haben .Heute wird dieses Vertrauen durch unberechenbare Politik und \u00dcberregulierung untergraben .Der schnellste Weg um das Vertrauen wiederherzustellen , w\u00e4re der die ( von Politikern ) gef\u00fcrchteten Strukturreformen einzuf\u00fchren , die echte private Investitionen ausl\u00f6sen w\u00fcrden .\u00d6ffentliche Ausgaben f\u00fcr sinnvolle Infrastruktur k\u00f6nnten in diesem Sanierungsplan eine unterst\u00fctzende Rolle spielen .Der Kauf von Anleihen l\u00f6st das Staatsschuldenproblem in der Eurozone nicht , da die Mitgliedstaaten weiterhin zu viel ausgeben .Was man damit erreicht , ist Zeit zu erkaufen , die die nationalen Regierungen dazu nutzen , um Reformen weiter hinauszuschieben .Die Verbraucherpreisinflation ist noch nicht zu den anvisierten 2 Prozent zur\u00fcckgekehrt , aber bei Aktien , Anleihen und den Immobilienpreisen ist eine Inflation der Verm\u00f6genswerte ganz offensichtlich .Diese Art des nachhaltigen Wachstums endet gew\u00f6hnlich in einer Blase .In Voodoo- und Stammesreligionen sind die Priester die Vermittler zum \u00dcbernat\u00fcrlichen , um den Wohlstand der Gemeinschaft sicherzustellen .Blickt man auf die langfristigen Ursachen und Wirkungen , so scheinen die Zaubertr\u00e4nke der Medizinm\u00e4nner , um die b\u00f6sen Geister zu vertreiben , genauso viel Logik zu beinhalten wie die Anstrengungen der EZB , die Wirtschaft zu heilen - au\u00dfer dass der Medizinmann wahrscheinlich weniger Schaden anrichtet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.28087"}
{"text": "[ 52 ] .The legislature has the right , and the duty , to see that appropriation bills are clearly set out , with proper explanations for all proposed expenditures .It also has the duty to ensure that the government does not make any expenditure without the approval of the legislature .To ensure that the understanding about passing the budget package is not abused , the legislature should insist that any new programs , whether of expenditure or taxation , should be debated and agreed by the legislature before being incorporated in the budget .Governments certainly will not like this .Governments enjoy the drama , the expectations and the publicity associated with the annual budget , but the benefits , if any , are for the government , not the nation or its economy .Governments like even more the fact that a budget can be presented as a package , so that the details of new programs often receive scant attention from the legislature .This should be unacceptable .Governments will certainly obfuscate if they can .An example is the ' vote ' system of appropriating funds .This lasted for three hundred years , and is only now being superseded in some parliaments by an accrual system of accounting , under which it is possible to see what a particular activity is costing , which was certainly not possible under the vote system .Parliament started making appropriations by votes , which could be spent only on the designated purposes , to prevent King Charles II spending the Navy estimates on his mistress , the appropriately named Duchess of Portsmouth .The system was slightly modified in the reign of William III , to prevent him spending public money on his friends , who were not even girls .That system continued into the modern era .If the government has been elected on a particular program of policy changes , the legislature must accept that these programs are the wish of the electorate , and must facilitate their implementation .This will require some judgement by the legislature .Most political parties , having won an election , claim a ' mandate ' for any policies that were mentioned , no matter how incidentally , during the election campaign .This claim is patently spurious .People vote for the government they want , though their decision may be influenced by major policy proposals , and there is usually a core of policies in a party 's election campaign which can reasonably be said to have been the basis of that party 's electoral success .Sometimes programs are not very precise .One British prime minister described his policy as ' to drift lazily downstream , occasionally putting out a boat - hook to avoid a collision . 'Admittedly Lord Salisbury was talking about foreign policy , but the electoral policy statements of some parties in other areas have a similar ring .Even when the legislature accepts the government 's mandate in particular areas , that does not mean that bills to implement the policies should necessarily be passed in the form presented .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.562805"}

{"text": "The aim was to shift the examination from the annual estimates to long term expenditure plans .It proposed that all the principal documents concerning each department 's spending plans should be referred to the relevant select committee for examination .The select committee would have to report within 60 days , and no money could be voted until the committee had reported .The government 's reply to the Procedure Committee 's recommendations was lukewarm , and nothing has yet happened .Canada .The Canadian Parliament passes an average of about 40 government public bills a year , all of which these days originate in the House of Commons .From the late 1960s all bills were automatically referred to standing committees , but this was changed in 1986 so that specific bills were referred to legislative committees for review , an arrangement which was stopped in 1994 .In that year , standing orders were amended to permit a bill to be referred to a committee before the second reading , and this is becoming increasingly common .Only a minister can move such a motion , and there is then a three hour debate in which MPs are limited to single ten minute speeches .The committee then effectively carries out the second reading and committee stages of a normal bill , and reports back to the House with any proposed amendments .Further amendments may be moved at this report stage , in the usual way .The proposal is not universally popular , particularly because of the elimination of the usual second reading debate , although some discussion of this issue could take place during the three hour debate on the bill 's referral to a committee .The bills referred in this way are not central to the government 's program and there is usually no consensus among government members .Typical bills related to bankruptcy , conflicts of interest of MPs , and gun control .Cross - voting is not uncommon on such bills , but is frowned on by party leaders .After fourteen Liberals cross voted in 1995 , mainly on controversial legislation on gun control and hate crimes , Prime Minister Chrtien reacted angrily , stripping some of them of their committee responsibilities and even threatening not to sign their nomination papers in the future .In the 1994 - 97 Parliament , 25 bills - about 20 per cent of the bills passed - were referred in this way , but in the next Parliament this had dropped to four bills .If there is general consent , a bill may be dealt with by the committee of the whole House of Commons , but this is very rare .It was used in December 1988 during the consideration of the free trade agreement with the US and Mexico .The committees considering bills are adequately staffed , with technical assistance provided by the research staff of the parliamentary library , supplemented when necessary by experts from the community ( chosen by the government ) .Some MPs still do criticise the level and quality of support available to committees , and certainly having the government select the expert advisers is objectionable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.74826"}
{"text": "The biggest problem with democracy in New Zealand is not the systems with have , it 's how they are abused and manipulated by political parties .CIR and MMP are designed by politicians and misused by politicians .But there 's no easy solution to this .Most people and groups of people proposing \" people 's democracy \" initiatives do n't actually think in terms of making things more democratic , they are blinded by their own agendas and want to manipulate democracy to achieve their own goals .I do n't think politicians will give up their power and their hold on the democratic processes easily .So I think the only way of people taking ownership of democracy is to set up small scale democractic systems , prove them and then grow them , where the only agenda is finding the best balance of democracy and leadership / governance . \"Fixing stuff like this might be where legislative effort should be spent rather than in attempting to reshape our traditional culture with legislation nobody really wants .\" What legislation ?If you are talking about the gay marriage bill then you are wrong , the majority of Kiwis want it .If you are talking about the voluntary euthanasia bill then again you are wrong , the majority of Kiwis want this as well .The \" traditional culture \" you keep crapping on about no longer exists , what makes it all the more laughable is that you know bloody well that Kiwis rejected the stifled , religious based \" traditional culture \" years ago .It is only stupid old men like you who yearn for the days past when life was meant to be endured not enjoyed .Grendal , so the majority of the population do n't understand the issue well enough to make the decision .Nor the politicians - so who do you think decided on the policy ?Or why was the policy determined on without understanding it - simply the opportunity to make an untaxed CG by buying cheap off the taxpayer and selling higher onto the market ?A way of using capital to speculate ?So those who have , will have more and those who have less get the higher power bill ?Pete George , the Labour Party are trying out the democracy thing in house at the moment , but apparently it makes those in leadership and those in caucus a little paranoid because it gives others a vehicle to challenge their primacy .It 's not the democracy that 's the problem ( Greens do fine ) it 's the transformation ( vested interest status quo etc ) .The reason to sell assets is that the private sector will run them better than the government .The incentive to make profits by providing goods and services that customers want to pay for , leads to better outcomes than the incentive to avoid embarrassing the shareholding minister or to pursue other politically driven goals .Any other reason is flawed .There will be little real debt reduction as revenue generated will be determined by the value of expected future profits , which could also have been used to repay debt .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.84985"}

V. Dicey stated that if a national constitution was written so as to be changeable by amendment , then it should be ' capable of being changed only by some authority above and beyond the ordinary legislative bodies ' .Not all agreed .Queensland 's Sir Samuel Griffith asserted that ' millions of people are not capable of discussing [ constitutional ] matters in detail ' , and stated his preference to have amendments approved by conventions of politicians .The history of Australia 's efforts at constitutional amendment suggests that , although ' millions of people ' might not have discussed the various constitutional amendments ' in detail ' , their voting record has indicated an adequate awareness of the relevant constitutional principles involved in the 44 referenda .Australian voters have been cautious , and conservative at times , but they have shown their willingness to accept change when persuaded that such change is sensible or right .Social issues , for instance , always seem to have a reasonable chance of being accepted , as have amendments designed to tidy up anomalous machinery matters .On the other hand , Australians will not alter aspects of the federal system of government if they perceive its basic structure to be under threat , nor will they seek to weaken the position of the Senate in any way .They need a lot of convincing to tamper with the work of the Constitution 's founders .Scott Bennett and Sean Brennan , ' Constitutional Referenda in Australia ' , Department of the Parliamentary Library , Research Paper No . 2 , 19992000 . ibid , pp .1718 .John Higley and Ian McAllister , ' Elite division and voter confusion : Australia 's republic referendum in 1999 ' , European Journal of Political Research , vol .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.61276"}

Warden is the first indication that the Justice Department is extending its total secrecy policy to proceedings in federal courts dealing with habeas corpus - that is , an individual 's right to force the government to justify his or her detention .The case offers the Supreme Court an opportunity for the first time to spell out whether such secret judicial proceedings violate constitutional protections .It may also offer the first insight into how much deference a majority of justices is willing to grant the government in areas where the war on terrorism may tread upon fundamental American freedoms .From the perspective of news reporters and government watchdogs , the case marks a potential turning point away from a long - held presumption that judicial proceedings in the US are open to public scrutiny .The case is one of several currently on petition to the high court dealing with some aspect of the war on terror .Two cases relate to detainees at Guant\u00e1namo Bay , Cuba , and one challenges Yasser Hamdi 's open - ended detention as an enemy combatant .A fourth case seeks to force the Justice Department to disclose the names of detainees caught up in antiterror investigations - an issue closely related to the Miami habeas case .Federal judges have the authority to order sensitive documents or even entire hearings sealed from public view when disclosure might harm national security .Such rulings are usually issued after the judge has explained the need for secrecy in a decision available to the public .In addition , judges can order that an individual be identified in public court filings only by a pseudonym or by initials , as happened when the MKB case arrived at the US Supreme Court .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.90456"}

V. Evatt , a development that some of his party were uncomfortable with .The margin by which the proposal failed was narrow , and some wondered if the strong fight led by Evatt had played an important role in its defeat .Even the hostile Bulletin acknowledged the strength of his efforts : .Immediately the referendum was launched he took the initiative in the fight ; he held it to the end , vigorously campaigning in every State , and by sheer personal earnestness and force making the other side 's effort in general look careless and lethargic .In the Establishment of Republic ( 1999 ) case , it has been suggested by Professor Clive Bean that the efforts of Kerry Jones , of the Australians for Constitutional Democracy , strengthened the NO case , whereas those of Malcolm Turnbull weakened the YES case .Bean 's work suggests that the combination of the two leadership effects may have cost the YES vote about 1.5 per cent , ' not an inconsequential slice of the margin ' .( 71 )A rather more subtle example was that of John Howard whose government sponsored the 1999 amendment legislation through the Parliament , yet who , according to Higley and McAllister , then ' used his position to undermine ' its chances .( 72 )Although many prime ministers have seen their hopes dashed in constitutional referenda , there is little doubt that the opposition of a prime minister would doom any attempt to amend the Constitution .Apart from party leaders , loud and persistent opposition can be important in defeating constitutional referendaas constitutional historian Helen Irving has noted , bipartisan support for an amendment proposal is not enough to get it through .( 73 )There have been a number of examples illustrating her point .Industry and Commerce ( 1926 ) and Parliament ( 1967 ) each had firm major party support , yet they were both defeated , largely because of loud opposition from people determined to defeat each proposal .For some referenda , it has been claimed that their defeat may have been due in part to their sponsorship in an inappropriate political context .Paul Hasluck has wondered if the Post - War Reconstruction and Democratic Rights ( 1944 ) referendum defeat was influenced by waning popular support for wartime controls and a concern about ' too much bureaucracy ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.97308"}

{"text": "In each of 1974 and 1988 , for instance , it was felt better to call for a uniform NO vote for the four questions being submitted , rather than have voters ' confused ' by a mix of YES and NO recommendations .( 87 )In 1973 many in the Coalition were in favour of the Commonwealth having power over incomes but not over prices .It was believed to be safer , however , to make the call NO for both issues , again to avoid ' confusing ' voters .Not all have felt this way .In 1977 the Canberra Times noted that the results indicated that voters were well able to differentiate between issues , a point noted also by Campbell Sharman of the University of Western Australia in regard to the 1988 referenda .Parties have also indicated their view of the voters by attempting too much at the one time .In 1911 and 1913 the ALP put eight questions - six of which were submitted in 1913-and a youthful H. V. Evatt suggested that it was ' chiefly due to its asking too much that the Labour [ sic ] Ministry failed to pass [ any of these ] amendments ' .None of the amendments was ratified , though the six 1913 proposals only failed narrowly , with all achieving a 49 per cent vote as well as the votes of three States , so Evatt may well have been correct in his assessment .Ironically , it was Evatt as Attorney - General who sponsored the Powers referendum in 1944 .This was designed to give the Commonwealth post - war reconstruction powers in fourteen areas of administration for five years after the end of hostilities .The range of policy areas was vast , including some controversial matters such as the organised marketing of commodities or control over profiteering and prices , but there were also relatively uncontroversial areas such as laws for Aboriginal people and the granting of family allowances .There were also provisions to safeguard freedom of speech , expression and religion .In an extraordinary error of judgment , the ballot paper held just the one question : ' Do you approve of the proposed law for the alteration of the constitution entitled \" Constitution Alteration ( Post - War Reconstruction and Democratic Rights ) 1944 ? \" ' ( 90 )This meant that voters who were strongly opposed to a single question had a strong incentive to vote in the negative , despite any sympathy they might have had for other questions .In a similar way , we have seen earlier how the Amendment referendum of 1974 lumped together the provision for the watering - down of the ' double majority ' requirement with the granting of the vote in referenda to Territory voters .If one disliked the former , then one was forced to vote against the principle of fairness that was encapsulated in the latter .In 1988 the Parliamentary Terms referendum effectively dealt with five separate matters : a longer term for the House , a shorter term for the Senate , ending the continuous nature of Senate terms , Senate terms to be no longer fixed and compulsory simultaneous elections for both houses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.94141"}

{"text": "Constitutional amendment can thus be difficult if it strays outside the federal parameters that seem to apply as much today as they did in the late 1890s .In their criticism of voter performance , writers such as Crisp have especially focussed on the 17 economic powers referenda , for they see national legislation and the setting of national benchmarks as essential to the development of the nation .This is particularly the case in a nation with a constitution that has been seen by former Prime Minister Whitlam and others as ' a political structure that is outdated , reactionary and resistant to change ' .If we look at different categories of amendment , however , the picture alters .There have been other questions dealing with the federal system , not just the type seeking to give more power to the Commonwealth .Two of three referenda trying to tidy up Commonwealth - State financial relations have been passed ( 1910 , 1928 ) , though a proposal to alter arrangements for the interchange of powers was defeated in 1984 .The only amendments seeking to increase Commonwealth power that have been passed were not typical of such questions .If we classify the Social Services ( 1946 ) and Aborigines ( 1967 ) referenda as ' social ' , then we note that together with the 1977 Judges example that dealt with retirement ages , then three of five such ' social ' referenda have been carried .The two that missed out were Communism ( 1951 ) and Rights and Freedoms ( 1988 ) .The other major type of alteration has dealt with what might be called ' machinery ' amendments .Just one of four dealing with electoral or referenda arrangements has passed - that giving Territorians the right to vote in constitutional referenda .The Senate has been the focus of seven attempts , six of them occurring in the past three decades .The Rotation of Terms amendment ( 1906 ) and the Casual Vacancies amendment ( 1977 ) , were both passed comfortably .By contrast , five proposals that seemed to have been designed ' to reduce the unpredictability of the Senate in the affairs of the Government ' ( 1967 , 1974 , 1977 , 1984 , 1988 ) have been defeated .In summary , amendments perceived to weaken the federal system are likely to receive short shrift , whereas attempts to repair the perennially - flawed finance chapter have been received sympathetically .Perceived attacks on the Senate are likely to be repelled but matters dealing with societal relations are considered closely .Such outcomes are a possible reminder that voters go to a referendum polling place ' with some consciousness of Australian history and politics ' .Apart from the different responses of voters to different categories of amendment , voters have also indicated an awareness of the issues ( if not necessarily the words ) surrounding particular questions .Examples illustrating this include : .1910 , 1928 State Debts .It has been argued that these referenda showed that people ' understood the intention ' of these ' adjustments to fiscal relations ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.98686"}

{"text": "King is particularly good at puncturing the myth that what has happened in recent years reflects the ' presidentialising ' of the office of prime minster .He distinguishes between three different aspects of the prime minister 's role : power , dominance and celebrity .All prime minsters have the same extensive , but by no means untrammelled powers .In addition , some prime ministers try to dominate their colleagues personally , by making sure that everything revolves around their particular whims and inclinations , and by stamping on rivals who may be getting above themselves .Margaret Thatcher was such a prime minister , but so too was Edward Heath , perhaps to an even greater extent ( Heath 's cabinet was composed almost entirely of admirers and minions ) , which goes to show that dominance does not automatically translate into success .Tony Blair was not a dominant prime minister : how could he be , having ceded control over large areas of domestic policy to Gordon Brown before he even arrived at No . 10 , and then lacking the nerve or political will to claw any of it back ?What Blair was , instead , was a celebrity .Heath , too , was a celebrity of sorts , but of a queasy 1970s type , with his ocean - racing and orchestra - conducting , like some sort of parody of the sophisticated , Continental man of parts .His celebrity , like his dominant personality , did him few favours in the end .Blair , by contrast , revelled in his celebrity , which was closer to that of a TV star , and made him the centre of attention wherever he went .Nor does it mean Blair could do as he pleased .In fact , it made some things harder to achieve , because his impulse to put himself in the spotlight meant that he had to spread himself pretty thin , and to follow the glare of public attention wherever it happened to take him .All prime ministers have to decide what sort of prime minister they want to be .Brown is still to make up his mind .Does he want to dominate ( which would not be hard since there is no one else of comparable stature in his cabinet ) ?Can he bear , as some of his advisers would clearly like , to turn himself into a celebrity ?Or would he really be happiest pulling strings behind the scenes ?He has said that one thing he wants to ensure is that Parliament is restored to some of its former significance , after the cavalier way it was treated by his predecessor .But this too is something of a misperception .Parliament as an independent body has never had much significance in the modern British constitutional order , certainly not since the party machines eradicated any real scope for independence among individual MPs towards the end of the 19th century .Throughout the 20th century , British politics revolved around the decision - making of the executive , and the job of the House of Commons was to sustain the government in power .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.004776"}
{"text": "Queensland 's Sir Samuel Griffith asserted that ' millions of people are not capable of discussing [ constitutional ] matters in detail ' , and stated his preference to have amendments approved by conventions of politicians .The history of Australia 's efforts at constitutional amendment suggests that , although ' millions of people ' might not have discussed the various constitutional amendments ' in detail ' , their voting record has indicated an adequate awareness of the relevant constitutional principles involved in the 42 referenda .Australian voters have been cautious , and conservative at times , but they have shown their willingness to accept change when persuaded that such change is sensible or right .They will not , it seems , alter aspects of the federal system if they perceive its basic structure to be under threat , nor will they seek to weaken the position of the Senate in any way .Social issues seem to be much more likely of amendment , as are tidying - up , machinery matters .Such a conclusion suggests that the Preamble question of November 1999 stands a good chance of being ratified if voters accept the sentiments expressed in the words , and believe it important to add these to the Constitution .Matters are not so clear with regard to the forthcoming Republic referendum .Despite the reasonable number of amendment attempts from which to draw some conclusions , in this case we find that history is not necessarily a sure guide .There are various reasons for this .We can not be sure how voters will see such an amendment .Will it be seen as a machinery matter ?If so , will a question that implies a ' minimalist ' change be considered as relatively unimportant as the question of the rotation of Senators and be passed easily ?Will the 1999 change be seen as more of a societal question ?Will the change be seen as a minor social alteration , whereby an Australian , rather than a British person becomes our head of state ?Would such a perception mean a relatively easy acceptance by voters , particularly as a consequence of the great deal of social change over the past fifty years that has taken Australian well away from the long - standing Anglo - Celtic norm ?On the other hand , some of those arguing the NO case will portray this change as a threat to the very basis of the governmental system and with the potential for great damage .If a great many voters agree with them , the message of the historical record is that the referendum is likely to struggle to receive a majority .How much bipartisan support will there be for the Republic question ?If the significant degree of bipartisanship that has been evident continues , then party attitudes may lose their significance .However , if there is a major division based on party lines , passage may well be difficult to achieve .What effect will dissident republicans such as Clem Jones or Phil Cleary have ?The message of the 1967 Nexus case was that even when most in the major parties support a change , loud dissident voices can still bring about an amendment 's defeat .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.07343"}

'Reading between the lines ' the tone of the letter suggests that Mr Tusk is asking other member states and the EU institutions to be more accommodating towards Britain 's proposals .The only voices making this point in the British press are the broadly pro - EU Guardian and Financial Times .They say that Mr Tusk is calling on all sides , and not just Britain to be flexible .Interestingly , on the Continent , Germany 's Die Welt argues that , if anything , it is the EU that will be flexible , rather than the UK . 'Jetzt will die EU den Briten ganz schnell entgegenkommen ' runs the headline .The paper argues that Mr Tusk 's letter is calling on other EU leaders to send a positive answer back to London , and quickly .No matter what David Cameron says , he is universally expected to back the campaign to remain in the EU , regardless of the outcome of his renegotiation .This leads many to suggest that the entire renegotiation process is a sham .The Spectator 's Isabel Hardman asks whether David Cameron is ' having a staged row with Donald Tusk ? ' , while the chief executive of Vote Leave , Matthew Elliot , is quoted by the Financial Times saying that Mr Cameron is having ' a manufactured row ' with the EU to make his renegotiation ' sound more significant than it really is ' .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.52024"}

H. Birch , a YES vote was a foregone conclusion , for voters ' would otherwise have faced the risk of losing the many social benefits which were already provided ' .( 39 )This and the two other 1946 proposals ( Marketing and Industrial Employment ) met some opposition based on a disinclination to see the Commonwealth gaining any more power , but the social services amendment was carried narrowly , with 54.4 per cent voting YES .Although this amendment recognised a position in which the Commonwealth had become the prime mover in the area of social services , it was important in giving the Commonwealth power in the area of medical and dental services which it did not have before .( 40 )Writing in 1984 , prominent health administrator Sidney Sax described the amendment as being ' of great significance ' , enabling the Commonwealth to legislate for the administration of many welfare schemes and potentially allowing for the provision of medical and dental services and hospital care .Sax has surmised that the Commonwealth 's reach is now potentially so extensive that in the future the national government ' might well be able to establish its own hospitals in the states ' .Further , the word ' benefits ' in the amendment has authorised ' not only the payments of money , but benefits in kind or by way of services ' .This was seen to be particularly important during the Labor Government of 1972 - 75 in enabling the government to make changes in health services .( 41 )At the same time , the High Court has indicated clear limits to this power over social welfare and it has been noted that the Whitlam Government 's social welfare programme was put together with a ' keen awareness ' of the limits .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.887955"}

'The last time the House reduced an estimate was in 1919 , when the Lord Chancellor was refused an additional bathroom .Since 1982 the House of Commons has set aside three days for debating the estimates , and for considering amendments to the Supply Bills , which authorise the estimated expenditure .In practice the committees do little about the estimates , and the debates tend to focus on subjects these committees have been considering , which may be useful publicity but has no effect on the estimates .The problem is not that no one cares about the effectiveness of the parliament in these matters ; it is rather getting something done about it .In the late 1990s there were two committees in the House of Commons looking at the problem - the Procedure Committee , made up of backbenchers , and the Modernization Committee , controlled by the government with the Leader of the House in the chair .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.004684"}

{"text": "( 21 )A recent judgement is that the referendum was ' vitally necessary to the process of change ' , especially as it : . bestowed upon the Whitlam and subsequent governments the moral authority required to expand the Commonwealth 's role in Aboriginal affairs and implement a major programme of reform .Four amendments recommended by the Australian Constitutional Convention were put to the people in 1977 .The Senate Casual Vacancies proposal arose out of the 1975 controversy over the appointment of non - party Senators Cleaver Bunton ( NSW ) and Albert Field ( Qld ) to fill Senate seats formerly held by ALP Senators .The change aimed at ensuring that a replacement Senator would be required to be a member of the party of which the previous Senator was a member at the time of his or her election .Essentially , the purpose of the amendment was to preserve the party balance from one Senate election to the next , and to that end it also abolished Senate by - elections .It received 73.3 per cent of the vote .This is the only reference to parties in the Constitution .Despite the clear intention of the amendment 's supporters to ensure that the party balance in the Senate should not be altered by a casual vacancy , the aftermath indicates that the best of intentions can be thwarted .Following the resignation of a Tasmanian ALP Senator in April 1987 , the nominee of the party , John Devereux , was rejected by a tied vote in the Tasmanian Parliament .As Liberal Tasmanian Minister for Forests , Ray Groom , put it , ' we can choose only a person who is a member of the same party [ as the departed Senator ] but we are not bound to accept the nomination of the party concerned ' .( 23 ) Tasmania therefore had only 11 Senators between 2 April and the double dissolution election of 11 July 1987 .At the time of Federation the very few people who lived in the Northern Territory voted as residents of South Australia .Territorians could therefore vote in constitutional referenda .When the Territory was surrendered to the Commonwealth in 1911 , however , its citizens lost the vote in such referenda , due to the failure to refer to Territory voters in s. 128 .Residents of the Australian Capital Territory were similarly restricted in the years after the establishment of that Territory .In 1967 demonstrations against this restriction upon civil rights occurred in Alice Springs , as Territorians expressed their resentment at not being able to vote in the Aboriginals referendum .In 1974 the Whitlam Government attempted to amend s. 128 in a double - pronged proposal .Territorial voting rights in referenda were sought , but the Government also proposed that constitutional amendments could be carried with just half of the Statesinstead of a majority of Statesvoting in favour .Only New South Wales supported the proposal , but it is likely that had the Territories section been a separate question , it would have been ratified .In 1977 the question of Territory votes was relatively uncontroversial , being carried in every State , gaining a national YES vote of 77.7 per cent , though Queensland and Tasmania had quite large NO votes with 40.4 per cent and 37.8 per cent respectively .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.29318"}

{"text": "( 97 )A number of writers have made clear the importance of Aboriginal and other groups in pushing the Aborigines referendum of 1967 .More recent examples of the impact of particular interests come from the Whitlam and Hawke Governments .In 1973 Bob Hawke as president of the ACTU led the union fight against the Whitlam Labor Government 's Incomes referendum , an effort that was believed to have been important in explaining the very poor YES vote that was cast ( 34.4 per cent ) .In 1988 , the Rights and Freedoms amendment - and in particular the religious freedom section - was strongly opposed by many church representatives and by independent schools , both fearful of the future of state aid to such schools .The Hawke Labor Government , apparently confident that the proposal would be praised by the electorate , was said to be stunned at the severity of the defeat .( 99 )The 69.2 per cent NO vote for this amendment is the highest negative figure returned in a constitutional referendum .The 1999 Republic referendum will be unusual with the Government 's appointment of the two committees to put the YES and NO cases ( see above ) .The Australian Republican Movement and Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy will therefore be key groups working to influence the vote outcome .The granting of such ' insider ' status is unprecedented .Much more typical will be the private efforts of a group like the Real Republicans to enter the public debate .At first glance , the only way to change the Constitution is by using the amendment procedure spelt out in its final provision , s. 128 ( the full text of which is found at Appendix 1 ) .Some of the constitutional features of that provision are examined below .Section 128 , however , is merely one of several ways to alter constitutional arrangements in Australia .Compared with these other methods , the returns from formal amendment by referenda are ' modest indeed ' .The primary method by which the constitutional framework has evolved is judicial interpretation by the High Court .Over time , High Court interpretation has developed and sometimes rewritten understandings of what the Constitution means , without any referendum changing the words , and indeed sometimes where the very same revision has already been tried and failed under s. 128 .For example , the 1920 Engineers case(101 ) entrenched a doctrine of ' legalism ' which licensed an expansionist interpretation of Commonwealth powers as the 20th Century unfolded .This progressive legal redefinition of the notion of a federal balance changed the bargaining power of the Commonwealth and the States , and has had major implications for the way federal politics has been played out .The generous interpretation of the grants power in section 96 has , for example , allowed the Commonwealth to insinuate itself into all kinds of policy areas previously regarded as State preserves .( 102 )The centralist logic embedded in the Engineers principle was most dramatically expressed in 1983 in the Tasmanian Dams case .In some cases the relationship between judicial review and attempts at formal amendment through s. 128 is more direct .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.401054"}

{"text": "Active Inducement takes place if someone intends to make another person infringe and then takes active steps to encourage it .The court basically said there were two types before ( contributory and vicarious ) and now there 's a new , third kind , called \" inducement .\" That 's what the court sent back to the Central District of California Court ( 9th Circuit ) to determine if the defendants were actively inducing infringement .So there used to be just two kinds of \" indirect \" infringement , vicarious and contributory .\" Vicarious \" is when you 're supervising people and making money from it , like at the Flea Market , if the owners of the Flea Market knew that stolen goods were being sold there .( A CA court ruled that Napster did this . ) \" Contributory \" infringement is where you 're supplying the means with knowledge that it will be used illegally .Like if I rented a bunch of CD burners to a bootleger and knew what he was going to do with them .Now , after Grokster , there 's a third , where I intend to make you infringe and take active steps to encourage it .That 's the test laid out by the decision .The trouble with the supremes defining a new type of indirect infringement is that it leaves the questions of \" vicarious \" and \" contributory \" infringement wide open , as well as the test of \" substantial non - infringing uses \" given to us in the Betamax decision .( So no one knows what the rule would have been on those . )The opinion also contained two \" concurrences .\" What are concurrences ?Well , in a formal ruling , there is a majority opinion which lays down the law .It includes what is called a \" holding \" -- what the court held the law to be .Then there are secondary opinions included in the ruling when judges want to add commentary .They are either \" concurrences \" ( which agree with the holding but perhaps for different or additional reasons ) or \" dissents \" ( which disagree with the holding and reasoning of the majority ) .Typically , with concurrences , they are sections that the majority did n't support .In Grokster , you had the majority 9 - 0 but each concurrence only had 3 votes .If either had gotten 5 votes , it would have been part of the majority .Although these two concurrences conflict with each other , the judges writing them agreed generally on the opinion ( unanimously in fact ) .So , for the two concurrences that received three votes each , one said that the Sony Betamax test of \" substantial non - infringing uses \" was more than satisfied .The other said that Sony should be revisited and overturned .So you may say \" well , it would certainly be hard to prove that , until you look at the decision a bit closer .In Grokster , the supreme court said that even using the name \" -ster \" as in Grokster showed intent to induce infringement , because it was similar to Napster .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "125.02718"}

{"text": "Bill 1999 and of the Presidential Nominations Committee Bill 1999 .S ome state premiers had also entered the debate on both sides and became important figures in the debate .Of greatest political significance was the emergence of a pro - republic Liberal State premier , Nick Greiner , in NSW .Greiner served to make republicanism a bipartisan issue .Paul Keating replaced Bob Hawke as Labor Prime Minister in December 1991 and immediately began to advance issues of national identity .On 24 February 1993 , in his policy speech just before the March 1993 federal elections , Keating announced his intention to form ' a committee of eminent Australians to develop a discussion paper that would consider the options for an Australian republic ' .5 This committee , the Republic Advisory Committee ( RAC ) was established on 28 April 1993 .The chair was Malcolm Turnbull of the ARM .The RAC reported on 5 October 1993 and concluded that a republic was achievable .It was ' both legally and practically possible to amend the Constitution to achieve a republic without making changes which will in any way detract from the fundamental constitutional principles on which our system of government is based ' .7 The Keating government committed itself to this position and , on 7 June 1995 , Keating gave a televised address to parliament in which he reiterated this view and set a timetable of a republic by 2001 .8 By now public opinion surveys ( see below ) suggested that a majority of Australians joined the ALP in supporting in principle the move to a republic , as did the Australian Democrats .So it had thus become an issue of some urgency for the Coalition parties to address .The early 1990s saw a quickening of the debate and a number of books were published , by academics and activists , examining the constitutional and political issues .9 Most of these authors wrote in favour of the move to a republic .Earlier , in November 1994 , the then Leader of the Opposition , Alexander Downer , had suggested the idea of a people 's convention to discuss the issue , a procedure advocated by the Constitutional Centenary Foundation .This first step later enabled the subsequent Opposition Leader , John Howard , to put forward a more detailed proposal along these lines in response to Paul Keating 's June 1995 initiative .When the Coalition parties won the March 1996 federal elections this proposal was part of its campaign promises but the republic did not play a major part in its campaign .At the time the Labor Government countered with a proposal for an indicative plebiscite ( a non - binding vote ) that would test support for a republic in principle before proceeding to a referendum on a particular model .The Howard government proceeded to implement its proposal and from that time onwards the debate narrowed .The Constitutional Convention ( Election ) Bill 1997 received its second reading on 26 March 1997 .The bill was held up in the Senate for some time because it proposed that the 76 elected delegates would be elected by voluntary postal ballot rather than by in - person compulsory voting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "136.39601"}
