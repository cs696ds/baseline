{"text": "Is it me or did Dexter kill the wrong guy .The cop killer was an American dude not the Russian right ? ? ?Because the guy he killed spoke with a heavy Russian accent and the the actual killer was the guy on the phone speaking to the Russian mob guy .Am I correct ?( I was a little distracted while watching . )After watching it again , you 're right he did kill the right guy .But what bothers me is that he speaks perfect English when he kills the cop , but all of a sudden has a heavy Russian accent when he 's on the table with Dexter over him .It 's like he became a Russian mobster overnight haha .One question that has been on my mind is that if Deb does n't expose him ( she wo n't ) .Would she start to help him hide it to protect him ?Also will she start freaking out and think every murder she works with was done by Dexter .Lastly the preview of the next episode made it look like she was setting up a rehab type thing for him , which I ca n't imagine going well considering what happened when Lila tried it .Yeah but Rita thought he was just an addict so it was easy for him to act like he was giving up his addiction .I think Dexter 's serial killings will be a lot harder to quit or even pretend to quit since Deb can be with him 24/7 even at work .babysitter 's boyfriend is a total douche character , wish Dexter would have killed his @ss .Some interesting storylines this year though , many ways this could go .Almost hope Dexter gets caught in the end .I feel like the only way this show can end once and for all is with Dexter being killed or put in prison .I personally would n't like to have it end with him in prison so I want him to die in the end .My favorite characters always die in the end of the story lol .I doubt they will kill him , they are going to milk this sheep for another season I bet .Once we get some more development for Deb before I think we will get a firm grasp on how its going to go .From a quick google , it looks like they already okay'd season 8 which will indeed be that last one .He 's basically a serial killer who kills only people who have done very bad things ( murder mostly ) .His job as a blood spatter ( not splatter :)) analyst with the Miami police helps him get information to \" prove \" his bad guys are really the bad guys .Check the show out , it 's quite entertaining .Forum Permissions .WASHINGTON ( CNN ) - Sen. Hillary Clinton 's sexuality is not the most pressing issue on the presidential campaign trail , but it is likely to get a fair amount of attention on a lazy Friday in the nation 's capital .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.6506"}
