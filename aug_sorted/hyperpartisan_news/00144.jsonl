{"text": "Boise State uses Trickeration to Upset Oklahoma in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl .The Boise State Broncos not only pulled off one of the biggest upsets in college football history , but they did it in style .The Broncos used three trick plays late in the game - including the famous Statue of Liberty play - to pull off a shocking win over the Oklahoma Sooners in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl .Although Boise State came in as only a 7.5-point underdog , this was the small schools big chance to introduce themselves to a national television audience .After blowing an early 22-point lead in the fourth quarter , the Broncos pulled out all the stops to force overtime in the final seconds , and eventually win the game 43 - 42 .Teams use trick plays all the time in sports .But by doing it several times , on the biggest stage , during their one shot at glory , head coach Chris Peterson and his Broncos took bold play calling to an entirely new level .Saints Execute Onside Kick During Super Bowl XLIV Victory .The New Orleans Saints pulled off arguably the most famous onside kick attempt in NFL history on their way to winning the Super Bowl XLIV .Yes , it is notable because it happened during the NFL 's biggest game of the year , but the timing of the play is what really made it special .The Saints were set to kick off to start the second half , trailing the Indianapolis Colts 10 - 6 .New Orleans then executed the unexpected onside kick and scored a touchdown on the ensuing possession .The play was indicative of head coach Sean Payton 's aggressive play calling , a style that led to an eventual 31 - 17 win .Green Bay Packers Prematurely End Brett Favre Era in Favor of Aaron Rodgers .While the controversy seems silly now , the Green Bay Packers ' decision to name Aaron Rodgers the starting quarterback before the 2008 season was very unpopular at the time .Some objective observers supported the switch to Rodgers , but a lot of Packers fans were furious with general manager Ted Thompson 's decision to part ways with Favre .It was bad enough that Favre refused to mentor Rodgers during their three years together in Green Bay .Rodgers ' job was made even harder by the initial lack of fan support .The easiest way to make people forget about a legend is to win games and play your butt off , and Rodgers has done both .He led the Packers to the Super Bowl title after the 2010 season , was named the NFL 's 2011 MVP and is generally considered the league 's best quarterback .Even as far back as his high school days , Rodgers ' path to stardom was not a smooth one .But over the past five seasons , he has made Thompson and head coach Mike McCarthy look like geniuses .The good people of Green Bay are pretty happy about how things turned out too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "117.86998"}
