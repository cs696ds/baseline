A. The original recipe instructions for forming the bagels : Rub some shortening on your hands .Place the bagels on the greased sheet pans .B. My updated instructions : Spray the inside of an ice cream scoop with vegetable spray .Scoop and drop the dough onto your slipat mat ( sprinkled first with cornmeal ) .Repeat with the remaining dough , re - spraying the inside of the scoop as needed .Spray the palm of your hand and gently flatten each bagel .Spray your pointer finger with vegetable spray , insert into the middle of each bagel and create a hole .I found it worked best to wipe my finger after each hole was made and respray it .In either case , cover with a towel or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for one hour .At about 30 minutes into this process , preheat your oven to 450 degrees .At about 45 minutes into this process , bring a large stockpot of water and 1 teaspoon of sugar to a boil .Once it reaches boiling ( and the bagels have risen for one hour ) , quickly place four bagels in the pot .After 30 seconds , flip them over .Remove them from the pot with a slotted spoon and place on a rack to cool .Repeat with the remaining bagels .The extra water will drip onto the counter below the rack .Return the bagels to the sheet pans .At this point , add any toppings you might like .Sesame seeds , poppy seeds , cinnamon sugar are all nice .Place bagels in the oven and bake for 20 minutes .Your bagels might need more or less time - keep an eye on them .When finished , remove from oven and place the bagels on a cooling rack .NOTE :I have always found that gluten free baked goods need to sit for awhile before eating .Give them a good 30 minutes or more before diving headlong into their deliciousness .I was never much of a bagel fan - they always seemed to upset my stomach .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "130.73016"}
{"text": "Not me .It 's all about what I 'm having for breakfast .A few weeks ago , I very successfully made bagels from a Breads From Anna bread mix using chia seeds in place of eggs .Today , I wanted to make bagels from scratch .And I wanted them to be multi - grain AND I wanted to use chia seeds as an egg replacer .Now , granted , it 's been four years since I tasted a bagel made with wheat .So , maybe I 'm hallucinating .But it does n't matter .For me , these bagels are the real deal .Not only that , I absolutely can not believe how moist and tender the insides of the bagel were .The only significant change - chia seeds .For those of you who tried making my bagels from this former blog recipe of mine , this recipe is in the same ballpark .But I think the chia VASTLY improves the texture .All I know is that when I sliced these babies open , I could n't believe my eyes .And my mouth was very happy .If your interest is piqued , but you want to use eggs , I would eliminate the chia gel and use 4 egg whites , per the original recipe .Of course , using chia seeds per this new recipe presumes that you have chia seeds in your pantry .As for me , there ai n't no turning back .When it comes to using them as an egg replacer for baked goods , I like their performance as much if not more than flax seeds and they 've got a lot of nutritional cache , and while pricey , you get a lot for your money .If you think you 'd like to make this recipe but do n't want to bother with all the ingredients , come back and visit .I 'll keep experimenting as time goes on .If I can come up with a bagel that tastes like this one and packs as powerful a nutritional punch , but that has less ingredients , yours truly will be all over it .Before starting , make your chia gel egg replacer : . 1 cup + 2 tbsp water 2 tbsp chia seeds .Combine and let sit for about an hour , stirring with a fork or whisk every 10 minutes .Store unused chia gel in the frig .Gluten Free , Dairy Free , Egg Free Multi - Grain Bagels makes 15 bagels . 1/2 cup sorghum flour 1/2 cup potato starch 1/2 cup millet flour 1/2 cup buckwheat flour ( I used light buckwheat , and yes , it 's gluten free ! )NOTE :I used a silpat mat to line my baking sheets ( jelly roll pans with sides ) .Sprinkle cornmeal on them .Place the dry ingredients , from the sorghum flour through the agar , into the bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer .Using the paddle attachment , mix the dry ingredients together just until blended .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "133.64062"}
