{"text": "Rush Coil , meanwhile , makes no appearance at all .In Cossack 4 , if you attempt to use any of the Rush weapons when in the center of one of the towers where Rush already awaits to take you to the main tower , you will hear a buzz and a second Rush wo n't spawn .Diagonal Cut : This is how Super Shadow Man kills the third Chimerabot in Wily Stage 4 .Evil Knockoff : Snatchman in Wily Stage 2 .If you beat him once , he steals 4 of your Robot Master Weapons with the help of Dr. Wily 's Stealing System .Feed It with Fire : Dust Man , with anything except Toad Spell when he is using Recycle Inhaler .In at least two cutscenes near the end of the game , Mega Man fires a charged shot without having to charge up first , the first time happening when he destroys Kalinka 's cell and the second time happening when he shoots down the alien cave projector .The Wish Star adaptor uses up its entire energy bar when used , even after rescuing Kalinka in Wily Stage 3 and she attaches a device to Rush that halves the usage costs of the Rush Search and Rush Cannon adaptors .Even if the player uses the Wish Star adaptor to defeat the Wily Machine , Mega Man is still able to immediately use it again afterwards to destroy Wily 's escape pod .Toad Spell turns the debris Dust Man expels out of his Arm Cannon into toads .When he inhales it back in , he gets damaged instead .Toad Man , in a homage to Mega Man 2 , gets killed in one hit if you use Toad Spell on him .Probably because the Toad Spell cures the Toad status in the Final Fantasy games .Spark Manbow affects Bright Man just as much when he uses it against Mega Man .Dust Man and Bright Man can do this to the player , should they try to use Rush Cannon on them .The former inhales it and fires it back at you , while the latter freezes time and knocks you into the path of your own weapon .Hologram : Crash Man and Wave Man .The alien lair , as well as the Petit Robot Masters .Hell Wheel can steamroll through enemies that are n't Jumbig .Homing Control Ring Boomerang can stay hold on enemies and stick there to do massive damage .This is probably the easiest way to kill a Jumbig .Pharaoh Shotgun can fire out FIVE Pharaoh Shots at once .Water Cutter is basically an even more broken version of Metal Blade .Infinity+1 Sword : The ?Dagger , which you must reach Wily 4 and fight Super Shadow Man in one life ( dying invalidates the condition and skips him ) to obtain .It turns every hit into a Critical Hit , making the rest of the game a breeze .Irony : During a contest for Mega Man 6 , designs for proposed Rush abilities were shown in Nintendo Power alongside several Robot Masters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.12422"}
{"text": "But he DOES have a pattern ... kind of .To Defeat Spark Man ...Spark Man 's lair layout should be your biggest concern upon taking him on .He 's pretty easy to beat otherwise , especially if you have the Shadow Blade equipped , which'll take him out in seven hits or so .Then he 'll continue to run and jump around his lair , trying to collide with Mega Man .Jump over him if you can ( although he is kind of tall ) , and fire some Shadow Blades on him before he repeats his battle pattern .You 'll see that it 's easier than it sounds when you actually get there .Use an E - Tank if need be , but try to save them if at all possible for later on in the game .You 'll need them more later , trust me !As was the case with Spark Man , Snake Man 's lair layout makes him seem harder than he actually is .To Defeat Snake Man ... Snake Man 's lair is layed out much like Spark Man 's in many respects , so Snake Man , in traversing around his room , is always jumping and running .Do n't run with him .Instead , just stay right by the lair entrance and pummel him with arm cannon shots from there , while avoiding the Search Snakes he shoots across the ground at you one at a time ( just jump over them ) .Staying in the position you 're in makes Snake Man run back away from you through his pattern , where you can pummel him with arm cannon shots , hitting him in his back .Just make sure to follow him when he jumps and changes heights for full effect from your arm cannon .He 's really that simple .------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GEMINI MAN \u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af \u00af\u00af\u00af Weapon : Gemini Laser Primary Weakness : Search Snakes Other Weaknesses : Magnet Missiles , Hard Knuckles , Shadow Blade Description : Gemini Man is the coolest idea for a character in this game .You might be wondering \" what does Gemini have to do with anything \" ... but if you 're saying that , then you obviously do n't know what the word means .Gemini means \" twin \" and the power of Gemini Man lies primarily in the fact that he can segment himself into a twin , and the two of them wreak twice the havoc .Thet wo run around the room , onto the walls and jumping across the ceiling to the other wall , where they repeat this process in a circle while shooting their arm cannons at you .You can kill one , and that 's when the battle gets more difficult , and the Gemini Laser comes into play .To Defeat Gemini Man ...Upon the battle beginning , it gets very fast paced as the real Gemini Man and the twin Gemini Man run around the room , shooting their arm cannons at you .Equip the Search Snakes and start firing at either one of them ( they are indistinguishable from each other ) , and jump over or slide under them as they make their rounds to avoid damage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.4919"}
{"text": "Pending he does any of the alternate move , you ca n't hurt him in that magnitized state , so you 'll just have to wait until after he 's done to fire upon him .Since he 's first in line to be fought , you only have the arm cannon to use on him , pending , of course , you 're following the order I 've given here .If not , the Spark Shock and Shadow Blades work just as well on him .He , like Magnet Man , has a pattern that 's even more predictable then his aforementioned counterpart , but has a lot more power behind him as well .He has two modes of attacks as well .Firstly , he shoots two Hard Knuckles at you , one going straight at you and the other going in the air .Then he jumps high in the air and plummets back to the ground on his head , doing massive damage to anything below in his path .To Defeat Hard Man ...Again , as I mentioned before , Hard Man too has a pattern , even more predictable than Magnet Man 's .Reading above , and knowing his pattern , you 'll basically want to fire away at Hard Man every other second or so with a Magnet Missile .They do n't even have to be going right for him , the metal of his plating is attracted to the Magnet Missile , so he , like all other enemies in the game , pulls it right in .Just make sure to turn around and fire on Hard Man when he 's about to plummet into the ground , before he freezes everything with his impact , to get in one more hit .Within two or three cycles of his pattern , he 'll be dead if you keep up the attacks .He 's just as weak to his own weapon as he is to Magnet Missiles , as well , but they are slower and clunkier ... and you can only attack him in Wily 's castle with his own weapon , so it does n't even matter .------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP MAN \u00af\u00af\u00af \u00af\u00af\u00af Weapon : Top Spin Primary Weakness : Hard Knuckles Other Weaknesses : Needle Cannon , Top Spin Description : Top Man is easily the simplest Robot Master in the game to defeat .To Defeat Top Man ...Top Man is a very , very easy Robot Master to defeat , especially if you have the Hard Knuckles , although he is simple enough ( maybe even simpler for those with the quick trigger finger ) with the regular old arm cannon .As I described above , Top Man fights strictly upon the basis of a pattern .He shoots his tops in the air , they spin for a bit , and then quickly shoot down upon Mega Man .That 's Top Man 's easiest way to damage you , so avoid damage by those by waiting until the last minute before they come down on you , and then sliding to avoid getting hit by them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.17835"}
