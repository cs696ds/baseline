Mitt Romney , his primary competition for the votes of religious conservatives , in ways both subtle and overt , while raising questions about Romney 's Mormonism and touting himself as a \" Christian leader . \"Romney responded earlier this month with a speech defending not only his own religion , but also asserting his own belief that religious faith had a place on the public square .It 's unclear whether it did him much good .It certainly did not deter Huckabee from continuing to harp on his Christianity .His latest gambit is a disarming television ad that seeks disingenuously to tone down the debate for the holiday season while still talking about the primacy of \" the birth of Christ \" while a cross - like image hovers over him in the background .It remains to be seen if this revival tent act can win Huckabee Iowa or any other state .He may turn out to be a 2008 version of Howard Dean , whose Democratic star peaked in late 2003 and then plummeted to earth with a scream in the Hawkeye state .Should the Republicans actually nominate Huckabee , there 's little doubt that almost any Democrat would dispatch this evolution - doubting foreign policy ignoramus in a landslide .But even if all Huckabee gets is a Dean - like 15 minutes of front - runner status before being consigned to the dustbin of history alongside Blaine and Burchard , the ensuing debate about the role of faith in politics is still worth pondering .In a riposte to Romney , Anti - Defamation League head Abe Foxman blasted Romney for the \" subtext \" of his defense of the separation of church and state .Comparing Romney 's stand with John F. Kennedy 's famous 1960 speech , in which JFK answered those who opposed the election of a Catholic to the presidency , Foxman said that there was a big difference between the two .While Kennedy disavowed any impact his faith might have on his politics or his decisions as a leader , Romney made it clear that while religious tests are abhorrent , he had no intention of running away from his faith .\" I will take care to separate the affairs of government from any religion , but I will not separate us from the God who gave us liberty .Nor would I separate us from our religious heritage , \" declared the candidate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.943344"}

Joseph Lieberman , whose message embracing faith was earning him ecumenical applause as the Democrat 's vice - presidential candidate .Though it was largely lost amid the hallelujah chorus sung for Lieberman 's historic achievement , Foxman then saw a danger in the popularity of this faith talk .As with Romney , Foxman took Lieberman to task for flaunting his religious observance and his status as a person of faith as being a credential for high office .The Faith Card Though the ADL 's position certainly speaks to the fears of both religious minorities and secularists who worry about the future of church - state separation , it is tone deaf both to the sensibilities of the American people and the reality of our politics .One need not agree with either of their very different political platforms to understand that the point here is there is a big difference between the likes of Lieberman and Romney , and that of a Huckabee .The former are men whose faith informs their consciences and policy decisions , and who rightly understand that Americans consider these to be trustworthy attributes .The latter is one who employs religion to trade on prejudice .Contrary to the strict separationists , religious liberty in this country is not based on what philosopher Will Herberg once described as the \" naked public square , \" in which faith is unwelcome .Though atheist books are the literary rage this season , the idea that the unique blessings of American freedom stem from a hostility to faith is an absurd misreading of history .Our experience as oppressed minorities in Europe may have bred in Jews a phobia for public Christianity , but that 's irrelevant to present - day America where it is believers , rather than unbelievers , who are more likely to stand up for Jewish rights and Israel .In 2008 -- as has been the case in the past -- the ability of American voters to understand the difference between principle and prejudice is something that we can all have faith in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.28311"}

Rick Perry has aligned himself with some of the most extreme figures on the Religious Right and embraced a troubling sectarian vision for the country .The relevance of African American Heritage Month . \" don gold teeth in the style of rappers from the Los Angeles suburb of Compton , eat watermelon , and dress in baggy athletic wear .\" For anyone who thinks that we are living in a post - racial age where racism is no longer a factor , let me just say , if nothing else convinces you of the gross inaccuracy of this belief , you need to understand the noose .You need to understand that the noose -- a symbol of lynching -- a reference to lynching black bodies -- is in no way funny or innocent or parodic .It is racist .And I know I have said that we should try not to use the \" R \" word because people do n't hear us .But let me repeat : .The noose is a symbol of racism .It is a racist symbol .It is a symbol that conjures up centuries of racial violence enacted against African Americans in this nation by white supremacist forces .It was used , quite literally , during the reconstruction and post - bellum era as a means of domestic terrorism and violent control .There is an entire history behind the symbolism of the noose in American history directly tied to the experience of being black in America that means if you did n't know this history , well , you should .Your education is far too incomplete .Which is why there is a need for February to be recognized as African American history and culture month .It is why if I were ruler of the world , there 'd be a mandatory black studies class at some point during every K-12 student 's life .But I do n't want to end on too hopeless a note .Because despite the ugliness at UCSD , the students did not let the racist statements , spoken and unspoken , go unchallenged .They pushed back .They spoke out .And they did it as a multiracial student body .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.37773"}

Bush - and I 'm not calling him that snarkily , note well - blundered the nation into its worst foreign policy disaster since Vietnam .And all his personal decency did not stay his hand as a torturer .Jimmy Carter was probably one of the most decent men ever to hold the office , but it availed him nothing as a leader .Gerson cites Richard Nixon 's paranoia as an example of how a president 's temperament can affect his performance in office .He 's right : character really is destiny .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.12837"}

Chris Christie Wednesday named a state advisory panel on the judiciary , making good a promise to swiftly replace a group that quit in protest last week .The previous Judicial Advisory Panel panel resigned en masse June 2 in response to Christie 's decision to replace state Supreme Court Justice John Wallace Jr.The governor 's spokesman said then that the panel members would be replaced \" in short order . \"\" I wanted to act quickly to fill the panel with qualified individuals of high integrity and reputation so that the panel would have no interruption in performing its function , \" Christie said Wednesday .The new seven - member panel will be chaired by former Justice Peter Verniero , whose own Supreme Court nomination and tenure were marked by controversy .Verniero said he 's looking forward to \" an important task , \" promising to \" offer the governor our candid assessment \" on potential Superior Court judges .Former Gov. Christie Whitman nominated Verniero to the Supreme Court in 1999 , then pushed his nomination through hostile Senate confirmation hearings - even though the New Jersey State Bar Association rated him unqualified for the state 's top court .Verniero eventually earned a reputation as a respected jurist , but he later came under fire when a state Senate committee accused him of covering up racial profiling by the State Police when he was attorney general .Verniero denied that charge .He resigned from the court in 2004 , sidestepping the political storm that was expected if he sought lifetime tenure on the court .Supreme Court justices in New Jersey serve seven - year terms before almost always being nominated for lifetime tenure .Christie became the first governor in six decades to not reappoint a sitting justice .He nominated Morristown lawyer Anne Patterson to replace Wallace last month , but Senate Democrats have pledged to block any confirmation hearings for the next 22 months , when Wallace would have had to take mandatory retirement at age 70 .Christie 's decision was roundly condemned by many prominent members of New Jersey 's legal world , although Verniero did not join eight other former justices in criticizing the governor .The previous panel said the governor 's views are \" inconsistent with an independent judiciary \" by casting aside Wallace , a \" jurist who indisputably exemplified all of the qualifications for honorable judicial service . \"Sen.

{"text": "4:8 , changing \" received gifts \" to \" gave gifts \" to fit his theological purposes .Often , the idea of prophesy is merely claimed , such as \" he shall be a Nazerene \" when no such prophesy has ever been found in The Bible .I wrote the above to point up that simply arguing for the existence of God proves nothing in relation to religion , since \" theism \" is NOT a religion but an abstraction .Religions are particular , and as soon as one comes out of the lofty clouds of theology and deals with the particular claims of religion they fall apart .The only reason Christian theology even exists is because the Bible is supposed true in some sence , and specifically Jesus is supposed to have fulfilled prophecies .Christianity takes talking snakes literally , and then interperets King Solomon drinking from his wifes navel in Song of Songs to be a metaphore for the love between Christ and the Church .These are the reasons , among others , that people such as myself are not convinced by Christianity or any religion ( and I trust that you as a Christian are aware of the problems of other religions ) .NOT because we woke up and decided one day that \" hey , I do n't like being told what to do \" or because we have a \" fallen \" understanding .William , you reason within a Christian conceptual framework , and the ( ostensible ) logic you employ to prove the scriptures \" false \" betrays a fundamentalist understanding of scripture .Were you a fundamentalist before you became an atheist / agnostic ?William Drewery writes : \" Atheists and agnostics such as myself tend to care quite a bit about Truth .\" I think we have to distinguish between different kinds of truth .In many cases religion is true at least in a poetic or literary sense .In other words , when humans want to say something really , really important about existence , they do n't write philosophical propositions ; they tell stories .The power of the story , the beauty of the story , is what grips people .In that sense , what Michael said is true : \" Atheism is more than anything else a failure of imagination .\" They then weigh religion in that balance and find it wanting .But to me , that would be like someone asserting that a rainbows are not beautiful and compassion for others is not morally good , because there is no instrument that can measure beauty or moral goodness .But of course not , and most of the things that are important to humans - namely the whole universe of meaning and value - can not be measured or demonstrated to rational satisfaction .That said , religious belief is also problematic .Because religions do n't just say that religion is true in a literary sense , but also in a real , historical sense .For example , Christians would say that the virgin birth is not just a beautiful , meaningful story , but also a story that is historically true - that it describes something that happened in the real , physical world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.183395"}
