{"text": "The Puerto Rico Supreme Court agreed to hear the dispute in both cases and consolidated them .\" It is hard to overstate the legal , practical , and political implications of [ the Puerto Rico Supreme Court 's decision ] , \" the lawyers wrote .\" It strips Puerto Rico of the ability to enforce its own criminal laws without federal interference . \"Unlike states and Native American tribes - which have their own inherent sovereignty under the Constitution - Puerto Rico is a territory , as it has been since the United States seized it from Spain in 1898 .Some have argued that the island gained a level of sovereignty when it adopted its own constitution in 1952 , making it something between a state and a territory .Others contend that any powers Puerto Rico 's government has must come from the US Congress , and therefore it is not sovereign .This tension is at the heart of the statehood debate that has raged for decades in Puerto Rico , and the court 's decision will have a lasting impact in determining Puerto Rico 's actual political status .\" That 's one of the central political issues here . \"Rivera explains that the political divisions that drive Puerto Rican politics hinge on the island 's status .On one side , statehood advocates argue that only statehood will give Puerto Rico parity in the eyes of the US Congress .On the other side , those who favor a version of the status quo want to maintain the semi - autonomy that exists today .A small minority advocate full independence .If the court rules that Puerto Rico is not a sovereign entity , and that its power derives from the US Congress and not from the Puerto Rican people , then the argument in favor of the status quo will suffer a major blow , Rivera says .Arguments for maintaining the commonwealth status have already been undercut by the island 's current economic disaster and massive emigration problem , which stem in part from the inequities it suffers under its territorial status .Their argument that Puerto Rico enjoys privileges beyond those of a US territory would receive another big blow if the Supreme Court ruled against them , making statehood ( or full independence ) a more attractive option to bring the island a degree of stability . \" As a practical matter , any statement the Court makes suggesting something beyond territorial status for Puerto Rico ... is fraught with potential political ramifications .\" Rivera , the law professor at the University of Puerto Rico , says the court 's decision will be parsed in a million different ways by the island 's political class and manipulated in support of a variety of arguments related to statehood , independence , or status quo .But , overall , it might help bring some clarity to the long - running debate about the island 's true status .\" The one thing I see as positive with all these developments is that people are talking more about the issue , \" he says .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.98274"}
