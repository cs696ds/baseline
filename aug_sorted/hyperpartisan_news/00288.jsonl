Bush and other administration officials , counter that they believe the FBI can change , that its shortcomings are fixable and that Mueller 's reforms will work in the long run .They also argue that a successful war against terrorism demands that law enforcement and intelligence are closely linked .And they maintain that the FBI is institutionally able to provide an integrated approach , because it already combines both law enforcement and intelligence functions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.719852"}

{"text": "Polarizing Primary Fights Leave Hole in Center of Presidential Race .It is an accepted truth in politics - one well supported by polling data - that the largest share of Americans fall neither on the ideological left nor the right , but rather somewhere in the center .Yet you would n't know that from the debate in this year 's primary campaign , which so far feels especially polarizing .Which leads to two questions : Why does it feel that way , and will that dynamic change once voting actually gets rolling ?By most readings , a big chunk of voters are n't comfortable with either the liberal or conservative wings of the two major parties .The latest Wall Street Journal / NBC News poll found that 37 % of voters classified themselves as \" moderate , \" a higher share than called themselves either liberal or conservative .Only 11 % called themselves \" very liberal , \" and 16 % \" very conservative .Yet the primary season seems to be drawing the two main parties away from the center and toward those outer wings .In the Democratic race , Sen. Bernie Sanders - a self - identified democratic socialist who scored a 95 % in the most recent ratings from the liberal organization Americans for Democratic Action - has pulled longtime favorite Hillary Clinton to the left on issues such as trade and taxes .In the Republican primary , the race is being dominated by Sen. Ted Cruz , a full - throated movement conservative , and billionaire Donald Trump , who holds a checkered ideological history but has moved steadily rightward on issues such as abortion , taxes and health care .Candidates generally considered more mainstream and moderate - former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush , New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich - lag well behind .The hole in the moderate middle is wide enough that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has begun pondering whether the conditions are right for a presidential run as an independent , centrist candidate , though history suggests such efforts are difficult at best .To some extent , it 's normal for primary elections to draw candidates toward the ideologically charged activists in their parties ' bases , who are the most energized players early in any campaign season .But the trend seems especially acute in the 2016 cycle .Here 's one big reason for that : More Americans actually are severing their ties to the two main parties , which they see as ineffective .In doing so , they are leaving the presidential primary process to be dominated by the more ideological activists of the left and right .A study of voter registration in the most politically competitive states by Third Way , a think tank of moderate Democrats , found that between the 2008 and 2014 election cycles , the share of Americans registered as independents grew by 17.4 % .Meanwhile , Democratic registration decreased by 4.8 % while Republican registration grew by just 3.3 % .Similarly , a new Gallup study released this month finds that 42 % of Americans now identify themselves as political independents , dwarfing the shares who call themselves Democrats ( 29 % ) or Republicans ( 26 % ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.312237"}

Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had one more retirement home rumble before New Hampshire residents flock to the polls Tuesday .In some areas , the two candidates showed great respect for one another , along with agreement on some policy issues .At other times , the gloves came off and things got a bit testy .NBC 's Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow moderated the debate .Bernie Sanders opened by saying that millions are leaving political process because they know the economy is rigged .The top one percent is reaping the benefits , and there 's a corrupt campaign finance system is keeping that system in place via donations to super PACs .We need to work to create an economy that works for all .Hillary Clinton said that we could get back on the right track , where wages reflect people 's work .I 'm fighting for people , and I 'm not making promises I can not keep .Clinton said that she shares a lot of policy goals with Sen. Sanders , like fighting for universal health care .She said that she wants to build on the progress we 've made .I do n't want to rip away coverage for Americans .She added that she believes in affordable college , but thinks free college is a bit of a pie - in - the - sky initiative .She respectfully noted that many of Sanders ' policy ideas are unrealistic .Sanders , of course , disagreed , noting that he 's known Clinton for 25 years and respects her very much .But he cited Canada , France , and other industrialized nations having health care systems that consider such benefits as a fundamental human right .He did n't accept the position that U.S. can not do the same here .Oh , and to pay for tuition - free higher education , he plans to tax Wall Street .Moreover , he denied that he would dismantle Obamacare , adding that the Affordable Care Act been good for the country .But also mentioned that 29 million still have no insurance , some are under - insured , and we need to move forward with a health care for all agenda .When asked about the meaning of being a \" progressive \" by Rachel Maddow , Clinton hit Sanders for voting against the Brady bill five times and the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act .The Brady bill established a national background check system for firearms purchases , while the PLCAA offered a legal shield to gun manufacturers from being sued if their guns are unwillingly and unknowingly used in felonious activities that result in fatalities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.645233"}

Barry Goldwater on the right and George McGovern on the left got their bases excited in the 1964 and 1972 presidential elections respectively , but got decimated in the general election .She asked what 's his general election strategy .Sanders said that Democrats win when there is a large voter turnout .Republicans win when people are demoralized , which is why they love voter suppression .Our campaign can create enthusiasm from working people and young people .If there is a large voter turnout , we will win and retain the White House .Clinton added that she 's the strongest person to take on the Republicans , and hopes to nab Sanders ' supporters in the future .MSNBC did ask Clinton about her email fiasco .Prior to that she said that she 's been vetted , and that there 's hardly anything you do n't know about her .She also said that she 's confident she would survive any attack against her on this issue .The former first lady also noted that past Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice had classified information in their email accounts .She was \" 100 percent \" confident that she would survive , even with the FBI investigating whether she mishandled classified information , while repeating that claim that she never sent or received any sensitive information .The rest of the debate concerned the water crisis in Flint , what issues they would tackle first in their possible administrations , and the death penalty .So , this is the state of the Democratic race .Two old people , one with far - fetched ideas that are so exceedingly expensive , they 're never going to become law , and another whose possible legal troubles are so great that there 's no way she could get anything substantive passed .One 's a self - described democratic socialist , the other trying to come off of a left - of - center pragmatist , though many have noted that she 's really a strong doctrinaire liberal ; she just does n't want to alienate voters .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.38989"}

At the same time , the FBI conducted criminal investigations of the murder of civil rights workers , inclduing the 1964 slayings of voting registration workers Michael Schwerner , Andrew Goodman and James Chaney in Mississippi .Most of Hoover 's FBI clandestine activities were not revealed until after the director 's death in 1972 , after 47 years in power .His immediate successor was acting Director L. Patrick Gray , whose time in charge was cut short by the Watergate scandal .The FBI was charged with investigating the break - in of the Watergate Hotel and attempted spying of the Democratic Party by Republican operatives .Suspicions circulated around Washington as to Gray 's role in the conspiracy , which damaged his effectiveness in leading the bureau ( Gray was never indicted on any charges ) .He was replaced in April 1973 by another acting Director , William Ruckleshaus , a former Congressman and the first head of the Environmental Protection Agency .Ruckleshaus was merely a stop - gap measure until Clarence Kelley was appointed in July 1973 .Kelley , a former Kansas City Police Chief and twenty - year FBI agent , wound up serving five years as the head of the FBI , during which time he had the task of refurbishing the bureau 's tarnished reputation .In 1978 , William Webster took over the helm of the FBI during the administration of President Jimmy Carter .The Webster era at the FBI was marked by a series of high profile law enforcement campaigns that helped people forget about the bureau 's dark days .A rise in international terrorism led to the FBI taking on a larger role in counterterrorism efforts and investigating attacks and hostage - taking incidents involving U.S. citizens .Espionage cases also became big media stories with the FBI helping to capture spies such as former Navy officer John Walker and former National Security Agency employee William Pelton .Another expansion of FBI duties occurred with the Reagan administration 's War on Drugs .Webster strengthened the FBI 's response to white - collar crimes , especially cases of public corruption involving politicians .FBI agents investigated members of Congress ( ABSCAM ) , the judiciary ( GREYLORD ) and state legislatures in California and South Carolina .The FBI also uncovered instances of fraud that lay behind many of the savings and loans failures of the 1980s .In 1984 , the FBI acted as lead agency for security of the Los Angeles Olympics .In preparing for the Olympics , the bureau established the Hostage Rescue Team ( HRT ) , a special force designed to handle the kind of tragic events that marred the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.47007"}

Bruce Bielaski became the new Bureau of Investigation chief .Over the next few years , the number of Special Agents grew to more than 300 , and these individuals were complemented by another 300 Support Employees .Field offices existed from the bureau 's inception .Each field operation was controlled by a Special Agent in Charge who reported to bureau headquarters in Washington , DC .Most field offices were located in major cities .However , several were located near the Mexican border where they concentrated on smuggling , neutrality violations and intelligence collection ( regarding the Mexican revolution ) .When the US entered World War I , the bureau 's responsibilities grew to include activities involving espionage , Selective Service and acts of sabotage .Bureau agents also assisted the Department of Labor by investigating enemy aliens .As part of this work , a young man named Herbert Hoover was hired to work for the Justice Department .A graduate of George Washington University 's law school , Hoover , in his mid - twenties , helped lead DOJ 's enemy alien operations during World War I and , in the General Intelligence Division under Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer , assisted with investigating suspected anarchists and communists .In 1919 , William J.

Freeh 's relationship with Republicans on Capitol Hill .Freeh was extremely popular with GOP members because he proved to be no friend of Democratic President Bill Clinton .And although they criticized FBI lapses at Ruby Ridge , Waco and in the Olympic Park bombing case , Congressional Republicans refrained from criticizing Freeh and the bureau 's key leadership .By the beginning of the 21st Century , the FBI suffered from a serious lack of modern technology .As Director Freeh prepared to depart the bureau , the standard - issue FBI computer was the outdated 386 or 486 PC .Even worse was the state of the FBI 's database .The bureau 's Automated Case Support ( ACS ) system , a centralized database designed to store and aggregate the mass of information FBI Special Agents assembled in the course of investigations , was plagued by problems from the start in 1995 .The system lacked the complex cross - referencing tools that investigators needed to conduct complex data - mining that could have tipped off Special Agents about the plot to hijack American commercial airliners on Sept. 11 , 2001 .In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks , the federal government 's investigation into what went wrong was especially critical of the FBI .As lawmakers debated what changes to implement , the very state of the bureau was threatened .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.30044"}
