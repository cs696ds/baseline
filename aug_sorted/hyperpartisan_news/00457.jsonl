' \" Scott said .I would say you should have that meeting - it 's called a teachable moment .\" What do you think ?Well here is what I see that is different .\" Part of what is going on with Scott and Russell is the concern from some in the Lakers ' camp that Russell is a little too full of himself , that his ego is too big , and it could become a problem .So they are trying to take him down a peg .I would say that for a smart player - and Russell is that - the game is humbling and will take care of the ego issue .But you 've got to give him run to develop him .Play him , and then communicate with him .It 's a system that does worth with modern players .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.85821"}
