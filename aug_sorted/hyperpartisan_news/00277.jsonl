{"text": "This naturally bears significantly on my question about the Churches of Christ 's theological relationship to mainstream evangelicalism .Hughes writes : .At the outset of this book , I suggested that the central story of Churches of Christ over the course of almost two centuries was its slow evolution from sect to denomination .A sect is by definition estranged from the culture in which is lives and from the religious bodies that reflect the culture 's values , and it typically stands in judgement on both .A denomination , on the other hand , has made its peace both with the dominant culture and with the larger Christian community .( Hughes , Reviving , 254 ) .At work here are definitions rooted in the church - sect typology but with particular emphasis on the issue of the religious group 's relationship to the culture 's values .In the typology per se , the relationship to the culture is one important factor but not the overruling definitional issue .Such a perspective inevitably generates a countercultural lifestyle \" ( Hughes , Reviving , xii ) .It is worth noting that , outside the church - sect typology , that is to say , in common English usage , denomination has a less specific meaning : .Likewise , sect has a broader usage : .A denomination , then , is merely a religious subgroup with distinguishable beliefs and practices .A sectarian denomination is a separatist religious subgroup , meaning it defines itself over against those from whom it separates .The trick here is to recognize the paradox of the definition : the sectarian claims not to be a subgroup but rather to be the only group truly representative of the religion .Thus , while the religious outsider and the non - sectarian denomination both describe the religion in broad terms , the sectarian describes the \" true religion \" in terms of the particular issues over which he separates from the mainstream .A denomination may be sectarian in the basic sense whether it has capitulated to the dominant culture or not .Yet , because Hughes uses sectarian in the sense of cultural separatist , and because evangelicalism has experienced church splits and separatist retreats over issues closely connected to cultural changes , it is necessary to distinguish between ecclesial sectarians , cultural sectarians , and the combination of the two .The problem , demonstrated primarily by Hughes 's vague use of worldview , is that the Churches of Christ 's relationship to the culture is more complicated than his use of the church - sect typology can represent .Because his thesis about the apocalyptic worldview is the heart of his historical analysis , this a major issue .That he conceives of the major historical dynamics in terms of worldview is his most important insight ; that he fails to work out the implications of worldview is the book 's greatest weakness .All together , though , he has pointed us in the right direction .In this post , I will try to demonstrate that , despite unique influences and periodic emphases , evangelicals and Restorationists have been adrift in the same worldview waters from the beginning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.4505"}

{"text": "One important way societal change seems possible is learning examples of other societies , as has occurred with liberation movements within and between societies ( e.g. , Alquwaizani , 2011 ; Lynch , 2012 ) .The bunching of protest movements in time suggests that they inspire each other as people recognize the similarity of their oppressions .For example , eastern European rebellions against the U.S.S.R in 1956 and in 1989 were chained in time , as are the Arab uprisings starting in 2010 .Another means of recognizing new possibilities is to reinterpret dominant ideologies .The re - analysis of Christian tenets once used to legitimize the African slave trade made it reprehensible and helped to prompt the abolition movement ( Lysack , 2012 ) .True ideological innovation , not just cross - fertilization or reinterpretation , is also possible ( e.g. political Islam , transnationalism ) , though potentially much more difficult given hegemonic statist liberalism among the most powerful states and international organizations ( Ikenberry , 2011 ) .But even when such innovation fails or disappoints or is destroyed by opponent forces , it leaves mainstream traces , as minorities and subordinates often do ( e.g. , continuing support for socialism in Europe and elsewhere after the demise of communism as a global ideological contender ) .Social dominance theory recognizes that within societies and even across societies , some institutions serve a hierarchy - enhancing function and others serve a hierarchy - attenuating function .However , it has not detailed how people change institutions , nor the mutual influence between hierarchy - enhancing and hierarchy - attenuating institutions , although it predicts oppositional adjustment and spreading consequences .For example , Khavul , Chaves , and Bruton ( 2013 ) describe how people who rejected the ideological assumption that the poor are \" unbankable \" established microfinance organizations in Guatemala .By providing small loans to very poor people , who rarely defaulted , these non - profit organizations demonstrated to large , regulated commercial banks that they were missing a market share .The banks then began to compete with microfinance organizations both in customer services and by demanding that microfinance organizations be regulated like banks .These institutional interactions with poor people are prompting them to establish savings accounts for the first time .Change in both hierarchy - enhancing and hierarchy - attenuating directions , at micro- , meso- , macro- , and meta - levels , are apparent .Social dominance theory predicts that Guatemala 's overall wealth and ethnic hierarchy will be maintained .The complexity of how people and institutions interact fits the dynamic systems and historical change views of social dominance theory , but these are not compatible with assuming that societal structure will not change substantially .At the very least , the non - hierarchical nature of the microfinance organizations and Christian base communities provide people with a more egalitarian and cooperative model of an institution than their post - colonial dictators have .Alternative ideologies are also important for prompting people societal change .During the 20 th century , the alternative ideology of feminism was enacted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.218605"}

Michael Craven .The latter half of the 20th century has seen the emergence of two extremes in the American Church and its relationship to the culture - liberal revisionism on the one side and conservative fundamentalism on the other .Both , I contend , have hindered the work and ministry of the Church .One renders the Christian faith meaningless while the other makes it irrelevant .Liberal revisionism has capitulated to contemporary culture and with it many truths of the historic faith .Liberal revisionism ultimately renders the Christian message meaningless by reducing Christ to anything you want him to be - there is simply no authority in this view beyond your own preference and cultural whims .My concern herein however is not for liberal revisionism but conservative fundamentalism , which has become the predominant view .Additionally , unlike liberal revisionism , conservative fundamentalism remains Christian but a distorted version of it that is often difficult to distinguish .A recent conversation with Os Guinness offers this further insight : .I think Os puts this well when he describes fundamentalism as \" an overlay \" which , as a result , has captured the thinking of many unwitting Christians .This is frequently expressed in terms of conservative politics , Christian nationalism and what one Evangelical writer revealed when he referred to the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount as \" Americanisms . \"Being Christian and being American are often thought to be synonymous .Practically , these expressions are manifest in the almost exclusive reliance upon coercion and politics as the means and method of bringing culture under the influence of biblical principles .The idea is that if \" we \" can only capture political control we can bring about cultural change in a way that recovers biblical values .Cal Thomas refers to this as expecting the \" Kingdom of God to arrive on Air Force One .\" There is no doubt that secularism has achieved its pinnacle in our time , however this does not mean that Christianity was the singular prevailing reality that occupied its place prior to this point .More accurately , the Church in America , much like the Israelites of the Old Testament , has been cyclical with periods of spiritual apathy punctuated by periods of great Awakenings and faithfulness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.28252"}

George Marsden has described the postwar reorientation of fundamentalism in substantial detail in his landmark study Fundamentalism and American Culture .Like Barton Stone , most fundamentalists descended from a distinctly Calvinist heritage and concerned themselves preeminently with the question of God 's sovereignty over human culture .In the late nineteenth century , faced with the rise of Darwinian evolution , biblical criticism , and the new psychology that explained God chiefly in terms of human need , many of these Calvinists saw little evidence of God 's rule over American culture .They saw instead a yawning chasm separating the kingdom of God from the world in which they lived .In a word , the fundamentalist worldview prior to World War I often resembled rather remarkably the worldview I have described in this book as the Stone - Lipscomb heritage within Churches of Christ .( Hughes , Reviving , 254 - 256 ) .Hughes is right that Churches of Christ and fundamentalists share a common worldview and that two groups did not \" suddenly \" acquire this commonality , but it is not the case that they came into a common cultural orbit only after World War I. They were always in the same orbit .The rest of Marsden 's historical analysis of evangelicalism and fundamentalism read alongside Hughes 's work clarifies this fact .In other words , while Restorationism 's particular agenda developed out of evangelicalism , from the perspective of worldview analysis the movement did not leave evangelicalism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.81067"}

O. Beardslee , and he had worked as a missionary in Jamaica earlier with a different group .This time there was some success at first , but it soon dwindled to nothing , and the mission was shut down .Thus ended the only three missionary efforts attempted by the ACMS even though it continued to exist in some form for another fifteen years after the Jamaica effort was ended .What can we conclude about the ACMS and the Campbellites regarding the American urge toward foreign missions ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.67001"}
{"text": "And yet , the Orthodox Christian civilization , starting from the same theological premises as that of the West , never developed liberalism .In fact some have asserted Orthodox cultures have an anti - democratic orientation ( Samuel Huntington distinguishes Orthodox civilization from that of the West ) .The example of Byzantium suggests that political freedom is not an inevitable product of putative salvation bequeathed by civilizational ( or individual ) baptism .But the cold grey vision of the second Rome was restricted only to the eastern half of the Christian tradition [ 4].It is in the West that we look for the seeds of liberalism .Christianity may still be a contingent variable without which liberalism may not take root , but I think we have established that it is not the sole variable - Christianization does not lead to inevitable liberalism .This precedent of a \" non - governmental organization \" seems likely to be important for the development of other sectors of civil society , the guilds and the free cities in which they took root .The idea of feudalism , and the complex interconnection of relationships between the various estates that distributed power , perhaps maintained the modus vivendi in western Europe of a plurality of states both in practice and in theory .On an aside , it must be noted that Tang China between 600 and 850 was witness to the growth and rise of an enormously wealthy Buddhist clerical establishment that served as a rival power structure to the Son of Heaven .It is often asserted as a truism that while impersonal Roman Law was not vigorous enough to resuscitate the Roman Empire , the Confucian tradition of personal judgement by a Mandarin elite unified by a common classical education was able to reunify China and recreate their Golden Age .But while the Roman state continued only in the form of a ghost , its cultural influence as a binding glue between the various ethnos and later states balanced with a new state of de facto political pluralism was more fruitful in the long term .The web spun by the West , a multifaceted nexus of religion , historical happenstance , geography and tribe is very difficult to untangle .I can not even enumerate the many times I have disputed with those that make a strong case for the overwhelming importance of Christianity in setting the context for the liberal order .And yet these same individuals can not dispute that historically Christianity has been used to justify every political arrangement possible , and for periods of time abetted autocracy .As a theoretical assertion , the enlightened and liberal Caesar and Christ have little to do with each other .But , Christianity does not exist in isolation from the culture around it , and vice versa .I think a compelling , entertaining , though never overwhelming , case can be made for Christianity 's importance in the formation of the liberal idea .The more practical question is this , those of us who are liberals , both Christian and non - Christian , must ask ourselves , should we promote Christianization of cultures that are historically despotic ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.67265"}

{"text": "As an integrative theory , social dominance theory has described how aspects of human psychology interface with the shared meaning systems and institutions of culture to reproduce the hierarchical structure of societies ( Pratto , 1999 ) .Social dominance theory therefore makes a different assumption about the stability of group - based dominance hierarchy than the Marxist concept of revolution , and a different assumption about the possibility of bringing about equality through democracy or \" social change \" than much of social science does .However , some readers misconstrue social dominance theory as not allowing neither for dynamism within societies , or for change in societies over time ( e.g. , Huddy , 2004 ; Jost , 2011 ; Turner & Reynolds , 2003 ) .By detailing the processes that social dominance theory posits , we demonstrate that neither claim is accurate .We do , however , take issue with social dominance theory 's assertions that group dominance is natural , inevitable , adaptive , and due to human inherencies ( e.g. , Sidanius , 1993 ) .Because social dominance theory views human societies as self - organizing and self - perpetuating systems , its view of societal change is complex .Dynamic social systems by definition have different \" components \" that influence each other across levels ( e.g. , Vallacher , Read , & Nowak , 2002 ) .As dynamical systems , human collectives must be understood by delineating how the multiple levels of organization within group - based dominance hierarchies interact .Like many social science theories , social dominance theory has micro- ( often person ) , meso- ( often group , institution , or local community ) , and macro- ( often societal ) levels of analysis .Social dominance theory emphasizes the interactions among these levels and how they tend to consolidate effects , reinforce each other , correct each other , and adjust to each other .This , theoretically , is what makes group - based dominance hierarchies work as dynamic systems , resistant to substantial changes in form , but flexible enough to withstand changes in economic production and in cultural ideologies and norms .In fact , it is impossible to describe any aspect of the theory without invoking multiple levels , as the following summary will show .We will also propose a novel addition to the theory : a meta - level of relationships among and across societies .All designations of what constitutes a \" level \" are arbitrary .Nevertheless , to follow common theorizing ( e.g. , Silbereisen & Tomasik , 2010 ) , let us suppose that the smallest ( micro ) level of organization is the person .Social dominance theory has considered how the person 's social learning , cognitive , motivational , and identity processes contribute to the likelihood of a person stereotyping , feeling prejudice , and discriminating ( e.g. , Pratto , 1999 ) .This general orientation is called social dominance orientation ( SDO ; Pratto , Sidanius , Stallworth , & Malle , 1994 ) .People 's level of SDO corresponds robustly to their likelihood of endorsing legitimizing ideologies , including racism , sexism , nationalism , and about powerful and weak groups in general ( e.g. , Lee , Pratto , & Johnson , 2011 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.55606"}

{"text": "Although , as we have shown , social dominance theory has part of the theoretical apparatus to explain societal change via dynamic systems , there are significant unaddressed issues .Incorporating theories of rhetorical strategies , communications , and norm changes may be theoretically useful and prompt new research ( e.g. , Liu & Mills , 2006 ) .Another unaddressed issue is to explain power dynamics between groups in more detail .Power basis theory explicitly recognizes that there are different kinds of power ( e.g. , access to resources , violence ) , and that they are fungible ( i.e. , can be transformed ) .The extent to which one is free to use power in this way , or is relatively unhampered by fungibility constraints , is a new metric for power .Integrating this new perspective to examine intergroup relations as social dominance theory does would prioritize discovering which kinds of power are most available to dominant and subordinate groups , and how transferable , fungible , and fertile different kinds of power are for dominant and subordinate groups .The interlinkages between kinds of power that power basis theory specifies could lead to a more accurate understanding of the complexity of intergroup power dynamics .For example , by exercising border control , Israel also exercises economic control over the Palestinian territories , so its use of force power also enacts economic power over Palestinians .By tactic , resource control and violence are linked .But although Israeli violence can be met ( more weakly ) by Palestinian violence , the same reciprocation can not be achieved in terms of resource control .And yet , when Israel exercises resource control , as it has to extremes in the siege of Gaza , it loses international legitimacy , a source of diplomatic power .Power basis theory thus specifies a more fine - grained way of theoretically describing and measuring power dynamics as they pertain to human lives across levels ( Pratto , Pearson , Lee , & Saguy , 2008 ) than social dominance theory 's opposing forces tenets .Although there is considerable evidence that in proto - imperial societies , group dominance is maintained by institutional discrimination , cultural ideologies , and force ( Sidanius & Pratto , 1999 ) , these do not guarantee that dominance is maintained .Rather than viewing failures of dominance as aberrations , we suggest considering what aspects of dominance systems set the conditions to destabilize dominance .Some of these have already been identified .Pratto and Stewart ( 2012 ) argued that power differences between groups prompt salience of own - group identity , and attachment to groups , which lead subordinated people to reject group dominance .Likewise , capitalism increases inequality , and increased inequality may de - stabilize social systems .When meso - level groups tire of being subordinated in macro - systems , they sometimes have been able to gain more autonomy ( e.g. , First Nations , Quebec ) , separation ( e.g. , Sudan ) , and even independence ( e.g. , U.S. , Afghanistan , Congo ) .Even the institutionalization of group favoritism through law can beget opposition to dominance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.8938"}

{"text": "SDO , in turn , sometimes interacts with people 's immediate social context to influence whether their behavior promotes or attenuates social hierarchy .One form of confluence concerns individuals ' SDO and the ideologies in their social context , including ideologies shared by other people and those that are normative within institutions .People 's SDO levels often correspond to how hierarchy - attenuating or hierarchy - enhancing their habitual environments , such as their jobs , are ( e.g. , Pratto & Espinoza , 2001 ; Pratto , Stallworth , Sidanius , & Siers , 1997 ) .This implies that one 's associates are likely to reinforce one 's own ideological biases in influencing one 's discriminatory behavior ( Pratto et al . , 1999 ) .Another kind of interaction shows that context can attenuate the effects of people 's pre - measured SDO on prejudice , discrimination , and ideological endorsement .Pratto and Shih ( 2000 ) found that when they made group threat distinctions salient , people expressing high levels of SDO become more implicitly prejudiced and people expressing low levels of SDO become less implicitly prejudiced than when group threat was not salient .Hodson ( 2008 ) found that British prisoners expressing high levels of SDO especially reduced their racial prejudice when given more contact with prisoners of other races .Umphress , Simmons , Boswell , and del Carmen Triana ( 2008 ) made either White women ( Experiment 1 ) or Black men ( Experiment 2 ) the most qualified applicant for a job .High SDO participants were less likely to hire the most qualified candidate than low SDO participants , unless an authority figure instructed participants to hire the most qualified candidate .Levin et al .( 2012 ) manipulated how normative three different ideologies in the U.S. concerning ethnicity - assimilation , color - blindness , and multi - culturalism - were said to be , compared with an untreated control condition .They found that the three ideologies mediated the influence of SDO on general ethnic prejudice ( i.e. , against Latinos , Asian - Americans , Black Americans , Arab Americans ) .People who expressed higher levels of SDO endorsed assimilation , which predicted more prejudice , whereas people who expressed lower levels of SDO endorsed color - blindness and multi - culturalism , which predicted lower prejudice .Making the hierarchy - attenuating ideologies of color - blindness and multi - culturalism normative eliminated the association between SDO and prejudice .Similar findings were reported by Pratto et al .( 1999 ) , who found that priming participants with either noblesse oblige or meritocratic ideologies in a job task reduced the influence of SDO on discrimination in allocating resources , compared to an untreated control condition .Such experiments show that the way people 's current social contexts invoke their psychological habits influences how their behavior in turn shapes social hierarchy .Further , the causal relationship between SDO and intergroup hostility can be reversed : Brown ( 2011 ) found that the experience of service - learning reduced college students ' levels of SDO .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.87659"}

H. M. in his \" Notes on Genesis , \" we can not refrain from quoting him : . \" The most trivial and the most important , the most likely and the most unlikely circumstances are made to minister to the development of God 's purposes .In chapter 39 Satan uses Potiphar 's wife , and in chapter 40 he uses Pharaoh 's chief butler .The former he used to put Joseph into the dungeon ; and the latter he used to keep him there , through his ungrateful negligence ; but all in vain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.03367"}

{"text": "Rather than viewing bi - directional experimental effects as inconclusive , these make theoretical sense because processes at each level influence processes at other levels through feedback .That is , individual psychological processes and socio - political contexts are mutually influential within a self - perpetuating dynamical social system .Institutions are the most influential meso - level actors in maintaining inequality ( e.g. , Feagin & Feagin , 1978 ) .Institutions often control more tools of dominance ( e.g. , money , weaponry ) than individuals do ( e.g. , Pratto , 1999 ) , and institutions guarantee that certain functions are served , regardless of which individuals perform them .Institutions and legitimizing ideologies are persistent , but not unchanging .The flexibility of racist ideology ( e.g. , Gossett , 1997 ) is mirrored by how the legal system produced , mutated , and reproduced racism in different historical periods and cultures .In the U.S. , for example , racism via the legal system mutated from anti - miscegenation laws to chattel slavery ( e.g. , Fredrickson , 1988 ) through Jim Crow , desegregation ( e.g. , Allen , 1994 , 1997 ) , and resegregation ( Quadagno , 1994 ) .Social dominance theory adds that organizations and institutions serve different functions regarding hierarchy maintenance .This fact is a substantial reason that social dominance theory is not merely an account of processes that are regressive or bolster the status quo , as Jost ( 2011 ) has claimed .These functions , rather than their domain or organizing principle , determine whether institutions are considered hierarchy - enhancing or hierarchy - attenuating .For example , because most financial institutions are in the business of helping people who have money to make more money , social dominance theory classifies them as hierarchy - enhancing .Some financial organizations though , like credit unions and Grameen - type banks , serve poorer people , which makes them hierarchy - attenuating .Consistent with this functional conception of institutions and the flexible view of ideologies , institutions can co - opt the rhetoric of the opposition without changing what consequences they actually have vis - \u00e0 - vis inequality .For example , large commercial banks have recently adopted community lending agencies ' agenda to \" serve the poor , \" often with disastrous consequences for the poor and large profits for the banks ( Rugh & Massey , 2010 ) .Rather than relying on their contents to determine whether ideologies are hierarchy - attenuating or hierarchy - enhancing , social dominance theory has provided an empirical standard for testing how ideologies function in any given context .Ideologies that positively mediate the influence of SDO on support of hierarchy - enhancing practices or rejection of hierarchy - attenuating practices are hierarchy - enhancing .Ideologies that negatively mediate support of hierarchy - enhancing practices or rejection of hierarchy - attenuating practices are hierarchy - attenuating ( e.g. , Pratto , Sidanius , & Levin , 2006 ) .In the absence of data from individuals , historical analyses about the effects of ideologies can be used to classify their functions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.31259"}

{"text": "Most of the processes social dominance theory has identified operate within societies ( macro - level ) .The cohesion of societies stems from institutions and cultural meaning systems , both of which transmit patterns of behavior and ideas over time , space , and particular people .This analysis works for functioning , stable societies .In this section , for the first time , we specify features of the broader context of societies which help stabilize or destabilize hierarchical societies .Leaving aside natural disasters , which can change societies ' organization and functioning , we focus on the social aspects of people 's context , including economic activity and distribution , population in relation to resources , cohesion , and trust .If societies have sufficient access to resources , they can maintain their form if they are fairly isolated or inaccessible .Both very hierarchical and less hierarchical societies have maintained lengthy stability under such isolation .For example , the Great Wall of China and several natural barriers allowed Chinese society to remain relatively unchanged for centuries .Physical enclaves can become cultural enclaves .For example , Australia 's over 600 indigenous languages indicate that hundreds of separate tribes co - existed separately and in peace for at least 50,000 , and perhaps for 65,000 , years - the longest continuous cultures in human history ( Australian Government , 2008 ) .Moreover , Australia did not have group - based dominance hierarchy until it was colonized by the British , a point to which we shall return .The resource pool must serve the population at hand , but the size of communities and their demographic composition changes , sometimes rapidly .Due to increased longevity , population size and distribution is expected to have global consequences that will change the age system , and is already prompting migration from nations with younger populations to nations with older populations ( e.g. , Bloom & McKinnon , 2010 ) .Demographic changes can radically alter societies , including their structure .For example , Tuchman ( 1978 ) argues that the Black Death , which decimated Europe , made labor so scarce that this epidemic undermined the feudal system .Inter - societal encounters may entail the spread of disease , technology , cultural practices , ideas , and family structure .Such changes often cause people to redefine what they consider their \" society \" to be and how it is organized and governed .In fact , every particular \" culture \" or \" society \" is time - bound , and all \" boundaries \" for identifying a distinct society , whether linguistic , cultural , ethnic , geographic , economic , or political , are blurry .Further , the physical local environment can change naturally , due to human activity , or to their interaction .For example , Iraq is desertified because the long history of irrigation that produced the \" fertile crescent \" of Mesopotamia salinated the soil ( Jacobsen & Adams , 1958 ) .Terrestrial reflection makes clouds above it less likely to rain , producing a positive feedback loop for desertification .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.53168"}

N. Declaration of Human Rights ( UNHDR ) presumes that the rights of individuals ( micro - level ) are granted or curtailed through national citizenship ( macro - level ) .The right to redress of individuals ( micro - level ) is only realized by governments ( macro - level ) .People who are not recognized as citizens of nations in which they live ( within a macro - level ) may also not be recognized as persons with rights by other nations ( meta - levels ) .For a person to leave his or her country , another country must be on good enough terms with the home country to allow that person entry .Micro - level rights only exist when recognized at the macro - level ( national ) and at the meta - level ( international ) .This interlocking of the micro- , macro- and meta - levels does not prevent societal change .A number of individual- and social- psychological processes ( micro - level ) contribute to change at the societal level ( macro - level ) and also to global ( meta - level ) changes .Conversely , societal and global changes are influencing people 's values and expectations .Both directions of influence can be seen in several studies that consider global trends and compare nations and people in them .Firebaugh ( 2003 ) documents that with greater international trade , nations are growing more economically equal to each other but inequality within them is markedly increased .Such global ( meta - level ) and within - nation ( macro - level ) changes , in turn , influence meso- and micro - level group and psychological changes .A meta - analysis of group differences in SDO found that differences between men and women and between dominant and subordinate arbitrary set groups were larger in societies with more individualist and egalitarian values ( Lee et al . , 2011 ) .This finding suggests that where norms are egalitarian , salience and disapproval of inequality make people in subordinated groups more cognizant of and more overtly opposed to their subordinated positions than in societies in which inequality is more normative ( see also Leach , 2002 ) .Societal - level objective movements towards equality and people 's rejection of inequality as a value have a positive feedback loop .Seguino ( 2007 ) showed that as gender egalitarian norms increased around the world during the 20 th century , gender disparities in power within societies have decreased .Hence , feminist ideals put into action ( social change as praxis ) have increased women 's power .Similarly , Guimond ( 2008 ) argued that as gender equality norms spread , women are more likely to view men rather than women as their social comparison standard and demand better treatment , higher wages , and more power .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.7992"}

A & B are cousins , but diverge sharply in a host of phenotypes , while A & C are close matches - perhaps close enough that many would think them siblings though they lack much shared ancestry ( relatively speaking ) .An ancestral relationship would give a false impression of congruency between individuals A & B , while ignoring the similarities between A & C. The key is probably to simply not use any one standard universally , in populations effected by the same selective pressures ancestry is still important .But where a whole host of phenotypic traits tend to separate two groups with a recent ancestral history , we might be inclined to be more careful about using neutral markers to guide us .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.50163"}

Wilkinson as cited in Goriunov , 2012 ) or sixth - century Europe ( Wallerstein , 1974b , 1990 ) , together with the spread of racism ( e.g. , Gossett , 1997 ) .Proto - imperial histories demonstrate that many ideologies of hierarchy , such as nationalism , sexism , and military glorification , can be trans - societal .Even neoliberal statism and adherence to the notion and forms of international regulation were largely adopted across the world due to both active enforcement and passive modeling by the West ( Agnew , 2009 ; Ikenberry , 2011 ) .As such , we view social dominance theory as better at explaining how dominance can be maintained than why it exists or is common .There is reason to question whether group - based dominance hierarchies will remain common as societies .At present , revolt , ethnic and religious \" nationalism , \" and globalization threaten the nation - state as the most viable societal form ( e.g. , Herbst , 1997 ) .The current trend is toward the break - up of large nations ( e.g. , U.S.S.R. ) into smaller , more homogenous nations that gain power ( Herbst , 1997 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.5963"}
