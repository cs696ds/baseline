{"text": "But it 's very easy to use .Consolidating my domains with my wife 's account turned out to be more troublesome than I expected .For one thing , GoDaddy has a domain proxy service that allows domain holders to keep their contact information private .While this is convenient , there are two issues .One , they charge extra for this service while most other domain providers do not .Two , if you have the domain proxy service active , you can not transfer your domain to another provider .You have to unsubscribe from the proxy service , allow your contact information to become visible again , and only then can you initiate the transfer .I did n't really have a problem with that .What I did have a problem with turned a simply domain transfer task into a two - day aggravating war of words with GoDaddy support .You see , one of my domains had an old email address .The address , in fact , was on the domain I had recently allowed to expire , and which instigated this mess in the first place .Here 's where it gets interesting .Years back , GoDaddy instituted a policy that prevented domains from being transferred to another registrar for 60 days after the WHOIS contact information had been updated .Well , I could n't transfer the domain without switching the contact information to a live email address .Pointing this out to GoDaddy will get you nowhere .The corporate line is , \" You agreed to the terms .\" They will not acknowledge the fact that the terms are unenforceable because they violate ICANN policy .They simply keep repeating the mantra that you chose to opt - in .I could n't get the transfer authorization code because I had to change the email address , and I could n't change the email address without accepting their illegal policy , which would negate the ability to transfer the domain .This is n't the only ICANN policy they violate .A quick Google search finds plenty of shady practices they 've been committing since the company was founded .There used to be a site called NoDaddy , which kept track of all of the dirty dealings , along with a message forum for visitors to relate their horror stories .I do n't understand why NoDaddy would have capitulated like that , since Bob Parsons is still CEO of GoDaddy in spite of the company sale , and it 's still business as usual over there .Holding domains hostage from being transferred , from a business standpoint , is financially sound .There 's less customer turnover if you make them wait for 2 months before they can take their domains away from you .By that time they are too tired to bother fighting it , or may have even forgotten about it .I was n't about to let them off the hook .I reported GoDaddy to ICANN , although I am not holding out hope that they will actually do anything .ICANN is notoriously lax in actually enforcing its own rules unless a major corporation or an entire country starts demanding action from them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.87523"}

{"text": "It is n't .It 's evil pure an simple .LATEST MUSIC .RSS .SEARCH .Iranian women 's groups and other rights organisations are fighting a much discussed proposed law which they say would encourage polygamy by allowing a man to take a second wife without the permission of the first in certain circumstances .The proposal comes at a time when the country has been rocked by protests , in which women have played a major part , following the disputed re - election last June of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .Although Sharia law permits a man to take up to four wives , polygamy is not widely practiced in Iran and women have enjoyed greater rights and freedoms than in some other Muslim countries .At present , an Iranian man needs his first wife 's permission to take a second .A so - called Family Protection Law , proposed by the government in 2008 , said a man could marry a second wife on condition only that he could afford both wives financially .The parliament dropped that clause following a wave of opposition from women but is now reconsidering a different version of the provision .The spokesman for the parliament 's Judicial and Legal Commission , Amir Hussein Rahimi , announced recently that the commission had now approved article 23 of the proposed Family Protection Law that said , \" A man can marry a second wife under ten conditions .\" You have to realize that when Gholi refers to himself and \" several other people \" he means the discussions that he has with his multiple personalities , both on and off - line .That is how he has reached this conclusion .FYI , if one posts an article , one should be able to support the post in the comments section .It is not a question of telling you what to post and not to post !If you post something about Israel with regard to Holocaust , book burning , etc we can compare it to IRI ...Also it is a liberal space where people have FUN .I 'm not trying to be brilliant but factual .Like you I do not like Hate Speech but if you are confused about what constitutes Hate Speech then complain to JJ .I noticed that you had flagged IranFirst 's comment but it has remained .You will find nothing here is hate speech , but free speech .Actually I am far too busy to come to IC but find the site fun , I sneak a look in it now and again in breaks , and I like to support fellow Iranians in the Green Movement .It is a critical time .So tough luck if it makes you insecure !If you think I or others have broken any rules please report us to JJ .In fact it is interesting that you accuse others of attacking you personally when you are accusing them of being Israeli Agents .That is all I have to say to your immature rant .PS : When you learn to spell my name correctly I will start referring to you by your new avatar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "151.9389"}
