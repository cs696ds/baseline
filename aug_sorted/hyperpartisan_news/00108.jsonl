Cuomo has praised Obama for abusing Presidential Powers .Gov. Cuomo has a lackluster record on properly vetting important issues as we saw with the SAFE - Act and minimum wage .No executive should be abusing his authority as a way to sidestep a legislature that , in large part , does not support these initiatives .President Obama 's actions place a heavy financial and social burden on law - abiding firearm owners in exchange for pursuit of his ideological agenda .Western New York is filled with legal firearm owners who love to hunt , target shoot and buy , sell and trade firearms .Furthermore , rural citizens use firearms for home protection , especially in places where police are many miles away .The founding of our nation and the 2nd Amendment are inextricably linked and should never be suppressed in exchange for one man 's political pursuits .I am deeply disappointed in the decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals ' Second Circuit to uphold the core provisions of the NY SAFE Act .This legislation infringes on the constitutional rights of gun owners across New York State and is clearly unconstitutional .My district alone is filled with thousands of law - abiding citizens with firearm ownership as part of their family 's traditions .This law disrespects their way of life and hinders their ability to defend themselves in the unfortunate event of a burglary or break - in .Aside from the facts that this law is arbitrary to a fault and lacks the enforcement mechanisms to make it effective , the process by which it was passed through the Legislature is deeply troubling .The SAFE Act was passed under cover of darkness on one of the first days of the legislative session , and I can attest to the fact that few members of the Legislature had even read the bill before it was voted upon . \"As lawmakers , we are supposed to hold transparency and accountability in the highest magnitude .The SAFE Act was forced through the legislative process with complete and utter disregard for these objectives and should be repealed immediately .I will continue to sponsor legislation that repeals this unconstitutional measure and places integrity above political ambition . \"Honor Flight Network is a nonprofit organization created solely to honor America 's veterans for all their sacrifices .The group transports veterans to Washington , D.C. , to visit and reflect at the memorials of the various wars .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.65941"}

Valeo let stand the FECA contribution limits , but struck down the spending limits because of free speech considerations .The Court also invalidated regulation of money spent on ads that do not explicitly suggest a vote for or against a candidate , known as \" issue ads . \" McCain - Feingold was passed in part as an attempt to close this \" soft money \" gap in campaign regulation .In declaring this part of McCain - Feingold unconstitutional 1 , the Supreme Court chose not to distinguish between corporations and actual persons for the purposes of free speech in campaign spending .This case did not establish corporate personhood , but broke from a line of precedent that did allow for limitation of corporate intrusion into elections .And although it is true that getting money completely out of politics is impractical , and not even desirable , it is absolutely true that getting corporate money out of politics is critical .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.536835"}

{"text": "I should probably qualify that .Some of the Libertarian paring down ideas and reforms make sense , as you need to have an efficient government that has the right economic incentives for people to be productive and to clear the job market .I am not an anarchist .I see no reason that we should practice the economics of a developing country as we are not without resources and we have a well developed infrastructure that is valuable to businesses , which we should use to our advantage .I studied politics in Africa and the AIDS villages in China so I am pretty leery of the factors that go into extreme political dysfunction .I am well aware of the benefits of having a K-12 education system , which includes science education .I feel we could even expand the curriculum to include logic and more math literacy .So companies have an incentive to invest here long term .Where I agree with the Libertarians is that I am not sure if everyone deserves unlimited support for industries that are becoming obsolete because they do not want to update their skills .I do not believe in industry wide welfare .I think if the dependency rate gets too high we may not be able to reverse it .I do not think we are in an immediate crisis , but we could get there over time if we do not make small changes now .Expanding economic polarity however is really not helping things , the Republicans have left the world of sound economics ... .Lately I am leaning towards the Democrats , I do n't agree with every faction in their party , but they seem to be gaining the majority of the people who want to fix things .So it seems to be where the debate is currently .Adam .Are n't those arguments AGAINST the Terrorist label rather than for ? 'Terrorist ' is an overused term - to the point now it realistically means little more than ' other ' .Better to call a spade a spade - it was murder - he s a murderer .In their press release , the Tea Party could n't even wait a paragraph between offering condolences and saying that they will be unfairly blamed .Even their condolences , which went something like \" though Giffords is a liberal , this is a sad day \" barely passes for sincere .We need to be mindful to avoid whitewashing this tragedy .Though it is painful and uncomfortable to draw these distinctions , Loughner would not have been motivated to kill Giffords were it not for conservative vitriol .He did not after all , shoot up a strip mall or engage in random shootings because he 's a psychotic violent man .It was a political targeting , and the national violent vitriol of the Far Right is fair game for criticism .A necessary step before wholesale confinement and murder of political opponents can proceed unimpeded is to gain a measure of public acceptance .Thus , before red - haired people can be exterminated , red - haired people must be demonized .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "126.93624"}

'Unfortunately , this now places tacit restrictions on ' free speech ' .In a world where words should frankly mean what they ought to mean , this statement is , unfortunately , 24 carat bullshit .If we wanted speech to come with one or more restrictions ( which responsibilities are ) , then we would call it ' restricted speech ' , not ' free speech ' .It also begs the questions , where is this list of ' responsibilities ' , and who in the name of Frigga is the person who came up with this list ?If it even exists at all ?How do I get on the panel that gets to change or amend this list of ' responsibilities ' ?Is the English language the poorer for people stuffing around with it like this ?There are other bits of special pleading that people will come out with which effectively says , ' Dikkii , it is n't really ' free ' .We just use the term to sell a particular package of speech guidelines that we like and use of the word ' restricted ' is not clever marketing .

'Well , yes it does , actually .Placing yet another restriction on freedom of speech , we gradually move further and further away from the dictionary definition of what ' free ' means .In its purest form , and I 'm using the Oxford here , the adjective ' free ' means : . \" ... able to act or be done as one wishes ; not under the control of another .\" I 'm sorry , but a restriction , whether it be crowded theatres or anything else , has been imposed by someone , and therefore not only can one not act ( in this case , speak ) as one wishes , someone has imposed a control .And the English language is indeed the poorer for this .It gets worse , too .Some of my old school buddies are fond of getting nice and condescending with the lovely old clich\u00e9 , ' I may not agree with what you 're saying , but I 'll fight for your right to say it .
