{"text": "California is the Ghost of Federal Government Future .During the last two decades , the Golden State has been transformed from what was once known as the nation 's most anti - labor outpost to a state essentially run by public - sector unions .Nearly three in five publicsector workers are unionized , compared to less than two in five public employees in other states .The Democratic Party , which is fully in hock to unions , has controlled the legislature and most statewide posts , with the notable exception of the governor 's mansion , for more than a decade .That means more government workers , higher salaries , and drastically higher pension costs .According to Adam Summers - a policy analyst at the Reason Foundation , the nonprofit that publishes this magazine - the state 's annual pension fund contribution vaulted from $ 321 million in 2000 - 01 to $ 7.3 billion last year .According to public databases , more than 5,000 people are drawing pensions in excess of $ 100,000 from the state of California each year .So pervasive is the union influence that big labor does n't even try to defend its deleterious effects on California 's finances .Just before the special election , a member of the Los Angeles Times editorial board asked Service Employees International Union chief Andy Stern to respond to charges that unions are the 21st - century equivalent of the railroads that were once all - powerful in California .Stern verbally shrugged : \" I think democracy is an ugly thing at times .\" That ugliness has made the California budget , like those in most of the other 49 states , less efficient and more bloated .Government spending , unlike spending in the private economy , is a zero - sum game - especially on the state level , since governors ca n't print money .Every dollar spent gilding a pension is a dollar not spent funding an orphanage .Naturally , the same elite outlets that were busy blaming voters after the election spent even more time detailing the horrors of the \" annihilating cuts , \" as the Los Angeles Times called them in a news article , that were coming down the pike .( In early June , the paper invited readers to be shocked that a high school with 3,200 students would have to make do with just three guidance counselors . )Bloated pension costs and the increasingly inefficient provision of state services received a fraction of the coverage .The federal government is now run by a president and Congress more responsive to union concerns than any in at least two decades .The same bloat currently bogging down statehouses and city halls is being duplicated in boomtown Washington , D.C. President Barack Obama even brought Andy Stern in to help warn Schwarzenegger that federal stimulus money would not be disbursed to California unless the governor rescinded some proposed state job cuts .Though that threat was later withdrawn , Schwarzenegger at press time was pushing for a measly work force reduction of 2 percent .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "42.613304"}

Sean Parnell .If approved , the initiative backers would then need to collect 23,800 more signatures statewide to put the idea on the 2008 ballot .If voters approve it , the initiative would create a system in which candidates could forgo private campaign contributions for public funding .Money for the clean elections fund would be provided by a three - cent tax per barrel of oil produced in Alaska , according to the initiative 's proposal .-- Proposed initiative targets ' clean election ' campaigns .March 28 , 2007 .Ohio : \" Liberal group challenges backers of 2004 gay marriage amendment \" .A liberal advocacy group asked the state 's elections chief Wednesday to investigate whether backers of a 2004 gay marriage ban properly reported all the money they received and spent during the campaign .Citizens for Community Values , the Cincinnati - based group behind the Ohio Campaign to Protect Marriage , immediately dismissed the claims by ProgressOhio.org as unfounded .The constitutional amendment the group backed , which passed overwhelmingly , was credited with turning out Christian conservative voters who tipped the state 's presidential results to President Bush .In a letter to Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , ProgressOhio executive director Brian Rothenberg said the numbers did n't add up in a review the group conducted of campaign finance reports for various entities linked to the 2004 marriage campaign .March 22 , 2007 .Arizona : petition drive starts to amend Independent Redistricting Commission law .Capitol Media Services reports : Some former state lawmakers and their allies want voters to revamp a 7-year - old law on how congressional and legislative districts are drawn in hopes of creating some more competition at the general election ballot box .But the head of the Arizona Republican Party said it 's simply an effort by a well - heeled Democrat to get more members of that party elected .An initiative drive formally launched Wednesday would revamp the Independent Redistricting Commission which actually draws the lines every decade , adding four new members .That change will ensure there are people from more parts of the state .January 19 , 2007 .California : Monterey activists circulated petitions in English , not Spanish .The Monterey County Herald reports : Slow - growth advocates on Thursday trumpeted the first victory in their effort to head off enactment of the Monterey County general plan update .In 10 days , the backers of a referendum challenging the county 's new general plan have gathered more than 9,000 signatures , enough to qualify under election law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.61424"}
