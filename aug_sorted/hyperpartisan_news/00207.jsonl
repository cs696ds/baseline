{"text": "A former U.S. attorney in San Diego , Calif. , Bersin said the escalation of violence in Mexico is a result of President Fel\u00edpe Calder\u00f3n 's crackdown on drug cartels .The violence has claimed the lives of U.S. consulate workers in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez , Mexico , and smugglers are suspected in the death of an Arizona man March 27 on his border ranch .But incidents of violence in U.S. cities near Mexico can not be compared with the level of lawlessness across the border , Bersin said .\" When we say ' spillover violence ' we are speaking of the kind of violence that we are seeing in Mexico that we have n't seen in the United States .That 's not to deny the reality of violence that 's attributable to organized crime based in Mexico , \" Bersin said .Mexican officials say drug violence has claimed the lives of nearly 18,000 people since Calder\u00f3n 's crackdown began in 2006 .Ju\u00e1rez emerged as a battleground last year , and a wave of gunbattles and executions beginning in February in the northern Mexican states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le\u00f3n prompted the U.S. State Department to issue a travel warning there .Texas officials , including Gov. Rick Perry and Sens .Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn , have asked the Obama administration to send the National Guard and other resources to the border .Cornyn said Bersin 's claim of \" no spillover violence is evidence that the Obama administration is sticking its collective head in the sand with regard to the safety of our border communities . \"Bersin and Cornyn are in agreement , however , that border security should not impede legitimate trade .Bersin said prescreening of travelers and shippers could help take pressure off border crossings .U.S. trade with Mexico exceeds $ 1 billion per day , according to U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk .Even with prescreening , land ports of entry on both borders need $ 6 billion in upgrades and repairs and 5,000 more customs agents , said Monica Weisberg Stewart , a McAllen businesswoman who chairs the Texas Border Coalition committee on border security .The coalition is a group of community leaders from Brownsville to El Paso who act as a lobbying arm for border cities and chambers of commerce .\" The proof is in the pudding , \" Weisberg Stewart said .\" Let 's see him put the resources and manpower at the ports of entry . \"About Me . is a grassroots coalition of groups and individuals united in our belief that a border wall will not stop illegal immigration or smuggling and will not make the United States any safer .It will do irreparable harm to our borderlands and our country as a whole .We urge our elected representatives to reject the border wall and repeal the Secure Fence Act and the Real ID Act .Obama puts forth border plan similar to Bush 's .In this Friday , Jan. 19 , 2007 file photo , A National Guard unit patrols at the Arizona - Mexico border on Friday , Jan. 19 , 2007 in Sasabe , Ariz.", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.723072"}

{"text": "Those delays are now raising doubts about a government plan to extend fencing to 370 miles of the Mexican border .The Bush administration , under pressure to tighten border security , wants all 370 miles done by the end of next year .The Homeland Security Department has yet to say where it will build fences in California , Arizona and New Mexico .And the only proposal made public so far -- for Texas -- drew immediate criticism and is being reworked .Opponents worried it would limit access to the Rio Grande , damage the environment and infuriate Mexicans who cross the border to shop and visit .The 1,952-mile border stretches over sensitive terrain , including two national wildlife refuges in Arizona .And negotiations for land owned by scores of ranchers and Indian tribes may be challenging .Democratic Rep. Silvestre Reyes of Texas predicted the construction of so much fencing will be a \" huge problem , \" noting opposition among many residents and even some Border Patrol field leaders who would prefer the money be spent on manpower and equipment .The San Diego fence , tilted 45 degrees at the top to deter climbers , starts at the coastline and stretches 14 miles inland .Construction began in 1996 , and there are still five miles to go .Until the mid-1990s , illegal immigrants had crossed in droves .They would slip across the border and huddle on U.S. soil as the handful of Border Patrol agents assigned to the area watched from a distance .When night fell , they ran for it .\" It was a never - ending battle , and we were losing very badly , \" said Don McDermott , a Border Patrol supervisor who worked the area in the 1980s .The nine miles of fencing completed so far have had a dramatic impact , along with more manpower and stadium lighting .Arrests are way down in San Diego , but traffic shifted to Arizona deserts .Those people who do make it across are increasingly desperate .More immigrants are attempting to swim across the border or crawl through crude tunnels , said Raleigh Leonard , supervisor of the Border Patrol 's Imperial Beach station .The final five miles of fencing in San Diego will cover some of the most rugged terrain and most sensitive habitats on the border .For example , to fill an area called \" Smuggler 's Gulch , \" crews are expected to move nearly 3 million tons of dirt -- enough to fill about 100,000 giant dump trucks .Border Patrol officials say they need a fence in the gulch because its urban surroundings give agents limited time to catch people before they melt into the local population .But environmentalists worry that shifting dirt will spill north into a federally protected estuary , disrupting a key stopover for more than 370 species of migratory and native birds .A 2005 law giving the federal government authority to waive all rules prohibiting fence construction prompted a judge to dismiss a legal challenge to the San Diego fence .The law should help smooth the way elsewhere along the border , too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.74837"}
