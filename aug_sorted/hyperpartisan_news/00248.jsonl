Rick Perry for president .But not only has Fox given Arpaio an unparalleled megaphone , it has also largely closed its eyes to reports that his Maricopa County office allegedly mishandled hundreds of sex - crimes cases on his watch .As the Associated Press reported on December 4 : .The 13-year - old girl opened the door of her home in this small city on the edge of Phoenix to encounter a man who said that his car had broken down and he needed to use the phone .Once inside , the man pummeled the teen from behind , knocking her unconscious and sexually assaulting her .Seven months before , in an apartment two miles away , another 13-year - old girl was fondled in the middle of the night by her mother 's live - in boyfriend .She woke up in her room at least twice a week to find him standing over her , claiming to be looking for her mother 's cell phone .In El Mirage alone , where Arpaio 's office was providing contract police services , officials discovered at least 32 reported child molestations - with victims as young as 2 years old - where the sheriff 's office failed to follow through , even though suspects were known in all but six cases .Many of the victims , said a retired El Mirage police official who reviewed the files , were children of illegal immigrants .Fox has asked Arpaio about the investigations only once - and this nearly two weeks after the AP 's report .On December 16 , Alisyn Camerota asked Arpaio about the issue .He replied in part : \" Phoenix police have 2,500 they have n't investigated .I do n't like throwing stones , but we did have a problem , we corrected it . \" A week earlier , Arpaio had stated : \" If there were any victims out there , I apologize to those victims - if there were any . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "40.489574"}

{"text": "Of those at risk , the authors estimate that roughly 15,000 females under nineteen were being trafficked for sex from those nations .Police Data .There are also national estimates from law enforcement sources about the number of juveniles taken into custody because of prostitution and related crimes .For example , the FBI 's Uniform Crime Report data analyzed by Snyder and Sickmund ( 2006 ) shows that 1,400 juveniles were arrested nationally in 2003 for prostitution and commercialized vice .These data come from aggregating data from most of the local law enforcement agencies in the U.S. , and are the same data used to estimate year\u2010to\u2010year estimates in violent and property crime .This is a plausible estimate of the number of youth arrested for prostitution and commercialized vice because , in truth , not many law enforcement agencies are actively arresting youth in regard to this problem , as a soon to be released CCRC study will show .But there is undoubtedly more prostitution involving youth ; law enforcement officials believe many youths involved in prostitution are arrested for other crimes ( e.g. , drug possession , curfew violation , etc . ) but not prostitution per se .Most observers believe also that there are also many youth engaged in prostitution who are never arrested by police .So , while this UCR estimate is plausible , no one believes this estimate fully characterizes the problem .It is rarely cited , even as part of a spectrum of estimates , perhaps because it would so lower the range as to make the higher estimates seem more extreme .Conclusion As the critique of estimates suggest , there is currently no reliable estimate of juvenile prostitution .Some current estimates are based upon \" gut hunches \" and \" guesstimates \" from almost thirty years ago .Others offer definitions of sexual exchange that may not actually constitute prostitution .Also , the methods used to create these estimates are often difficult to find , making them methodologically suspect .These organizations often recognize these problems but continue to cite such poorly calculated estimates .People concerned about the problem very much want there to be a number that they can cite .Because other people have cited numbers , there has come to be a \" collective intuition \" about the rough magnitude based on these earlier claims .But in reality there is little scientific substance behind any of them .This is not an uncommon phenomenon in social problem analysis and has been called the \" Woozle Effect \" ( Gelles 1980 ) .The \" Woozle Effect \" occurs when one writer reports an estimate based on a typically weak methodology or guesstimate that is subsequently cited by other writers , but without the first writer 's caveats ( Gelles 1980 ) .What are journalists and scholars to do ?It is our suggestion that in the absence of any estimates with any good scientific basis , that scholars , writers and advocates stop using the unsubstantiated estimates and simply indicate that the true incidence is currently unknown .It is very frustrating to write about a topic and not have an estimate of its magnitude , but we believe that continued citation of unsupported estimates gives them credibility .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.67204"}
