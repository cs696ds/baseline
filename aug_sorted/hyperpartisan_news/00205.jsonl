{"text": "The Supreme Court 's conservative justices tore into the Obama administration 's signature health - care law Tuesday and posed these questions : If the government can make individuals buy health insurance , why ca n't it make them buy cell phones or even burial insurance ?When they vote together , the five conservatives are a majority of the nine - member court .President Obama 's legal team went into the second day of oral arguments on the Affordable Care Act \" ObamaCare \" knowing they needed to win over at least one conservative justice to join the four justices who appeared more sympathetic to upholding the law .On Tuesday , achieving that goal seemed unlikely .At issue on Day 2 of three days of oral arguments before the justices was the health care mandate , the requirement that with few exceptions all individuals must have health insurance or pay a penalty via their income taxes .Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy , viewed by court watchers as possible swing votes , appeared worried that the mandate would raise the curtain on an era of unlimited congressional power to regulate all aspects of American life . \"Can the government require you to buy a cell phone because that would facilitate responding when you need emergency services ? \"Roberts asked Solicitor General Donald Verrilli , who argued the case for the Obama administration .Kennedy asked Verrilli : \" When you are changing the relation of the individual to the government in this ... unique way , do you not have a heavy burden of justification to show authorization under the Constitution ? \" Kennedy was referring to the Constitution 's commerce clause , which empowers Congress to regulate interstate commerce .Countering Verrilli 's argument that all persons are in the health - care market whether they like it or not because all people will get sick one day , Justice Samuel Alito asked Verrilli if the government should require people to buy burial insurance , since all people eventually die ?\" I do n't see the difference , \" said Alito , considered a likely vote to strike down the health care law .A health care study cited by the Obama administration found that cost shifting adds an average of $ 1,000 annually to premiums of those who have health insurance .Opponents counter that because it polices \" inactivity \" - not buying health insurance - the mandate exceeds the power of Congress under the commerce clause .On Tuesday , Paul Clement , the lawyer representing the 26 states ( including Texas ) that are suing the Obama administration over the health care law , said the commerce clause \" gives Congress the power to regulate existing commerce .It does not give Congress the far greater power to compel people to enter commerce , to create commerce essentially in the first place . \"Kennedy and Roberts also asked probing questions of Clement , who had been solicitor general for President George W. Bush .Much of the back - and - forth on Tuesday concerned the difference between requiring insurance when someone seeks out health care versus requiring it before that point .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.58601"}
{"text": "The law \" is requiring them to subsidize services that will be received by somebody else , \" Alito said .Verrilli argued that any healthy person is only a car accident or a cancer diagnosis away from needing hugely expensive health care .Requiring health coverage only when people become sick would blow a hole in the insurance industry 's risk - pool model and make health insurance unaffordable to many , Verrilli said .In response to a question from Justice Sonia Sotomayor , Clement acknowledged that requiring health insurance when people need it clearly would be constitutional , because it is an active economic decision that Congress can regulate under the commerce clause .Better to require purchase before that point , Verrelli argued , so everyone is chipping in to the risk pool while healthy .The result : Risk is spread out more evenly so costs are lower .Liberal justices did their best to help Verrilli , who seemed unsure of himself in the beginning .Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan focused on the cost - shifting issue , and how the unique nature of the health care market requires a pre - purchase of insurance for the system to work .After the two hours of arguments , opponents of the law were exultant .\" We knew that if we could get the court to agree to focus ( on how the law ) infringed on individual liberty , we had chance of winning , \" said Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott , who attended the court session .\" We were pleased to walk out of the courtroom today knowing that five justices of the United States Supreme Court focused their powerful questions against the U.S. government on that very issue . \"Sen. John Cornyn , R - Texas , who also was in the courtroom , said : \" As government grows , individual freedom shrinks .That 's what this case is all about .\" Supporters of the law said despite the tough questions , they were not in despair .\" It would be staggering for them to strike it down , \" said Joe Onek , a veteran Washington lawyer who served as counsel to Rep.

{"text": "The protesters sued , and won a court injunction , over the opposition of Trumps lawyers , prohibiting any future interference with protests outside Trumps offices .Trump does not apologize for what happened .Well , these guys were tough guys outside , Trump said of the protesters .They had a lot of problems .The incident , combined with the clashes at his rallies , raises questions about how a President Trump would handle public criticism in office .Disruptive protests of candidates are a feature of our current system , and for decades candidates and elected officials have simply waited them out .Asked if he questions the right to protest , he answered succinctly , No , not at all .I have protests .Asked if he could give assurances that even reporters he despised would keep their credentials for the White House briefing room , he said , Oh yeah , I would do that .It does nt mean I would be nice to them .I tend to do what I do .If people are nt treating me right , I do nt treat them right .But there is a larger question of how Trumps tough rhetoric and policies might change the country , and the world , in ways he does not directly control .In late August , after a Red Sox game , two brothers from South Boston allegedly awoke a sleeping 58-year - old Latino homeless man by urinating on his head .They hit him with their fists and a metal pipe .Police say one of the brothers later explained his actions by saying , Donald Trump was right .All these illegals need to be deported .Trump eventually tweeted a condemnation , after a reporter questioned him about his silence .We need energy and passion , but we must treat each other with respect , he wrote .I would never condone violence .But when asked months later if he worried that his continued aggressive rhetoric might lead to innocent people getting hurt or other human suffering , he seemed unmoved by the danger and unhappy with what he called a very unfair question .Are you ready ?he asked brusquely , a phrase he often uses to preface an impolitic remark .People are getting hurt .People are being decimated by illegal immigrants .The crime is unbelievable .There is no conclusive evidence that undocumented immigrants are more likely to commit violence than anyone else , a fact that Trump does not dispute .A September study by the National Academy of Sciences found that neighborhoods with greater immigrant concentrations generally have much lower rates of crime and violence .Foreign - born men ages 18 to 39 are incarcerated at one - fourth the rate of their -native - born peers .People are getting hurt far greater than something I am going to say , Trump continued .People are getting hurt by our stupidity .Landon Nordeman for TIMERelentless Cheerleader Trump brags about himself , dismisses his nomination rivals and talks tough about immigration and trade It seemed an important point of clarification , after months of escalating calls for confrontation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.71546"}
