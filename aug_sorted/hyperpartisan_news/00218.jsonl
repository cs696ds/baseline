Primakov , leader of the Eurasianist school of foreign policy and Boris Yeltsin 's spy chief , foreign minister , and prime minister .[ 6 ] .Both Russian domestic and foreign media policies incorporate anti - American rhetoric .This became readily apparent after Putin 's February 2007 speech at the Munich Security Conference .He stated , \" We are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law ....One state and , of course , first and foremost the United States , has overstepped its national borders in every way .\" [ 7 ] This speech set the tone for what would become the constant refrain of many approved commentators and Kremlin mouthpieces in the media .After the eruption of the global financial crisis , the Russian national leadership began to blame the calamity on the United States .For example , President Dmitry Medvedev said the crisis was caused by the financial \" egotism \" of some parties and that the crisis is a harbinger of the end of America 's global economic leadership .[ 8 ] The Russian media soon echoed this view .As prominent media analyst Daniel Kimmage has noted , if one watches Russian television regularly , a viewer could easily believe that the United States is the root cause of the financial crisis .This message is easy to disseminate because Russian television is under tight government control , similar to the media controls imposed in many Arab countries .[ 9 ]According to Kimmage , the Internet in Russia is subject to the greatest manipulation .[ 10 ] On the Internet , conspiracy theories about the United States proliferate , especially about the U.S. role in causing the financial crisis to hurt a rising and more economically prosperous Russia .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.750084"}

{"text": "Anti - Americanism as Entertainment .Anti - Americanism sanctioned by the government also infests other Russian social institutions .For instance , an elaborate anti - American movie genre has emerged in Russia , in which Americans make handy villains and American society has become a mere caricature .It is a powerful narrative , which reinforces the image of an immoral , foreign threat to Russian society .For example , Brother 2 , an action adventure blockbuster of 1990s , demonstrated the superiority of Russian moral values over American , while depicting the United States as degraded .The movie Aliens contrasts a group of highly immoral American doctors -- including homosexuals , pedophiles , and an unfaithful wife-- with courageous Russian sappers working in a Middle Eastern country .According to Russian experts , the movie was commissioned by the government .[ 15 ] .Russian cinematography also features slanted historical documentaries .For example , Lev Trotsky : The Mystery of the World Revolution seeks to establish that the White House and Wall Street , as opposed to the Imperial German General Staff , were involved in fomenting and funding the Bolshevik Revolution .Even the Russian Orthodox Church is a participant , releasing the documentary The Fall of an Empire : The Lesson of Byzantium [ 16 ] in January 2008 .The movie artfully compares the declining Byzantium to Russia during the 1990s .It warns against \" Western \" political reforms , which decentralized power , led to the rise of \" oligarchs \" in Byzantium , and caused its undoing .Youth Movements .Borrowing a page from the Communist political manual , the Kremlin launched a number of political youth organizations and movements , including Nashi ( Ours ) , Marching Together , and Young Guard youth movement of United Russia , the ruling political party headed by Putin .These youth organizations are loudly and violently pro - regime and often cultivate strong anti - American sentiments .One Nashi member declared , \" Our idea is to stop Russia from becoming a subsidiary of the USA and supplier of raw materials . \"[ 17 ] .Regrettably , the Russian leadership is using technological advancements , which are often thought to facilitate greater openness and communication , to advance top - down authoritarianism and nationalism .Information manipulation on the Internet and through other media acts as a force multiplier for anti - Americanism .This is especially true with the tech savvy youth , a group that is often mistakenly seen as inherently liberal and sympathetic toward the West .This is patently not the case with youth organized by the Kremlin or ultranationalists around a xenophobic agenda .Advancing the Russian Agenda in the West .The Russian leadership 's public diplomacy campaigns against the West are highly sophisticated and proactive .Russia Today ( RT ) , a television channel in English , Spanish , and Arabic , has become a highly effective public diplomacy tool .It regularly features Kremlin - supported commentators , who attack the political opposition in Russia and depict American policy in a negative light .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.653275"}
{"text": "Yet the idea of \" resetting \" the relationship between the two , as conceived by President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , rests on the profound fallacy that the current Russian leadership and the United States share common values .From the Kremlin 's perspective , anti - Americanism is a strategic tool for pursuing domestic and foreign policy goals .It has remained this way for almost the past 100 years .After World War II , Joseph Stalin denounced American \" imperialism \" as the enemy at the gate .In 1956 , Nikita Khrushchev infamously threatened the United States : \" We will bury you ! \"Since then , Soviet and Russian anti - Americanism has become a part of the Russian national psyche .Anti - Americanism is not confined to Russia alone .Russia is deliberately spreading this poisonous propaganda to neighboring countries through the Russian mass media , briefings , and conferences .This anti - Americanism also provides the glue that keeps together Russia 's de facto anti - American coalition with countries such as Iran and Venezuela .Some dismiss the constant flood of anti - Western and anti - American words and images as rhetoric for internal consumption .Yet just as their czarist and Soviet predecessors , contemporary Russian leaders view external propaganda as a full - fledged instrument in their foreign policy and national security toolbox .This has far - reaching implications for U.S.-Russian relations and the U.S. global image and can not be dismissed lightly .To oppose Russia 's strategic information campaigns , the Obama Administration and Congress should : .Use public diplomacy strategically to counter the flood of anti - American propaganda from the highest levels of the Russian government .U.S. public diplomacy should focus on reaching ordinary Russians .These efforts should include international broadcasting , Internet campaigns , the launch of a new Russian satellite channel , Web 2.0 social networking , print media , and revamped academic , student , and business exchange programs .Launch a comprehensive audit of Russian information operations in the United States .The U.S. needs to evaluate the extent and effectiveness of the Russian campaign in the U.S. media , understand its strategic implications , and counter disinformation where it exists .This research could ideally be performed by a new federally funded research and development center , a Corporation for Foreign Public Opinion Analysis , working with existing agencies , such as the CIA and the FBI .Remain committed to funding programs to consolidate the strategic gains made for freedom and democracy .The U.S. needs to support new U.S. allies in Central and Eastern Europe as well as Georgia and Ukraine to ensure that they remain solidly anchored in the West and do not slide back into Russia 's sphere of influence , which is a real and present danger .Respite , Then the Return of History .Anti - Americanism in Russia took a brief holiday after the fall of the Soviet Union .During the Yeltsin administration ( 1992 - 1999 ) , the United States and other developed countries provided immense financial and technical assistance to Russia to facilitate its transition to free markets and democracy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.56285"}
