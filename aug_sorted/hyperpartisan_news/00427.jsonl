{"text": "As Bill Clinton would often remind me : Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome is the definition of insanity .In 1985 , along with about three dozen governors , senators , and congressmen , I formed the Democratic Leadership Council ( DLC ) to analyze the party 's precipitous decline and make it competitive again in presidential elections .Our diagnosis was not earthshaking : When voters again trusted the Democrats to grow the economy and expand opportunity , to defend the country , and to support values most Americans believed in , they would turn to us for national leadership .During the New Deal era , Democrats were identified as the party that helped America recover from the Depression , saved the country and the world from fascism , and represented the interests and values of ordinary Americans .That identification was strong enough to hold together a party that was , in reality , a broad and disparate coalition that often disagreed on specific issues .The harsh reality of the New Deal era - the nine elections between Roosevelt 's in 1932 and Johnson 's in 1964 - was that it was the anomaly , not the norm .By the 1980s the Democrats had fallen back into their pre - New Deal ways .From 1860 to 1932 , Democrats were largely the remainder party of American politics - a confederation of disgruntled constituencies with little sense of national purpose .During that period , Republicans won 14 of 18 presidential elections .The only Democrat to win a majority of the popular vote was New York Governor Samuel B. Tilden , who lost the controversial 1876 election when an electoral commission appointed by Congress voted along party lines and awarded the election to Rutherford B. Hayes .The only Democrats to win the White House were Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson , who both won twice but never won a majority of the popular vote .Over those eighteen elections , Democrats averaged around 43 percent of the popular vote .In late 1987 in a speech in Houston , Charles S. Robb , then chairman of the DLC , articulated the historic plight of the party : .Except for the New Deal era , Democrats have won the White House only when the Republicans have split , gotten themselves embroiled in scandal , or presided over a national calamity .In fact , between the Civil War and the Great Depression , Democrats were less a national party than a rather feckless confederation of disparate and often aggrieved constituencies : white southerners , Midwestern farmers , and ethnic workers in the East .What held this improbable collection together was a common fear of being ground down by America 's transition from an agrarian to an industrial society .We became a party of protest , of habitual and seemingly permanent opposition .Franklin Roosevelt changed that .Under FDR , Democrats offered a broad agenda for economic and social progress .Policies begun under the New Deal and boosted by the war effort rebuilt the American economy , created the great American middle class , conquered fascism , and saved the free world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "46.007072"}

{"text": "It was the first time since 1952 that the Republicans secured control of both houses of U.S. Congress , which , with the exception of the Senate during 2001 - 2002 , lasted until the 2006 mid - term elections .Democrats had controlled both houses of Congress for the forty years preceding 1994 , with the exception of the 1981 - 1987 Congresses ( in which Republicans controlled the Senate ) .In the 1994 mid - term election , Republican congressional candidates ran on a platform of promising floor votes to force members of Congress to go on record on a series of popular reforms -- something the Democrats had stifled for decades .These measures and others formed the Contract with America , which represented the first effort to have a party platform in a mid - term election .Seven of the ten Contract items actually became Law .Democratic President Bill Clinton opposed some of the social agenda initiatives but he co - opted the proposals for welfare reform and a balanced federal budget .The result was a major change in the welfare system , which conservatives hailed and liberals bemoaned .One Contract item , which required Democrats in a two - thirds majority to pass a Constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress , failed .In 1995 , a budget battle with President Clinton led to the brief shutdown of the federal government , an event which contributed to Clinton 's victory in the 1996 election .That year the Republicans nominated Bob Dole , who was unable to transfer his success in Senate leadership to a viable presidential campaign .Ross Perot ran again ( this time on Reform Party ticket ) , once again draining away a large percentage of Dole 's support and insuring Clinton another term after the majority of Americans voters voted against him .With the election of George W. Bush ( son of former president George H. W. Bush ) in an extremely close 2000 election , the Republican party controlled both the presidency and both houses of Congress for the first time since 1952 .However , after Vermont senator Jim Jeffords left the Republican Party to become an independent aligned with the Democrats in June of 2001 , Republicans lost control of the Senate by a single seat .In the wake of the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the United States , however , Bush pursued a \" War on Terrorism \" that included the liberation of Afghanistan from the radical Islamist Taliban regime and the USA PATRIOT act .By early 2002 , the Taliban was removed from power in Afghanistan .On March 20 , 2003 , U.S. and allied nations initiated \" Operation Iraqi Freedom \" to liberate the Iraqi people from the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein .By May 1 , 2003 , the regime of Saddam was declared officially over .Once US and allied military forces entered Iraq , they discovered that various international terrorists had been given sanctuary by Saddam and ran their terrorist operations from Iraq .Notable terrorists found included Muhammad Zaidan aka Abu Abbas and Sabri Khalil al - Banna aka Abu Nidal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.19307"}

Mondale lost 49 states , the second 49-state shellacking in four elections .Only by winning the overwhelmingly Democratic District of Columbia and his home state of Minnesota by a mere 3,761 votes did Mondale avoid losing every state .The party of Roosevelt , Truman , and Kennedy had reached bedrock .Members of my generation , born around the Second World War and the end of Franklin Roosevelt 's presidency , grew up believing that Democrats were the majority party , the dominant party of American politics .We were the children of the New Deal era of American politics , an era dominated by Democrats and driven by Democratic policies .Our party had won seven of nine presidential elections between 1932 and 1964 .During those nine elections , we won a majority of the popular vote for the White House , and we dominated Congress , too .How had the Democratic Party , that had been the engine of economic and social progress for so much of the twentieth century and had been so politically successful during the New Deal era failed so badly in the 1980s ?Until we answered that question , it was unlikely that we could turn the party around .Before we could shape new ideas and launch a comeback , we had to understand why Democrats were getting blown away in presidential elections .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.473053"}

{"text": "Democrats reaped the political benefits .Between Roosevelt 's victory in 1932 and Lyndon Johnson 's in 1964 , Democrats averaged about 52.5 percent of the popular vote .Throughout this period the liberal agenda drove the Democratic Party , fueled economic and social progress , tempered the harshness of untrammeled capitalism , tipped the balance of economic power from the privileged few to the striving many , and benefited our core constituencies .It forged a collection of distinct interests - working men and women , retirees , farmers , and , later , minorities - into a purposeful national party dedicated to expanding opportunity and stimulating upward mobility for the greatest possible number .But as the 1960s passed into the 1970s , the liberal agenda ran out of steam , largely because of its own success , and the intellectual coherence of the New Deal began to dissipate .The Democratic coalition split apart over civil rights , Vietnam , economic change , culture and values , and the great cause of liberal government that had united the Democratic Party for three decades degenerated back into a collection of special pleaders .The party was no longer seen as the party of prosperity , opportunity , and national strength .Not surprisingly , Democrats began losing presidential elections again - five out of six after Johnson 's victory in 1964 until Clinton 's in 1992 .The beginnings of the two schisms over civil rights and antitotalitarianism that shattered the New Deal coalition became apparent in the years immediately after World War II .The party first included a civil rights plank in its 1940 platform , but Franklin Roosevelt never put civil rights high on his agenda , focusing instead on economic recovery and building what his 1944 platform boasted was the strongest military in the history of the world .That kept white southerners firmly in his camp .President Truman took a much more aggressive stance .In 1948 he established a highly publicized Commission on Civil Rights and ordered the integration of the armed forces .At the 1948 Democratic Convention , a group of liberals , led by Minneapolis Mayor Hubert Humphrey pushed for and won a strong civil rights plank in the party 's platform .During Humphrey 's speech supporting the plank , southern delegates walked out .They formed the States ' Rights Democratic Party , known as the Dixiecrats .The Dixiecrats purported to support what they called \" the southern way of life \" but were primarily for segregation and against federal intervention to enforce integration .They nominated South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond to run against Truman .The Dixiecrats won just four states - Louisiana , Alabama , Mississippi , and South Carolina - but the fissure in the solidly Democratic South never healed .Because it reconnected Democrats with the antitotalitarianism of FDR , that decision had a profound impact on the party 's course over the next two decades and likely delayed the demise of the New Deal coalition until Vietnam shattered the consensus on anticommunism .The tough stance against communism kept many southern conservative Democrats in a strained alliance with the party as it became a louder champion of civil rights .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.441185"}

Kennedy of Massachusetts , was 43 ; the Republican , Vice President Nixon , was 47 .They both were ardent cold warriors and political moderates .Kennedy 's relative inexperience and his religion ( he was the first Roman Catholic presidential nominee since Al Smith ) placed him at an initial disadvantage .But the favourable impression he created during a series of televised debates with Nixon and the support he received from blacks after he helped the imprisoned black leader Martin Luther King , Jr. , enabled him to defeat Nixon in a closely contested election .The Kennedy and Johnson administrations .The New Frontier .His administration was headed by strong , dedicated personalities .The Kennedy staff was also predominantly young .Its energy and commitment revitalized the nation , but its competence was soon called into question .In April 1961 Kennedy authorized a plan that had been initiated under Eisenhower for a covert invasion of Cuba to overthrow the newly installed , Soviet - supported Communist regime of Fidel Castro .The invasion was repulsed at the Bay of Pigs , embarrassing the administration and worsening relations between the United States and the Soviet Union .These deteriorated further at a private meeting between Kennedy and Khrushchev in June 1961 when the Soviet leader was perceived as attempting to bully his young American counterpart .Relations hit bottom in October 1962 when the Soviets secretly began to install long - range offensive missiles in Cuba , which threatened to tip the balance of nuclear power .Kennedy forced the removal of the missiles , gaining back the status he had lost at the Bay of Pigs and in his meeting with Khrushchev .Kennedy then began to work toward improving international relations , and in July 1963 he concluded a treaty with Britain and the Soviet Union banning atomic tests in the atmosphere and underwater .His program of aid to Latin America , the Alliance for Progress , raised inter - American relations to their highest level since the days of Franklin Roosevelt .Kennedy 's domestic policies were designed to stimulate international trade , reduce unemployment , provide medical care for the aged , reduce federal income taxes , and protect the civil rights of blacks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.27862"}

Wallace set up a third party that carried much of the deep South .As Goldwater faded to a lesser role after 1964 , a new conservative hero emerged : in the largest and most trendy state film star Ronald Reagan was elected governor of California in 1966 and reelected in 1970 .With the rise of conservatism the national Republican Party became more ideologically homogeneous .This change occurred as conservative politicians and voters joined the party and their liberal counterparts abandoned the GOP .Events in New York State during the 1960s and 1970s facilitated this transformation .Here , ideological conservatives formed a third party for the express purpose of changing a state GOP that both symbolized and contributed to the national GOP 's liberal viewpoint .The Conservative Party relied on the state 's unique election law to crash the New York GOP , either by forcing its way in or by imposing a lethal electoral price .The GOP - Conservative Party relationship began in 1962 at sword 's point but achieved a high degree of harmony in 1980 .Initially , New York Republicans , led by Governor Nelson Rockefeller , successfully marginalized the new party .As the conservative movement matured , however , the balance of power began to shift .When Nixon was elected president in 1968 , the Conservative Party gained an external ally who proved invaluable .The third party achieved partial acceptance in 1970 with the election of James Buckley to the Senate .For much of the ensuing decade , however , Conservatives struggled with success suffering a series of damaging setbacks .Only in the late 1970s , did the party recover when it embraced a more modest agenda .Finally , the 1980 election settled the overall contours of the relationship between the two parties .Conservatives formed their party to force the state GOP to the right , to drive liberal Republicans from office , and allow ideologically conservative national Republicans to succeed in the state .By 1980 , it had achieved these goals changing the nature of politics in the state .This resolution affected politics beyond the state by diminishing the importance of ideological liberals in the national GOP , thus freeing a more ideologically consistent national Republican Party to promote the rise of conservatism .[ 16 ] .Realignment : The South becomes Republican .In the century after Reconstruction ended in 1877 , the white South identified with the Democratic Party .The Democrats ' lock on power was so strong , the region was called the \" Solid South . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.76687"}

Russel Sprague , the party used patronage and community organizing techniques to build its base among ethnic voters , young people , and new homeowners .The party expanded beyond its white Protestant base , with Italian Americans becoming particularly prominent in party leadership .Sprague was both party leader and county executive .That post was created in 1936 under a new charter engineered by Sprague to update a municipal apparatus unable to meet the infrastructure and development needs of a county that by 1960 had 1.3 million residents .Democrats and reformers had promoted charter revision for decades , and some consolidation of government services did take place .As county \" boss , \" Sprague ruled with an iron hand .Nassau 's pluralities for such candidates as Governor Thomas E. Dewey and President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Sprague 's fundraising prowess made him a force in national party politics .He advocated a moderate , middle - of - the - road position that recognized expectations created by the New Deal while criticizing what were claimed to be Democratic excesses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.23438"}

{"text": "Liberal politicians were finally able to take the actions necessary to turn their political theories into real programs .Then everything seemed to go wrong and liberalism began to loose favor with the electorate in this country .Allen Matsuow 's book is a detailed history of this process as he seeks out the causes for the failure of liberalism .This is a sympathetic history , as would be expected from a self confessed liberal , but one that holds the success of liberalism itself at fault for its downfall .Matusow 's history of liberalism during the 1960s falls into three periods .The first is a period of ascendancy during the Kennedy administration .The author is ambivalent toward John Kennedy 's liberal credentials .He considers Kennedy a politician who adopted liberal positions for pragmatic reasons rather than a true believer in a liberal philosophy .There was a lot of talk but little action because as a politician Kennedy did n't want to alienate any particular faction by taking to hard a line on a issue .As an example Kennedy would attempt to placate the civil rights movement by convincing them that executive orders rather than legislation were all that was needed to achieve equality .Championing legislation would put him at odds with southern Democrats who opposed civil rights .However , Kennedy having been involved even weakly with many liberal political policies allowed Johnson to begin to enact them in what would have been the last year of Kennedy 's first term .Matusow 's second period falls between 1964 and 1967 , the Great Society period .As the policies begin to go into effect thing do not work out the way the theorist had predicted .Where once full employment and inflation were seen as positive economic conditions , conditions that help get the country out of the Great Depression , they had become economic liabilities .The more the government did the worse the inflation got .Inflation drove up the cost of living and the cost of everything else including the government .This led to a spiral of increasing taxes and increasing prices that by 1967 seemed would go on without end .Civil rights also turn out differently .The Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act of the middle of the decade raised expectations .When improvements , especially in the urban centers of the north did not improve immediately unrest developed .By the end of the decade inner - city ghettoes in several major cities had experienced riots that lasted days before order could be restored .The final period of the book is the 1968 election when the country turned against the liberalism of the previous administration and elected Richard Nixon .As is the theme throughout the book Matusow sees Nixon 's election as a failure of liberalism rather than a victory of conservatism .This is good synthetic history of the national politics of the 60s .It focuses on the liberal side but this is proper for what is in essence a history of liberalism during that period .Matusow has some primary sources but relies mostly on secondary sources .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.01739"}

Congressmen for several decades . )But within four years both the national Populist Party and the southern Republican Party had been destroyed , and the vast majority of Southern blacks had been disenfranchised .In North Carolina this happened by violence , pure and simple .A well - organized armed insurrection overthrew the elected Republican government of Wilmington , North Carolina 's largest city , and much of the black population fled , including the majority of Wilmington 's until - then - thriving black middle class .( One of the leaders of this insurrection was Pitchfork Ben Tillman of South Carolina , a murderous white - supremacist Democrat who had co - opted some Populist themes .Tillman is sometimes used as an example of what Populists really are like ) .Similar methods helped the Democrats win the 1898 elections , and North Carolina became part of the segregated solid Democratic South .The national Republican Party did not respond to the lawless destruction of their North Carolina branch or to the destruction of Republican Party elsewhere in the South .My guess is that this is because the destruction of the Populist Party came along with the destruction of the Republican Party in the South , a tradeoff which the Republicans found to be well worth it .Populists did not directly oppose white supremacy , but by their existence they weakened it , and they knew that : they put their money where their mouth was n't .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.35681"}

McCarthy of Wisconsin stood out among those who held that the Roosevelt and Truman administrations amounted to \" 20 years of treason . \"In February 1950 McCarthy claimed that he had a list ( whose number varied ) of State Department employees who were loyal only to the Soviet Union .McCarthy offered no evidence to support his charges and revealed only a single name , that of Owen Lattimore , who was not in the State Department and would never be convicted of a single offense .Nevertheless , McCarthy enjoyed a highly successful career , and won a large personal following , by making charges of disloyalty that , though mostly undocumented , badly hurt the Democrats .Many others promoted the scare in various ways , leading to few convictions but much loss of employment by government employees , teachers , scholars , and people in the mass media .The Korean War .On June 25 , 1950 , a powerful invading force from the Soviet - supported Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( North Korea ) swept south of the 38th parallel into the Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) .Within days , President Truman resolved to defend South Korea , even though there were few Americans in Korea and few troops ready for combat .The UN Security Council , acting during a Soviet boycott , quickly passed a resolution calling upon UN members to resist North Korean aggression .After almost being driven into the sea , UN forces , made up largely of U.S. troops and commanded by U.S. General Douglas MacArthur , counterattacked successfully and in September pushed the North Korean forces back across the border .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.72071"}

{"text": "From 1837 until 1901 , Britain was ruled by Queen Victoria , arguably the most popular of all British monarchs in history .Her reign oversaw the establishment of a great empire and Britain 's becoming the most powerful Western nation .Britain also enjoyed relative peace from 1815 until 1914 , this period is often called the Pax Britannica , from the Latin \" British Peace \" .This period also saw the evolution of British constitutional monarchy , with the monarch being more a figurehead and symbol of national identity than actual head of state , with that role being taken over by the Prime Minister , the leader of the ruling party in Parliament .Two dominant parties emerging in Parliament in this time were the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party .The Liberal constituency was made up of mostly of businessmen , as many Liberals supported the idea of a free market .Conservatives were supported by the aristocracy and farmers .Control of Parliament switched between the parties over the 19th century , but overall the century was a period of reform .In 1832 more representation was granted to new industrial cities , and laws barring Catholics from serving in Parliament were repealed , although discrimination against Catholics , especially Irish Catholics , continued .Other reforms granted near universal manhood suffrage , and state - supported elementary education for all Britons .More rights were granted to workers as well .Following independence from Britain , the United States began expanding westward , and soon a number of new states had joined the union .In 1803 , the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory from France , whose emperor , Napoleon I , had regained it from Spain .Soon , America 's growing population was settling the Louisiana Territory , which geographically doubled the size of the country .At first Spain and its allies seemed ready to try to reconquer the colonies , but the U.S. and Britain opposed this , and the reconquest never took place .From 1821 on , the U.S. bordered the newly independent nation of Mexico .An early problem faced by the Mexican republic was what to do with its sparsely populated northern territories , which today make up a large part of the American West .The government decided to try to attract Americans looking for land .Americans arrived in such large numbers that both the provinces of Texas and California had majority white , English - speaking populations .This led to a culture clash between these provinces and the rest of Mexico .When Mexico became a dictatorship under General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna , the Texans declared independence .After several battles , Texas gained independence from Mexico , although Mexico later claimed it still had a right to Texas .After existing as a republic modeled after the U.S. for several years , Texas joined the United States in 1845 .This led to border disputes between the U.S. and Mexico , resulting in the Mexican - American War .The war ended with an American victory , and Mexico had to cede all its northern territories to the United States , and recognize the independence of California , which had revolted against Mexico during the war .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.0721"}

Whitney .Despite aggressive pressure by Truman 's aides to avoid forcing the issue on the Convention floor , Humphrey chose to speak on behalf of the minority plank .In a renowned speech , Humphrey passionately told the Convention , \" My friends , to those who say that we are rushing this issue of civil rights , I say to them we are 172 years too late !Humphrey and his allies succeeded ; the pro civil rights plank was narrowly adopted .As a result of the Convention 's vote , the Mississippi delegation and half of the Alabama delegation walked out of the hall .Many Southern Democrats were so enraged at this affront to their \" way of life \" that they formed the Dixiecrat party and nominated their own presidential candidate , Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina .The goal of the Dixiecrats was to take several Southern states away from Truman and thus cause his defeat .The Southern Democrats reasoned that after such a defeat the national Democratic Party would never again aggressively pursue a pro - civil rights agenda .However , this move actually backfired .Although the strong civil rights plank adopted at the Convention cost Truman the support of the Dixiecrats , it gained him important votes from blacks , especially in large northern cities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.84294"}
