''I often think about the things I went through , all the hardships , ' 'Nez said .He was being interviewed at the studios of KUNM in Albuquerque for Veterans Day .Years later , Nez was shocked to learn he 'd been recruited by the Marines , specifically to devise a code using the same language the government tried to beat out of him .Judith Avila helped Nez write his memoir Code Talker , which was just published . ''It was extremely ironic one of the very things they were forbidden to do -- speak Navajo -- ended up helping save us during the war , ' ' Avila said .During World War II , the Japanese had cracked code after code the U.S. military used to hide their communications .Then , a Marine by the name of Philip Johnston , who had been raised on the Navajo Nation by white missionaries , suggested enlisting the help of the Navajo tribe .They became known as the code talkers .Navajo , or Dine as it 's called , is a spoken language .And few non - Navajos understand its complexities .Then they came up with words for military terms .In Navajo , there is no word for bomb .So they called it an egg .A fighter plane was the Navajo word for hummingbird . ''And the Japanese tried everything in their power to try to decipher our code , but they never succeeded , ' 'Nez said .He and his fellow code talkers were faced with many cultural challenges during the war .The most difficult was dealing with so much death .The Navajo believe when you encounter a dead body that person 's spirit stays with you .Coming home after the war , Nez remembered being haunted by these spirits . ''They were all around me .I actually see them alongside my bed , ' 'Nez said . ''This was one of the bad omen . ' 'His family performed a ceremony called the ' ' enemy way ' ' to cleanse him After that , Nez said , he felt free of the ghosts .The code talker program was secret .When Nez and the others arrived home in 1945 , there was no fanfare .The code remained active for years after the war ; it was n't declassified until 1968 .Still , it took decades before the men were officially recognized .In 2000 , New Mexico Senator Jeff Bingaman introduced legislation to honor the code talkers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "39.895798"}

Vogel , the commanding general of Amphibious Corps , Pacific Fleet , and his staff .Johnston staged tests under simulated combat conditions which demonstrated that Navajos could encode , transmit , and decode a three - line English message in 20 seconds , versus the 30 minutes required by machines at that time .The idea was accepted , with Vogel recommending that the Marines recruit 200 Navajos .The first 29 Navajo recruits attended boot camp in May 1942 .This first group then created the Navajo code at Camp Pendleton , Oceanside , California .[ 11 ] The Navajo code was formally developed and modeled on the Joint Army / Navy Phonetic Alphabet that uses agreed - upon English words to represent letters .Several of these portmanteaus ( such as gofasters referring to running shoes , ink sticks for pens ) entered Marine corps vocabulary and are commonly used today to refer to the appropriate objects .A codebook was developed to teach the many relevant words and concepts to new initiates .The text was for classroom purposes only , and was never to be taken into the field .The code talkers memorized all these variations and practiced their rapid use under stressful conditions during training .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.001526"}

''I told my roommate , ' Let 's try it out , ' and that 's what we did , ' 'Nez said . ''One reason we joined is the uniform-- they were so pretty , dress uniforms .

''The Japanese did everything in their power to break the code but they never did , ' ' he said .Nez no longer remembers the code in its entirety , but easily switches from English to Navajo to repeat one instruction he delivered during fighting on Guadalcanal . ''I always remember this one , ' 'Nez said . ''Enemy machine gun on your right flank , destroy ! ' ' The Navajos trained in radio communications were walking copies of the code .Each message read aloud by a Code Talker was immediately destroyed .
