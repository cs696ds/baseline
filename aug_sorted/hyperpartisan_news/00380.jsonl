{"text": "Was Friday 's Price Action in Gold Signaling a Top in the S&P 500 ?Friday morning traders and market participants awaited the key January employment report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics .The reaction to the supposedly wonderful report was a surge in the S&P 500 E - Mini futures contracts as well as several other key equity index futures .The overall tenor among the financial punditry was predictable as wildly bullish predictions permeated the morning session on CNBC and in the financial blogosphere .However , after the report had been out for several hours notable independent voices such as Lee Adler of the Wall Street Examiner came out with information that suggested the numbers were an apparition of manipulated statistics .I am not going to spend a great deal of time discussing the report , but the reaction to the news was decisively bullish on Friday .The question I want to know is whether Friday was a blow off top ?In the recent past the S&P 500 has seen several key inflection points and intermediate - term tops form on non - farm payroll monthly announcements .I follow a variety of indicators to help me decipher more accurately when the market is getting overbought or oversold .For nearly two weeks the market has been extremely overbought , but now we are reaching truly astonishing levels .The following charts represent just a few signals that the market is due for a pullback and a top is likely approaching .Percentage of NYSE Stocks Trading Above Their 50 Period Moving Average .The chart above clearly illustrates that as of Friday 's closing bell ( 02/03 ) over 89 % of stocks were trading above their 50 period moving averages .Consequently that reading is one of the highest levels that we have seen in the past 3 years .In addition , over 73 % of stocks that trade on the NYSE are currently priced above their longer - term 200 period moving averages .Another extremely overbought signal .The S&P 500 Bullish Percent Index is another great tool for measuring the overall position of the S&P 500 .It is without question that the longer term time frame is reaching the highest level of overbought conditions in the past 3 years .The two charts shown above present an interesting situation regarding the divergence in the McClellan Oscillator and the price action in the S&P 500 .The most recent example of this type of divergence occurred in October of 2011 and prices immediately reversed to the upside after several months of selling pressure .In fact , this correlation between reversals in the S&P 500 and divergences in the McClellan Oscillator works relatively well historically .Clearly there are bullish voices arguing for the 2011S&P 500 Index high of 1,370.58 to be taken out to the upside in the near future .Additionally , several market technicians in the blogospere have been pointing to the key resistance range between 1,350 and 1,370 on the S&P 500 as a likely price target .Obviously if those price levels are met strong resistance is likely to present itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "29.65733"}

{"text": "Let 's move on to today 's chart section to see how the situation looks like .The reason for this is the price action seen on Thursday when the index declined sharply , pulling back a bit before the session closed to end the day very close to the level of the May low .In fact , it is possible that we have seen the final bottom for this correction .The breakdown which we see here below the rising support line was so dramatic that it just might be the decline that the breakdown was supposed to generate .The most important and interesting implications are seen when we look at the reaction of the precious metals to Thursday 's decline in USD Index .Specifically , it is the lack of reaction in these markets that is most striking , even though the dollar index declined by about 1.5 index point and closed the day about 1 point lower .A huge rally in gold , silver , and the precious metals mining stocks would normally accompany such a significant move in the USD Index ( say , a $ 30 - $ 50 rally in gold ) , but barely any move to the upside was seen .This is a very bearish indication for the precious metals sector .In the short - term Euro Index chart , recall that we have had a head - and - shoulders pattern underway and not yet completed .The question now is , was this pattern invalided on Thursday with the decline in the USD Index and the move to the upside which was seen here ?Quite simply the answer is no .The move higher did not take the index above the final Fibonacci retracement level .Drawing parallel lines based on the local bottoms , we see that the upper line has not been reached and it emphasizes that the shape of the head - and - shoulders is still intact .The index level is not too high above the last shoulder as the formation is skewed .This is due to both higher lows and higher highs .The last shoulder ( September - October ) has a double top pattern so it 's really not so striking that the right shoulder just formed a second top .All in all , this pattern could still be completed and if it is , it will have bearish implications for the euro and the precious metals and bullish implications for the dollar .Now , let us take a look at the yellow metal to see whether any reaction to the dollar 's weakness was seen .Click to enlarge .We see that gold has rallied a bit more than $ 20 this week , really not much of a rally at all .The outlook continues to be bearish and the trend remains down .Gold could still decline heavily based on the long - term cyclical turning point , which is due approximately next week .Summing up , the most important development in the currency markets was the heavy decline of the USD Index on Thursday and the striking lack of reaction in the precious metals sector .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "30.625893"}

{"text": "Posts .For the past several weeks , everywhere I looked all I could find was bullish articles .After the fiscal cliff was patched at the last second , prices surged into the 2013 and have since climbed higher all the way into late February .I warned members of my service that this runaway move to the upside which was characterized by a slow grinding move higher on excessively low volume and low volatility would eventually end violently .I do not have a crystal ball , this is just based on my experience as a trader over the years .Unfortunately when markets run higher for a long period of time and just keep grinding shorts what typically follows is a violent selloff .I warned members that when the selloff showed up , it was likely that weeks of positive returns would be destroyed in a matter of days .The price action in the S&P 500 Index since February 20 th has erased most of the gains that were created in the entire month of February already and lower prices are possible , if not likely .However , there are opportunities to learn from this recent price action .There were several warning signs over the past few weeks that were indicating that a risk - off type of environment was around the corner .As a trader , I am constantly monitoring the price action in a variety of futures contracts in equities , currencies , metals , energy , and agriculture to name a few .Besides looking for trading opportunities , it is important to monitor the price action in commodities even if you only trade equities .In many cases , commodity volatility will occur immediately prior to equity volatility .Ultimately the recent rally was no different .As an example , metals were showing major weakness overall with both gold and silver selling off violently .However , what caught my eye even further was the dramatic selloff in copper futures which is shown below .As can be seen above , copper futures had rallied along with equities since the lows back in November .However , prices peaked in copper at the beginning of February and a move lower from 3.7845 on 02/04 down to recent lows around 3.5195 on 02/25 resulted in roughly a 7 % decline in copper prices over a 3 week period .As stated above , commodity volatility often precedes equity volatility .As can be seen above , copper futures appear to be reversing during the action today and many times commodities will bottom ahead of equities .I want to be clear in stating that equities will not necessarily mirror the action in commodities or copper specifically , but some major volatility was seen in several commodity contracts besides just metals .Oil futures were also coming under selling pressure as well .As can be seen above , oil futures topped right at the end of January and then sold off briefly only to selloff sharply lower a few weeks later .Oil futures gave back roughly 6 % - 7 % as well which is quite similar to copper 's recent correction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "33.7769"}

{"text": "We see five big risks that may affect the mapping of our macro views into the market forecast : .Long - dated real yields rise more sharply .We forecast that real bond yields in the US ( and G4 ) will rise modestly in 2014 , at a pace close to the forwards .Given the importance of the valuation gap between bonds and equities for our story , we have highlighted the risk that this gap closes more through higher real yields than through higher equity markets .There are good reasons to expect the rise in yields to be relatively moderate .Back - dated yields have moved much closer to normal levels than they were a year ago and our measures of G3 bond valuations are no longer ' rich ' .Inflation remains benign and major central banks still look committed to a long period of unusually low policy rates .And with Fed tapering already begun , the market has incorporated the expectation that asset purchases will end this year .But the term premium in bonds is still lower than during much of the pre-2007 period .And models of the term premium and fund rate paths that we used last March to argue that there was upside risk to yields suggest that some upside risk remains ( Exhibit 6 ) .Exhibit 6 shows a range of yield estimates generated from simple term premium models .While these do not point to large upside risks in 2014 , they do imply increased risk beyond that point .These models are based on our own benign view of the Fed funds path and inflation , so if those assumptions come under challenge , so could our yield view .We have argued that rising yields are consistent with positive equity returns as long as improving growth is driving both higher , so the driver of higher yields matters .That is a key reason why we have been mostly relaxed about the impact of higher bond yields so far .But there are two key caveats .The first is that periods where yields rise rapidly - even with strong growth - tend to hurt equities , as during the taper tantrum .Temporary periods of that kind are likely even in our central forecast .The second is that if yields rise because of expectations of tighter monetary policy , this is more unambiguously negative for equity markets .On the rates strategy front , it is the pricing of rates over the next 3 - 5 years where we think the risk premium looks unusually low .That takes us to our next risk .Markets doubt G4 commitment to easy policy in the face of better growth .Our forecast is that although tapering will likely be completed this year , the Fed will not raise the Funds rate until early 2016 .The Fed itself has worked relatively hard to try to decouple the decision to taper from the decision to hike .And while the market gave little credit to that view during the ' taper tantrum ' last summer , expectations of the path for US policy rates fell back significantly after the non - taper in September and the nomination of incoming Fed Chair Yellen , despite rising bond yields .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "35.961044"}

{"text": "For more on this breakthrough fascinating new way of viewing causality , please visit the Socionomics Institute 's website by CLICKING HERE .When Gold reached a peak of $ 1923.70 in September 2011 , most analysts thought the metal would soar to $ 4,000 + .When sentiment is extreme , and the right technical conditions are in place , markets reverse .Gold is no exception to this principle .Now , with Gold down 44 % from its peak , the financial media and pundits have all but lost hope for the metal .This is the type of environment that is conducive to short - term bottoms in markets .But that 's not what this post is about .While Gold is certainly oversold and may rally in the short to intermediate term , longer term , Gold is in a bear market .Most analysts , even the ones that were bullish at the 2011 top , now admit this , even if they call it a \" correction in a bull market \" .What is not a majority opinion by any means , is that Gold has actually been in a bear market since January 21 , 1980 , when the metal went parabolic and topped at $ 850 an ounce with the peak in inflation .It subsequently crashed 70 % in a long , drawn out bear market that lasted 21 years into 2001 .Some say the bear market ended in 1999 , however , prices very nearly matched their 1999 low in 2001 in nominal terms , and made new lows in real terms ( adjusted for inflation ) .I have deflated the price of gold using the Producer Price Index , and it bottomed in 2001 .What this suggests , is that Gold as a commodity bottomed in 2001 .From the 2001 low , Gold advanced for 10 years into the 2011 top .However , looking back in history , this top was not anywhere near as parabolic as the spike up into 1/21/1980 .It is more characteristic of a b - wave advance , than that of an impulse .This Article from an analyst whom I highly respect , although do n't entirely agree with , Doug Casey , highlights the fact that the advance this time around in Gold was nowhere near the magnitude that the bull market that peaked in 1980 was .He also points out the fact that measures used to suggest Gold reached its 1980 peak in inflation - adjusted terms are wrong , and instead refers to measures used by John Williams of Shadow Government Statistics , by far the authority on exposing government lies in economic reporting .While Casey uses this as evidence the bull market did n't yet end , I contend it is rather evidence that the entire rally was not a bull market at all , but rather a rally in a much longer - term bear market .Further evidence of the three wave corrective advance comes with the near 1.618 Fibonacci relationship between waves C and A , a common characteristic of three wave corrective moves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "36.867867"}
{"text": "In equity terms , since February 20 th the S&P 500 futures have sold off from a high of around 1,529 to Monday 's low of 1481.75 .Thus far we are seeing a move lower of about 3.10 % since 02/20 in the S&P 500 E - Mini futures contract .While I am not calling for perfect correlation with commodities , I do believe that a 5 % correction here not only makes sense , but actually would be healthy for equities .If we assume the S&P 500 E - Mini contracts were to lose 5 % from their recent highs , the price that would correspond with that type of move would be around 1,453 .As shown above , while 1,453 does represent a consolidation zone in the S&P 500 which occurred in the beginning of January of 2013 , there is a major support level that corresponds with the 1,460 - 1,470 price range .I am expecting to see the S&P 500 test the 1,460 - 1,470 price range in the futures contract , however the outcome at that support level will be important for future price action .If that level holds , I think we likely reverse and move higher and we could even take out recent highs potentially .In contrast , if we see a major breakdown below 1,460 I believe things could get interesting quickly for the bears .I am watching the price action today closely as I am interested in what kind of retracement we will get based on yesterday 's large bullish engulfing candlestick on the daily chart of the S&P 500 futures .Ultimately if the retracement remains below the .500Fibonacci Retracement area into the bell we could see some stronger selling pressure setting in later this week .The Fibonacci retracement of the 02/25 candlestick can be seen below .So far today we have not been able to crack the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement area .This is generally considered a relatively weak retracement and can precede a strong reversal which in this case would be to the downside in coming days .It is always possible to see strength on Wednesday and a move up to the .500 retracement level .As long as price stays under the .500Fibonacci retracement level , I think the bears will remain in control in the short - term .However , should we see the highs from 02/25 taken out in the near term the bulls will be in complete control again .Right now I think it is early to be getting long unless a trader is looking to scale in on the way down .I think the more logical price level to watch carefully is down around 1,460 - 1,470 on the S&P 500 .If that level is tested , the resulting price action will be critical in shaping the intermediate and long - term price action in the broad equity indexes .If you have to trade , keep position sizes small and define your risk .Risk is elevated at this time .If you would like to get our detailed trading videos each week and know what is just around the corner test out here : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "36.868805"}

'Slow and steady ' seemed to be an obsolete term when looking at recent market moves .The multiple turning points which are at hand or imminent in many world markets are further evidence of the dependencies and interrelationships , which have formed in what at first may seem unrelated areas .It is quite true that when the Bank of Spain has a liquidity problem , the price of silver could very well be impacted immediately .Such is the case when the all global economies are so interconnected .We saw such an example , albeit temporary , this week when Japan devalued the yen on Tuesday .World markets immediately reacted .Although we may temporarily see a move slightly below this level , the local bottom is likely very close to being in .With strongly negative correlation between metals and the USD Index , the implications for precious metals are bearish .The local top should be quite close although double - tops can not be ruled out and should therefore not be surprising .It all depends on whether the support level has enough strength to stop the USD decline at 77 , or will it need to move lower to 76 .We believe the former is more likely .In last week 's Premium Update we stated told our Subscribers that the target level for the current decline is close to 77 and that a pullback / consolidation is probable once this level has been reached .If the bottom is in fact in , ( and it certainly appears so ) , it means that the index is following our expectations remarkably well .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "37.025776"}

{"text": "With another year of steady declines in the unemployment rate likely in 2014 , this argues for another year of lower US volatility .But this relationship also highlights that the risk of an earlier US labour market tightening than we expect could bring forward the point at which equity volatility begins to rise .A rising volatility environment need not be inconsistent with rising equity markets , as the late 1990s powerfully demonstrated .But it would increase the risks .Margins compress more rapidly as wage share recovers .One of the key supports for US equities over the last few years has been the high level of corporate margins .The US profit share has remained at historically high levels .Our expectation is that it will remain there in 2014 .As described in the final US Economics Analyst of 2013 , we expect price inflation to be a touch higher than unit labour cost inflation , which has historically allowed firms to maintain or improve margins .Once again , this depends on the assumption that wage growth will remain benign and implicitly that the labour market has plenty of slack .Exhibit 9 shows that , in general , there is a strong tendency for the profit share to decline when the unemployment rate falls below the NAIRU .Given our view that we are still well above that rate and likely to remain there through 2014 , it is logical to expect little margin pressure in this environment .But this means that the issue of labour market slack is relevant not just to the inflation and policy outlook , but also to the margin story .A more rapid tightening in the US labour market represents the most significant risk to record - high margins .EM assets benefit more from DM recovery or suffer more from local imbalances .We have had a structurally cautious view of the EM outlook over the last year or two .As US growth and yields have begun to pick up , we have argued that this puts some of the imbalances that have built up in EM more squarely into focus .And although we expect growth to pick up slightly in EM and modest positive returns from equities in 2014 , our outlook - both for EM economies and markets - is still more cautious than for the DM economies .There are risks on both sides of the EM outlook .On the downside , we could easily see greater pressure than we forecast on a range of EM economies and markets from the ongoing rise in US yields and the rebalancing of their own economies .And EM equities and currencies have generally struggled again on the back of these dynamics as 2013 has drawn to a close .A weaker growth outlook in China would be an additional negative force for many EM assets .And elections in a number of countries ( Turkey , Brazil , India ) may also increase political risk .Given our relative caution , this would to some extent be a reinforcement of the basic picture we expect .As a result , the main risk to our own forecasts - and perhaps the markets too - would be that EM assets do better than their DM counterparts , reversing some of the recent underperformance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "39.94709"}

{"text": "Silver 's only problem since August was gold .And a big part of gold 's problem was a giant contraction in speculative capital deployed .Due to forced redemptions , margin calls , and sheer fear , traders all over the world pulled capital off the table .Their selling forced virtually all prices lower .Unfortunately gold was not an exception this time around , as it should have been during a full - blown panic .And with gold weak , silver did n't stand a chance .In recent weeks , angry and shell - shocked silver enthusiasts have been looking for a villain to blame .While conspiracy theorists from various factions will shrilly disagree with me , I do n't think there is a silver - specific culprit to tar and feather for the extraordinary chaos of the past few months .Gold got crushed and silver followed and amplified gold as it always ultimately does .End of story .But one thesis today suggests mainstream stock investors added to this silver plunge by dumping their holdings in the SLV silver ETF .Last week I investigated this claim for gold made by opponents of gold 's ETF , and they were groundless .I was curious about SLV so I checked out its holdings .The results will be very surprising to many and suggest stock investors buying SLV are much stronger hands than expected .While speculators abandoned silver since mid - July , stock traders owning SLV did n't really succumb to this irrational panic .SLV 's total holdings , amazingly enough , actually grew and hit new all - time record highs during the silver crisis of recent months !A steep uptrend in SLV 's bullion holdings that began during the sharp early-2008 upleg somehow held intact through the brutal late-2008 correction .The silver ETF actually helped retard silver 's selloff !SLV holds silver in trust for its investors .Its mission is to track the silver price .This only happens naturally if SLV supply and demand trends are very similar to underlying silver supply and demand trends .If relatively more SLV is demanded than silver , this ETF must issue shares and use the proceeds to buy physical silver to equalize this demand differential .The opposite is also true , SLV must sell silver bullion and buy back shares if SLV selling pressure exceeds that in silver futures .If these mechanics are n't clear to you , I explained all this last week for GLD .SLV works the same way .If SLV and silver always had the same supply - demand pressures on a minute - by - minute basis , SLV 's holdings would never need to change ( outside of the modest annual management fee ) .SLV 's holdings only grow when SLV demand exceeds silver 's and only shrink when SLV supply exceeds silver 's .Since SLV still grew its holdings even while silver cratered , SLV buying pressure in recent months was greater than the selling pressure driven by silver 's collapse .This is incredibly impressive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "40.000443"}

{"text": "Sometimes a failed signal can be more profitable than the normal expected response .For example , a classic failed response might be a scenario wherein price was consolidating in a pattern of higher lows and lower highs - a classic triangle pattern .One would expect a breakout from a chart formation to have some follow - through .However , if price only penetrates the lows by a small amount and then turns upward , picking up volume and momentum as it goes , and comes out the upside , a very significant reversal has probably occurred and there may be much more price advance to unfold .One last trick to watching price action is to learn to think in terms of \" handles , \" or levels .Think of the S&P 's as reaching for the \" 1110 \" handle , or the \" low 1060 's \" as a level .Each ten points is a defined level .Use big round numbers as reference points for levels .It does n't mean that you are placing orders at those numbers .It is just a simple way of organizing data that professional traders practice subconsciously .Pivot Points .An astute trader will always have the previous day 's close in his head .He also knows the previous day 's high and low ( prices he would have liked to have bought and sold but probably did n't ) .He also knows the opening price , for that tells if the buyers or sellers are in control for the day .The previous day 's high and low and today 's open have very strong psychological implications and are the most important \" pivot points \" to recognize .By concentrating on price action near these points , we can eliminate much of the hard work in tape reading .Many times the market will let us know right away if this is going to be an area of support or resistance .The previous day 's high and low tend to overlap in congestion areas .Look to exit profitable trades immediately at these points in sideways markets .In trending markets , the price will run through these points a bit before pausing .When the market is strongly trending , the opening price becomes the most important .If we are watching a high , low , or opening price as a pivot point , we are watching to see whether there is any impulsive price action as the market approaches the point or moves further away from it .What is \" impulsive action ?\" I like to call it a \" whoosh .\" The market moves rapidly as if just coming to life for the first time .It is usually a series of ticks in one direction without a tick in the opposite direction .The market is tipping its hand .A sequence like this tends to consolidate or pause a bit before being followed by more impulsive action .This is quite easy to see in a market like the S&P 's if you look on a short - term time frame .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.411087"}

{"text": "This is a trade setup based mostly on technicals and my feeling that the USD rally against the British Pound is a bit overdone this week .First , we can see on the one hour chart above that the pair has dropped almost its entire average weekly range ( 288 pips ) and is about to test a major support level : PWL ( blue line above ) .Stochastics are showing oversold conditions on the one hour and four hour timeframes , indicating that the sell off may be running out of steam .Traders could take profit there and push the pair higher ahead of the next two major events for the pair : BOE interest rate decision and US Non - farm payrolls .As far as the BOE interest rate statement , with the first quarter UK preliminary GDP coming at a mediocre 0.5 % , we will probably see the MPC keep rates at 0.50 % .With no chance of a rate cut , this keeps the interest rate differential in the British Pounds favor , and in the highly unlikely chance we do see a rate hike , this could be a huge boost for the British Pound .On Friday , we have the Non - Farm Payrolls expected to increase for the seventh straight month .If this were the case , we tend to see a short - lived Greenback rally against the Sterling as buyers jumped in long and faded any initial drops in the last couple of releases .If we see a weak number , the market could still go in Sterling 's favor in an anti - dollar reaction .Again , both scenarios look good for Cable bulls .In my view , buyers will probably have the upper hand with the upcoming events and the current levels Cable is trading at , so I 'll go long the market if we see a test of last week 's lows .I 'll keep my stop tight incase the pair is quick to break that level , and because of the potential movement these two events can create , I 'm going for a big profit on this one by scaling into a winning position .Finally , because of my tight stop , I 'll also cut down my trade risk to 0.50 % of my account , giving me the flexibility to jump in again and stay within my risk comfort levels .Here 's what I am going to do : .Long GBP / USD at 1.6430 , stop at 1.6370 , trail stop and add full position every 60 pips .Initial risk is 0.50 % of my account .Profit target is the major resistance area WO / PWL , taking max profit at 1.6670 .Remember to never risk more than 1 % of a trading account on any single trade .Adjust position sizes accordingly .So , if everything works out my way , the potential return - on - risk is 10:1 , meaning a 5 % return on this trade if it all works out .Stay tuned by following me on Twitter and Facebook !", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.3023"}

{"text": "Rating Action On Dec. 14 , 2012 , Standard & Poor 's Ratings Services affirmed its ratings , including the ' BB ' long - term corporate credit rating , on Birmingham , Ala.-based aggregates producer Vulcan Materials Co.The outlook is stable .Rationale The affirmation of our ' BB ' corporate credit rating on Vulcan is based on Standard & Poor 's view of the company 's \" aggressive \" financial risk ; \" satisfactory \" business risk ; and \" strong \" liquidity , based on our criteria .We view the financial risk as aggressive despite our estimate that year - end 2012 total debt / EBITDA leverage ( adjusted for leases and post - retirement expenses ) is likely to be in a range of 6.5x to 7x , which we view as weak for the rating .We are forecasting that 2012 EBITDA could approximate $ 500 million , which is about 10 % below our prior expectation , but still a significant improvement over the 2011 level of about $ 350 million .The ratings also incorporate expectations under our baseline scenario that credit measures will improve over the next 12 to 24 months to levels more consistent with a ' BB ' rating , given the company 's satisfactory business risk profile .For 2013 , we expect improvement in Vulcan 's sales of about 5 % from our baseline scenario , based on the following assumptions : -- Flat infrastructure ( highway spending ) given the current highway appropriations under Moving Ahead for Progress ( MAP-21 ) bill .As a result , we think 2013 adjusted EBITDA ( after our adjustments for pensions and leases ) could approximate $ 550 million or slightly higher , resulting in improvement in leverage measures to 5.5x or lower by the end of 2013 .Key risks to our EBITDA forecast include a stalled recovery in housing markets in 2013 or the risk of a new recession , which our economists estimate at a 15 % to 20 % probability .Vulcan has undertaken a program to achieve $ 500 million of after - tax proceeds from planned asset sales .While not yet determined , some or all of these proceeds may be utilized for additional debt reduction , which we would view as favorable to the rating .We continue to believe that Vulcan 's results could significantly improve once construction markets recover closer to historical averages , due to the high operating leverage inherent in the aggregates business .If construction markets recover further by 2014 and beyond , we estimate that EBITDA could reach historical levels of $ 750 million or more .However , for this to occur , the company would need mid - single - digit pricing increases and double - digit percentage volume growth .The ratings on Vulcan also incorporate our view of the company 's satisfactory business risk profile , reflecting aggregates ' long - term favorable growth prospects , high barriers to entry , and the supply and demand characteristics of the industry .The ratings also reflect Vulcan 's exposure to cyclical construction markets and very high debt levels , offset somewhat by its leading position in the fragmented U.S. aggregates market , presence in higher growth markets , and the longer term need for increased infrastructure spending .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.13099"}

{"text": "Crucially , the ' normal ' correlation between and is actually negative ( and smaller in absolute value ) in sub - sample .Our interpretation is that increases in U.S. real interest rates are correlated with other things that are good for emerging markets and thus decrease their cost of borrowing .Future research ought to investigate which aspects of international financial markets , correlated with U.S. real interest rates , are most important to the risk of emerging market default .The results in Table 3 are substantially different from the OLS estimates using only the sub - sample C presented in Table 4 .While the former shows a strong positive relation , the latter shows a mild and insignificant effect .Rosa ( 2011 ) as noted that , in some applications , the results from employing the identification through heteroskedasticity methodology are not much different from a simple OLS using the subsample where the FOMC meets .That is not the case here since we are using the long - term interest rates , where endogeneity is likely to be much more important than when the policy rate is used , and the correlation between variables in the N sample is different from the causal effect .4 Concluding Remarks .The strong and positive relation between exogenous changes in U.S. real interest rates and the EMBI+ premium highlights the importance of U.S. interest rate shocks .The fact that the overall correlation between U.S. rates and the EMBI+ premium is negative highlights the importance of other aspects of international financial markets , such as favourable external conditions to emerging economy borrowing .From a policy perspective , our result has implications for proposals to issue debt that is contingent on exogenous factors that affect the ability to repay .One of these ideas is that a higher U.S. real interest rate makes it more difficult for emerging market economies to repay , so reducing emerging market debt payments when U.S. interest rates increase would be welfare improving .Our finding that the overall correlation is negative implies that making emerging market sovereign debt contingent on U.S. real interest rates would have an opposite result from the desired effect .Research on sovereign default should note that shocks affecting foreign real interest rates might have very different effects on emerging market default risk .References .Arora , V. and Cerisola , M.

{"text": "Today Mario Draghi , Chairman of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , made public comments regarding the readiness of the ECB to act if need be to safeguard the European Union .The Dollar Index Futures plummeted on the statement and remained under selling pressure most of the trading session on Thursday .If a mere comment from the ECB can have such a damaging impact on the valuation of the Dollar , what would happen to the Dollar if the Fed initiated a new easing mechanism ?The answer is simple , the U.S. Dollar would immediately be under selling pressure .Selling pressure in the U.S. Dollar Index generally leads to a rally in risk assets such as equities and oil futures .Over the longer - term , a weak Dollar is also positive for precious metals and other hard assets .As an example to illustrate the power of Quantitative Easing as it relates to the price of both gold and oil , consider the following chart : .Obviously the price action is pretty clear that Quantitative Easing has a positively correlated impact on the price performance of hard assets , specifically gold and oil .Now consider a price chart of the Dollar Index shown below courtesy of the Federal Reserve Bank , the annotations are mine .The chart above tells an interesting story about the impact that Quantitative Easing has on the Dollar .How can the Federal Reserve claim to be protecting the purchasing power of the U.S. Dollar when its actions have a direct negative correlation to the greenback 's price ?Furthermore , based on the chart above I am of the opinion that Quantitative Easing III is a foregone conclusion .The current price of the Dollar Index is clearly above the previous high where QE2 was launched .So far , the rally in the Dollar Index has not pushed equity prices considerably lower .However , should the Federal Reserve refrain from initiating additional easing measures it is likely based on the chart above that the U.S. Dollar Index will rally .Upon the conclusion of both QE and QE2 , the Dollar Index rallied sharply higher .With the Fed announcement coming closer by the hour , financial pundits will attempt to predict the future action of the Fed .I have no interest in making predictions about what the Fed will do .It is a certainty that QE3 will take place at some point in the future whether it be sooner or later .The Federal Reserve simply has no choice , otherwise the Dollar would continue to rally and we would begin to go through a deflationary period which the Federal Reserve simply can not tolerate .The scenario that I would urge inquiring minds to consider would be as follows .If the Fed does nothing we can likely assume that the U.S. Dollar Index will continue to rally to the upside .Based on the price chart of the U.S. Dollar Index shown above , we can expect that sellers would certainly step in around the 86 - 88 price range based on previous resistance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.131905"}

{"text": "If a mere comment from the ECB can have such a damaging impact on the valuation of the Dollar , what would happen to the Dollar if the Fed initiated a new easing mechanism ?The answer is simple , the U.S. Dollar would immediately be under selling pressure .Selling pressure in the U.S. Dollar Index generally leads to a rally in risk assets such as equities and oil futures .Over the longer - term , a weak Dollar is also positive for precious metals and other hard assets .As an example to illustrate the power of Quantitative Easing as it relates to the price of both gold and oil , consider the following chart : .Obviously the price action is pretty clear that Quantitative Easing has a positively correlated impact on the price performance of hard assets , specifically gold and oil .Now consider a price chart of the Dollar Index shown below courtesy of the Federal Reserve Bank , the annotations are mine .The chart above tells an interesting story about the impact that Quantitative Easing has on the Dollar .How can the Federal Reserve claim to be protecting the purchasing power of the U.S. Dollar when its actions have a direct negative correlation to the greenback 's price ?Furthermore , based on the chart above I am of the opinion that Quantitative Easing III is a foregone conclusion .The current price of the Dollar Index is clearly above the previous high where QE2 was launched .So far , the rally in the Dollar Index has not pushed equity prices considerably lower .However , should the Federal Reserve refrain from initiating additional easing measures it is likely based on the chart above that the U.S. Dollar Index will rally .Upon the conclusion of both QE and QE2 , the Dollar Index rallied sharply higher .With the Fed announcement coming closer by the hour , financial pundits will attempt to predict the future action of the Fed .I have no interest in making predictions about what the Fed will do .It is a certainty that QE3 will take place at some point in the future whether it be sooner or later .The Federal Reserve simply has no choice , otherwise the Dollar would continue to rally and we would begin to go through a deflationary period which the Federal Reserve simply can not tolerate .The scenario that I would urge inquiring minds to consider would be as follows .If the Fed does nothing we can likely assume that the U.S. Dollar Index will continue to rally to the upside .Based on the price chart of the U.S. Dollar Index shown above , we can expect that sellers would certainly step in around the 86 - 88 price range based on previous resistance .If the U.S. Dollar makes it anywhere near the 86 - 88 price range without the Federal Reserve initiating QE3 it would be expected that risk assets would be under considerable selling pressure somewhere along the way .Should the Fed act to break the Dollar 's rally either through more easing or \" other \" mechanisms , the result would be a potentially monster rally for risk assets , at least initially .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.315437"}
{"text": "If relatively more SLV is demanded than silver , this ETF must issue shares and use the proceeds to buy physical silver to equalize this demand differential .The opposite is also true , SLV must sell silver bullion and buy back shares if SLV selling pressure exceeds that in silver futures .If these mechanics are n't clear to you , I explained all this last week for GLD .SLV works the same way .If SLV and silver always had the same supply - demand pressures on a minute - by - minute basis , SLV 's holdings would never need to change ( outside of the modest annual management fee ) .SLV 's holdings only grow when SLV demand exceeds silver 's and only shrink when SLV supply exceeds silver 's .Since SLV still grew its holdings even while silver cratered , SLV buying pressure in recent months was greater than the selling pressure driven by silver 's collapse .This is incredibly impressive .SLV has grown fast during silver uplegs , grown slowly during silver consolidations , and has even grown or remained stable during silver selloffs .Stock traders want to be able to get silver - price exposure via their usual stock - trading accounts , so SLV demand has continued to grow despite silver 's wild volatility .No matter how you feel about metals ETFs personally , you ca n't argue that SLV contributed to silver 's recent weakness .This ETF actually had to buy physical silver during this futures - based selloff !Whenever you analyze silver it always comes down to gold in the end .If gold is strong enough for long enough , silver will explode higher as speculators flood in to drive one of its characteristic parabolic spikes .If gold is drifting in a consolidation , silver will dutifully follow in a sideways grind of its own .And if gold sells off , silver speculators will abandon silver in a heartbeat without thinking twice .Gold is the key .I fully know silver is a religion for some investors who will own nothing else but this metal , its producers , and its explorers .More power to them , silver is definitely very exciting and exceedingly lucrative when it rockets higher .This being said , silver is still at the mercy of gold .This final bull - to - date chart of gold and silver , from my multi - decade study of this relationship , offers some important lessons .Yes , silver has awesome potential .Yes , its secular bull has already carried it from around $ 4 to nearly $ 21 at best .Yes , investors and speculators in silver including me and our subscribers have made fortunes trading it and its producers .All this is true , there are many reasons to love silver going forward .Yet ultimately , silver is slave to gold .It is a hyper - volatile speculation that amplifies gold - driven PM sentiment .In silver 's bull to date , literally all of its gains have come from just 3 fast uplegs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.323063"}

{"text": "The first of these may pose the more important risk .There is room for uncertainty here , because fiscal drag is not directly observed .We do observe the shift in government tax and spending plans ( and even here true ' shifts ' are complicated to tease out of the data , in part because they also depend on estimates of spare capacity ) .To convert those into estimates of drag , we need to assume multipliers into broader activity .The work we ( and others , such as the IMF ) have done suggests that those multipliers have been quite large given the constraints on monetary policy and credit creation .But it is still possible that we have overestimated the drag from the public sector .The fact that US GDP growth accelerated from 2013H1 to 2013H2 , as have measures like our Current Activity Indicator , is comforting for the story that fiscal pressures early in 2013 were a large drag .But it is not yet definitive evidence .Deleveraging obstacles continue to weigh on private demand .The other half of the story of improving growth is that the US private - sector impulse remains robust .As discussed above , the flipside of a smaller estimate of fiscal drag would be that the private sector has not been adding as much as we think .The simplest version of that risk may be that the post - bust headwinds and the pattern of slow recoveries that follow financial crises continue to prevent a self - sustaining pick - up in private demand .US capital spending in particular has been lower than our forecasts .While we expect it to pick up as consumer demand growth improves , there is some risk that excess capacity and uncertainty about demand continue to weigh .In the Euro area , similar risks exist but pressures from ongoing bank deleveraging ( lending to the private sector is still contracting ) constitute an important additional headwind .The impact of new financial regulations and , in some places , fresh macro - prudential measures could also have a larger growth impact than we anticipate .In assessing the broad risks to US private - sector demand , the housing market still plays a key role .Directly or indirectly , the housing recovery has been responsible for about a third of US growth over the last year ( Exhibit 2 ) .Following the rise in mortgage yields in the summer , we saw a patch of weakness in housing data that has now begun to reverse .Our assumption is that the secondary housing market will continue to improve , although at a more modest rate than last year , and that the scope for new building remains high .But the biggest risk to that view is probably a fresh tightening in financial conditions , which have reversed all of the tapering shock and are back at very easy levels , and mortgage rates in particular .Away from the US , a number of housing markets ( Canada , Sweden , Switzerland and even the UK ) have also shown significant gains on the back of low interest rates and could prove vulnerable to sharper reversals , rising rates or macro - prudential measures .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.656868"}

{"text": "As growth accelerates above trend for the first time in the recovery , the supply side of the US and other DM economies is likely to become a more important issue .In particular , our forecasts assume that there is plenty of effective spare capacity in the G4 economies , and that this will keep wage and price inflation well - anchored despite better growth .Underlying this view is that the financial crisis has not led to large permanent losses in potential output and that , while the NAIRU ( the lowest unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation ) has probably increased , it is still well below current levels .The lack of significant wage inflation suggests that those who argued in recent years that the US NAIRU may now be as high as 7%-7.5 % have been wrong .But the question of where capacity pressures begin to bite is always highly uncertain and is likely to be put to a tougher test as growth picks up .The US unemployment rate has also consistently fallen faster than our forecasts anticipated , including over the last 12 months , as the participation rate continues to fall ( Exhibit 3 ) .Surprises have not yet made a difference to the inflation picture and we still think there is plenty of slack .But systematic forecast errors naturally make us less confident .As the unemployment rate itself drops ( on our forecast , it ends 2014 at 6.3 % ) the debate over the drivers of the US participation rate will sharpen .Outside the US , the UK is likely to see similarly intense focus on the issue of slack and labour market tightening .The unemployment rate has fallen more rapidly there too , on the back of the recent acceleration in growth , and we expect it to decline further .In the Euro area as a whole , with slower growth and higher unemployment , we see much smaller risks that capacity tightness will become an issue this year , although we do forecast a significant increase in those pressures in Germany in 2014 .Even if we are right that there is plenty of slack in the developed world , the market may worry about these risks before it is convinced .And if growth is more rapid than we forecast - a possibility in the US and UK , at least - spare capacity would be eroded faster , even if our view of the starting point is correct .Our benign view of supply constraints also extends to commodity markets , where we envisage steady oil prices and falls in many other commodity prices .If that view is wrong - or if geopolitical issues disrupt supplies - that would also worsen the broader risk picture .Euro area risks resurface .Although we expect the strongest impulse in 2014 to come from the US , we forecast improving Euro area growth .That improvement - and an expectation that Euro area system - wide risk will remain well - contained again in 2014 - is an important support for our benign view of the outlook .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.08419"}

{"text": "One of the most important points I made in the Psychology of Trading book is that trading performance is not so much a matter of controlling emotions as controlling your focus and concentration .If you treat your emotional responses as market data -- information , not problems to be covered over -- you'll find that focusing on your experience ( not getting lost in it ) can pay off handsomely .Let 's take an example .The market has bounced off a price level a couple of times , and you 're noticing reduced volume as we test those lows .The third time we approach the lows , you decide to buy the market .We bounce higher , stall , and then a large local begins to put large offers in the book , capping the buying .Within seconds , locals ( perhaps that very same local ) pulls bids and the market whooshes lower , breaking the recent support by a couple of ticks .Your trade is under water .Does a trader feel fear or frustration at those moments ?Of course .The question is not whether you have those emotions , but whether or not you lose your focus and blindly act upon them .As the slide above notes , to lose your focus is to become undercontrolled -- impulsively putting on \" revenge \" trades -- or to become overcontrolled , frozen with fear like a deer in the headlights .A better alternative is to become an observer to those emotions .Perhaps , if you are becoming concerned about your position , other traders are as well .That prods you to increase your focus : look harder at what 's going on in the market .When you notice that there are very large bids just below the market , you realize that large players are pushing the market into those bids .Your fear and frustration are what will make you hit their bids and get them out of their positions .Volume , after all , has not expanded on the move down : the running of stops was the result of a vacuum caused by strategies played out in the order book .Within moments , the market is back trading where you bought it .There are good reasons to stay in a trade , and there are good reasons to exit and stop yourself out .The question is whether your decision is the result of enhanced focus -- using your emotions as warning signals that alert you to important market changes -- or the result of attention that has been shifted toward your P / L fears and frustrations .As any competitive athlete or soldier knows , emotion can be your friend or foe : it can make you focus harder on your circumstances , or it can distract your focus .It 's much easier to maintain your focus when you have a well thought - out trade idea to focus upon .Much loss of focus ( and resulting emotionality ) , I find , is simply the result of trades that lack a firm grounding .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.287544"}

{"text": "It is obvious that Chairman Bernanke and the Federal Reserve have embarked on a massive fiat currency printing campaign which has helped buoy risk assets to the upside .Through a combination of reducing interest rates on safety haven investments like Treasury 's and CD 's , the Federal Reserve has forced conservative investors and those living on a fixed income into riskier assets in search of yield .This process helps elevate stock prices and creates the desired outcome for the Federal Reserve which involves the perception by average individuals that they are wealthier .The Fed calls this the \" wealth effect \" and they seem poised to insure that U.S. financial markets continue to ride upon a see of cheap money and liquidity .Ultimately the Federal Reserve 's most recent announcements have served to help flatten the short end of the yield curve further while providing a launching pad for equities and precious metals .However , issues persisting in Europe could have an adverse impact on the short to intermediate term price action of the U.S. Dollar .Right now everywhere I look I hear market prognosticators commenting on how hated the U.S. Dollar is and how Chairman Bernanke will not allow the Dollar to appreciate markedly in order to protect U.S. exports and financial markets .I think that the Dollar has the potential to rally in the short to intermediate term .Right now the U.S. Dollar Index appears to be trying to form a bottom .Obviously there is good reason to believe that the U.S. Dollar Index could reverse to the upside here .Whether it would have the strength to take out recent highs is unclear , but a correction to the upside not only seems unexpected by most market participants , but it seems plausible based on the weekend news coming out of Greece .Monday morning the Greek government is set to determine if they will agree to the demands of the Troika in exchange for the next tranche of bailout funds .If the Greek government and the Troika do not come to an agreement , the Euro could sell - off violently .Additionally there are already concerns about the next LTRO offering from the European Central Bank .The measure is to help provide European banks with additional liquidity , but there are growing concerns that the size and scope of the LTRO could have a dramatic impact on the Euro 's valuation against other currencies .Time will tell , but there are certainly catalysts which could help drive the U.S. Dollar higher .Another potential indicator that the Dollar could see higher prices in coming days was the largely unnoticed bearish price action on Friday of precious metals .Both gold and silver have been on a tear higher over the past several weeks .Both precious metals have surged since the Federal Reserve announced that interest rates would remain near zero on the short end of the curve through 2014 .However , on Friday gold and silver were both under extreme selling pressure .The move did not get much attention by the financial media .The price action in gold and silver on Friday could be another indication that the U.S. Dollar is set to rally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.47214"}

{"text": "At first glance , this chart does not appear to be warning us about fear at the moment .However , certain aspects of the Volatility Index ( VIX ) are largely unknown to the retail investor .The VIX is a guide for volatility in the present , but it does a poor job of projecting future volatility .Simply looking at the VIX 's current price is not the appropriate way to gauge market volatility expectations in the future .The Volatility Term Structure is a better way of understanding what the Volatility Index is saying about the future .Wikipedia lists the following definition for volatility term structure : . \" Volatility term structures list the relationship between implied volatilities and time to expiration .The term structures provide another method for traders to gauge cheap or expensive options .\" As can be seen above , the forward Volatility Term Structure indicates that volatility is expected to go higher in the future .This is not all that uncommon , but I think what is more important is the rate of change in the near term .When we look at this chart , the term structure indicates that Volatility levels roughly 4 months out ( March 2013 ) are nearly 13 % higher than they are today .By June of 2013 , volatility 's rate of change is well over 20 % higher than it is today .It is important to understand that volatility does not necessarily mean risk .Volatility typically increases when equity prices are falling , however volatility levels can rise for a variety of reasons .Uncertainty about the outcome of an event like hitting the debt ceiling could push volatility levels higher without sending equity prices sharply lower .The point is the term structure just provides clues as it is not the holy grail about looking in the future .What the Volatility term structure does tell us is that the marketplace expects a significant increase in overall volatility in the next 3 - 6 months .What I think the Volatility Term Structure is conveying presently is that decisions regarding the fiscal cliff and the debt ceiling will impact market prices , However the real impact may not be felt until later in the 1 st or 2 nd Quarters of 2013 .Most economists believe that if we do go over the fiscal cliff and taxes go up for everyone that the U.S. economy will be in recession within 6 - 9 months .Clearly as shown above , the Volatility Term Structure likely agrees with the economists assessments and the economic conditions in the next 6 to 7 months could possibly turn for the worse .All we can hope for is that the politicians can compromise on a plan that will remove uncertainty from the marketplace without compromising the economy .Something tells me that is not likely to happen , but here is to hoping that I 'm wrong !This material should not be considered investment advice .J.W.

{"text": "However , what is certain is that during the end of the year the bulls usually have the upper hand .The reasons are fairly simple , but they usually hold sway most years .Due to the holiday season , many traders take vacations and leave their trading desks .Because traders are largely absent , volume levels start to decline as the holiday season approaches .Typically volume levels do not normalize until January of the new year .Low volume levels typically synch up with low volatility levels .When those two forces align together the bulls will almost always have the upper hand .Is it any wonder that this time of year the financial media begins discussing a \" Santa Claus rally \" ?Of course not , but Santa Claus is really just light volume levels and low volatility levels in this case .Recently volatility has been pretty choppy , but the Volatility Index is not showing considerable fear regarding the fiscal cliff in the near term .In fact , the VIX is trading in the middle of its recent range as shown below .At first glance , this chart does not appear to be warning us about fear at the moment .However , certain aspects of the Volatility Index ( VIX ) are largely unknown to the retail investor .The VIX is a guide for volatility in the present , but it does a poor job of projecting future volatility .Simply looking at the VIX 's current price is not the appropriate way to gauge market volatility expectations in the future .The Volatility Term Structure is a better way of understanding what the Volatility Index is saying about the future .Wikipedia lists the following definition for volatility term structure : . \" Volatility term structures list the relationship between implied volatilities and time to expiration .The term structures provide another method for traders to gauge cheap or expensive options .\" As can be seen above , the forward Volatility Term Structure indicates that volatility is expected to go higher in the future .This is not all that uncommon , but I think what is more important is the rate of change in the near term .When we look at this chart , the term structure indicates that Volatility levels roughly 4 months out ( March 2013 ) are nearly 13 % higher than they are today .By June of 2013 , volatility 's rate of change is well over 20 % higher than it is today .It is important to understand that volatility does not necessarily mean risk .Volatility typically increases when equity prices are falling , however volatility levels can rise for a variety of reasons .Uncertainty about the outcome of an event like hitting the debt ceiling could push volatility levels higher without sending equity prices sharply lower .The point is the term structure just provides clues as it is not the holy grail about looking in the future .What the Volatility term structure does tell us is that the marketplace expects a significant increase in overall volatility in the next 3 - 6 months .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.060417"}

{"text": "The odds of selling or buying a market at the precise top or bottom are pretty slim .What that means is that even the best trades will take some heat , i.e. , some adverse price movement .Indeed , distinguishing between normal heat -- random price movement around an entry -- and just plain being wrong on the trade is an important component of trading expertise .The recent post on emotionally intelligent trading is highly relevant to the issue of taking heat on trades .The emotionally intelligent trader uses the feelings generated by adverse movement to become more market focused , absorbed in the details of how and why the market is moving .If the heat on an S&P trade occurs on a modest TICK reading , for example , and is not confirmed by similar moves among small cap stocks and leading sectors , the trader may well conclude that it is merely noise .Conversely , if a leading sector moves opposite one 's trade and the broad market follows , the heat may represent an important shift in short - term sentiment and warrant a quick exit .The emotionally intelligent trader neither ignores the heat nor overreacts to it .Instead , it becomes a prod to revisit one 's trade and trade assumptions .One of the common reactions I observe among traders is that they react to heat with frustration and a venting of emotion .This creates distraction and a lapse in concentration .Lacking emotional intelligence , the trader takes the heat personally rather than as fresh market information .When reactions are personalized in this manner , it is difficult to make decisions that are not impulsive .A great way to deal with heat is to anticipate it .When traders react personally to adverse movement , it 's often because they did n't expect to take heat .If you check out the posts on hot and cold emotional states and using imagery to accelerate behavior change , you 'll see that mentally rehearsing expectable heat ( and one 's desired reactions to the heat ) can very much instill sound trading behaviors .When we vividly imagine adverse movement and what we would do under various scenarios , the heat becomes familiar to us ; it loses its threat value .Heat on a trade does n't have to make us hot - headed .These qualities pretty much read as a collection of strengths that are present among most successful traders .To be sure , there are many cognitive strengths that are necessary to trading success , including pattern recognition , memory , and speed of processing .These will not yield consistent profitability , however , if not supplemented with emotional strengths .In a social interaction , the emotionally intelligent person picks up on subtle cues -- tone of voice , body language , changes of topic -- to track others and respond effectively .When people become caught up in their own emotions , they become emotionally unintelligent .They respond to others out of their own neediness , anger , or insecurities and fail to track what is really being communicated .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.516754"}

{"text": "Implied equity market volatility ( as measured by VIX ) is determined by a reflexive loop between the derivative and underlying markets based on future estimate of realized volatility of the underlying ( S&P500 Index ) + characteristic movements of the underlying .There are of course many more factors that affect the VIX -- such as skew of implied volatility curve , day of the week , holidays in a given month , upcoming events that could impact the market -- just to name a few .Unlike determining the direction of stock prices , forecasting volatility can be a matter with which investors are unfamiliar .While this may sound like a complex concept , it can be easily broken down into three parts .The first step involves looking at estimates of future realized volatility .V - Lab is an excellent website to get up - to - date estimates of the future realized volatility of the S&P500 Index based on various GARCH models .( Wikipedia is an excellent resource to understand the technical definitions of GARCH Models ) .In V - Lab , click on SPX , and several analyses of S&P500 Index will show .I like to look at EGARCH return series ( just a personal preference ) .The graph below is from V - Lab and shows EGARCH volatility prediction for future realized volatility of the S&P500 Index .As of August 23 , 2012 , the value for 1-month prediction was 15.13 % .One should then compare this number to the At - The - Money ( ATM ) implied volatility level of S&P500 Index options , depending on number of days to go before expiration .Since we have two weeks remaining to August expiration , we should average the implied volatility levels of SPY August and September 139/140 strike options , which are At - the - money .ATM implied volatility numbers can be found in Morningstar 's website under \" Options \" tab for SPY and the average currently stands at 14.4 % .Usually , volatility values from EGARCH model are a couple of points lower than implied volatility values of ATM options .The reason is that investors would rather buy options than sell them , given a 50/50 outcome of a gain vs. a loss , because the potential payout of unlimited gain and limited risk is far more attractive .Furthermore , if the EGARCH model estimate of 15.13 % proves to be accurate , options theory tells us that one could purchase an ATM options straddle at 14.4 % volatility level and dynamically scalp deltas at 15.13 % volatility level for a small , but riskless profit .Commissions , slippage and other costs could make this trade less attractive , but these costs are very low for market makers .To market makers , the current situation would be like owning almost free options , and almost free options are always good to own .Based on realized ( future estimate ) volatility analysis , I would say that current implied volatility levels are undervalued .The second step is to look at median values of VIX dependent on where SPY prices are relative to its various moving averages because changes in VIX are dependent not only in the volatility of SPY prices , but also in how comfortable investors are about the market .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.723522"}
{"text": "Exhibit 7 shows that the volatility in forward views of the US policy rate has tended to be higher during periods of positive data surprises .The same dynamic is true in the UK .Over the last few weeks , as the data have improved we have already seen a fresh rise in shorter - dated yields , so anxieties here have not been calmed completely .If growth moves decisively above 3 % and the unemployment rate continues to fall steadily , the market is likely to worry more about the Fed 's resolve unless guidance is very clear .We expect both the UK and US to breach the formal unemployment thresholds this year .While these kinds of communication challenges will be an issue even if central banks remain committed to their current strategy , policymakers themselves may begin to sound less committed to prolonged easy policy as the recovery becomes more visible .That is clearly possible in the UK and US .But there is also a risk that the Bank of Japan may sound less committed to sustained asset purchases as inflation picks up .A premature focus on their exit strategy would pose a risk to bullish Japanese equity and bearish JPY views .Low risk premia create valuation challenges .Beyond the challenges from rates markets , concerns about valuations - not just in bonds and credit but in equities too - have clearly intensified .Some of those concerns we think are really worries about the longevity of the rally rather than the levels of markets .But as the expansion and market rally have progressed , risk premia have clearly fallen and equity valuations in particular are cited more often as a constraint .On most absolute measures of valuation ( P / E multiples , price - to - book , cyclically - adjusted P / E ratios ) , equities look modestly expensive relative to history , although they are well below the levels that have signalled significant obstacles to gains in the past .On relative measures of valuation compared with bonds or credit - the equity risk premium or equity credit premium - equities still look cheap relative to history , although less cheap than last year .So a key question ( see the next risk ) is whether real yields remain lower than normal and whether relative or absolute valuations are in the driver 's seat .Measures of the equity risk premium are derived rather than observed and we are conscious that more direct measures of risk premium - the VIX and credit spreads - are starting 2014 at their lowest levels since 2005 - 07 ( Exhibit 8) .So the tailwind from risk compression is less powerful than it has been .Our view is that that relative story will remain supportive for equities , although we agree that return prospects are lower than they were coming into 2013 .We think the macro environment remains one that supports low volatility and tight credit spreads .We have shown in the past that the level of the VIX is broadly related to the change in the US unemployment rate , and is also generally lower when growth is higher .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.744118"}

{"text": "A triangle pattern may sometimes be associated with a \" coil \" .A \" coil \" needs to recoil ( contract ) in order to build up enough potential energy for its next expansion .The pattern implies that buyers and sellers are in a period where they still hesitate where the market is heading .However , in the end , either the buyers or sellers managed to find enough conviction to break out to one side with great force .Existing Trend : There should be an established existing trend ( normally downtrend ) in order for the pattern to qualify as a continuation pattern .In other words , prices should increase and hit the downward sloping upper line then decline for at least twice ( forming at least two peaks ) .Prices should drop and hit the lower line then bounce up for at least twice ( forming at least two troughs ) .Volume : Volume should be diminishing ; heavy at the beginning and contracts as the pattern develops .However , when breakout occurs , there should be a significant increase in volume .This is because during the development of the pattern , investors are still undecided .Some are holding on to their stocks , awaiting the market 's next move , whereas the others are buying and selling sooner , which translates into a narrowing range of the peaks and troughs .When breakout finally occurs , volume should increase significantly , because investors finally have enough conviction about the market direction and they are eager to release their pent - up supply or demand .Duration : On a daily chart , this pattern usually may take about 1 to 3 months to form .Generally , the longer it takes to form the triangle ( or the longer the timeframe of the triangle formation ) , the stronger the breakout would be .Potential Price Target : 1 ) Compute the height of the triangle at its widest part ( on the left of the chart ) .The height is determined by projecting & measuring a vertical line from the highest high point on upper line to the horizontal lower line .2 ) Subtract the result from the breakout point ( i.e. the horizontal lower line ) to get the potential price target .Return to Breakout Level : After the breakout through the lower line occurred , it is common that prices could bounce back to the lower line for an immediate test of this new resistance before resuming their downward moves .This is because the lower line that previously acted as support now turns into resistance .( Remember the basic principle of technical analysis that resistance turns into support , or vice versa ) .However , it should not reenter the triangle and/or even close above the upper line .Breakout Direction :Although Descending Triangle is generally considered as bearish pattern ( i.e. the breakout should be to the downside ) , it may sometimes break to the upside instead ( i.e. break out through the upper line ) .When Breakout Should Occur : The breakout from a triangle pattern should occur well before the pattern reaches the apex of the triangle ( i.e. should be somewhere between two - thirds and three - quarters of the horizontal width of the triangle ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.20318"}
{"text": "We highlight five key risks on each front , although in practice it is hard to separate the two categories so neatly and , if we are wrong in one area , it may increase the chance of being wrong in others .The biggest issues revolve around two main areas .The first area is the supply side of the global economy and whether better demand growth will increase focus on capacity constraints and put upward pressure on bond yields .The second area is policy risk , where the key challenge is the exit from extraordinary monetary stimulus , but where fiscal risks and the constraints on EM policymakers are also still critical .Those challenges are heightened by the difficulties of communicating with the market in the unfamiliar terrain of forward guidance and asset purchases .In laying out our Top Market Themes , we have focused on the prospects for hedging against the risk of a sharper rise in bond yields and concerns about premature monetary tightening .The risks below set out a broader range of areas where hedges could be worth exploring .Five risks to our economic forecast .Our central forecasts look for accelerating growth in the DM economies , against the backdrop of continued low inflation and low policy rates .The shift in the US to sustained above - trend growth , in particular , has been the backbone of our economic and market views for some time .Any forecaster knows that there are many ways to be wrong , so we are not attempting to be comprehensive .But the five risks below would have a material impact on the way we see the economic backdrop .It is hard to balance how likely each risk is with how problematic they would be for our views , so the order should not be interpreted as a ranking : .The core of the story on why we expect US ( and DM ) growth to accelerate in 2014 is set out in Exhibit 1 .The chart shows our estimates of the private- and public - sector impulses for growth in the US .On that basis , we see private - sector healing having already led to an improving impulse but this was masked by significant drag from the public sector in 2013 .As that fiscal drag alleviates in 2014 , alongside a still - positive private - sector story , we should see overall GDP growth pick up .A key risk is that the alleviation of fiscal drag adds less to growth than we expect .That could happen for one of two reasons .First , underlying fiscal drag in 2013 may turn out to have been smaller than we estimated .If so , this would mean that the private sector has added less to growth and , as the fiscal drag alleviated , any acceleration would be more modest .Second , our assumptions about current fiscal plans may turn out to be too optimistic .We have already highlighted the prospective drag in Japan , where the consumption tax on current plans is set to deliver a sizeable negative fiscal impulse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.332558"}

{"text": "Other shocks that directly affect the EMBI+ premia are assumed to be uncorrelated with the timing of FOMC meetings .This assumption resembles the desired characteristics of an instrument in IV regressions .However , the timing of FOMC meetings affects the variance , not the level of shocks , so a usual IV strategy can not be employed .The methodology of identification through heteroskedasticity yields a synthetic instrument based on differences in the covariance matrices of our data between dates when the FOMC does and does not meet .Our findings are presented in Section 3 , where we show that unexpected policy - induced increases in interest rates lead to greater EMBI+ premia and , by implication , default risk in emerging economies .A 1 basis - point increase in 10-year U.S. real interest rates raises EMBI+ premia by around 1 basis point , which means that the cost of borrowing in emerging economies rises substantially more than in the U.S.This confirms the hypothesised theoretical relationship between changes in U.S. real interest rates and the risk of default and suggests that more attention ought to be paid to this relationship in the literature on default risk .A positive correlation between default risk and U.S. real interest rates would imply that emerging economies should issue debt contingent on U.S. real interest rates because such a contingency would negate the increased default risk not associated with fundamental changes in emerging economies .Note , however , that this policy prescription depends not on the causal relationship between U.S. real interest rates and the EMBI+ premium , but on the correlation between both .Omitted variables that significantly affect this correlation would also affect the performance of debt contracts contingent on U.S. real interest rates .In actuality , on dates when the FOMC does not meet , we observe a significant correlation with the opposite sign : changes in real interest rates are negatively related to changes in EMBI+ premia .Moreover , the overall correlation between real interest rates and the EMBI+ premium is negative : a 2 bp increase in the 10-year U.S. real rate is on average related to a 1 bp decrease in the EMBI+ .The results suggest that high real interest rates reflect favourable external conditions for emerging markets , which reduce the risk of default .This finding resonates with that of Longstaff et al .( 2011 ) , where global risk factors ( proxied by U.S. markets ) are shown to be the major determinant of sovereign credit risk premia .Regardless of the precise reason for the negative correlation , the policy implication is clear : emerging economies should not issue debt contingent on U.S. real interest rates .Previous academic work has attempted to establish the nature of the relationship between U.S. real interest rates and sovereign default risk by applying different methods to deal with the aforementioned endogeneity problems .Some of this work has relied on structural assumptions in vector autoregressions to identify the relationship ( e.g. , Uribe and Yue 2006 ) .For our purposes , high - frequency data on financial prices can provide more information and allow for a cleaner identification strategy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.50565"}
{"text": "For example , at the start of a new expiration month ( say August ) , VXX would be holding nearly 100 % August VIX futures in its portfolio .With two weeks to go to expiration , VXX would be holding roughly 50 % August VIX futures and 50 % September VIX futures .As August expiration approaches , VXX would be holding closer to 100 % September VIX futures position .The daily performance of VXX would be similar to the weighted average daily price changes of the first two monthly VIX futures positions .Many investors who thought VXX was a good instrument to buy and hold or use it as a hedge against rising volatility have suffered considerable losses .Mainly , this is because of the cost of carry as a result of contango in the very futures instruments that VXX holds in its portfolio .Contango means that each subsequent expiration month of VIX futures prices are trading higher than the closer month 's VIX futures prices and the spot VIX overall ( upward sloping curve ) .The effects of contango on VXX can be seen visually in the graph below .The graph shows the average premium the front month and second month VIX futures trades over spot VIX over time , along with cumulative average cost per month that puts significant downward pressure on VXX prices .When in contango , VIX front month futures ( in blue ) on average start off 10 % higher than the spot VIX with 21 trading days to go before expiration .As expiration approaches , this premium goes to zero .Likewise , VIX second month futures ( in red ) on average start off 15 % higher than spot VIX .The premium on this goes down as well as time passes .The net effect ( shown in Green ) is that VIX futures contango has reduced on average the price of VXX by 6.5 % per month !Remember , when VIX rises above 25 level , VIX futures usually goes into backwardation .Backwardation can be understood as the opposite phenomenon as contango .When VIX futures are in backwardation , VXX prices would theoretically rise as time passes , even if spot VIX were to remain constant .To test the accuracy of how contango affects VXX prices , I plotted VXX prices from the beginning of 2012 and compared this to the theoretical VXX price taking into account the daily price change of VIX less the average daily cost burden from VIX futures contango .As you can see over time , theoretical VXX prices mirrored actual VXX prices as shown in the graph below .As a rule of thumb , from the beginning of a new expiration month , the average daily cost from contango has been 0.25 % for each trading day .With 5 days to go before expiration , however , the cost has jumped to 0.45 % for each trading day .More appropriate way of looking at this is on a weekly basis .With 4 weeks to go before expiration , the effects of contango has eaten away on average 1.25 % from the price of VXX each passing week , but during the final week 2.25 % has been chomped off .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.52398"}

{"text": "Long time blog readers are familiar with my use of the NYSE TICK as a trading tool .As I noted in today 's Twitter posts , today 's market was a nice example of strong underlying buying interest among NYSE issues , as measured by the Cumulative TICK .As a rule , it pays to trade in the direction of the Cumulative TICK , as that reveals buying vs. selling sentiment across the broad range of NYSE issues .In e - Signal , the NYSE TICK goes by the symbol $ TICK .Closely related is the TICK measurement that is specific to the Dow Industrial stocks , $ TICKI .Here we 're tracking how many Dow stocks are trading on upticks vs. downticks at any given moment ( the figure is updated about 6 times per minute ) .Because the Dow stocks trade very actively , TICKI moves much more quickly than TICK .Most traders do n't understand TICKI , and few utilize the indicator because it seems so noisy .As I noted in an earlier post , the Dow TICK is sensitive to program trading , because the Dow stocks are frequent constituents of baskets of stocks .This creates an interesting dynamic between $ TICKI and $ TICK .We can have situations in which there is program selling of large cap issues , for example , but strong underlying demand for stocks overall .That was indeed the case in today 's market .As the chart above depicts , the Cumulative TICKI ( a cumulative line of the one minute H+L+C values ) danced above and below the zero line during the first part of the day 's trade , even as the Cumulative TICK was in a strong uptrend .What that tells us , as a rule , is that program trading is limited and can not drag down the broad range of stocks .In such an environment , pullbacks in Cumulative TICKI that occur at successively higher Cumulative TICK levels ( and successively higher ES prices ) often are great entries to follow the trend .You 're letting the temporary program selling move the market lower to give you a better entry on the long side .The reverse is true during market declines : bounces in TICKI in a weak Cumulative TICK and price market often provide excellent entries for shorting and riding the downtrend .I find that plotting a short - term moving average of TICKI ( 10 periods on a 1-minute chart ) helps filter out the noise and helps traders identify whether TICKI is staying mostly above or below the zero line .Recall that a cornerstone of the solution - focused approach is that working on weaknesses will at best take deficient performance and turn it to average .That can be helpful , but in itself will not make you a stellar performer .To get to that proverbial next level , you need to build on your strengths and become more consistent in drawing upon them .But how can you build on strengths if you 're not fully aware of what they are , and if you 're not targeting them with positive goals that you work on daily ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.41643"}

{"text": "These shared characteristics allow us to divide exchange - traded funds into categories ; here we define the ETF categories used in AAII 's Guide to Exchange - Traded Funds .In the guide , the individual fund listings appear alphabetically within each category .Stock ETFs .ETFs that invest in common stocks typically follow indexes based on market capitalization , country , style , sector , industry or a combination of these characteristics .The underlying index may either be well known , such as the S&P 500 , or one that has been created for the fund to follow .Over the stock market cycles , large stocks behave differently from small stocks , domestic stocks do not move in unison with foreign or emerging market stocks , and stocks in different sectors or industries react differently to the same economic and business conditions .For investors to make initial investment decisions on stock - based ETFs and to compare and evaluate the ongoing performance of investments in stock - based ETFs , grouping similar funds together into cohesive categories is a logical first step .Large - Cap Stock : In funds categorized by stock size , the \" cap \" stands for capitalization ( market share price times number of shares of common stock outstanding ) .Large - cap stocks are usually stocks of national or multinational firms with well - known products or services provided to consumers , other businesses or governments .Most of the stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average , the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100 are , for example , large - cap stocks .While some large - cap stocks are more volatile than others , a well - diversified ETF portfolio of large - cap stocks would perform similarly to most investors ' conception of the stock market .Large - cap stocks , as a category , also tend to pay the highest cash dividends , although many large - cap stocks pay no dividends .Large - cap stock funds , in summary , tend to have the lowest volatility and highest dividend yield in the domestic common stock group .Mid - Cap Stock : Mid - cap stocks are , as their name implies , smaller than the largest domestic stocks .They are usually established firms in established industries with regional , national and sometimes international markets for their products and services .The S&P MidCap 400 index is the best - known benchmark for mid - cap stocks .These ETFs would tend to have lower dividend yields than large - cap funds and to have somewhat higher volatility .Small - Cap Stock : Small - cap stocks are often emerging firms in sometimes emerging industries .But also , these small companies can be established firms with local , regional and sometimes even national and international markets .The most well - known benchmark for this group is the S&P SmallCap 600 index .These stocks must have liquid enough trading for ETFs to invest and , although small , are still listed on the New York Stock Exchange , the American Stock Exchange or NASDAQ .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.62703"}
{"text": "\" You want something that tracks the price of gold as close to dollar to dollar as possible . \"Gold ETFs .Gold exchange - traded funds are a popular way to have gold exposure in your portfolio without the hassle of storing the physical metal .First , you can invest in one of three physically backed ETFs , which track gold 's spot price .The most heavily traded ETF is SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) , which saw record inflows as fears ballooned over Europe sovereign debt fears and a struggling U.S. economy .Big guns like George Soros and John Paulson own the stock .iShares Comex Gold Trust ( IAU ) is the cheapest ETF with a 0.25 % fee .The newest gold ETF is ETFS Gold Trust ( SGOL ) , which launched in September 2009 .This gold ETF actually stores its gold bullion in Switzerland and gives investors access to different types of gold .For each share of these ETFs you buy , you generally own the equivalent 1/10 an ounce of gold .If investor demand outpaces available shares then the issuer must buy more physical gold to convert it into stock .Conversely , when investors sell , if there are no buyers , then gold is redeemed and the company must then sell the gold equivalent .Gold is a tool for investors and for traders looking for gold exposure or as a way to hedge other gold positions .The result can be rough violent price action .Expense ratios can range from 0.25 % to 0.50 % and your value erodes the longer you hold the shares .The fund must sell gold , for example , periodically to pay for expenses which decreases the amount of gold allocated to each share .There are also two types of gold stored in the ETFs , allocated and unallocated .Allocated gold is the bullion held by the custodian , big banks .Custodians provide a bar list of all the individual allocated bars daily and are typically audited twice a year , paid for by the sponsor , by an independent party like Inspectorate International .Unallocated gold relates to authorized participants like JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs who trade gold futures .Futures contracts are often bought if the trustee needs to create new shares fast and does n't have the time to buy and deliver the bullion .Typically allocated gold far outweighs the unallocated gold and the amounts are tallied each day by the custodian .The ETF also has a set amount of time when it must deliver the physical gold into the vault .Because you own shares and not the physical metal , precious metal ETFs may be sold short , so two people can own the same \" gold \" -- the original owner and the investor who is borrowing the shares .Although baskets of shares are allocated to specific gold bars , which can be found in the ETF 's prospectus , an investor must share ownership .Profits made on investments in physically backed ETFs are also taxed like collectibles , at around 28 % -- an investor gets taxed as if he owned bullion , when in reality he just owns paper .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.63085"}

{"text": "This is particularly true with respect to epistemology , that branch of philosophy that deals with knowledge and its acquisition .What we count as truth ultimately determines how we pursue truth , whether in markets , science , or politics .Ms. Rand also stressed that contradictions can not exist in reality .Where we find a contradiction , she advised , check your premises .At least one of them will be incorrect .The positivism expressed by David Aronson 's fine book Evidence - Base Technical Analysis yields just such a contradiction .Before I launch into the contradiction and a possible resolution , allow me to mention ( on an unsolicited basis ! ) that Aronson 's book is a substantial contribution to the literature on technical analysis .Specifically , Aronson has accomplished four worthy ends : .For a book that deals with technical themes of logic and mathematics , his work is eminently readable and understandable .I would rate it alongside Kenneth Grant 's \" Trading Risk \" as a must read for developing traders .That having been said , I believe Aronson 's positivist roots -- leading him to equate knowledge with declarative statements known to be true -- create a Randian contradiction .If all knowledge consists of verifiable statements about observables , then Wittgenstein is correct in his formulation : Whereof we can not speak , thereof we must be silent .Subjective knowledge must be an oxymoron .But here is the contradiction : It is common -- certainly in my visits to proprietary trading firms , hedge funds , and investment banks -- to find discretionary traders who have achieved a high level of trading success year after year , trading actively .Indeed , I wrote about just such an individual in my new book on trader performance .These are not mere anonymous figures on bulletin boards puffing up their performance stats .These are traders who have account statements and risk managers able to verify their superior performance .And yet they can not verbalize specific rules or systems for their trading .In short , they have knowledge , but it is not of the verbal , declarative kind .The existence of such implicit learning has been known in cognitive neuroscience circles for decades .Philosopher Michael Polanyi offered an influential treatise on tacit forms of knowledge , and Arthur Reber began his groundbreaking studies in the 1960s , culminating in his 1993 text \" Implicit Learning and Tacit Knowledge \" .More recently , Timothy Curran , in the \" Handbook of Implicit Learning \" summarized research that found different brain mechanisms mediating implicit learning and explicit , verbal knowing .How does implicit learning occur ?Through intensive repetition , in which individuals become sensitive to complex and noisy patterns .This is how young children learn to speak grammatical English before they can verbalize the rules of English grammar .It 's also how we can identify a face that we could never adequately describe in words , and it 's how we know when such a face is starting to display anger or sadness .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.74431"}

{"text": "Interestingly , they can anticipate events in those sequences , but can not verbalize the complex patterns that they have internalized .( The research of Axel Cleeremans is particularly eloquent on this point ) .Such subjective knowledge is not \" devoid of information \" as positivist philosophy would have it .There are , of course , intutions that prove to be invalid , but reducing all knowledge to testable hypotheses would probably eliminate most of the knowledge and understanding that lies behind great art , as well as most performance fields such as athletics .The deep knowing of musicians , chess players , and fighter pilots can hardly be reduced to sets of explicit propositions .If we admit the possibility of such subjective knowledge , then it follows that the development of algorithmic systems with fully backtested rules is not the only way to achieve trading success .It may be possible to generate success by accelerating processes of implicit learning through the use of simulation / replay and intensive feedback .Ironically , the weakness of much technical analysis is not that it is subjective , but that it pretends to an objectivity that it can not support .Can there ever be an objective basis for subjective knowledge ?I believe so .A trader 's track record of profit / loss can be compared to random entries / exits ( as well as buy and hold ) to objectively determine whether or not that trader -- over time -- exhibits significant skill .Imagine a Monte Carlo simulation in which we create random entries and exits each day that a trader trades , with identical trading frequency and holding times .Suppose that such a simulation is conducted 10,000 times by computer .The resulting distribution of P / L would display the likelihood of achieving a given level of profitability by chance alone .If a trader 's subjective trading methods consistently produce results at the very upper tail of that distribution , we can objectively infer that the subjective trader is skilled .In other words , by treating each trader as a trading system , we can evaluate that trader 's level of knowledge , regardless of whether the knowledge is subjective or objective .In the absence of such score - keeping , discretionary traders have no basis for a belief that they possess a true edge in the marketplace .One need not resort to positivism -- or system - based trading -- to be rigorously scientific .It is precisely because intuitions are fallible and human senses are so easily deceived that we need to distinguish truly superior outcomes from merely random ones .This was illustrated for me quite recently when I read that we were due for a meaningful correction because we had n't had one for a while .Let 's see if that reasoning is valid .It turns out that we have n't seen a daily 1 % or greater decline in the cash S&P 500 Index ( $ SPX ) in over 60 trading sessions .Over essentially every time frame leading up to 60 days , moreover , we see above average returns following from periods in which we have n't had a 1 % daily correction .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.97151"}
{"text": "5 ) Substance Abuse - Traders in early burnout stage may try to self - medicate to feel better and to escape their situations .Food may also serve as a refuge .I recommend a several step program for traders who are burning out : . 1 ) Take a Break - The worst thing a trader can do is feel guilty and try to force themselves to work harder .Burnout is not laziness , and it will not go away with willpower .Getting away from work stress and attending to good sleeping and eating patterns can help provide the energy for a comeback .2 ) Get Help - Sometimes what looks like burnout can be a different problem : depression or an endocrine imbalance .Getting a medical workup is important to rule out physical causes of fatigue .If the problem indeed turns out to be burnout , short - term counseling / therapy can be very helpful in getting a handle on situations that feel overwhelming .3 ) Regain Control - A common denominator in much burnout is a perceived loss of control over one 's situation .Setting reasonable work goals , managing time effectively and reasonably , and finding elements in the situation that can be controlled all can be very helpful .By keeping goals modest and building small success experiences , traders can regain optimism and energy .Burnout is common within high stress , high demand , fast paced fields , such as ambulance / EMT work ; nursing ; military combat ; and medical residencies .By recognizing that burnout is a potential occupational hazard , traders can take a preventive stance by keeping expectations realistic and getting plenty of time away from work , in activities they enjoy and can control .If you are no longer enjoying your trading ; if you respond to losses but get little enjoyment from gains ; if you stop caring about your work ; or if you are just too overloaded to get the work done , consider the possibility of burnout .Renewing yourself early in the process can save a career .There are a few indicators I follow daily that reflect momentum and strength in the stock market .I look to these indicators to give me an idea of whether stocks overall are strengthening or weakening .If strengthening , I tend to look for continuation of uptrends or short - term reversals of downtrends .If weakening , I look for downtrends to continue or uptrends to reverse .I use these measures more as a heads - up than as precise timing devices .They 've been very helpful in keeping me in trending moves and avoiding chasing moves that are about to reverse .So what are the indicators and what are they saying now ?My first measure is the number of stocks in the S&P 500 Index that are trading above their 50-day moving averages .At present , that percentage is 23 % , which has -- over the last few years -- been a level at which we 've tended to see intermediate - term market bottoming .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.0112"}

{"text": "Overall when we zoom back out and look at the secular trend , there is one very clear conclusion that can be made .As goes the HUI , so goes its volume .The HUI gained 1331 % from its November 2000 low to its March 2008 high .And provocatively , from full year 2001 to 2009 , HUI volume has risen by nearly the same amount .But this 1323 % rise in average HUI daily composite volume only tells part of the story on the popularity front .If we want to gain a clearer picture of investor interest in gold stocks , we need to consider capital volume .Capital volume is a way of quantifying volume in dollars .And with the availability of historical volume and price data , there are a number of different ways we can look at it .In the chart above I present it at an individual - stock level in order to see the capital volume of the average HUI component stock over the course of this bull .The calculation is simple , multiplying the average annual share price of HUI component stocks by the average annual daily volume .As is apparent , in the early years gold stocks did n't swing around very much capital .In 2001 the average HUI gold stock traded at $ 6.72 per share with an average daily volume of 603k shares .This is the equivalent of daily capital volume of only about $ 4.1 m .In the subsequent years rising share prices naturally led to a higher HUI , and when volume is thrown into the mix we can gain a better understanding of the kind of money that was finding its way into the gold stock trade .As mentioned earlier , 2006 was the breakout year for gold stocks .And capital volume was a big constituent of the coming - out party .With an average share price of nearly $ 23 and average daily component volume of about 3.0 m shares , average capital volume skyrocketed to nearly $ 70 m per day .This 189 % increase over 2005 capital volume showed sharply growing investor interest in these once - unknown gold mining companies .And the popularity of these gold stocks has continued to grow into 2009 .So far this year the average HUI component share price is right around $ 25 with average daily component volume at nearly 6.5 m shares .This average daily capital volume of $ 162 m is a staggering 3908 % higher than it was in 2001 !Gold stocks have indeed grown in popularity , but there is a lot more room to run in this still - small sector .To put the capital volume of the average HUI component stock in context , consider the average daily capital volume of these mainstream favorites so far in 2009 .INTC - $ 1100 m , USB - $ 528 m , MCD - $ 553 m , F - $ 421 m , AAPL - $ 2900 m , and CHK - $ 341 m .To take this a step further , let 's compare the HUI 's full year 2008 cumulative capital volume to that of another market darling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.325714"}

{"text": "Relying on a trading coach to review your trading practices and address these factors can be promising . 2 ) Do the problems primarily result from poor trading , or are the problems a primary cause of poor trading ?- This can be tricky to sort out , because the direction of causality often goes both ways .Many times , poor trading practices -- such as trading excessive risk -- lead to emotional fallout , such as frustration , anxiety , or even depression .Working on changing emotions might be helpful , but the root cause -- the faulty money management -- needs to be addressed .Conversely , there are times when emotional problems , such as performance anxiety , get in the way of trading plans and trading results .It is very helpful to examine trading problems in a step - by - step fashion , to see where emotions are affecting trading and to see where trading is creating emotional pressures .The most difficult emotional interference in trading occurs when longstanding emotional patterns and conflicts spill over into handling the risk and uncertainty of trading .A rebellious teen with unresolved control issues with parents can easily grow up into a trader who rebels against rules and plans , undercutting his own trading .A person who has been traumatized by losses of loved ones may find it difficult to handle financial losses .Someone who never learned to regulate anger and frustration as a child may now find these emotions derailing sound decision making in markets .When the past is intruding into the present , affecting emotional well being and trading performance , sound psychological assistance -- even the short - term methods of brief therapies -- can be very helpful .When , however , skills have n't been learned and a trader lacks a true edge , then trading may be causing emotional frustration and anxiety .Many traders try to front run their learning curves , putting capital to work before they 're ready , creating stress and distress in the process .Psychology is vital to good trading , but you need to trade well to sustain a sound psyche .One pattern that I 've seen play out on multiple timeframes is that price breakouts that lead to a surge in the number of stocks making new highs tend to be followed by consolidation / reversal in the short run , but continuation thereafter .This sets up useful trades in which initial pullbacks following these surges can make nice entry points for subsequent upside moves .Interestingly , ten days after the surge in new highs , SPY averaged a gain of only .05 % ( 122 up , 91 down ) , compared with an average gain of .08 %( 787 up , 572 down ) for the remainder of the sample .The surge in strength does not necessarily result in significant near - term gains , but it is common to see momentum carry the market higher in the longer run .In a future post , I will illustrate this pattern at intraday time frames .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.2534"}

{"text": "Each level of the Fibonacci fan acts as support and resistance line and is very useful when the market is trending .As you can see in the weekly chart of the EUR / USD above , the market recently paused at the 61.8 % level .A bounce back up here could be a great new long entry point .The lines create candidate support areas during an uptrend and potential resistance areas during a downtrend .We usually like to see a confirmed bounce before taking action but the analysis helps us plan ahead for those technical areas that are likely to become important .How to draw Fans The process for drawing Fibonacci fan lines is similar to Fibonacci retracements but because they accommodate the trend , they may have to be adjusted less frequently .First , identify the trend by anchoring the Fibonacci fan study to the major top and bottom of the trend you are analyzing .In the example above , we used the top and bottom of the 2009 rally in the EUR / USD .Here are a few tips that will help you better understand how Fibonacci fans work , and how you can begin experimenting with them in your own trading .How to anchor Fans Like a Fibonacci retracement analysis , determining where the tops and bottoms of the trend are is somewhat subjective .However , Fibonacci rays , like retracements , can tolerate a fair amount of variation as long as you are picking significant highs and lows .Here is an example of the same EUR / USD chart but rather than anchoring the bottom of the analysis with in March was replaced with the major bottom that occurred in November .As you can see the fans lines were still very helpful in identifying December 's support level .EUR / USD .Other things to consider .In the video we will look at a specific example of this kind of situation .Quite often the study will stay intact as long as the trend itself lasts .Entry points and profit targets The distance between fan lines becomes wider the further the trend extends .Be aware that this makes developing a consistent rule of thumb for entry points and profit targets more difficult than it is for Fibonacci retracements .Very steep trends are not very conducive to this kind of analysis .In the video you will see the affects of this problem when the trend used to anchor the Fibonacci fan study was a result of a very fast moving market .In these situations the market almost immediately moves outside the range of the Fibonacci fan study and limits its usefulness .Alternatively , very fast trends or corrections can be ideal situations for a Fibonacci retracement study to find potential areas of support or resistance .Got the time ?Learn to use Fibonacci time studies to identify major reversals .Fibonacci analysis can be enhanced by using time projections .Fibonacci time forecasts are applied to a chart like other Fibonacci studies , and work best when combined with either a retracement or fan study .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.5963"}
