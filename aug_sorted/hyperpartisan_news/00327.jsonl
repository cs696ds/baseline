{"text": "But only one pinger was heard , and aircraft carry two black boxes , each equipped with a pinger .Oceans are filled with natural noise , so black box pingers are designed to make a unique sound on a frequency different from natural noise , but it could be noise from a nuclear sub , and it 's known there 's at least one sub in the area .Experts said if the pings came from the missing aircraft , there should have been two pings , because the plane carries two black boxes and each has a pinger .But the pinger batteries of the missing plane would die sometime this weekend , and it 's possible one of the pingers had already died and the ship picked up the other one during its last minute - and - a - half of signaling .There have been many false hopes and deadends in the search for the missing plane .But even if the pingers are no longer broadcasting , searchers should be able to determine with sonar whether plane wreckage is nearby .If the sounds came from a black box , the plane wreckage should be within an area of four square miles , and is almost certain to be found .However , neither the pinger noise nor the floating debris is verified at this point .The Chinese ship detected the pings outside the search area but nearby .The debris sighting was 56 miles away from that location .The area of interest is a couple hundred miles closer to western Australia than the main search area , and at about the same latitude .Hobby Lobby also invests in corporations that manufacture abortion pills .So I choose to use a internet browser that some bigot created .He should have said that he only created it for heterosexuals .Put it out there .Be honest .Tell it like it is .Advertise Gays not Welcome , see your profits drops .Have the balls other than to put up a sign that says stone the gays .Tolerance ?Where is the tolerance .Nothing more than hate mongering and inciting violence , from you guessed it the religious tolerant .Good fucking day to you !In the Western Australian Senate Election re - run , looks like the Liberals picked up 2 seats , Labor 1 , The Greens got enough of a quota for one seat , as well as the Palmer United Party , a pro - business party started by a mining magnate .The last seat is still up for grabs , and could come down to the final preference votes of the individual voters .It may be awhile , especially if a good percentage of the voters voted below the line .Above the line voting , a voter is accepting the predetermined flow of votes by that party .It appears the voters swung against both Labor and the Liberals .Labor did n't help their own cause much when one of their candidates , a right - wing unionist , made some bad comments , about his own party .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "131.3913"}
