{"text": "Elevated testosterone appears to slow the development of neurons in the left hemisphere of the brain , causing the right hemisphere to develop better , resulting in dominance of the left side of the body .So the prevailing theory for why left - handers die out of the population is that a combination of factors put them at higher risk of impaired longevity : accidents , neuropathology , immune deficiencies , and other causes .But this is not at all to say that all left - handers are born with some physical deficiency .No evidence has ever been found showing that all left - handers have anything in common .Heritability is a major factor : left - handed children are more likely to have left - handed parents .A lot of research has been published showing possible genetic markers , but so far there is certainly nothing as specific as a \" left - handedness gene \" .Moreover , it 's certain that no genetic marker will ever be found that indicates left - handedness in every case .One of the reasons we know this for a certainty is something we 've learned from twin studies , which are a great way to see genetic traits .If there were a genetic cause for handedness , we would expect identical twins , who are genetic copies of each other , to have concordant handedness , meaning that both are the same , either left - handed or right - handed .We would expect fraternal twins , who are genetically as different from one another as any other siblings , to have the same distribution of handedness as the general population .But , strangely , this is not what we see at all .It turns out that handedness among identical twins , fraternal twins , and the distribution among the general population are all equal .Identical twins are discordant , meaning one is left - handed and the other is right - handed , just as often as are fraternal twins , and as often as all siblings .This strongly suggests that genetics are not the overwhelming driver of handedness .There 's no definitive answer as to how identical twins could end up discordant , but one leading theory is that is has to do with physical positioning within the womb .Twin fetuses usually face each other , and we 've often observed their limbs adopt mirror - image positions .This behavior may require no more exotic an explanation than a simple economy of physical space available in the womb .Handedness is often predicted by which hand is most often held closest to the fetus ' mouth , and this may indeed be the totality of the explanation for why identical twins are so frequently discordant .The question everyone wants to know about handedness is what special aptitudes left - handers have .Are they more creative ?Are they more likely to be successful ?The most surprising thing to me that I found in my own literature survey is that there seems to be weak evidence for just about any aptitude you can think of , except the most commonly believed ones .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.0514"}

{"text": "Many subsequent studies have shown no evidence that left - handed people have reduced longevity compared to right - handed people .According to Stanley Coren in The Left - Hander Syndrome , most people were only forced to write with their right hand and allowed to continue being left - handed in most other respects indicating that the decline in older left - handers is not from being forced or switching in later life .Historically , the justification of forcing use of the right - hand was in part due to the difficulty left - handers had writing with liquid ink or fountain pens .When writing with these pens , the side of the left - hander 's hand would smear the writing as it passed over the still - wet ink .While not as prone to this , modern ballpoint pens do not entirely eliminate this smudging .Writing in pencil also smudges the graphite as the hand passes over what has just been written .A simple solution to smudging and hook - hand writing is to rotate the writing paper about 20 degrees clockwise .An ink pen also has its nib cut or folded at a slight angle .If a left - handed user tries to use a regular ink pen the nib will be at the wrong angle and its corner will scratch or dig into the paper on the up stroke and flick ink over the page , unless one is particularly careful when writing .Left - handed people are sometimes placed at a disadvantage by the prevalence of right - handed tools in society .Many tools and devices are designed to be comfortably used with the right hand .For example , ( right - handed ) scissors , a very common tool , are arranged so that the line being cut along can be seen by a right - handed user , but is obscured to a left - handed user .Furthermore , the handles are often moulded in a way that is difficult for a left - hander to hold , and extensive use in such cases can lead to varying levels of discomfort .Most importantly , the scissoring or shearing action - how the blades work together ( how they are attached at the pivot ) - operates correctly for a right - hander , but a left - hander will tend to force the blades apart rather than shearing the target substance .So - called ambidextrous scissors do not help , since the cutting blades are still set right - handed .It can be difficult for left - handed children to learn to write if the teacher does not take the student 's left - handedness into account .In fact , even in the later 20th century , some UK schools were discouraging children from writing with their left hand , often seriously affecting the child 's development ( Hansard 1998 ) .When properly done , left - handed writing is a mirror image to that of the right - hander , making the teaching process confusing for the right - handed teacher of a left - handed student .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.584793"}

{"text": "This belief persisted until the early part of the 19th century , when the assumptions of popular psychology seeped into scientific explanations of left - handedness .More recently , psychologists and neurologists have tried to find a biological basis for left - handedness .One theory , proposed by Marian Annett in the 1970s , held that handedness could be explained by a notion of dominant and recessive traits , much in the way that brown and blue eyes are .Right - handedness , like brown eyes , would be a dominant trait .The twist : Left - handedness was not the recessive trait .Rather , the recessive trait was a genetic indifference to hand preference .If you receive one copy of the dominant allele from your parents , you 'll turn out to be right - handed , but if you receive two copies of the recessive allele , then it becomes a toss up between left - handedness and right - handedness .Another popular theory , put forward by the behavioral neurologist Norman Geschwind around the same time that Annett was doing her work , pointed to hormones .Geschwind claimed that people who were exposed to high concentrations of testosterone as fetuses were more likely to be left - handed .Excessive testosterone exposure correlated well with slightly higher incidences of dyslexia and epilepsy , and so , Geschwind noticed , did left - handedness .The trouble with both these theories , says Smits , is that they fail to account adequately for the surprising connections between left - handedness and twins .Not only is left - handedness twice as common among twins as among regular siblings , but left - handers are twice as likely as right - handers to produce twins .This eerie link lies at the heart of another modern theory ( and Smits 's favorite ) : that \" being a monozygotic twin is a precondition of being left - handed . \"In other words , only someone who has had a twin in utero can be truly left - handed .The twins are mirror images of one another ; one is left - handed , and the other right - handed .Of course , left - handedness does n't require that one ultimately be born with a twin .If only one fetus results at the end of term , that means the other died in the womb and was absorbed by the mother : a \" vanishing twin .\" There are two major problems with this theory , as Smits notes .One is that many twins vanish so early in a pregnancy that they are never detected .Without knowing how frequently they occur , nobody can be sure whether twins account for the 10 percent occurrence of left - handedness in the population .Another problem - one that dogs all studies about left - handedness - is that handedness is not truly a binary phenomenon : Many people use their left hands for some tasks and their right hands for others .Few are exclusively left- or right - handed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.40416"}
