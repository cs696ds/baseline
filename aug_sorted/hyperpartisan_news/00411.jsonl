{"text": "The Obama administration released 100 pages of emails Wednesday that reveal differences between intelligence analysts and State Department officials over how to describe the Sept. 11 , 2012 , attack on the U.S. post in Benghazi , Libya .The internal debate did not include political interference from the White House , according to the emails , which were provided to Congressional intelligence committees several months ago .Since the assault that killed four Americans , including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens , Republicans have accused President Obama and his senior advisers of mischaracterizing the attack , largely to prevent political repercussions during what was then a close re - election campaign .Much of the Republican concern has focused on whether administration officials acknowledged early enough that an Islamist terrorist organization was behind the attack , rather than groups of demonstrators participating in anti - American protests outside many U.S. diplomatic missions in the Middle East and North Africa .According to the emails and initial CIA - drafted talking points , the agency believed the attack included a mix of Islamist extremists from Ansar al - Sharia , an al - Qaeda affiliated group , and angry demonstrators .White House officials did not challenge that analysis , the emails show .But CIA Deputy Director Michael Morrell later removed the reference to Ansar al - Sharia because , senior administration officials said , the assessment was still classified and because FBI officials believed making the information public could compromise their investigation .Senior administration officials said Wednesday the emails capture what is a fairly routine conversation between agencies over how to talk about a major event .What was most challenging in this case , senior administration officials said , was doing so within days of the attack as intelligence agencies working in a volatile environment were trying to piece together what happened and who had carried it out .The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence requested the talking points during a Sept. 14 briefing with then - CIA Director David H. Petraeus .The request set off the internal discussion over how much information could be revealed by members of Congress in the days ahead -- and by administration officials .U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice , who did not participate in the email exchanges directly , appeared on a series of Sunday shows two days after the Petraeus briefing .The talking points she delivered emerged from the email discussion revealed Wednesday , and eventually cost her the nomination for Secretary of State amid Republican criticism that she intentionally misrepresented the attack .The talking points , which were edited a dozen times between Sept. 14 and 15 , also show that the source of the debate between the CIA and the State Department was whether previous agency warnings of attacks in the Benghazi area should be included in public statements .The two agencies had the most at stake in the Benghazi aftermath .The attacks targeted a State Department post and a CIA site , where a U.S.-effort to disarm Libya 's militia in the area was centered .Virtually no Americans were in the diplomatic post , only at the CIA site where the agency was responsible for security .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.2357"}

Paul Oetken upheld the arbitrator 's decision .Monnin had sought to have it overturned based on three grounds : the arbitrator overstepped his authority , his decision disregarded law , and she did n't know the arbitration hearing was taking place .The judge disagreed .Monnin , of Cranberry , Pa. , said in a Facebook post Thursday evening that she is glad the truth is out there , regardless of the outcome .\" This is not about me being a ' sore loser ' or wanting my ' 15 minutes of fame ' \" she wrote .\" This is about the MUO 's admission under oath that they manipulate the judges ' results to suit their own ends .This is not what they advertise to the public . \" Pageant organizers claimed Monnin resigned because she disagreed with a decision to allow transgender contestants .They made public text from an email they said Monnin sent citing the decision to allow natural - born males into the competition as the reason for her resignation .A transgender contestant was initially denied entry to the Miss Universe Canada pageant because she was n't born female , but Trump overruled that decision .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.109726"}

{"text": "But going for near future cuts in big entitlement programs ( and being willing to take the political heat for it ) would make a big difference for the country .Such cuts , focused on Medicare , were key to the budget deals that gave the United States a run of budget surpluses in the 1990s .It 's worth trying the same thing again .The entire debate over the debt ceiling is , and will remain , a bad idea .But if Republicans want to eek out a victory for the country and good public policy , they should focus on near future cuts to entitlement programs .Using rather effective sarcasm , McKibben makes the case that the spate of recent extreme weather events should be a wake - up call on the urgency of addressing climate change .He correctly points out that climate scientists have been predicting for years that carbon loading in our atmosphere will create droughts , floods and other extreme weather events .Does that scientific concurrence absolutely prove cause and effect ?No , but it does distinguish McKibben 's hysterics from those of climate deniers who point to every cold snap or snowstorm as evidence that global warming is a hoax .Because \" climate \" represents long - term trends , and day - to - day weather relies on multiple variables , it is wrong to say that any one weather event or abnormal season either proves or disproves climate change .However , weather trends that are demonstrated over time , and that track with other well - documented scientific evidence , should indeed be a wake - up call .We ignore them at our own peril .The more important question that McKibben 's op - ed begs is : How much evidence will it take to convince the American public and its elected representatives that action on climate change is warranted ?The problem is that action to address climate change not only requires the belief that it is happening ; it also requires the belief that we can do something about it .This is where the climate change deniers - along with some narrowly focused folks in the oil and coal industries - do their most damage .As the deniers ' assertion that climate change is a hoax begins to falter under the weight of reality , they have begun to pivot to the argument that climate change is a natural occurrence that mankind can not alter , only adapt to .It is an argument designed to lull people into a state of complacency - similar to the tactics totalitarian regimes use to lull their subjects into passivity and government dependency .Perhaps President Reagan recognized such tactics when he rejected the arguments of those who were trying to forestall action to address another climate problem , ozone depletion .He consulted with climate scientists , looked honestly at the evidence , accepted mankind 's role , and took prudent action to solve the problem .Reagan faced ozone depletion with the same clear - eyed realism that he faced the threats posed by the Soviet Union and communism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.71568"}

Holder Jr. , who favors civilian trials .Mr. Holder led a campaign within the administration to conduct civilian trials for Mohammed in New York City , and his prosecutors secured a grand jury indictment .But the plan for the trial of the alleged Sept. 11 mastermind faced strong political opposition from Republicans , including New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , and many Democrats .The indictment was dropped last month , paving the way for the military charges to be reinstated .Last month , Mr. Holder said he believed the U.S. government could have won the case against Mohammed in civilian court , but he blamed Congress for passing legislation that led to his referring the case back to the military commissions .\" Unfortunately , members of Congress have intervened and imposed restrictions blocking the administration from bringing any Guantanamo detainees to trial in the United States , \" Mr. Holder said in an April statement .\" While we will continue to seek to repeal those restrictions , we can not allow a trial to be further delayed for the victims of the 9/11 attacks or their families .I have full faith and confidence in the reformed military commission system to appropriately handle this case as it proceeds .\" If convicted , the charges could result in the death penalty .Robert Chesney , a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and an expert in national security law , said the announcement was not surprising . \"Setting aside the possibility that an inspection of the sworn charges reveals something unexpected , this is n't exactly a surprising development , \" Mr. Chesney said .\" We 've known since early April that the administration was giving up on the civilian prosecution option in the face of determined congressional resistance , and that these persons would instead be prosecuted by military commission after all . \"Republicans now enjoy an 11 - 8 edge over their Democratic counterparts in Illinois , which includes five GOP freshmen , but the new map - which could be legally challenged - will likely shift the delegation 's balance of power .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.701035"}
