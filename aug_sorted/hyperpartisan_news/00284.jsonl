{"text": "Why is it important to define affordability ?Affordability refers to a family 's or an individual 's ability to purchase health care at a reasonable cost .What constitutes a reasonable cost , however , varies by income level .If insurance is not adequately subsidized for low - income individuals , then they would continue to suffer excessive financial burdens .Yet , the greater the generosity of financial assistance , the higher the costs that fall to the government .Defining affordability is thus an important decision for policymakers .Today , unaffordable health care poses an undeniable burden on families .A recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 28 percent of Americans list paying for health care and health insurance as a \" serious problem .\" This should n't come as a surprise .Forty - five million people spent over 10 percent of their income on health care in 2004 .To cope with these financial difficulties many opt to delay or refuse important medical care , creating future problems and more costs .Differing interpretations of affordability .Economists use two competing approaches to understand how much households can pay for health care .The first approach considers household budgets , measuring the dollar amount each household spends on necessities and then treating health care expenditures as an extra expense .This approach considers any remaining money after the purchase of necessities in the household budget to be available for the purchase of health care .This approach does not treat health care as an essential good , but rather as a luxury item .Also , it does not consider health care spending as a proportion of one 's income .Naturally , those with larger disposable incomes can afford to spend a much higher dollar amount on health care than can those with lower incomes .The second common approach considers the share of income Americans can actually spend on health care .The costs of premiums and out - of - pocket expenses are measured as a share of income , and analysts use a sliding scale to compare this amount to a family 's or individual 's expected contribution for health care .These different ways of understanding affordability have important implications for health reforms that seek to ensure access to affordable health coverage\u00f3for example , how affordability is defined will determine who receives help with health care costs , and how much help they may receive .The state of Massachusetts uses the second approach to determine the maximum amount families can afford to pay for health insurance , measured as a proportion of their income .The scale is updated annually based on the Federal Poverty Guidelines .Those with the lowest incomes are not expected to pay any of their own money toward their monthly premiums .Those who earn more money can afford to spend a greater proportion of their income on health care , and the scale reflects this difference .Can greater individual responsibility lead to affordability ?The conservative approach to achieving affordability relies on individuals taking on more financial risk .The basic concept is that if individuals are more responsible for cost , then they will find low - cost , high - quality coverage .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.62513"}

{"text": "Debate over reforms in this area should seek to avoid old ideological battles and simplistic dismissals or endorsements of options as \" tax increases \" or \" tax cuts .\" The primary goal here is to reform health tax expenditures to make them more efficient and effective , more conducive to restraining health care costs , and less regressive .The Employer Exclusion .The employer tax exclusion is the single largest subsidy in the tax code .According to the Joint Committee on Taxation , the exclusion of employer - sponsored health care reduced federal tax collections by $ 246 billion in 2007 .[ 10 ] .As is well known , the tax exclusion is poorly targeted .It gives the greatest benefit to those with the highest incomes , although they are the group that least needs help paying for health insurance .The 24 percent of tax units with incomes over $ 75,000 in 2004 received almost half of the benefits of the exclusion , while the 27 percent of tax units with incomes under $ 20,000 received 6 percent of the benefits .The tax exclusion also exacerbates the problem of high and rising health care costs .Like any subsidy , the exclusion encourages more spending on the item that is subsidized .By reducing the after - tax price of health insurance , the exclusion provides an incentive for employers and individuals to select more generous coverage than they otherwise would purchase .Along with other factors , this leads to an increase in the demand for health care services , drives up prices in the health - care sector , and ultimately makes health care and health coverage less affordable .[ 12 ] .Because of these problems , many analysts have recommended that the tax exclusion be scaled back .Capping the tax exclusion at some dollar level could change incentives in ways that would encourage people to seek , and providers to practice , more cost - effective health care and thereby slow the growth in health care costs .But there also are legitimate concerns about such a course .Unless limits on the tax exclusion are combined with other changes , modifying the exclusion could weaken employer - sponsored insurance , which is the predominant source of health coverage for people of working age and their dependents .The tax subsidies provided through the exclusion are a primary reason why employer - based coverage is so widespread , along with the economies - of - scale and the risk pooling function that employer - based coverage provides .What to Do ?A cap on the tax exclusion could make an important contribution to health - care reform by providing a significant source of financing without eroding employer - sponsored insurance or causing other undesirable effects - if both the cap and the rest of the health care legislation are well designed .The design issues are crucial .First , most health - reform proposals include a requirement that individuals obtain health insurance for themselves and their families .This is important : faced with having to meet an individual requirement , many workers would find employer - sponsored health insurance even more attractive than it is now even if part of the benefit effectively became taxable for a minority of workers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.26683"}
{"text": "A tax on high - sugar soft drinks would reduce consumption of such beverages - and thereby improve health outcomes .The authors of the recent New England Journal of Medicine article estimate that a 10 percent price increase would cut consumption by 7.8 percent .States are out in front of the federal government here .While only 14 states levied a sales tax on food for home consumption in 2007 , some 39 states imposed a sales tax on at least some soda purchases .In some of these states , the tax on soda is simply part of the sales tax that applies to food ; in others , it is a separate or a higher tax .The best option to consider here would be to establish an excise tax on the value of soda , as Arkansas and West Virginia have done .In these states , the tax is levied on distributors , manufacturers , and wholesale dealers .( Both states also levy an equivalent tax on soft drink syrup or dry mix used to make soft drinks . )Health concerns argue for a tax levied in this \" upstream \" manner - the higher price that results operate as a nudge to reduce consumption of high - sugar beverages .[21 ] .The New England Journal of Medicine article proposed that a tax be set on those products at the rate of a penny per ounce .That would add 12 cents to the price of a 12-ounce soft drink .The authors of the article estimated this would reduce soft - drink consumption by more than 10 percent .On a back - of - the envelope basis , such a proposal should raise something over $ 10 billion a year , based on a Center for Science in the Public Interest estimate of a similar proposal .Alcohol Taxes .Federal excise taxes on alcohol now stand at their lowest level in decades .The tax on distilled spirits has been reduced 85 percent in real terms since 1951 ( i.e. , after adjusting for inflation ) .Just since 1991 , when alcohol taxes were last adjusted , these taxes have been reduced 37 percent across the board , when inflation is taken into account .Taxes on alcohol are projected to fall another 8 percent in real terms by 2019 .Looked at another way , federal excise taxes on alcohol equaled 12 percent of gross alcohol sales in 1980 .They now amount to about half that , with the percentage falling further every year .To be sure , moderate alcohol consumption can be neutral or even beneficial for health .But excess alcohol consumption imposes large costs .A study conducted for the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism by the Lewin Group found that the economic costs of alcohol abuse amounted to an estimated $ 185 billion in 1998 .Such costs include direct medical costs , lost productivity and earnings , and increased crime .For these reasons , a large group of economists , including four Nobel laureates and three former presidents of the American Economics Association , issued a statement in 2005 calling for increases in excise taxes on alcohol .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.445755"}

{"text": "[ 3 ] .Reducing Costs for Drugs Prescribed through Medicare to \" Dual Eligible \" Beneficiaries .Prior to the establishment of the Medicare Part D drug benefit , Medicaid provided prescription drug coverage to more than 6 million \" dual eligibles \" ( low - income Medicare beneficiaries who also are enrolled in Medicaid ) .In 2006 , drug coverage for these dual eligibles was shifted to Medicare .When Congress enacted the drug benefit , it assumed that the private insurers participating in Part D would be able to negotiate greater rebates from drug manufacturers than the rebates the manufacturers had been required to pay , under Medicaid , for drugs dispensed to the dual eligibles .[ 4 ] .An increasing body of research demonstrates , however , that the rebates negotiated by Medicare Part D plans actually are well below the rebates that would have been required under Medicaid .As a result , the federal government is now incurring higher drug costs for the dual eligibles than it previously incurred under Medicaid .Harvard health economists Richard Frank and Joseph Newhouse examined SEC filings among manufacturers of drugs used heavily by dual eligibles , such as anti - psychotic medications .They found that that Medicare Part D plans were not obtaining prices that approximated the prices for these drugs net of the Medicaid rebates .As a result , they found \" manufacturers have realized significant gains simply from the change in responsibility for purchasing from Medicaid to Medicare .\" [ 5 ] .Similarly , Stephen Schondelmeyer , a University of Minnesota expert on prescription - drug pricing , has estimated that most of the publicly released Medicare Part D prescription drug prices are 20 to 30 percent higher than the estimated prices in Medicaid net of the manufacturers ' rebates .[ 7 ] This figure was derived from the Committee 's review of confidential pricing documents provided by insurers and drug manufacturers at the Committee 's request .To help finance health reform and lower Medicare costs , Congress could require drug manufacturers to provide , at a minimum , the same level of rebates for prescription drugs provided to dual eligibles under Medicare Part D as would have been required under the Medicaid program .There is no Congressional Budget Office estimate for this policy option , but the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee staff estimated it would produce savings of as much as $ 86 billion over ten years .[ 8 ] .Chairman Baucus ' \" white paper \" on health reform stated that Congress should consider extending the Medicaid price discounts to Part D - covered drugs dispensed to the dual - eligible population .[ 9 ] .Revenue Offsets .This part of my statement covers four types of revenue options : .Capping the tax exclusion for employer - sponsored health care .Other health - related tax expenditures .Health - related excise taxes .Capping itemized deductions for high - income filers .Let me preface this discussion by noting that while these options would raise revenues , health care reform likely also will include tax credits to make health care affordable and enable an individual mandate to be put in place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.178116"}

Mary L. Landrieu ( D - La . ) and President Obama arrive last month in New Orleans , where he encouraged more exports to create jobs .She has since distanced herself from the president and Obamacare .( Jonathan Bachman / Associated Press ) .The three - term Louisiana Democrat was one of the final holdouts , but ultimately she backed the bill .And now in this red state - where President Obama lost by 18 percentage points in 2012 - her opponents intend to make her pay the price .As her poll numbers have plunged during the bumpy Obamacare rollout , Landrieu has rushed to contain the damage .When about 90,000 health insurance plans were canceled in her state because they did not meet the new law 's requirements , she swiftly introduced a legislative fix and bucked the White House by enlisting other Senate Democrats to support it before the president announced his own adjustment .\" I 'm fixing it ... and I 've urged the president to fix it .\" Landrieu is one of a small group of vulnerable Senate Democrats with the bad luck to be running in hotly contested races under the substantial shadow of Obamacare .Landrieu 's strategy is not without risk .While distancing herself from the law she must also avoid alienating black voters , whose solid support has been a key element in each of her narrow Senate wins .Complicating matters is Louisiana 's complex \" jungle \" election system : She will not face voters until November , when to avoid a runoff she must vanquish two Republican opponents by winning more than 50 % of the vote .Her current poll numbers show her well below that threshold .Interviews with voters here suggest that Landrieu 's biggest challenge is rebuilding her brand as a populist , and one who is less partisan than most Democrats on Capitol Hill .( Her father , Maurice Edwin \" Moon \" Landrieu , was mayor of New Orleans , a post now held by her brother Mitch . )With the healthcare law , \" she should have known what was coming , \" said Stremlau , who was grocery shopping with his young daughter in this swing territory near the shore of Lake Pontchartrain .\" She made a big mistake by toeing the line on the Democratic side for the healthcare law . \"Democrat Zack Braud , a drugstore manager from LaPlace who has also voted for Landrieu in the past , said she had not been vigilant enough in overseeing the dispersal of federal funds after Hurricane Katrina .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.60094"}
