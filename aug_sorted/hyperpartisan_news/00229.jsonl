{"text": "After all , the fact that American justices face decisions without looking at every possible viewpoint available in the written law , has nothing to do with the fact that foreign law systems are often completely alien to our own .It 's not a question of whether or not we are able to see every bit of available information , but rather that the systems by which other countries arrive at legal decisions are usually not very similar to ours .I found it interesting that Justice Breyer first announced that foreign law is \" of course \" not binding in Constitutional law , yet followed up that point by giving reasons , ostensibly , why it should be .My problem is that I do n't know what they ought to do .What is it that they ought to do ?He stated that foreign law is irrelevant to anyone who embraces that philosophy , with the exception of old English law , because of the fact that many of our legal definitions were taken from that to begin with .He went on to relate two other approaches to interpreting the Constitution .- Troy v. Dulles , 356 U.S. 86 , 101 .At that point he mentioned that he detests that phrase , arguing that societies do n't necessarily mature , and that \" sometimes they rot .\" That third philosophical approach , Scalia continued , says \" I am not looking for the evolving standards of decency of American society , I 'm looking for what is the best answer in my mind , as an intelligent judge .And for that purpose , I look to other intelligent people , and I talk sometimes about conversations with judges , and lawyers , and law students .Do you [ the law students in the audience ] think you 're representative of American society ?Do you not realize you are a small , cream at the top , and that your views on innumerable things are not the views of America at large ?And does n't it seem somewhat arrogant of you to say I can make up what the moral values of America should be on all sorts of issues ? \" The whole time he was saying this , Breyer looked as if he 'd just swallowed a prune pit , since he clearly understood ( as did I , and probably everyone else watching ) that Scalia had just implied he was arrogant .Once Justice Scalia had concluded by saying that he did not wish to undertake the responsibility of deciding what is moral and what is n't for all of society , Justice Breyer commented , \" I think that 's pretty good . \"\" It 's really because I think , and I think many judges think , that your own moral views are not the answer , that people look other places for trying to find out - how to find answers , \" he added .Yet once again his statement did n't have any bearing upon the issue raised .The question is n't whether one should look for answers as to what may be the morally right thing to do , but rather , where it is they 're looking !", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.06089"}

Bernard Sanders late Monday night that it has no results for 90 precincts across the state , which could account for as much as 5 percent of the total vote .And the party has asked the campaigns for help in getting a tally for those missing results .\" They 've asked the other campaigns to do the same thing .At the end of the day , there 's probably going to be squabbles on it , \" he added .An Iowa Democratic Party official disputed Becker 's characterization .\" We are currently getting results from our small number of outstanding precincts , and results continue to be reported on our public website , \" an Iowa Democratic Party official told Roll Call . \" The reports of precincts without chairs are inaccurate .These outstanding precincts have chairs who we are in the process of contacting to get their results .It is inaccurate to report that these precincts did not have chairs . \"\" We have reached out to the campaigns for help in contacting the chairs for our outstanding precincts .We are not taking results from the campaigns .We are taking them from the chairs who are in these precincts , \" the official added .Clinton and Sanders were locked in a virtual tie for most of the evening , with the state party announcing early Tuesday morning that Clinton achieved a slight edge in delegate counts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.27476"}

Daley .A few weeks ago I was watching a program on C - Span pertaining to the impact of foreign court opinions upon the U.S. justice system .The primary participants in the discussion were Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen Breyer , and the event took place at the American University Law School in Washington D.C. rtsp://video.c - span .org / archive / sc / sc011305_scalia .rm .The debate revolved around questions asked by a moderator named Professor Norman Dorsen , and the first multi - part question asked was , \" When we talk about the use of foreign court decisions in U.S. Constitutional cases , what body of foreign law are we talking about ?Are we limiting this to foreign constitutional law ?What about cases involving international law , such as the interpretation of treaties , including treaties to which the U.S. is a party ?When we talk about the use of foreign court decisions in U.S. law , do we mean them to be authority , or persuasive , or rhetorical ?If , for example , foreign court decisions are not understood to be precedent in U.S. Constitutional cases , are they nevertheless able to strengthen the sense that U.S. law assures a common moral and legal framework with the rest of the world ?If this is so , is that in order to strengthen the legitimacy of a decision within the U.S. , or to strengthen a decision 's legitimacy in the rest of the world ? \" Some question , huh ?I do n't think I 'd be comfortable trying to answer it all in one fell swoop , and apparently neither did the two justices .Justice Scalia began his reply by stating that most of the parts of it should be posed to Justice Breyer , simply because Scalia does not use foreign law in the interpretation of the U.S. Constitution .He stated that he will use it when interpreting a treaty , because treaties are based upon a mutual understanding of the law by the signatories thereof .That seemed like a no - brainer to me , and the point was not argued by Breyer .Scalia went on to say that , aside from that , he refuses to use foreign decisions in Constitutional law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.697556"}
