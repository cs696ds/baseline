{"text": "Time of use metering is a significant issue for renewable - energy sources , since , for example , solar power systems tend to produce energy during the daytime peak - price period , and produce little or no power during the night period , when price is low .In market rate net metering systems the user 's energy use is priced dynamically according to some function of wholesale electric prices .The users ' meters are programmed remotely to calculate the value and are read remotely .Net metering applies such variable pricing to excess power produced by a qualifying systems .Market rate metering systems will be implemented in California starting in 2006 and under the terms of California 's net metering rules will be applicable to qualifying photovoltaic and wind systems .Under California law the payback for surplus electricity sent to the grid must be equal to the ( variable , in this case ) price charged at that time .It can never be negative , meaning you can not make money from selling the electricity back .If you generate more electricity than you use then over a period of a month you will be billed zero and not make any money , in effect you give away your extra energy if you do not use it .No credit is given for annual surplus production .Australia 's \" feed - in tariff \" is actually net metering , except that it pays monthly for net generation at a higher rate than retail , with Environment Victoria Campaigns Director Mark Wakeham calling it a \" fake feed - in tariff \" .[ 3 ] A feed - in tariff requires a separate meter , and pays for all local generation at a preferential rate , while net metering requires only one meter .The financial differences are very substantial .Victoria .From 2009 , householders will be paid 60 cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid .This is around four times the current retail price for electricity .Commencing in 2008 , the Solar Bonus Scheme pays 44 cents for every excess kilowatt hour of energy fed back into the state electricity grid .This is around three times the current retail price for electricity .Ontario allows net metering for up to 500 kW , however credits can only be carried for 12 consecutive months .Should a consumer establish a credit where they generate more than they consume for 8 months and use up the credits in the 10th month then the 12 month period begins again from the date that the next credit is shown on an invoice .Any unused credits remaining at the end of 12 consecutive months of a consumer being in a credit situation are cleared at the end of that billing .[ 4 ] .Areas of British Columbia serviced by BC Hydro are allowed net metering for up to 50 kW.At each annual anniversary the customer is paid 5.4 Cents [ 5 ] per KWh if there is a net export of power .Systems over 50 kW are covered under the Standard Offer Program .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.40791"}

{"text": "This is not too bad but you also have to consider that some charters do not serve the same demographics as your neighborhood schools and can decide what type of student they take .They are notorious for taking students who do not have any learning challenges in the form of SPED or are English Language Learners .There are also some which have lower levels of students who come from low SES households .Since poverty is a huge factor in successful outcomes , this too could sway the results when comparing schools \" success \" with regards to scores .The next point I want to make is that the average expenditure per child is greatly inflated when you consider the costs of teaching students with learning disabilities since their services cost a lot more than a child who does n't need any special needs services .The average expenditure per child with no special needs can be as little as $ 2,500 - $ 3,500 per year while a child with special needs can be as much as $ 30,000 per year .When those numbers are averaged out , it is not too difficult to see how the average can be greatly inflated .Considering that charter schools do not serve the same number of students with special needs , it is not too difficult to then negate the argument that they are more cost effective .The public needs to remember that when they vote YES for this amendment , they are LOSING THEIR DEMOCRATIC VOTE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL .Why would anyone want to give up their local vote and pass it into the hands of a non - elected and probably very partisan committee .The other thing not mentioned is nowhere does it say where the money is going to come from to fund the charters .We are supposed to agree \" blindly \" that the state will work in the best interests of public education when their actions in the past 10 years has shown nothing but contempt for our public schools .The $ 4 billion austerity cuts have crippled districts , especially those outside metro Atlanta .What the opponents do n't want you to know is that this is a move by the policy writing group ALEC to privatize education .ALEC writes the policy that our legislatures then pick up and present as their own .Jan Jones ( Rep - Milton ) is the chair person of the Educational Task Force for ALEC ; a group which has proclaimed it 's agenda it to ultimately put our schools into the hands of private business .Who funds ALEC ?The very same corporations who will make huge financial gains if this amendment passes .And please remember , if this passes , it is only the beginning of the path towards the total decimation of our schools .Friends , if our local boards do not approve charter school applications , there is already and appeals process in place via the State Board of Education and it has been working very nicely .Do not give up your vote at a local level and vote no in November .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.75784"}
{"text": "PG&E often presents itself as on its way to becoming the greenest utility , if not already there .They point out that they were named the greenest utility in Newsweek 's Green Rankings 2009 .But the fact of the matter is that they are not even close to being the greenest utility .Many of the public utilities in Northern California have not only greener power but also lower prices .These include Palo Alto Utilities with the most successful 100 % green power option , Sacramento Municipal Utility District with 19 % renewable power , and Alameda Municipal Utility which claims to be the greenest utility with most of its power coming from renewable sources .On the other hand , only 14 % of power delivered by PG&E in 2009 was derived from renewable sources in 2009 .Investor owned utilities are mandated by the 2002 Renewable Portfolio Standard to be at 20 % renewable power by 2010 ; PG&E had 12 % in 2003 .PG&E has already said that they will not make the 20 % target for 2010 .Meanwhile , nascent Community Choice Energy programs across the state are signaling their intent pursue 50 % renewable power by 2017 and to build significant amounts of electricity locally , which creates clean energy jobs for residents .Despite withering and possbily illegal opposition for the deep pocketed PG&E , Marin and San Francisco are first out of the gate , moving forward with Community Choice .In the face of competition from Community Choice and Public Power , PG&E is pushing a law to prevent competitors from the playing field .The Power Grab .By killing honest competition from municipal utilities and community choice energy programs , PG&E will have a free hand to raise rates and hamper the adoption of clean energy produced here in California .Rather than moving away from expensive and dirty power , PG&E wrote their initiative to put the kabosh on letting California communities provide competitively priced energy that is significantly cleaner than PG&E 's .This amendment to the California Constitution would require an extraordinarily high 2/3 vote of the people in order to expand municipal electric companies ( like those in Alameda or Sacramento ) or to create Community Choice Energy programs ( like those being launched in Marin and San Francisco ) .Rather than break its addiction to fossil fuels , PG&E is attempting to lock ratepayers into its already high rates as well as future rate increases .The PG&E Power Grab , in short , will use money and political clout to jam through a ballot initiative that creates an undemocratic 2/3 vote barrier to local governments ' efforts to provide renewable energy choices to their communities .PG&E 's board authorized the company to spend $ 30 M on the initiative .Were it not for PG&E 's deep pockets and robust PR machine , such audacity would be laughable .But given the realities of corporate power and media obfuscation , a mass mobilization of voters will be required to beat back this fossilized monopoly protection scheme .Opposition to the Power Grab .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.851105"}

Mark Dayton vetoed it .That bill would have made a new law ; the one on the Nov. 6 ballot would change the state Constitution .Reasoning : Amendment supporters say they want to make sure only eligible voters cast ballots .Opponents claim Minnesota has the country 's cleanest elections and there is no need for change .Impact : Democrats who oppose the amendment say the proposal is a Republican effort to disenfranchise minority , the elderly and other voters who are less likely to have photo IDs and are less inclined to go through procedures needed to get one .Most of those groups lean Democratic .Republicans say the amendment would not affect one group more than another .Cost : Proponents and opponents vary greatly on what it would cost to implement the amendment .Supporters say the cost would be very low , mostly to provide free ID cards to the few Minnesotans who do not have one .But local elections officials and Secretary of State Mark Ritchie claim the cost could be much higher , with some estimates topping $ 100 million .Laws legislators pass to implement the amendment would determine the final cost .Fraud : Minnesota Majority , a group pushing the amendment , says it has found more than 200 felons who voted in violation of state law .Amendment opponents respond that even felons have photo IDs and the amendment would not stop them from voting .Few other voter fraud cases have been prosecuted .Provisional ballots : The amendment would allow voters who could not produce a photo ID at the polling place to mark a ballot , but the ballot would not be counted until the voter shows an ID to local elections officials .Opponents say that many people would need to drive long distances to show their IDs and some could not do that .Absentee ballots : There is a disagreement about how absentee voting would work .Proponents say that laws implementing the amendment would allow mailed absentee ballots , perhaps with copies of a photo ID accompanying the ballot .Opponents say the amendment requires \" substantially equivalent \" treatment of absentee and in - person voters , which is not possible .Mail voting : Arguments about mail - in ballots used in some rural areas fall along the same lines as absentee voting , with opponents saying the amendment would end mail voting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.000275"}

Kurt Bills of Rosemount said the good news is that since he is getting little financial help from the party , the GOP can not tell him what to do .\" I 'm my own guy , \" Bills said .\" Maybe I 'm here at the right time . \"Bills added : \" It would be nice to have a state party , but we will get it done anyway .They are rebuilding .\" The Republican candidate trails U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar in polls , and he has not seen much of a spotlight during the campaign .Even so , he said , people know him well enough .\" I think so .We just have to walk by faith and get it done . \"Addresses may be updated .The Minnesota Vehicle Services Department plans extended hours on election day to update addresses on driver 's licenses and state identification cards .Some driver examination stations will be open until 7 p.m. Nov. 6 to update addresses , but exams will not be given after normal hours .Those staying open late are in Anoka , Austin , Bemidji , Detroit Lakes , Duluth , Hastings , Mankato , Plymouth , Rochester , St. Cloud , and Virginia .Absentee time short .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.140945"}
