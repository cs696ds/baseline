How was the strike launched ? A. The Defense Ministry said the missiles were fired from four ships in the Caspian Sea and flew across Iran and northern Iraq to reach their targets .Russia has maintained a naval flotilla in the Caspian - which is landlocked from the rest of the world 's seas - for nearly 300 years .The flotilla currently has no aircraft carriers or other large capital ships , but it has frigates and Buyan - class missile corvettes , including two that were commissioned just last year , the Grad Sviyazhsk and the Veliky Ustyug .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.12392"}

Marco Rubio climbs to second place with 18 % following his strong third place finish in Iowa , followed by Ted Cruz ( 13 % ) and John Kasich ( 12 % ) in a near - tie for third .Jeb Bush holds fifth place at 10 % , a hair behind Cruz and Kasich , with Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina well behind at 4 % each .The fight for second place between Cruz , Rubio and Kasich remains within the survey 's margin of sampling error .The poll was conducted entirely after the Iowa caucuses .[ ... ] .Trump has also been ruled out by more likely voters than any other Republican in the field , 37 % say they would never vote for him .Cruz is second on this score , with 13 % saying they would never vote for him , followed by Bush at 7 % .There 's a lot of room for candidate to make their last minute pitches New Hampshire heads to the polls on February 9 .Forty - one percent of Granite Staters have made up their minds come Election Day , with 25 percent leaning towards someone .Yet , 34 percent are still undecided .But given how strong Marco and Cruz did during the Iowa Caucuses- it could be the nudge these fence sitters need to pick who they feel should be the GOP nominee this year .Sanders stands at 61 % support , up slightly from the 57 % he held in a late January CNN / WMUR poll conducted before he and Clinton divided Iowa caucusgoers almost evenly on Monday night .Clinton holds 30 % , down a tick from the 34 % she held before the caucuses .Both changes are within the poll 's margin of sampling error .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.60243"}

{"text": "Although independents claim no outright allegiance to either major party , it is well - known that they are not necessarily neutral when it comes to politics .When pressed , most independents will say they lean to one of the two major parties .For example , last year an average of 17 % of Americans who initially identified as independents subsequently said they \" leaned \" Republican , 15 % were independents who leaned Democratic , with the remaining 11 % not expressing a leaning to either party .In 2014 , an average 45 % of Americans identified as Democrats or said they were Democratic - leaning independents , while 42 % identified as Republicans or were Republican - leaning independents .That the three - point Democratic edge was down from six points in 2013 , and among Democrats ' smaller advantages the past 25 years .Democrats usually hold an advantage in this combined measure of party affiliation .In fact , the only year Republicans held a notable edge since Gallup began tracking independents ' political leanings was in 1991 , the year Republican President George H.W. Bush 's approval ratings soared after the United States ' victory in the Persian Gulf War .Democrats ' high point came in 2008 , in the final year of George W. Bush 's administration and the year Barack Obama was first elected president .However , the three - point Democratic advantage for all of 2014 obscures the change that occurred during the year .On a quarterly basis , Democrats started out 2014 with a five - point edge , similar to their advantage in 2013 .That dipped to two points by the third quarter .In the fourth quarter , likely in response to Republicans ' success in the 2014 midterm elections , Republicans held a slight advantage of one point .Since 2008 , Americans have been increasingly reluctant to identify with either the Republican or Democratic Party , and now a record 43 % claimed political independence in 2014 .Given historical trends , 2015 could bring a new record , as the percentage identifying as independents typically increases in the year before a presidential election , averaging a 2.5-point increase in the last six such years .Although Democrats typically have an advantage in partisanship , that edge shrunk in 2014 and in the last months of the year the parties were essentially on equal footing .With each party controlling part of the federal government - Democrats the presidency and Republicans the Congress - they each will have a say in how the nation addresses its major challenges in the coming year .However , in recent years divided control of government has more often than not resulted in partisan gridlock , and Americans ' frustration with the frequent political stalemate is evident .Continued frustration with the government would likely encourage more Americans to identify as independents this year .Survey Methods .Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted January - December 2014 , with a combined random sample of 16,479 adults , aged 18 and older , living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.501205"}

{"text": "Trust in the government to handle problems more generally is the lowest Gallup has measured to date , and Americans ' favorable ratings of both parties are at or near historical lows .Thus , the rise in U.S. political independence likely flows from the high level of frustration with the government and the political parties that control it .Democrats ' Edge in Party Identification and Leaning Shrinks .Although independents claim no outright allegiance to either major party , it is well - known that they are not necessarily neutral when it comes to politics .When pressed , most independents will say they lean to one of the two major parties .For example , last year an average of 17 % of Americans who initially identified as independents subsequently said they \" leaned \" Republican , 15 % were independents who leaned Democratic , with the remaining 11 % not expressing a leaning to either party .In 2014 , an average 45 % of Americans identified as Democrats or said they were Democratic - leaning independents , while 42 % identified as Republicans or were Republican - leaning independents .That the three - point Democratic edge was down from six points in 2013 , and among Democrats ' smaller advantages the past 25 years .Democrats usually hold an advantage in this combined measure of party affiliation .In fact , the only year Republicans held a notable edge since Gallup began tracking independents ' political leanings was in 1991 , the year Republican President George H.W. Bush 's approval ratings soared after the United States ' victory in the Persian Gulf War .Democrats ' high point came in 2008 , in the final year of George W. Bush 's administration and the year Barack Obama was first elected president .However , the three - point Democratic advantage for all of 2014 obscures the change that occurred during the year .On a quarterly basis , Democrats started out 2014 with a five - point edge , similar to their advantage in 2013 .That dipped to two points by the third quarter .In the fourth quarter , likely in response to Republicans ' success in the 2014 midterm elections , Republicans held a slight advantage of one point .Since 2008 , Americans have been increasingly reluctant to identify with either the Republican or Democratic Party , and now a record 43 % claimed political independence in 2014 .Given historical trends , 2015 could bring a new record , as the percentage identifying as independents typically increases in the year before a presidential election , averaging a 2.5-point increase in the last six such years .Although Democrats typically have an advantage in partisanship , that edge shrunk in 2014 and in the last months of the year the parties were essentially on equal footing .With each party controlling part of the federal government - Democrats the presidency and Republicans the Congress - they each will have a say in how the nation addresses its major challenges in the coming year .However , in recent years divided control of government has more often than not resulted in partisan gridlock , and Americans ' frustration with the frequent political stalemate is evident .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.86523"}

Bush presidency .When we look at Figure 1 we can see that naming popularity seems to be heavily affected by First Ladies .Most names experienced a steady downward trend in popularity .The name \" Rosalynn \" is an exception as it peaked in popularity during the Carter administration before falling by the end to have risen in popularity once again .The name \" Hillary \" is very unique in this pattern as unlike most names , it was growing rapidly in popularity prior to the Clinton administration .However , early into the Clinton administration the popularity dropped rapidly falling to pre-1980s levels for the name .Except for a small rally in during the 2007/2008 primary campaign against Obama , it has not recovered .While this is certainly quite silly and does n't necessarily mean anything , it 's strange to think about how many American girls could have potentially been named Hillary if Bill Clinton had lost the 1992 election .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.74348"}

Anthony Weiner%E2%80%99s claim that his Twitter account was hacked , a key clue has been missing : exactly how the notorious groin pic was posted online .Chet Wisniewski , a senior security adviser at security software company SophosLabs , said the TweetDeck stamp % E2%80%9Cdoes make it more plausible that it did come from him .%E2%80%9D .Weiner used TweetDeck frequently , but he often also posted from the Web directly or from his BlackBerry .A widely circulated explanation for how Weiner%E2%80%99s Twitter account could have been hacked by email would also seem to be incompatible with the fact that the message in question originated on TweetDeck .If email had been used , the message probably would have originated via the photosharing site Yfrog , where the infamous picture was posted .However , this information doesn%E2%80%99 t rule out the possibility that the congressman%E2%80%99s Twitter account was infiltrated % E2%80%94 as Weiner has publicly suggested .But experts say it adds another hurdle for an alibi that has come under increasing fire .%E2%80%9CThe complexity goes up,%E2%80%9D said Chris McCroskey , the Texas software developer who founded TweetCongress.org .The site , which has advocated the increased participation from congressmen on Twitter , aggregates and archives all the feeds of the 112th Congress from Twitter%E2%80%99s application programming interface .It is the only known database to do this other than the Library of Congress , which does not publicly share its data .Robert Stribley , a senior information architect at Razorfish , a social media strategy agency , reasoned that if Weiner used the TweetDeck app , % E2%80%9Cit would probably make it less likely his account was hacked .%E2%80%9D .When reached by The Daily , TweetDeck%E2%80%99s community manager , Richard Barley , declined to comment .Experts caution that there are several scenarios in which the congressman%E2%80%99s Twitter account could have been compromised .Wisniewski cautioned that a savvy hacker may have intentionally noted Weiner%E2%80%99s posting platform the night of the offending tweet , and intentionally matched it .On the other hand , Matthew Green , chief technology officer at Independent Security Evaluators , said that if the offensive tweet had been transmitted through something other than TweetDeck that night , it might have gone a long way to exonerate Weiner . %E2%80%9CThey%E2%80%99re going out of their way to make sure it looks like it came from him .%E2%80%9D . TweetDeck is not hacker - proof , said Jason Falls , and there still is the possibility that someone with authorized access to his Twitter account intentionally or inadvertently logged onto Weiner%E2%80%99s account and sent the picture .In a case that has grabbed headlines recently , a woman who worked for the Red Cross accidentally tweeted about getting drunk on the organization%E2%80%99s Twitter account , thinking that she had posted it on her personal one .As for Weiner , the TweetDeck stamp won%E2%80%99 t solve the case itself .But McCroskey knows what can . %E2%80%9CHere%E2%80%99s the thing that solves it all,%E2%80%9D said McCroskey , % E2%80%9Cfor him to call for a criminal investigation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.974365"}
