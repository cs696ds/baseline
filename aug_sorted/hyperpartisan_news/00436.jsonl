[34 ] .Soon afterwards , Muhammad came into conflict with the Banu Nadir .He had one of the Banu Nadir 's chiefs , the poet Ka'b ibn al - Ashraf , assassinated [ 35 ] and after the Battle of Uhud accused the tribe of treachery and plotting against his life and expelled them from the city .[36 ] The Qurayza remained passive during this conflict , according to R. B. Serjeant because of the blood money issue related above .[ 27 ] .In 627 , the Meccans , accompanied by tribal allies as well as the Banu Nadir [ 37 ] [ 38 ] - who had been very active in supporting the Meccans [ 39 ] - marched against Medina - the Muslim stronghold - and laid siege to it .It is unclear whether their treaty with Muhammad obliged the Qurayza to help him defend Medina , or merely to remain neutral , [ 8 ] according to Ramadan , they had signed an agreement of mutual assistance with Muhammad .[ 11 ] The Qurayza did not participate in the fighting - according to David Norcliffe , because they were offended by attacks against Jews in Muhammad 's preaching - but lent tools to the town 's defenders .[40 ]According to Al - Waqidi , the Banu Qurayza helped the defense effort of Medina by supplying spades , picks , and baskets for the excavation of the defensive trench the defenders of Medina had dug in preparation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.836777"}

{"text": "An aim either worthy or cringe - makingly ingratiating , according to taste , but one that ought to have rung alarm bells for anyone who cares about fiction .Novels written with a purely didactic intent are rarely very good .In an early review , in the LA Times , Laurel Maury describes Jewel as \" a second - rate bodice ripper - style romance \" which , while \" readable enough \" , \" suffers from large swaths of purple prose \" .I should say so : the stench of dead murex snails fairly wafted from the screen in those extracts I saw .Maury picks the following representative sentence : \" From my camel 's hump I could feel the leaf - kissed air moving like a cool , moist cloth across my brow as I inhaled the fresh clean scents of petal and blade and springs gilding the morning .\" Too many adjectives , Mrs Jones .And try working a bid harder on your metaphors .How can a spring \" gild the morning \" ?Silver it , perhaps .Clearly description is n't Jones 's strongest card .Maury concedes that \" once strife among Muhammad 's wives begins to develop , the story becomes entertaining , \" and even credits the author with the ability to \" make a plot dance \" .Her characterisation , though , sounds almost as wonky as her prose .Aisha \" has the mind of a top - notch general stuffed into the body of an emotionally immature child \" and \" sounds like a mix of Gloria Steinem and Pippi Longstocking \" .Other characters are one - dimensional , while the author herself is n't in full control of her material .\" I suspect Jones wanted to write a feminist text , sort of Islam 101 for the post- Buffy the Vampire Slayer generation , \" suggests Maury .Yet her Aisha comes across as \" a wayward girl who needs to be disciplined by an older , wiser male .\" The initial criticism of the book , by the Texan academic Denise Spellman , was that it was historically inaccurate \" softcore pornography .\" There would seem , in fact , to be little or no sex in the book ( just as well , perhaps , though I can imagine Jones might have been a strong contender for this year 's Bad Sex Award if there had been ) .What there is , rather , is a failure of imagination .Jones 's Aisha is not plausibly a woman of the seventh century .In Egypt Today , Ethar El - Katatney ( who has also read Jewel ) comments that the author . essentially converts Aisha of the seventh century into Aisha of the twenty - first century Western world .In The Jewel of Medina , Aisha 's dreams center on her freedom , desire for power and control of her own destiny .On the other hand , perhaps out of deference to ( real or imagined ) Muslim sensibilities , Jones makes so many moral concessions to the patriarchal attitudes of the time that Aisha 's supposed strength of character comes across as brattish .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.86225"}
