McNabb .The U.S. attorney 's office in Los Angeles is less likely to prosecute criminal cases referred by the Internal Revenue Service than its counterparts in the rest of the state , according to a California Watch analysis of five years of data .The eastern district , which includes Sacramento and Fresno , was the most likely to prosecute IRS referrals , the data shows .But the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles was the only office in the state that fell slightly below the national average of prosecuting criminal IRS cases .Each U.S. attorney has broad discretion over the priorities for his or her district .They determine which criminal cases referred to them by other law enforcement agencies they want to pursue and which cases to close without prosecuting .It is difficult to determine why the Los Angeles office lagged behind its peers .\" It 's definitely puzzling , \" said Terree Bowers , a former U.S. attorney .Since leaving the Los Angeles office , Bowers said he brought a fraud case to the office 's attention and was surprised that it did n't act on the case .The IRS investigates and refers cases about tax fraud , money laundering , narcotics trafficking , organized crime and public corruption .Compared with the volume of cases it handles , the IRS refers only a small percentage for federal prosecution .Syracuse University 's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse , which compiled the data analyzed by California Watch , estimated that the odds of having the IRS refer a case to a federal prosecutor were about 12 per million nationwide last year .In California , the IRS referred about 540 cases to federal prosecutors in the last fiscal year .When adjusted for population , the odds of having a case referred to a federal prosecutor in the state are 15 per million , slightly higher than the national average .When they do receive cases from the IRS , three of the state 's four U.S. attorneys prosecute alleged offenders at a rate above the national average , the data shows .Across the country , close to 54 percent of all IRS referrals are prosecuted .In the eastern district covering Sacramento , that prosecution rate is about 62 percent .For the northern San Francisco and the southern San Diego districts , the prosecution rate is the same : 57.8 percent .For Los Angeles , the rate falls to 51.4 percent .The IRS has several ways of enforcing tax law , including audits and civil charges .\" The heavy gun of the IRS is criminal enforcement , but it 's a much less frequent event , \" said David Burnham , a co - director of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse .The federal tax filing deadline is tomorrow .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.78414"}

Cole is being prosecuted before a military commission .I am proud to say that trial attorneys from the Department of Justice are working with military prosecutors on that case , as well as others .And we will continue to reject the false idea that we must choose between federal courts and military commissions , instead of using them both .If we were to fail to use all necessary and available tools at our disposal , we would undoubtedly fail in our fundamental duty to protect the Nation and its people .That is simply not an outcome we can accept .This Administration has worked in other areas as well to ensure that counterterrorism professionals have the flexibility that they need to fulfill their critical responsibilities without diverging from our laws and our values .Last week brought the most recent step , when the President issued procedures under the National Defense Authorization Act .This legislation , which Congress passed in December , mandated that a narrow category of al Qaeda terrorist suspects be placed in temporary military custody .As authorized by the statute , the President waived the requirements for several categories of individuals where he found that the waivers were in our national security interest .These procedures implement not only the language of the statute but also the expressed intent of the lead sponsors of this legislation .And they address the concerns the President expressed when he signed this bill into law at the end of last year .Now , I realize I have gone into considerable detail about tools we use to identify suspected terrorists and to bring captured terrorists to justice .This principle has long been established under both U.S. and international law .In response to the attacks perpetrated - and the continuing threat posed - by al Qaeda , the Taliban , and associated forces , Congress has authorized the President to use all necessary and appropriate force against those groups .Because the United States is in an armed conflict , we are authorized to take action against enemy belligerents under international law .The Constitution empowers the President to protect the nation from any imminent threat of violent attack .And international law recognizes the inherent right of national self - defense .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.02939"}

{"text": "If the minor and technical procedural advantages in a criminal adjudication are a burden of constitutional significance then surely the advantage of not being subjected to a criminal adjudication at all is as well .More importantly , this case , unlike the precedential Supreme Court cases , deals not with a privilege , but with an immunity .The concurring opinion is a more nuanced version of the state 's argument .According to the concurrence , in running defendant 's license plate , the officer did not distribute a \" privilege or immunity \" as those terms are used in Article I , section 20 .A privilege or immunity , the concurrence argues , is something to which a citizen is \" entitled \" by statute or constitution .State v.

[ Northwest Ordinance , Section 9 , July 13 , 1787 ] .[ The Confederate Congress , emphasis added ] .Without citing the case as such , the words of author John S. Wise sound a close , if not identical parallel to the argument for the Respondent filed in the case of People v.

Sparks , an officer called in the license plate of a GMC Suburban to request a computerized check .The dispatcher mistyped the information given by the officer and informed him that the plate was registered to a 1983 Chevy CTX .The dispatcher subsequently informed the officer of the error and that the correct registration information revealed it had expired one month earlier .After receiving the information , the officer initiated a traffic stop .Upon questioning the driver , the officer located a stolen motorcycle plate , amphetamine , a loaded .45-caliber gun and a black ski mask .This information also led to the officer obtaining a search warrant for the vehicle , which revealed additional weapons and drugs .The driver filed a motion to suppress the evidence , arguing the traffic stop was based on the computerized check on the wrong license plate .However , the court found that the driver failed to point to any evidence that the officer lacked good faith .Moreover , even assuming the officer did not possess good faith , the court found that the dispatcher , once she revealed her error , told the officer the Suburban s correct license plate was expired by one month .This is probable cause to stop the vehicle .Even without the additional probable cause as in Sparks , if an officer acts in good faith , the evidence may not be suppressed .In Walraven , the dispatcher gave the officer conducting the traffic stop information on a different license plate ( she inverted the last two numbers of the license plate ) and gave him this information on three separate occasions in a 3.5 minute period .The Walraven court further found that because the officer was concentrating on the Cadillac , he did not hear the dispatcher incorrectly repeat the license plate information .Moreover , evidence that the officer was concentrating on the road was also presented .Randomly checking license plates also applies to vehicles that are stationary .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.95189"}

{"text": "And , since then , meaningful improvements have been implemented .It 's important to note that the reformed commissions draw from the same fundamental protections of a fair trial that underlie our civilian courts .They provide a presumption of innocence and require proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt .They afford the accused the right to counsel - as well as the right to present evidence and cross - examine witnesses .They prohibit the use of statements obtained through torture or cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment .And they secure the right to appeal to Article III judges - all the way to the United States Supreme Court .In addition , like our federal civilian courts , reformed commissions allow for the protection of sensitive sources and methods of intelligence gathering , and for the safety and security of participants .A key difference is that , in military commissions , evidentiary rules reflect the realities of the battlefield and of conducting investigations in a war zone .For example , statements may be admissible even in the absence of Miranda warnings , because we can not expect military personnel to administer warnings to an enemy captured in battle .But instead , a military judge must make other findings - for instance , that the statement is reliable and that it was made voluntarily .I have faith in the framework and promise of our military commissions , which is why I 've sent several cases to the reformed commissions for prosecution .There is , quite simply , no inherent contradiction between using military commissions in appropriate cases while still prosecuting other terrorists in civilian courts .Without question , there are differences between these systems that must be - and will continue to be - weighed carefully .Such decisions about how to prosecute suspected terrorists are core Executive Branch functions .In each case , prosecutors and counterterrorism professionals across the government conduct an intensive review of case - specific facts designed to determine which avenue of prosecution to pursue .Several practical considerations affect the choice of forum .First of all , the commissions only have jurisdiction to prosecute individuals who are a part of al Qaeda , have engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners , or who have purposefully and materially supported such hostilities .This means that there may be members of certain terrorist groups who fall outside the jurisdiction of military commissions because , for example , they lack ties to al Qaeda and their conduct does not otherwise make them subject to prosecution in this forum .Additionally , by statute , military commissions can not be used to try U.S. citizens .Second , our civilian courts cover a much broader set of offenses than the military commissions , which can only prosecute specified offenses , including violations of the laws of war and other offenses traditionally triable by military commission .This means federal prosecutors have a wider range of tools that can be used to incapacitate suspected terrorists .Those charges , and the sentences they carry upon successful conviction , can provide important incentives to reach plea agreements and convince defendants to cooperate with federal authorities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.12011"}

{"text": "In 2005 , the Financial Crimes Section developed the Electronic Bank Records Initiative ( EBRI ) .The EBRI was implemented to identify and develop a process for obtaining electronic ( digital format ) records from financial institutions .Historically , financial institutions have provided paper copies of records to law enforcement when they receive a subpoena from the government .These records are generally maintained by the banks in an electronic format .The time it takes the financial institution to make the copies of the records and for the investigative agencies to return the paper copies back to an electronic format for financial analysis creates a severe negative effect on the timeliness , effectiveness , and efficiency of investigations .In an effort to increase the efficiency of the process , a subpoena attachment was developed by the DOJ , FBI , and the Internal Revenue Service - Criminal Investigative Division ( IRS - CI ) for the production of electronic records instead of paper copies .The development included significant coordination with the financial institutions and their associations .The subpoena attachment was not based upon new or expanded laws , regulations , or rules .The attachment is merely meant to standardize and clarify the requests for electronic records according to the current Federal Rules of Criminal and Civil Procedure .In general terms , if a financial institution maintains records electronically , the requesting agency would be seeking to obtain the records electronically .In addition , the scope of the records requested has not changed due to the subpoena attachment , with the exception of seeking the records electronically .The subpoena attachment was disseminated to FBI offices and IRS offices and throughout the DOJ in November 2007 .The goal of the DOJ , FBI , and IRS - CI is to inform and prepare financial institutions and their respective agencies for the use and response to the subpoena attachment .This includes working with financial institutions during the transition period in coordinating the requests and associated responses to subpoenas .In addition , it is anticipated that the EBRI will greatly increase the efficiency of the financial records production process and provide significant costs savings to both the government and private industry .II .Overall Accomplishments .Through Fiscal Year 2007 , 2,493 cases investigated by the FBI resulted in 839 indictments and 635 convictions of health care fraud criminals .It should be noted that numerous cases are pending plea agreements and trials .The following notable statistical accomplishments are reflective in Fiscal Year 2007 for health care fraud : $ 1.12 billion in restitutions , $ 4.4 million in recoveries , $ 34 million in fines , and 308 seizures valued at $ 61.2 million .MEDICARE STRIKE FORCE ( MIAMI ) : A multi - agency team of federal , state , and local investigators designed to investigate Medicare fraud was established in Southern Florida during March 2007 .The strike force combats fraud by reviewing real time Medicare billing data and acting promptly to make arrests and prosecutions .The strike force teams include a federal prosecutor and agents from FBI , Health and Human Services - Office of Inspector General , and local law enforcement agencies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.22182"}

{"text": "The Pyramid Scheme - As in Ponzi schemes , the money collected from newer victims of the fraud is paid to earlier victims to provide a veneer of legitimacy .In pyramid schemes , however , the victims themselves are induced to recruit further victims through the payment of recruitment commissions .Advance Fee Fraud : This category of fraud encompasses a broad variety of schemes that are designed to induce their victims into remitting up - front payments in exchange for the promise of goods , services , and/or prizes .In the securities and commodities fraud context , victims are informed that in order to participate in a promising investment opportunity , they must first pay various taxes and/or fees .Advance fee fraud schemes are further discussed in the mass marketing fraud section of this report .Hedge Fund Fraud : Hedge Funds are private investment partnerships that have historically accepted only high - net worth clients willing to meet significant minimum investment thresholds .The industry as a whole has been largely unregulated but has become increasingly relevant to middle class investors through their exposure to hedge fund activities via ancillary investments ( e.g. , pension funds ) .The relative lack of regulatory scrutiny has made the industry vulnerable to fraud by fund managers , to include : overstatement / misappropriation of fund assets ; overcharging for fund management fees ; insider trading ; market timing ; and late trading .Commodities Fraud : These schemes typically involve the deceptive or fraudulent sale of commodities investments .In such instances , false or deceptive sales practices are used to solicit victim funds for commodities transactions that either never occur or are inconsistent with the original sales pitches .Alternatively , commodities market participants may attempt to illegally manipulate the market for a commodity by fraudulently reporting price information or cornering the market to artificially increase the price of the targeted commodity .Foreign Exchange Fraud : These schemes are characterized by the use of false or deceptive sales practices , alleging high rates of return for minimal risk to induce victims to invest in the foreign currency exchange market .In such instances , the touted transactions either never occur , are inconsistent with the original sales pitches , or are executed for the sole purpose of generating excessive trading commissions in breach of fiduciary responsibilities to the victim client .Alternatively , individual corrupt currency traders employed by large financial institutions may attempt to manipulate foreign currency exchange prices in an effort to generate illicit trading profits for their own enrichment .Broker Embezzlement : These schemes involve illicit and unauthorized actions by brokers to steal directly from their clients .Such schemes may be facilitated by the forging of client documents , by the doctoring account statements , or by unauthorized trading / funds transfer activities or other conduct in breach of the broker 's fiduciary responsibilities to the victim client .Late - Day Trading : These schemes involve the illicit purchase and sale of securities after regular market hours .Such trading is restricted in order to prevent individuals from profiting on market moving information which is released after the close of regular trading .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.765976"}

{"text": "The reality is that both incorporate fundamental due process and other protections that are essential to the effective administration of justice - and we should not deprive ourselves of any tool in our fight against al Qaeda .Our criminal justice system is renowned not only for its fair process ; it is respected for its results .We are not the first Administration to rely on federal courts to prosecute terrorists , nor will we be the last .Although far too many choose to ignore this fact , the previous Administration consistently relied on criminal prosecutions in federal court to bring terrorists to justice .John Walker Lindh , attempted shoe bomber Richard Reid , and 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui were among the hundreds of defendants convicted of terrorism - related offenses - without political controversy - during the last administration .Over the past three years , we 've built a remarkable record of success in terror prosecutions .For example , in October , we secured a conviction against Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab for his role in the attempted bombing of an airplane traveling from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 .He was sentenced last month to life in prison without the possibility of parole .While in custody , he provided significant intelligence during debriefing sessions with the FBI .He described in detail how he became inspired to carry out an act of jihad , and how he traveled to Yemen and made contact with Anwar al - Aulaqi , a U.S. citizen and a leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .Abdulmutallab also detailed the training he received , as well as Aulaqi 's specific instructions to wait until the airplane was over the United States before detonating his bomb .And convictions have been obtained in the cases of several homegrown extremists , as well .I could go on .Which is why the calls that I 've heard to ban the use of civilian courts in prosecutions of terrorism - related activity are so baffling , and ultimately are so dangerous .These calls ignore reality .And if heeded , they would significantly weaken - in fact , they would cripple - our ability to incapacitate and punish those who attempt to do us harm .Simply put , since 9/11 , hundreds of individuals have been convicted of terrorism or terrorism - related offenses in Article III courts and are now serving long sentences in federal prison .Not one has ever escaped custody .No judicial district has suffered any kind of retaliatory attack .These are facts , not opinions .There are not two sides to this story .Those who claim that our federal courts are incapable of handling terrorism cases are not registering a dissenting opinion - they are simply wrong .But federal courts are not our only option .Military commissions are also appropriate in proper circumstances , and we can use them as well to convict terrorists and disrupt their plots .This Administration 's approach has been to ensure that the military commissions system is as effective as possible , in part by strengthening the procedural protections on which the commissions are based .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.88626"}

Holman , 44 Or 180 , 74 P 933 ( 1904 ) ( statute violates Article I , section 20 , when it authorized a board to grant an exclusive privilege to operate a sailors ' boarding house ) .In such a case , the law creates the privilege or immunity ( e.g. , a license , permit , or legal advantage ) and directs the agent to allocate or determine that advantage ( e.g. , grant or deny the license under particular circumstances ) .The statutes are replete with laws that create privileges or immunities by directing official action to allow or limit those privileges .For example , professional licensing requirements and oversight statutes , local government ordinances to allow zoning variances , and state regulations allowing water appropriations are all laws that create a legal privilege by directing actions by a governmental agent to allow , deny , or limit that entitlement .Those types of laws fit squarely within the scope of Article I , section 20 , because they directly delegate authority to grant a privilege .Laws involving the specific authority to create a benefit are tested under Article I , section 20 , for whether they permit outcomes that violate the constitutional command by , for example , improperly allocating a privilege or immunity or creating a monopoly .In this case , the deputy sheriff exercised authority conferred by statute .Those statutes did not specifically authorize the deputy to establish the purported privilege or immunity at stake in this case .The question becomes whether some other law did .The resulting Article I , section 20 , inquiry , as framed by Bruner , is whether \" a person is denied some advantage to which he or she would be entitled but for a choice made by a governmental authority . \" 299 Or at 268 - 69 ( emphasis added ) .An entitlement is necessarily legal in character ; otherwise , the claim is unenforceable and without legal status .A privilege or immunity , in this entitlement sense , is an advantage that is created or embellished by a constitutional or statutory policy .Cf . i d . at 268 ( \" [ T]he fact that two processes exist by which one person may enjoy advantages not available to another is precisely what triggers the Article I , section 20 , concerns we addressed in Freeland . \")Thus , I interpret the Clark line of cases to require official consistency when a government official is tasked by law to create or allocate a specific legal right or is authorized by law to administer a privilege or immunity created by a separate law .Where I part company with the dissent is in its assumption that a citizen enjoys a privilege or immunity , in this constitutional sense , to be free of any bad consequence of official action .Under that logic , any arbitrary exercise of official discretion that produces some detriment to a defendant -- such as a police officer 's decision to pursue one of two speeding cars -- violates Article I , section 20 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.93523"}

{"text": "Adam Elkus , a security studies specialist , observed as much in discussing the latest lapse in America 's ability to protect its citizens - the detention of former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati in Iran on accusations of espionage .Elkus writes , \" why [ is the U.S. ] apparently powerless to protect its citizens abroad but can protect -- or govern -- foreigners through expeditionary force of arms or whole - of - government .\" Elkus additionally notes that , despite decades of bellicose statements and the use of force abroad , the United States lacks credibility when it comes to protecting its citizens .In reviewing Hekmati 's predicament , Elkus writes approvingly of an approach submitted by Anna Simons of the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School .In an essay adapted from one of her lectures , Ms. Simons # posits a simpler interpretation of sovereignty whereby states ( and not states and citizens ) are recognized as the \" global unit of account \" and the international community has no basis for enforcing accountability .The United States would no longer dictate another state 's form of government or economy and would only intervene in another state 's affair if that state 's conduct enabled or permitted an infringement of American sovereignty .Simons and her colleagues assert establishing sovereignty as a baseline would simplify decisions regarding the use of force . ...we 've been attacked , and you own the problem .What kind of relationship have you had with the United States ?What kind of relationship do you want now ?It 's the future , not the past that matters . ...Let a regime explicitly support attackers or do nothing to eliminate them , and that government invites the largest and loudest U.S. response : we target it . ...we make an example of that government .It 's gone , as are those who attacked us .While admittedly \" harsh , \" the approach would be consistent .Adversaries would know American red lines and , with repetition , the approach would attain credibility .Would - be attackers and their enablers would have to consider a credible threat of American retribution .Lastly , by limiting the use of force to the defense of its citizens at home or abroad , the approach could count on unified popular support and might avoid the inevitable domestic divisions arising from recent interventions .Tellingly , Elkus casts this alternative sovereignty solution as simply \" self - help , \" the exact opposite of altruism .As American conservatives wage an energetic battle against altruism in domestic affairs , they should be prepared to do so in the realm of national security as well .About the Author .Michael Few is a retired military officer who served multiple combat tours to Iraq including the Thunder Runs and The Surge , and he currently serves as the editor of Small Wars Journal .He is a graduate of the United States Military Academy and studied small wars at the Defense Analysis Department at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , CA .Comments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.15887"}

{"text": "Despite the endless repetition of claims that individuals have a constitutional right to be armed , this is not consistent with the weight of legal opinion .In fact , a series of US Supreme Court cases have made the situation quite clear .In U.S. v. Cruikshank ( 1876 ) , the Court ruled that the right \" of bearing arms for a lawful purpose is not a right granted by the Constitution .\" Ten years later , in Presser v. Illinois , the Court noted that although states have the right to form militias , they are also free to regulate the circumstances under which citizens can carry weapons .This view was upheld in an 1894 case , Miller v. Texas .In 1939 , federal gun regulations established by the National Firearms Act of 1934 were challenged .The decision in that case was unanimous .The federal government has the right , the Court ruled , to regulate the transportation and possession of firearms , and individuals only have a right to be armed in connection with military service .In 1980 , Justice Harry Blackmun commented that this case represented the Courts ' basic thinking on gun control .On June 8 , 1981 , the Village of Morton Grove , Illinois passed an ordinance banning the possession of handguns , except by police , prison officials , members of the military , recognized collectors and those who needed them for their work .Predictably , the National Rifle Association challenged the law .Both the Federal District Court and a Federal Appeals Court rejected their argument , saying that there is no individual right to bear arms , the ordinance was reasonable , and the right to have weapons applies only to well - regulated militias .The US Supreme Court refused to even hear the case .Guns and Crime .Sentiment in favor on some form of gun control fluctuates , but has tended to grow for decades .In 1968 , 71 percent were in favor , peaking at more than 90 percent in 1981 .In one Gallop Poll the Brady Bill won 95 percent support .Most people obviously see some connection between the availability of firearms and the rate of crimes involving guns , and a variety of studies support these views .Nevertheless , opponents insist that stronger laws wo n't have an impact .Interstate trafficking of weapons is an enormous problem , undercutting the argument sometimes heard that the only reason for gun control is a high murder rate in a specific state .This provincial argument ignores interdependence , our responsibility to our neighbors , and basic facts .The only effective way to control the black market for guns , through gun shows and private sales , is a national registry of all purchasers , along with tracing and prosecution of the interstate traffickers .This does not involve rounding up handguns , but it does mean acknowledging that the situation is out of control and that saving lives takes priority over protecting a form of free enterprise that has turned monstrous .Leaving the matter in the hands of individual communities or states may sound appropriately populous .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.839226"}

Alabama , 474 U.S. 82 , 89 - 90 ( 1985 ) ] .Now , if a State of the Union is sovereign , is it correct to say that the State exercises an authority to which there is absolutely no superior ?No , this is not a correct statement .There is no other organized body which is superior to the organized body which retains sovereignty .The words \" people of the United States \" and \" citizens \" are synonymous terms , and mean the same thing .They both describe the political body who , according to our republican institutions , form the sovereignty , and who hold the power and conduct the government through their representatives .They are what we familiarly call the \" sovereign people , \" and every citizen is one of this people , and a constituent member of this sovereignty .[ Dred Scott v. Sandford , 19 How .393 ( 1856 ) ] .[ emphasis added ] .The source of all sovereignty in a constitutional Republic like the 50 States , united by and under the Constitution for the United States of America , is the People themselves .Remember , the States , and the federal government acting inside those States , are both bound by the terms of a contract known as the U.S. Constitution .That Constitution is a contract of delegated powers which ultimately originate in the sovereignty of the Creator , who endowed creation , individual People like you and me , with sovereignty in that Creator 's image and likeness .Nothing stands between us and the Creator .We think it is fair to say that the Supreme Court of the United States was never more eloquent when it described the source of sovereignty as follows : .And the law is the definition and limitation of power .[ Yick Wo v. Hopkins , 118 U.S. 356 , 370 ( 1886 ) ] .[ emphasis added ] .More recently , the Supreme Court reiterated the fundamental importance of US the People as the source of sovereignty , and the subordinate status which Congress occupies in relation to the sovereignty of the People .The following language is terse and right on point : .[ cites omitted ] The Congress as the instrumentality of sovereignty is endowed with certain powers to be exerted on behalf of the people in the manner and with the effect the Constitution ordains .The Congress can not invoke the sovereign power of the people to override their will as thus declared .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.51451"}

{"text": "Many libertarians have interpreted this sentence to mean that individuals are guaranteed the right to possess firearms for their personal defense or for any other use they choose .What this fails to acknowledge is the meaning of citizenship as it was understood two centuries ago .In the 18 th century , citizenship directly involved militia service for men , which was part of the commitment to the greater public good .An armed citizenry did not mean an armed population .In fact , even then it was clearly understood that access to weapons was a communal rather than an individual right .This dynamic was made clear in various declarations of rights predating the Bill of Rights .For example , Virginia 's Declaration of Rights , adopted on June 12 , 1776 , said that a well - regulated militia , trained to arm , was the safe defense of a free state .That and subsequent variations adopted by other states made it clear that the idea was trained citizens , organized in militias , providing for a common defense .The word \" people \" refers to this collective role , contrasting a militia to a standing army .Vermont 's Article 9 , which dealt with the matter of conscientious objection to military service , made it clear that \" bearing arms \" meant military service .It said that no one could be compelled to carry or use a gun , even though rights also involved personal service .The solution was that those who chose not to serve would pay an appropriate sum of money .Bearing arms was directly linked to the collective responsibility for defense .Several states specifically said that criminals or people involved in rebellion could be disarmed .In other words , the security of society took precedence over an individual 's right to have weapons .Thus , when early Americans spoke of an armed citizenry 's role in preserving freedom , they were talking about a militia linked to the classical idea of citizenship .There is no record of anyone arguing , during the passage of the Bill of Rights , that individuals had a right to bear arms outside the ranks of a militia .On the contrary , that provoked fear for the stability of the new Republic .The great constitutional commentator of the period , Justice Joseph Story , noted that what the Second Amendment actually guaranteed was a \" well - regulated militia .\" The fear was that without one the country might be vulnerable to invasion , domestic insurrection , or a military takeover by some ruler .We needed a militia , Story said , because it was impractical to keep people armed without some organization .The fear of a militarized society or a federal government monopoly on force is not , by definition , a form of paranoia .On the other hand , it is an overreach to claim that individuals have a fundamental right to protect themselves by stockpiling weapons .For those who want a counter - force to our national military , the direction to look is greater autonomy of organized local or state militias , not the right of people to become self - appointed guardians or vigilantes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.48981"}

{"text": "Our legal authority is not limited to the battlefields in Afghanistan .Indeed , neither Congress nor our federal courts has limited the geographic scope of our ability to use force to the current conflict in Afghanistan .We are at war with a stateless enemy , prone to shifting operations from country to country .Over the last three years alone , al Qaeda and its associates have directed several attacks - fortunately , unsuccessful - against us from countries other than Afghanistan .Our government has both a responsibility and a right to protect this nation and its people from such threats .This does not mean that we can use military force whenever or wherever we want .International legal principles , including respect for another nation 's sovereignty , constrain our ability to act unilaterally .Furthermore , it is entirely lawful - under both United States law and applicable law of war principles - to target specific senior operational leaders of al Qaeda and associated forces .This is not a novel concept .In fact , during World War II , the United States tracked the plane flying Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto - the commander of Japanese forces in the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Midway - and shot it down specifically because he was on board .As I explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee following the operation that killed Osama bin Laden , the same rules apply today .Some have called such operations \" assassinations .\" They are not , and the use of that loaded term is misplaced .Assassinations are unlawful killings .Now , it is an unfortunate but undeniable fact that some of the threats we face come from a small number of United States citizens who have decided to commit violent attacks against their own country from abroad .Based on generations - old legal principles and Supreme Court decisions handed down during World War II , as well as during this current conflict , it 's clear that United States citizenship alone does not make such individuals immune from being targeted .But it does mean that the government must take into account all relevant constitutional considerations with respect to United States citizens - even those who are leading efforts to kill innocent Americans .Of these , the most relevant is the Fifth Amendment 's Due Process Clause , which says that the government may not deprive a citizen of his or her life without due process of law .The Supreme Court has made clear that the Due Process Clause does not impose one - size - fits - all requirements , but instead mandates procedural safeguards that depend on specific circumstances .Where national security operations are at stake , due process takes into account the realities of combat .Here , the interests on both sides of the scale are extraordinarily weighty .An individual 's interest in making sure that the government does not target him erroneously could not be more significant .Yet it is imperative for the government to counter threats posed by senior operational leaders of al Qaeda , and to protect the innocent people whose lives could be lost in their attacks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "123.096016"}
