{"text": "Great paper , very much needed .Several things I would like to comment on , but one point in particular that I find most fascinating is how your call to transcend ' identity ' ( in a manner of speaking ) very much aligns with Adorno 's negative dialectics .I am curious as to whether you have made this connection personally ?In sum , Adorno 's negative dialectics essentially works through similar identity problems that you outline , wherein instead of Hegel 's ' identity of identity and non - identity ' Adorno formulates the ' non - identity of identity and non - identity ' .A mouth full , indeed - but the basic thesis here is a theory of ' non - identity ' that strives for ' something more ' in behind object ( to break the conceptual stranglehold of capitalism , one might say ) .This translates into a lot of exciting avenues of research which I do n't think have been fully explored , including a more ' multidimensional ' perspective of phenomena .Long story short and skipping ahead several paces , in the past whenever I thought about how Adorno could contribute to a radical feminism , it was precisely along the lines of your argument above , which I find both exciting and inspiring .Thanks for reading and reblogging !I am not super familiar with Adorno 's negative dialectics but would definitely like to read more about it , especially given your comments here .I will look into it and hopefully we can engage more in the future .One quick comment .You wrote , \" I personally would n't limit a critique of identity politics to labour \" I think this is a place where many have misunderstood my writing about labor .Some people are assuming I mean a flattened one - sided category , meaning \" work , \" or the restricted forms of work we do under capitalism .But what I actually mean is a universal category that encompasses all of our creative self - activity .It is a broad concept including every possible interaction with the world around us .So I am not sure how a category like that could \" limit \" any other category .Perhaps you could clarify if this is a misunderstanding of how I represent the category or maybe what you mean by \" labor \" and how it might limit an understanding of identity .Definitely a small point compared to what you 're raising here but it was something that caught my eye that others have mentioned in the past .... .I have some major contentions with some of the assertions .As a Marxist feminist my understanding of oppression is that we are not all merely oppressed as exploited workers .The private property system is very much based on the subjugation of women to control their reproduction so fathers know that they are passing their property and dynasties on to their heirs which was n't the case under tribal systems .Engels already talked about this over a 100 years ago .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.500046"}

{"text": "Federici describes this as a phenomenon that grew out of the primitive accumulation moment in the \" transition \" to capitalism .She basically leaves alone the productive sphere but soundly argues that this period corresponded to the development of \" women 's work , \" ( reproductive labor , split from productive labor ) .Women have always been limited to low paying work ( or unpaid work ) .As Federici simply puts it , women found it more difficult than men to support themselves ( 74 ) .As Marx describes in \" The Working Day , \" women and children simply could not survive considering the amount they worked and the wages they were paid in the capitalist moment corresponding to formal subsumption of labor .Federici and James add that this created a situation where women were forced into marriage in order to survive .This fissure within the class was exploited by capitalism in the interest of surplus value extraction .In sum , I think my original formulation is a bit sloppy or imprecise .It takes a specific side of a relation as a general law of capital .Its maturation is expressed in the moment of real subsumption of labor .Over time , the gendered division of labor became generalized and women began to ONLY worked in feminized labor , including everything from the home to pink collar low - waged jobs .b. For the purposes of an argument against identity politics and intersectionality theory , we can assume a separation between production and reproduction along gender lines , since these politics were born from the period of corresponding to real subsumption of labor .c. I think it 's also worth mentioning that the wage is only one side , or expression , of how gender mediates value .Another side I have been thinking about lately is the way in which labor power is realized in a gendered form .I do not recall Marx diving into this deeply in Capital ; however , it is clear that over time , the sensuous activities that we do to realize the labor power exchange develop certain parameters around them .So , if we agree to sell our labor power as a server , we usually do not agree to also do a song and dance , or lay bricks , or file taxes , etc .Instead , there is a general agreement that you will be waiting tables , prepping salads , etc .These general parameters are developed through many reified acts of selling \" server \" labor power in exchange for a wage .In simple terms , as part of the gender relation under capitalism , women are expected to do more sensuous labor than men .These are all a byproducts of the reified gendered division of labor under capitalism .This is part of what makes women actually more profitable and better workers , from a capitalist standpoint , than men .We are gendered to do more work , and , as notably argued above , we are gendered to do more for less .Ultimately , I think my piece is a bit imprecise and I 'm still working out some of the specifics of it but I wanted to get down some of the more technical things I 'm thinking about lately and that these comments have me working through .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.14633"}

{"text": "Surplus labor time is the time the worker works beyond the necessary labor time .Since the going rate for labor power ( again , our capacity to labor - not our actual living labor ) is the value of all the commodities the worker needs to reproduce herself , surplus labor is value that goes straight into the capitalist 's pocket .For example , let 's say I work in a Furby factory .I get paid $ 10 a day to work 10 hours , I produce 10 Furbies a day , and a Furby is worth $ 10 each .So my necessary labor time is 1 hour , and the surplus labor time I give to the capitalist is 9 hours ( 10 - 1 ) .The wage obscures this fact .Recall that under capitalism , it appears as though we are paid the equivalent value of what we produce .But , in essence , we are paid only for our necessary labor time , or the minimum amount we need to reproduce ourselves .This was different under feudalism when it was very clear how much time humans spent working for themselves , and how much time they spent working for someone else .For example , a serf might spend five hours a week tilling the land to produce food for the feudal lord , and the rest of her time was her own .The development of the wage is key because it enforced a gendered division of labor .( 2 )A separation of production and reproduction .Along with commodity production came a separation between production and reproduction .To be clear , \" reproduction \" does not solely refer to baby making .As capitalism developed , generally speaking , productive ( value - producing ) labor corresponded to the wage , and reproductive labor was unwaged ( or extremely low waged ) , since in appearance it produced no surplus value for the capitalist .This separation , characterized by the wage , took on a specific gendered form under capitalism .Women were largely excluded from productive sphere and therefore did not receive a wage for the reproductive work they did .This gave men a certain amount of power over women , and created antagonisms within the class based on a gendered division of labor .Silvia Federici , in Caliban and the Witch , calls this the \" patriarchy of the wage \" ( 97 - 100 ) .( 3 )The contradictory development of the nuclear family .With the development of capitalism and large - scale industry , the content of the nuclear family took a contradictory turn .On the one hand , as pointed out by theorists such as Selma James and Mariarosa Dalla Costa in \" The Power of Women and the Subversion of the Community , \" the nuclear family was strengthened by the gendered division of labor characterized by the wage .Women and children were excluded from the wage and relegated to reproductive work ; men received a wage and were relegated to productive work .And so on the one hand , the development of capitalism strengthened the nuclear family .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.51344"}
