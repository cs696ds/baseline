{"text": "Here is my response in the form of a Letter To The Editor : \" . \"As many know , there is quite a controversy concerning Barack Obama 's eligibility to hold the office of President of the United States .This controversy has spread to other nations and America 's credibility is now at stake among foreign governments .On May 13 , 2009 , I filed , with the Catawba County Clerk of Court 's office , an indictment of Barack Hussein Obama for the commission of fraud and treason .This indictment was handed down , on May 9 , by a Citizen 's Grand Jury composed of jurors located in various states of the United States .All laws governing Grand Juries were complied with .The indictment was filed locally because it is the duty of any and all district attorneys to act on criminal charges ... and I live here .As I understand it , the indictment has been filed in other states in addition to North Carolina .It is the hopes and expectations of the Grand Jury , and others , that District Attorney James C. Gaither will honor his Oath of Office and investigate these accusations .If he will do so , it will require his bringing this case before a judge .Once that is done , the judge will grant discovery . \" Discovery \" is a term used to require that both sides put their cards on the table .This is to avoid \" trial by ambush \" .Once Mr. Obama is forced to submit his actual birth certificate , his school records , his college records and his immigration records , ( which he has spent approximately one million dollars in concealing ) the controversy will be settled .He will either continue to be president or he will be removed from office .This is not about Barack Obama .It is now up to the courts to decide . \"\" I also included the info below : \" . \"FYI On his first day in office , January 21 , 2009 , Obama signed Executive Order 13489 .This order was entered into the Federal Register on January 26 , 2009 .What this executive order says , is that only the Attorney General ( Eric Holder ) and Council to the President , ( Gregory Craig ) are able to review presidential records requests and determine if they can be made public or not .( See Section 3 ) .In other words , you are n't going to see any records or documents that Obama does n't want you to see .It should n't surprise anyone that Obama 's first official act was to deny access to his records .Obama has lived for 48 years without leaving any footprints - none !There is no Obama documentation - no bona fides - no paper trail - nothing .If anyone from the Observer News Enterprise in Newton , NC , or any other media outlet has any questions , I will answer them . \"On May 9 , 2009 , the American Grand Jury met and , after reviewing the evidence presented , indicted Barak Obama , aka Barry Soetoro for fraud and treason .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.621384"}
