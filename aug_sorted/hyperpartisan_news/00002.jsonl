United States , 522 U.S. 398 , 805 ( 1998 ) .Thus , the only avenue for reform with respect to Section 1001 is in Congress , where politicians seldom get brownie points for narrowing the reach of federal criminal statutes .But why , you may ask , should law - abiding citizens be alarmed about this statute ?Do n't the feds only pick on big - league liars ?Do n't we trust the federal government and its law enforcement officers and assume that they are responsibly trying to ferret out crime ?Besides , if we meet an FBI agent that we do not trust , ca n't we always decline to speak to him ?It may be true that most federal agents and prosecutors are decent people who would not intentionally abuse Section 1001 .Moreover , it is very important from a law enforcement perspective for federal agents to be able to informally question witnesses during the initial stages of an investigation .And certainly citizens are under no obligation to speak to a law enforcement agent in the first place , although , as shown below , it is essential to learn how to decline to speak to government officers .But power corrupts , and the potential for abuse of this statute is great , especially during periods of public outcry over corporate and other white - collar crimes .When we reflect upon how many petty rules and regulations get broken and how many white lies are told during the course of an average American business day , it is apparent that Section 1001 can easily be applied and misapplied to normally upstanding folk .Consider , for example , the following hypothetical .Assume you are the former employee of a corrupt home health care agency .You hated the place , left as soon as you could and did your best while there not to join in the fraud you saw being committed all around you .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.18558"}

{"text": "He had no checked luggage for his \" trip \" to Detroit ; Adbulmutallab paid for his one - way ticket in cash and was allowed to board the Northwest flight without a passport .We suspect that the intelligence problems resulted , in part , from differing security classifications for the various databases .The initial report from Abdulmutallab 's father was likely classified at the \" Secret \" level and disseminated via SIPRNET , the government intranet cleared for material up to that level .Meanwhile , reporting that linked the Nigerian to radicals in Yemen might have been based on SIGINT reporting ; information of that type is normally held at the \" Top Secret / Sensitive Compartmentalized Information ( TS / SCI ) , and disseminated via another network , known as JWICS .Put another way , it 's quite likely that those vital bits of intelligence data were never fused together .That would have given the feds ample reason to bar Abdulmutallab from the flight , although his actions in Amsterdam were more than sufficient for a secondary screening which might have revealed his hidden bomb .Of course , the intelligence community has an organization that 's supposed to \" fuse \" terrorist - related intel information -- the NCTC .But the center is hardly immue from the long - running turf battles between the CIA and the FBI .The two agencies have sparred for years over the counter - terrorism mission and that war has only intensified since 9 - 11 .With billions of budget dollars on the line ( and dominance in the counter - terror mission at stake ) , it 's little wonder that the NCTC has become yet another battleground for the FBI and CIA .True , the center actually falls under the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) , but with the CIA and FBI providing most of the personnel , conflicts over intel sources , methods and information reliability are inevitable .And the list of problems does n't end there .Beyond database issues and turf wars , there 's the \" mindset \" that dominates our battles against terrorists .With the arrival of the Obama Team , the U.S. government has returned to a \" law enforcement \" approach in dealing with terror groups .Closing Gitmo , shipping Khalid Sheik Mohammed to Manhattan for a civilian trial and even the handling of Farouk Abdulmutallab are evidence of a changing mindset , one that will make it more difficult to prosecute terrorists -- and implement solutions to deter future attacks .You see , there 's already a successful system for dealing with the types of threats posed by radicals like Abdulmutallab and his handlers in Yemen .It 's the Israeli model , based heavily on advanced passenger screening and profiling .Israel 's state airline ( El Al ) and other carriers have used this approach for years , supplemented with additional layers of physical security at the airport and on individual aircraft .Additionally , Israel is the only nation to take the extra measure of installing missile defense systems on passenger jets , protecting them against yet another potential threat .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.59767"}
