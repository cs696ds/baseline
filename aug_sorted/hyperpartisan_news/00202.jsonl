{"text": "A special session day called in August to deal with the pension issue produced no action on those bills .The Chambers for Pension Reform , a group composed of the Illinois Chamber of Commerce and several local chambers , has a more Spartan plan .They say the state should raise the retirement age for state employees , increase the amount employees contribute toward their pensions and reduce the level of benefits that have yet to be earned .The group 's most controversial idea - shared by the Illinois Policy Institute - is changing pensions from a system in which benefits are defined beforehand to a system in which the state makes no promises about benefits .In the latter scenario , called a \" defined contribution \" plan , retirees receive whatever they have saved plus whatever the state has contributed toward their pension .AFSCME opposes that idea because it represents the possibility for greatly diminished future benefits .If the General Assembly adopts any changes along those lines without first getting AFSCME on board , the union is likely to challenge the changes in court .The reason is the Illinois Constitution 's Article XIII , Section 5 , which states that membership in the pension system is a contractual right , \" the benefits of which shall not be diminished or impaired . \"Plans like that of the Chambers for Pension Reform are careful to address only benefits to be earned in the future , which could be interpreted as not impairing benefits already owed .But AFSCME sees the promise of benefits as a contract itself .When a worker begins employment with the state , the worker is promised certain benefits as a term of employment .For AFSCME , reducing that promise of benefits for people already employed amounts to breaking the contract protected in the state constitution .Whether or not the benefits have been earned to date does n't matter in AFSCME 's view .Should AFSCME lose a court challenge to a plan that amends benefits , it would likely open avenues for more benefit cuts .While the state probably wo n't switch state employees to defined contribution plans as the Chambers suggest on this go - round , reform advocates - especially those hostile to the union - could view a court - approved benefit cut as a declaration of open season .Contrarily , if AFSCME wins such a challenge , it would eliminate talk of reducing benefits and instead focus attention on ways to reduce state spending or increase revenues .In the current political climate - already soured by the 2011 income tax increase that did n't solve the state 's financial problems - further revenue increases are likely to be considered toxic for any politician seeking reelection .AFSCME has its own ideas about how the pension issue should be handled .The organization 's pension reform framework states union members would be willing to pay \" a little more , even though they have contributed their portion over the years .\" That concession would be given in exchange for a promise that the state would pay its share toward the system .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.64427"}

California Teachers Association .Collective bargaining in the government context is inherently political because government worker wages are public funds .Therefore , if the government compels \" fair use \" fees collection , it is a violation of a worker 's First Amendment rights .It forces an association with a political cause ( bargaining with the state ) with which a worker might not agree .Abood had separated the functions of the union , administrative work versus political activity .Fredrichs says that ALL activity of unions is political .If the Supreme Court decision agrees with Friedrichs , it will overturn Abood .It will end the practice of a \" union shop .\" The absence of any requirement to pay unions for services rendered will make it too easy to be a \" free rider . \" In turn , unions will wither and die from not having a budget .Remember , even with a negotiated union contract , employers - only governments in this case - are entitled to all rights over workers which are not covered in the contract .With this line of reasoning , without unions , employers will have unchallenged , unbridled control over workers with no ability to contest mistreatment or abuse .The undermining of unions , the only organizations that advocate for rights of workers , will contribute to the Republican - led state legislatures ' move to right to work laws .Currently 25 states have right to work provisions .The RTW advocates characterize states where unions represent government workers as \" forced - unionism \" states .Advocates for \" free bargaining \" states label the right to work as the \" right to work for less .\" The quality of life for workers in RTW states is lower than in public sector union states - lower wages , more low wage jobs , higher rates of workers without health insurance , higher poverty and infant mortality rates .And if working in a RTW state , you have a 54 % higher chance of dying at work .Finally , by gutting union budgets , opponents will also thwart overt political activity by unions .Unions support Democratic candidates .Union - busting groups are partisan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.322407"}

Detroit Board of Education correctly concluded that fair share fees are constitutional , and the decision should not be disturbed .Abood allows the union to charge for its mandated representational duties , but not for political expenditures .In this context , the objectors ' first amendment interests are reduced and the interests of the government employer that has entered into an agreement with the union enhanced .Justice Alito suggested in Harris , however , that all union activity in the government sector implicates the highest first amendment interests .This is at odds with the Court 's cases on the first amendment interests of public employees following Abood .In recent years , the Court has held that the government has stronger interests in restraining speech when it acts as an employer .Accordingly , when employees speak pursuant to their job duties , their speech is unprotected .Additionally , when an employee 's speech is about an internal workplace grievance , it is similarly unprotected by the first amendment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.602722"}

Louisiana .Far right justices Scalia and Alito sounded clearly negative on Montgomery 's claim , suggesting that the Court did not even have jurisdiction to hear it , while justices like Kagan and Breyer were far more receptive .As occurred in the 2012 ruling , this case is likely to produce a 5 - 4 decision with the outcome depending on Justice Kennedy .The fate of a thousand or more people convicted for life while juveniles like Henry Montgomery will hang in the balance .On its last day of oral arguments in October , the Court heard Campbell - Ewald v.

{"text": "The outcome of this highly controversial issue could set precedent for years to come and could change how the state 's constitution is interpreted with regard to state employee benefits .Each of the state 's five pension systems have enough money to pay current retirees for the next several years , according to their annual reports .In fact , Dave Urbanek , spokesman for the Illinois Teachers ' Retirement System , says TRS could survive until at least 2030 even if the legislature cut its annual appropriation for pension payments by $ 1 billion .Urbanek says pension underfunding is a long - term problem , not an immediate crisis as it has been portrayed .While none of the five state pension systems is in danger of collapse any time soon , the cost of benefits is expected to grow faster than the combined value of contributions and the pension systems ' income from investments .Put simply , money is expected to go out faster than it will come in .That 's why lawmakers passed a law in 1995 requiring the state pension systems to be funded to 90 percent of total liability by 2045 .That law requires a \" ballooning \" state contribution that gets progressively larger with time , putting more strain on the budget .Henry Bayer , AFSCME 's executive director , says state employees have always contributed their share to the pension system , but lawmakers have not followed suit .Urbanek says , for example , between 1970 and 2011 , the legislature redirected $ 15 billion in funds that should have been invested in TRS .But Paul Kersey , director of labor policy for the conservative think - tank Illinois Policy Institute , says AFSCME shares some of the blame it assigns to lawmakers . \" A union 's responsibility does n't end with negotiating a big pension ; they should monitor things to make sure the employer follows through , \" Kersey says .\" Less energy should have gone into coaxing politicians into making new promises , while more should have gone into making sure they 'd keep the ones they 'd already made .Some of this is 20 - 20 hindsight , but at best the union miscalculated badly .At worst , they were indifferent and reckless with their members ' retirements , or are reckless with taxpayer money and did n't think it ever would run out .\" The variety of proposals to make up the shortfall vary widely in their impact and potential for controversy .The already - enacted law to make retirees pay health insurance premiums would save the state about $ 1 billion per year , but has spawned a lawsuit and could be ruled unconstitutional because of the Illinois Constitution 's prohibition on diminishing public employee pension benefits .Rep. Elaine Nekritz , a Democrat from Northbrook , introduced a pair of bills in early August that attempt to comprehensively address the pension issue .Those bills would make state employees hired before Jan. 1 , 2011 , choose between receiving health care benefits as retirees and having raises count toward their pensions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.910038"}

Anthony List 's Marjorie Dannenfelser claimed that \" the result of the current law is that we 're living back - alley abortions right now .\" Few would disagree that Gosnell - who was convicted of killing a patient and three infants who were born alive at his squalid clinic - was offering the functional equivalent of back - alley abortions .But the anti - choice movement is instead attempting to exploit the Gosnell case to claim that legal abortion is back - alley abortion , and to use it to justify unnecessary regulations meant to cut shut down safe providers .Abortion rights opponents often attempt to downplay the real danger of illegal abortions women faced before the liberalization of abortion laws and Roe .Although women with money and connections could often obtain a safe hospital abortion ( whether or not it was technically legal ) in the years leading up to Roe , the burden of unsafe abortion fell disproportionately on poor women and women of color .Guttmacher reports that although rates of death from unsafe abortion fell as medical care improved on all levels , 200 women died from unsafe abortion in 1965 , making up 17 percent of all pregancy - related deaths that year .Even as states began to liberalize their abortion laws , many women without access to safe procedures still obtained illegal abortions .As a number of commentators pointed out when Gosnell 's crimes came to light , forcing safe clinics to close would only force more women to predatory providers like Gosnell .From the beginning , anti - choice activists have acknowledged that clinic regulations like those in Texas are meant not to protect women but to challenge legal abortion .In its annual package of model legislation for state legislators , AUL touts clinic - regulation measures as part of the effort to \" unravel \" Roe and facilitate its \" demise .\" Texas ' law , which AUL says it helped write , requires abortion clinics to remodel if they do n't meet the stringent standards of ambulatory surgical clinics , which in general perform more complicated and riskier procedures than abortion .It also mandates that abortion providers have admitting privileges at a local hospital , an unnecessary requirement that it is sometimes difficult or impossible for abortion providers to meet .( This is in part because anti - abortion activists pressure hospitals not to offer such admitting privileges , again showing that their goal is closing clinics , not improving safety standards . )The law behind the Whole Women 's Health case is n't meant to eliminate \" back - alley \" abortions , as its backers are now claiming .It 's meant to cut off access for the women who can least afford it and to chip away at the legal framework of Roe , which would , ironically , mostly likely lead to more true back - alley abortions .As we noted this morning , Sen. Ted Cruz 's presidential campaign has launched a new \" Pro - Lifers for Cruz \" coalition , led by the Family Research Council 's Tony Perkins along with 10 co - chairs , including radical anti - abortion activist Troy Newman .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.768784"}

Detroit Board of Education [ 431 U.S. 209 ( 97 S.Ct .1782 , 52 L.Ed.2d 261 ) ] divided union dues into two parts .One part is costs associated with providing union workers with a contract , the collective bargaining agreement with the employer , and its administration , the subsequent services of representation at adversarial meetings with management , grievances and arbitrations .Fees for those services are called \" fair use \" or \" agency \" fees .In other words , Abood said that non - members who benefit from union services have to help cover costs .The second part of union dues is \" expenditures for ideological causes not germane to its duties as a collective - bargaining .\" This has been dubbed the political activity of the union , including overt politicking , lobbying lawmakers for specific legislation and financial support for political candidates .People who object to this part of union activity can refuse to pay that portion of dues to the union .In the specific case before SCOTUS today , Friedrichs , plaintiffs are challenging California law .If a teacher wants to protest the political portion of the CTA dues , she or he can give the union a written objection - an \" opt out \" declaration .That portion of the contested fee is then refunded or a portion is reduced .The anti - union plaintiffs want that teacher to have to \" opt in \" and agree to the fees .Plaintiffs frame the issue as one of free choice and the First Amendment ( whether or not the non - administrative fees constitute speech ) .The Case 's Strange Origin .The union - busting groups , typically with a libertarian or right - wing political bent , found this case in order to abolish the last bastion of unionization in America - in government .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.15163"}

'As a result , I agree with Gary Messing that it is likely that the Court will in the future directly address the issue that it did not rule on in Harris , i.e. , whether fair share clauses can be constitutionally applied to full - fledged public employees .\" The dissenting opinion authored by Justice Kagan relies largely upon the principles of stare decisis .Justice Kagan suggests that past precedent makes it ' impossible to reverse ' Abood .I respectfully disagree .I know this because I was the author of an amicus brief in the Garcia case , in which I pointed out that all nine justices had issued previous opinions in which they relied upon the Court 's decision in National League of Cities , all to no avail .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.385376"}

Gomez , the corporation had violated federal law by sending unwanted telephone solicitations to some 100,000 people .Jose Gomez got one of those solicitations and filed a lawsuit , asking for the maximum statutory remedy for himself of $ 1500 but also seeking to bring a class action on behalf of the tens of thousands of other people who received the unwanted solicitations .The corporation tried to end the suit by offering to pay Mr. Gomez his $ 1500 and then arguing that its offer ended the lawsuit and the basis for the class action .If allowed , that would give corporations an easy and inexpensive way to prevent most class action lawsuits .The Supreme Court rejected the corporation 's ploy in a 6 - 3 vote .As Justice Ginsburg explained , if a plaintiff like Mr. Gomez rejects an offer , even if it is for the maximum amount that could be recovered individually , the case remains alive and able to be pursued as a class action .Chief Justice Roberts , joined by Justices Alito and Scalia , dissented and argued , as they usually do , that the corporation should prevail , since it was willing to give Mr. Gomez \" everything he asks for . \"As Justice Ginsburg explained in response , that \" would place the defendant in the driver 's seat \" , improperly allowing corporations to spend minimal amounts to pay off individual plaintiffs and forestall class actions .This decision will not remedy the damage that the Roberts - Alito Court has previously done , and could well do in the future , to limit class actions and harm consumers .And the Court left open the question of whether a corporation can stop a class action by formally placing the full amount of an individual 's claim in an account and getting a lower court to rule for the individual and dismiss the class action claim .This loophole should be closed by the Court , as the New York Times explained , to \" protect what remains of the class action from the unrelenting efforts of business to undermine it . \" At least in this case , however , even Roberts and Alito could not muster the votes needed to further harm consumers and help big business .On Tuesday , Sandy Rios of the American Family Association denounced the nomination of Wilhelmina Wright for a seat on the federal district court in Minnesota , urging Senate Republicans to not only oppose Wright but also to block every single one of President Obama 's remaining judicial nominees .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.49586"}

Walker is also taking aim at another potential growth sector : high - speed rail .Right now no passenger rail exists between Madison and Milwaukee , which between them house over 75 percent of Wisconsin 's entire population .A high - speed train running between the cities would serve commuters and business travelers , and it would provide a critical influx of visitors to both downtowns .It would also connect Madison to the existing Milwaukee - Chicago train route .Perhaps most important , studies have shown that the line would create over 13,000 jobs , eliminate 780,000 car trips annually , and save Wisconsin residents 2.76 million gallons of gas each year .Investing in high - speed rail makes sense in Wisconsin .The state 's major university and state capitol are in one major city , but the majority of industry and commerce is in another .Connecting the two would be a major investment in Wisconsin 's future growth .But Gov. Walker does n't see it that way .One of his first acts once in office was to defund the proposed rail line , turning down over $ 800 million in federal funds to support the project .That 's a lot of lost jobs today and lost revenue tomorrow .Gov.

The continued exploits of Ross and Torres getting on the board tonight with a home run .BRUCE BOCHY :Yeah , that was big by both of them because we were n't doing much offensively .Those home runs got us back in the game , and that 's what you 're hoping , keep it close and hopefully get a rally going .But Ross has done a great job for us , as Torres has .You 're looking for someone to kind of ignite the offense , and they certainly were trying .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.58153"}

{"text": "Next up are anybody trying to organise a union .The communists know that unions are their most deadly enemy and no communist regime will tolerate them .A union , at least in theory , is run from the bottom up and will oppose stupid decisions dumped on the workers from the clouds like collective agriculture or the extensive use of slave labour .One of the first things that Lenin and Trotsky did was to slaughter everyone in the Sailor 's Union in Kronstadt .Then everyone else who might have any power or influence outside the party gets the bullet to the head .Now you have a single - point - of - failure system because all that 's left is one single bureaucracy and one single set of decision makers .Ask any engineer about the stability of single - point - of - failure systems .Ask any network technician about the information distortion in a system where every datum at the bottom has to go all the way to the top and then all the way to the bottom through 20 levels to be acted upon .( Digression - the government of the Victorian Empire had 7 levels , including Queen Victoria , and there were many multiple other centers of power in that society ) .After the collapse by incompetence everybody crawls out of the wreckage and looks around for some other system .Hilariously they often choose the cartoon - caricature version of capitalism of their old propaganda that never really existed in the West : for one thing religion had as much , if not more , influence on society than the technological and economic systems had .Capitalist economies sit on top of liberal political and religious systems , not the other way around as the identical - twin , hide - bound dogmatists of the Left / Right would have it .A capitalist economy that 's not part of that social ecology turns into the actual nightmare that was originally just a dream of communist propagandists .Doubtless that will get kicked over by some new , stupid , anti - intellectual , demagogic system until some unions survive to stabilise things .In brief , no unions- no civilisation as we know it .( The only other viable system that allows a reasonable level of technology is the Chinese Empire model .Your typical Dynasty lasts for about 300 years and then dies HARD . )If I was some business guy I 'd get down on my hands and knees every morning and Thank God for the unions of yesteryear .They 're the only reason any businessmen working for themselves can exist except as dead bodies piled up in a ditch .I 'll admit that the Cuban and Vietnamese regimes are n't quite like that but they both had the \" advantage \" of US military and economic opposition to keep them honest .They 're just boutique branches of the main horror shows in Asia and Eastern Europe though .MYTH :The Employee Free Choice Act abolishes the National Labor Relations Board 's \" secret ballot \" election process .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "132.74323"}
