Bush administration acknowledged that there was , somewhere in a vague legal ether , an Iranian right to enrich - but it argued that Tehran had somehow managed to \" forfeit \" this right .Such an argument did not persuade most of the lawyers working on the issue in the Bush administration , much less most of the other nations of the world .Eventually , the Bush administration retreated to a rigid demand that the Islamic Republic obey Security Council resolutions calling on it to suspend enrichment before the United States would negotiate with Tehran - and without ever stipulating that a negotiated settlement would include an explicit recognition of Iran 's nuclear rights .Predictably , this stance was diplomatically dysfunctional .When the Obama administration came in , it dropped the Bush administration 's insistence on suspension as a precondition for negotiations .But it has been even less willing than the Bush administration to acknowledge Iran 's nuclear rights - and it , too , has the diplomatic ( non)results to show for its obtuseness .From a global perspective , the positions of the Bush and Obama administrations on Iran 's right to develop indigenous nuclear fuel cycle capabilities and to pursue internationally safeguarded enrichment of uranium on its own territory make the United States a real outlier .This reality was underscored in August at the Non - Aligned Movement ( NAM ) summit , convened in Tehran , where NAM members - including the vast majority of the world 's nation - states - strongly endorsed the Islamic Republic 's right to pursue uranium enrichment .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.81181"}

{"text": "There are several known cases in which the consulate officials of a country have been selling visas to the would - be migrants for a hefty fee .It is not at all unusual that travel agencies also participate in such operations .A special case is in this context the story of children sent by their parents through smugglers / traffickers to Western Europe in the hope that they will also be provided , in the wake , with the right to asylum .This practice is particularly common in Somalia where each month some 250 children are sent out with parents paying up to US$ 10,000 to get their teenagers , but sometimes only four to five year olds , out of the country .In France , young unaccompanied immigrants often evaporate from the official bureaucracy and end up in very diverse conditions .There is only one reception centre for underage immigrants ( Tervonen 2002 ) .In 2001 a total of 461 and in 2002 a total of 550 unaccompanied children came to Sweden , while in 1999 the figure was 236 .The entrants were mostly kurds from Northern Iraq , but they came also from Somalia , Serbia , and Afghanistan .It is commonly assumed that the role of the organized crime syndicates is pervasive in illegal migration .However , many comments tend to confuse illegal migration and human smuggling / trafficking with each other which is less than helpful ( this is done even by Global Report 1999 : 223 - 25 ) .In addition , empirical evidence points in a somewhat different direction ; while organized crime is certainly involved in many illegal human transfers , they can also take place without the criminal contribution .Moreover , many smuggling rings are more like small enterprises run by a group of relatives or acquaintances .If they are involved , crime syndicates tend to be dominant in human trafficking which often requires the control of the entire migration cycle , while in smuggling the main task is to take the person across the border for a profit .Human trafficking may combine smuggling with other types of criminal activities , such as drug trade and prostitution , which is possible because of the resources and networks controlled by the organized criminal groups .In many cases they are tied together by ritual kinship relations that reaffirm their fraternal and operational commonalities ( Paoli 2001 : 94 - 99 ) .For their operation , criminal networks become especially relevant in the recruitment process in which the trafficker needs local contacts to find , either personally or through media , new victims for the business .Human trafficking often involves coercion and violence that are , however , hardly effective means in the recruitment phase of the process .More important is the social access to the local communities and their willingness to provide human raw material for trafficking because without that material the business would dry up ( Koslowski 2001 : 347 - 49 ; Truong 2001 : 16 - 18 ) .5 Transnational mobility and borders The relatively closed nature of political borders can be contrasted with the increasingly free movement of goods , capital , and technology across borders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.94777"}

Richard Assistant Secretary , Bureau of Population , Refugees , and Migration .Geneva , Switzerland . ...Only a small fraction of those who want to be resettled can be - only about one hundred thousand refugees per year , worldwide .There are more than six times that many Syrian refugees in Jordan alone .We applaud the 25 countries that have agreed to resettle Syrian refugees , including some who will be accepting UNHCR refugee referrals for the first time .The United States accepts the majority of all UNHCR referrals from around the world .Last year , we reached our goal of resettling nearly 70,000 refugees from nearly 70 countries .And we plan to lead in resettling Syrians as well .We are reviewing some 9,000 recent UNHCR referrals from Syria .We are receiving roughly a thousand new ones each month , and we expect admissions from Syria to surge in 2015 and beyond .Like most other refugees resettled in the United States , they will get help from the International Organization for Migration with medical exams and transportation to the United States .Once they arrive , networks of resettlement agencies , charities , churches , civic organizations and local volunteers will welcome them .These groups work in 180 communities across the country and make sure refugees have homes , furniture , clothes , English classes , job training , health care and help enrolling their children in school .They are now preparing key contacts in American communities to welcome Syrians .I am inspired both by the resilience of refugees we resettle , and the compassion of those who help them .Resettlement can not replace what refugees have lost or erase what they have endured .But it can renew hope and help restart lives .That can make all the difference .Thank you .So thousands of Syrians are about to be brought into the United States .They are likely to be only the first wave of refugees from the mainly Muslim Middle East .Refugee Resettlement Watch lists the states where nearly 10,000 mostly Muslim refugees were resettled in the first two months of the current fiscal year .Once settled here , they can bring their relations to join them .Under the Obama administration , the Muslim population of America is increasing constantly by immigration .They do not need amnesty .They start receiving \" entitlements \" immediately on arrival .But the UN wo n't allow Western countries to decide which refugees they 'll accept .Canada wants to accept Christians and Yazidis , not Muslims with their incompatible law and ideology .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.349"}

{"text": "What everyone \" knows \" about the crusades may not , in fact , be true .From the many popular notions about the crusades , let us pick four and see if they bear close examination .The four myths : .Myth # 1 : The crusades represented an unprovoked attack by Western Christians on the Muslim world .Myth # 2 : Western Christians went on crusade because their greed led them to plunder Muslims in order to get rich .Myth # 3 : Crusaders were a cynical lot who did not really believe their own religious propaganda ; rather , they had ulterior , materialistic motives .Myth # 4 : The crusades taught Muslims to hate and attack Christians .Here 's the most obvious thing you should know .The Crusades were defensive actions : .In a.d .632 , Egypt , Palestine , Syria , Asia Minor , North Africa , Spain , France , Italy , and the islands of Sicily , Sardinia , and Corsica were all Christian territories .Inside the boundaries of the Roman Empire , which was still fully functional in the eastern Mediterranean , orthodox Christianity was the official , and overwhelmingly majority , religion .Outside those boundaries were other large Christian communities - not necessarily orthodox and Catholic , but still Christian .Most of the Christian population of Persia , for example , was Nestorian .Certainly there were many Christian communities in Arabia .By a.d .732 , a century later , Christians had lost Egypt , Palestine , Syria , North Africa , Spain , most of Asia Minor , and southern France .Italy and her associated islands were under threat , and the islands would come under Muslim rule in the next century .The Christian communities of Arabia were entirely destroyed in or shortly after 633 , when Jews and Christians alike were expelled from the peninsula .6 Those in Persia were under severe pressure .Two - thirds of the formerly Roman Christian world was now ruled by Muslims .What had happened ?Most people actually know the answer , if pressed - though for some reason they do not usually connect the answer with the crusades .The answer is the rise of Islam .Every one of the listed regions was taken , within the space of a hundred years , from Christian control by violence , in the course of military campaigns deliberately designed to expand Muslim territory at the expense of Islam 's neighbors .Nor did this conclude Islam 's program of conquest .The attacks continued , punctuated from time to time by Christian attempts to push back .Charlemagne blocked the Muslim advance in far western Europe in about a.d .800 , but Islamic forces simply shifted their focus and began to island - hop across from North Africa toward Italy and the French coast , attacking the Italian mainland by 837 .A confused struggle for control of southern and central Italy continued for the rest of the ninth century and into the tenth .In the hundred years between 850 and 950 , Benedictine monks were driven out of ancient monasteries , the Papal States were overrun , and Muslim pirate bases were established along the coast of northern Italy and southern France , from which attacks on the deep inland were launched .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.99589"}

{"text": "This also means that most workers continue to produce for the international market primarily from their home base .Capital and technology are much more mobile than productive activities per se .This creates a stark contrast between the global mobility of the rich and the immobility of the great majority of the poor ( this contrast has been stressed by Bauman 1998 ) .An additional factor is that much of the transnational mobility of the elite is licit by its nature ; tourism , business trips , and temporary residence or even multiple residences in foreign countries .In the 1950s and the 1960s , especially in Germany , Sweden , and Switzerland , the liberal immigration regime was due to the need of the semi - skilled labour force in the Fordist manufacturing system .These migration flows followed methodically the expansion of the industrial core of the world economy ( Morawska and Spohn 1997 : 25 - 38 ) .Thus , in recent history , large - scale migration has been associated with the expansion of the mass industrial production .Due to the demand for the labour force , immigration to Western Europe was mostly kept legal and even assisted by the recipient countries .The shift to more capital- and technology - intensive modes of production has significantly reduced the need to import labour from the ( semi)peripheral countries .Instead , we find that capital is searching for new sites of production in which the combination of the costs and the productivity of labour is in the right proportion to relevant economic and political variables .These factors include the access to the global and regional markets and the character of the governmental policy .These observations lead to an intriguing question whether the globalization of capital is associated with the erection of economic and political barriers to the free flow of labour , especially between the periphery and the centre .The elites and masses of the core prefer to confine the exploitation of the low - paying labour force to the periphery .This barrier is often legalized and reinforced by the core governments , for instance , by closing the border for migration and imposing employer penalties ( for an early analysis of this tendency , see Cohen 1987 ) .It has been often noted , though , that in industrialized countries , the penalties to import and employ illicit labour are weak and they are enforced in a haphazard manner .However , in recent years , the control of borders has become stricter largely because of the political backlash that the inflow of immigrants and refugees has fostered in several European countries .In reality , the issue is about the crisis of the asylum policy that represents both the complexity of the new challenges of the new immigration and the ineptitude of the EU governments to deal with it ( on the British situation , see The Economist 2003 ) .In sum , the licit flow of both unskilled and even skilled workers is now increasingly regulated by the core states , although the United States continues to be a partial exception in this regard .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.992035"}

{"text": "These intermediaries are usually professionals , often small entrepreneurs , and they do not need to be members of any centralized crime syndicates .The exportation of migrants is frequently initiated by the local entrepreneurs or elites who have connections with the smugglers and foreign employers .In these operations , these people are transported en masse , either clandestinely or by the help of the bribed officials , to work in prostitution , plantations , sweatshops , or mines .The key feature of such an operation is that the migrants lose their freedom and may become bonded labour and live in servitude ( Kyle and Dale 2001 ) .Both schemes described above may involve human trafficking , but their practical and moral character differs significantly from each other , the slave importation scheme being worse of the two .When in illegal migration the goal is to just find employment , the person moving has at least a modicum of freedom to decide whether he or she wants to leave the country for a foreign destination .On the other hand , in slave trade there is no such choice as it specifically targets those who are weak , vulnerable , and deprived in the society ( Bales 1999 : 10 - 11 ) .4 Human trafficking The Protocols of the Palermo Convention make a clear distinction between human smuggling and trafficking .The latter refers to a process in which illegal and coercive means are used both in the smuggling of the victims and subjugating to an unfree or abusive status in the destination .Trafficking can be considered a form of international business ( Salt and Stein 1997 : 470 - 71 ) which means that its borderline with human smuggling becomes blurred ( Helminen and Kirkas 2002 : 21 - 22 ) .The dilution of this borderline underestimates , however , the human rights violations that are involved in human trafficking ( UNICEF 2002 : 2 - 4 and passim ) .As a result , human trafficking is usually regarded as a nasty and repulsive business that receives almost universal moral condemnation , while illegal immigration , and even human smuggling , are understood because of the economic and humanitarian motives involved in them .An illegal migrant is only a person who wants to improve his lot in the world , albeit by means defined as illicit by governments .The problem is that the more strictly the laws of immigration against the illegal entrants are enforced , the more sinister forms of criminality are used in human trafficking to overcome the barriers that are needed for making a profit .In other words , the higher the barriers of entry to an attractive target country are , the more complex becomes the methods and morality of human smuggling .The critical variable seems to be the interaction between the governments and organized crime syndicates .Corruption is , indeed , a central element in human smuggling and trafficking because it makes it easier to get the migrants across the borders .Illegal immigrants may , of course , enter the country on their own , but often they need assistance by the professional smugglers bringing them in clandestinely .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.20737"}
