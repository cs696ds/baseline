Danin is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and at Harvard University 's Belfer Center .He previously served in a variety of senior Middle East positions at the White House and U.S. Department of State .Here 's Why Saudi Arabia and Iran Are at Each Other 's Throats .It 's not been a great start to 2016 .Saudi Arabia has cut diplomatic ties with Iran after its embassy in Tehran was torched by protesters over the weekend .Iran 's Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has promised \" divine vengeance \" on the Desert Kingdom , prompting fears that a decade - long Cold War may suddenly get a lot hotter .Here 's a quick explainer of what 's happened so far , and what could still happen .Q. What happened while I was still celebrating New Year 's ? A. Saudi Arabia executed 47 people for either committing or conspiring to commit terrorist attacks .According to various reports , most of the victims were loyal , or sympathetic , to Al Qaeda .But they also included Sheikh Nimr al - Nimr , a prominent cleric from Saudi Arabia 's Shia minority .That caused a wave of protests , both in Iran and among Shia communities in Arab countries , culminating in the attack on the Saudi embassy .Q. But it did n't come out of nowhere , did it ? A. Far from it .It 's an indication of Saudi 's priorities that it stopped bombing Islamic State positions in Iraq three months ago to concentrate on bombing Yemeni rebels ( with substantial civilian casualties ) .Q. So , is this about religion or politics , and who 's winning ? A. The rivalry has turned increasingly hostile since Saddam Hussein was toppled from power in Iraq ( which borders both countries ) , paving the way for that country 's Shia majority to take power there .It got a lot more hostile in the last 12 months under the influence of Saudi Arabia 's new king , Salman , who has been much more aggressive in trying to stop Iranian influence from spreading .Q. Is Saudi 's oil price war part of its strategy ? A. When Saudi Arabia stopped cooperating with the rest of OPEC in 2014 to support oil prices , it had other targets in mind , notably higher - cost producers in the U.S.But low oil prices has the bonus effect of punishing both Iran and ( non - OPEC )Russia for thwarting its efforts to topple President Bashar al - Assad in Syria .For the moment , Saudi has deep enough pockets to survive the hit to its own finances .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.82289"}

Bush , who was excoriated by hawks for pursuing supposedly \" realist \" objectives in foreign affairs .What Saudi Arabia 's Spat With Iran Means for the U.S. .Earlier this week , Saudi Arabia cut off diplomatic ties with Iran after authorities executed a popular Shiite cleric .Anyone watching this meltdown unfold has every reason to think of worse - case scenarios , as it will only deepen the Middle East 's widening sectarian divide , intensify the region 's multiple conflicts , and set back efforts to defeat the Islamic State and end the bloodshed in Syria .Each claims to be the face of the true and authentic variant of Islam .Saudi Arabia , custodian of Islam 's two leading holy places in Mecca and Medina , sees in the Islamic Republic of Iran a revolutionary Shiite Persian power expanding its reach into the Sunni Arab heartland .Having seen Tehran spread its influence into Iraq , Lebanon , Yemen , and Syria , the Saudis , led by a new and more activist king , are sending a strong message to the world that it will not sit by passively .The most immediate casualty of intensified Saudi - Iranian tensions will be the recently launched U.S.-led diplomatic effort to end the horrific Syrian war that has already claimed more than 250,000 dead .Iranian forces are fighting and dying in Syria to preserve president Bashar al Assad 's regime , while Saudi Arabia is actively backing rebels seeking to topple the dictator .Just getting the Iranian and Saudi foreign ministers into the same room last month was touted as a major accomplishment by Secretary of State John Kerry .While Iran and Saudi Arabia profess a desire to cooperate diplomatically , both countries are now sure to double down their support for the opposing sides in Syria 's war .The Syrian opposition , meanwhile , has urged all Arab countries to break relations with Tehran .A second casualty of Iran 's strained relations with Saudi Arabia is likely to be the regional effort to combat the so - called Islamic State , or Daesh , that currently occupies a large swath of territory across Iraq and Syria .While the United States and Europe , reeling from Islamist terrorism , see defeating Daesh as the paramount objective in the Middle East , this sense of priority is not shared by many Arab allies within the anti - Daesh coalition .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.32592"}

{"text": "But why a pragmatic country ( as Parsi portrays Iran ) should be harmed and isolated by the peace between Israel and Palestinians ?Many other regional countries ( like Turkey ) were not invited to Madrid conference but only Iran felt endangered by the peace prospect and took the lead to ( violently ) oppose it .Simply because the peace would eliminate the Iranian ambition to take the leadership of the Islamic world founded on hatred and animosity with Israel .Parsi claims that : \" the more the Islamic Republic 's foreign policy was presented as different from that of the Shah , the more it resembled it at its core .Achieving and sustaining a position of preeminence in the Persian Gulf - based on Iran 's inclusion in all decisions of relevance to the region - was the guiding principle of the Iranian monarch 's foreign policy .The means had changed dramatically .The ideology had shifted astonishingly .But the end goal remained remarkably similar .It is difficult to incorporate the creation of Hezbollah and enormous efforts by Iran to support similar radical groups around the globe in the framework of Persian Gulf domination .Similarly , the Iranian campaign of kidnapping , terror and destabilization operations in the 1980s that targeted almost all the moderate Arab countries is in sharp contrast to a pragmatic foreign policy , which only aims to dominate the Persian Gulf region .They are indications of a more ambitious goal to dominate the Islamic world .There is always a correlation between the means and the goals .How could a campaign of terror serve a pragmatic foreign policy ?The nature of Iranian partners is a good indication of its goals .How could a country achieve a pragmatic foreign policy when all of its partners are the most radical , reactionary and terrorist groups ?No country in the world has so much contributed to the spread of fundamentalism , hatred , instability and terror in the Middle East than Iran under Ayatollahs .But Parsi 's effort to misrepresent the Iranian regime 's nature and goals become vain and obsolete when he tries to mask and pale its anti - Semitism .Part three : Paling the Iranian regime 's anti - Semitism .Regime 's Holocaust denying and anti - Semitism .When in 2005 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made his infamous declaration that Israel should be wiped off the map , the international community reacted forcefully and condemned this new low in the Iranian regime 's hatred towards an entire nation .For Iran observers , this was only a new step in the Iranian march to promote anti - Semitism and Holocaust denying throughout the Middle East and Islamic world .Since the start of Khomeini 's rein in 1979 , Iran has become the godfather anti - Semitism and supported , promoted and protected the most reactionary people and groups from around the world that were unified together in their hatred against the Jewish people and Israel .The Iranian government has been the only regime in the world that openly and systematically assumes its anti - Semitism and Holocaust denying .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.3754"}

{"text": "Yes , you read that right - NIAC beat AIPAC .\" On the other hand , when NIAC is under criticism , the blame is on Israel , AIPAC and Neoconservative warmongers .For example , when in April 2007 this author published a report about NIAC , several government - related newspapers in Tehran came out to defend Parsi and wrote that AIPAC and Neoconservatives have attacked NIAC .Similarly , the same line of defense has been adopted by Parsi and NIAC in Washington to depict their critics as warmongers who serve the pro - Israeli neoconservatives .It is noteworthy to remember that he has always tried to present his lobby in \" attractive \" terms .In 2002 , few months after the start of NIAC , he sent a letter to a Wahington lobbyist and explained him how to give a human face to the anti - sanction lobby .He wrote : . \"Although the mission of the proposed lobby should be to improve relations between the US and Iran and open up opportunities for trade , the initial targets should be less controversial issues such as visas and racial profiling / discrimination ... .Despite its predominantly business oriented constituency , it is essential that the lobby creates a \" human face \" for its aims and goals .AIPAC successfully painted the opponents of the Iran Libya Sanctions Act as \" greedy businessmen who had no scruples when it came to doing business with terrorist regimes .\" The oil companies failed to characterize their campaign with \" human concern for the well - being of innocent Iranians stuck with a dictatorial regime \" or \" support for the poor mid - Western family father who lost his job due the sanctions .\" The human element is essential both when it comes to attracting support among Iranian - Americans and when it comes to winning the debate and the votes on the Hill .\" Practical tactic or genuine belief , the results are identical .Parsi has greatly contributed to present AIPAC and Israel as the powerful and bullying giants in Washington that harm US interests .Consequently , those who fight against AIPAC , are patriots who should be honored as David of modern time .Remembering the Nazi radio broadcast .Adam Kirsch who has recently reviewed Jeffrey Herf 's new book , \" Nazi Propaganda in the Arab World \" wrote : .\" What is most striking in the Nazis ' Arabic - language propaganda is the unquestioning assumption of Jewish power .Again and again , the British and the Americans are described as pawns of the Jews ; Roosevelt is alternately said to be Jewish or surrounded by Jews ( including Eleanor ) ; Chaim Weizmann is considered as powerful as Roosevelt and Churchill put together . \"Had it not been for the Jews , neither London , Washington , nor Moscow would have been linked together , \" explained one broadcast in December 1943 .It is a perfect example of the Nazi \" Big Lie , \" for of course the truth is exactly the opposite : it was Germany 's aggression that brought together those unlikely allies . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.60034"}

{"text": "Q. Will oil prices spike if the tensions worsen ? A. Maybe .It 's important to distinguish between the actual balance of supply and demand in the oil market , and the geopolitical risk premium that traders build in to oil prices .The first impact on prices is likely to come through the latter channel .Everyone is so bearish about oil in general at the moment , says Mostaque , that there 's no geopolitical risk component in the price at all ( crude prices have already given up three - quarters of their gains since the Saudi embassy went up in flames ) .Q. Is that it ?Just an abstract \" risk premium \" ? A. In the short term , yes , although it would be unwise to underestimate that .Oil traders are a jumpy lot ( especially if they work for strategically important trading houses in big oil importer countries like China or Japan ) , and things could change quickly if there 's further escalation in the tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran .But fundamentally , the oil market is badly oversupplied .While such imbalances invariably correct themselves as demand responds and expensive production is curtailed , the process takes time .To achieve a real , sustained lift to oil prices , you need a real , sustained disruption to supply ( preferably in conjunction with a revival in demand ) .That could happen in the form of a stand - off in the Persian Gulf , through which around 20 % of the world 's oil supplies flow .But an outright interstate conflict is n't the most likely course of events , experts say .Jane Kinninmont , deputy head of the Middle East and North Africa program at the Royal Institute for International Affairs in London , reckons that an extension of the proxy conflicts between Saudi Arabia and Iran is more likely .If Saudi 's focus falls on Yemen , or Lebanon , as some fear , then there 'll still be no big hit to output .Destabilizing Iraq , which raised oil production more than any other single country last year , would have a much bigger impact on oil prices ( albeit at the price of angering the U.S. , the Kingdom 's most important ally ) .World Stock Markets Reel From China , Saudi Shocks .Global stock markets have opened 2016 with a bang - just not the kind most were hoping for .The only color on the screens ( unless you 're an oil or gold trader ) is red , as markets tumble from Shanghai to London on a cocktail of conflict in the Middle East and fresh evidence of a slowdown in China .The only difference is in how much each market has fallen .In Shanghai , trading was halted with the main index down 6.9 % , bringing back memories of the panic selling last summer as a government - sponsored bubble exploded .An index level of 50 generally reflects constant levels of output .Slowing growth in the world 's second - largest economy plagued stock markets all through last year , and international fears were made worse by the extreme volatility in China 's stock market , and by suspicions that Beijing may be hiding the true extent of its slowdown .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.136635"}

Bush lived there - at the expense of traditional CIA missions .Like all enduring myths , there 's more than a little truth to all this .CIA got into the killing business in a serious way , in many places , developing a close - to - seamless relationship between itself , NSA , and the military 's spooky Joint Special Operations Command to hunt down terrorists worldwide .This represents the most impressive secret killing machine in military history , with lethal snake - eaters guided by real - time , precise intelligence , and one which President Obama especially has not been squeamish about using .This militarization of CIA has led to criticism of the Agency from outsiders , many of whom did n't like CIA anyway and really do n't like it when it has its own drones and special operators .Needless missteps that have gotten CIA officers killed thanks to sloppy tradecraft are grist to the mill of \" too - much - CT \" criticism .However , it 's easy to overstate all this .CIA has kept on doing all its traditional missions since 9/11 .Spies and analysts have been rolling along , doing what they 've done since the Agency was established in 1947 .Outside critics often miss the big picture , as I 've noted before , and few journalists and academics have much \" feel \" for how CIA and the whole IC actually operate .It all looks rather different when you 're inside the bubble .It 's disappointing that hardly any commentators have noted that CIA is currently being taken down a path of real militarization .The major reforms recently proposed by Director John Brennan are causing serious bureaucratic churn out at Langley .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.45614"}

{"text": "Although the West is far more resilient to these interconnected global crises , entrenched inequalities in the US , Britain and Western Europe - which have a disproportionate effect on ethnic minorities , women and children - are worsening .In Britain , nearly 70 percent of ethnically South Asian Muslims , and two - thirds of their children , live in poverty .Just under 30 percent of British Muslim young people aged from 16 - 24 years are unemployed .According to Minority Rights Group International , conditions for British Muslims in terms of \" access to education , employment and housing \" have deteriorated in recent years , rather than improving .This has been accompanied by a \" worrying rise in open hostility \" from non - Muslim communities , and a growing propensity for police and security services to target Muslims disproportionately under anti - terror powers .Consistently negative reporting on Muslims by the media , coupled with grievances over justifiable perceptions of an aggressive and deceptive foreign policy in the Muslim world , compound the latter to create a prevailing sense of social exclusion associated with British Muslim identity .It is the toxic contribution of these factors to general identity formation that is the issue - not each of the factors by themselves .Poverty alone , or discrimination alone , or anti - Muslim reporting alone , and so on , do not necessarily make a person vulnerable to radicalisation .But together these can forge an attachment to an identity that sees itself as alienated , frustrated and locked in a cycle of failure .The prolongation and interaction of these problems can contribute to the way Muslims in Britain from various walks of life begin to view themselves as a whole .In some cases , it can generate an entrenched sense of separation and alienation from , and disillusionment with wider society .This exclusionary identity , and where it takes a person , will depend on that person 's specific environment , experiences and choices .Prolonged social crises can lay the groundwork for the rise of toxic , xenophobic ideologies on all sides .Such crises undermine conventional mores of certainty and stability rooted in established notions of identity and belonging .While vulnerable Muslims might turn to gang culture , or worse , Islamist extremism , vulnerable non - Muslims might adopt their own exclusionary identities linked with extremist groups like the English Defence League , or other far - right extremist networks .For more powerful elite groups , their sense of crisis may inflame militaristic neoconservative ideologies that sanitise incumbent power structures , justify the status quo , whitewash the broken system that sustains their power , and demonise progressive and minority movements .In this maelstrom , the supply of countless billions of dollars to Islamist extremist networks in the Middle East with a penchant for violence , empowers groups that previously lacked any local constituency .As multiple crises converge and intensify , undermining state stability and inflaming grievances , this massive input of resources to Islamist ideologues can pull angry , alienated , vulnerable individuals into their vortex of xenophobic extremism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.23152"}
