Nixon 's order to fire the Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox .But there is a difference .By his own account , Mr. Comey threatened to quit -- along with Mr. Ashcroft and the F.B.I. director , Robert S. Mueller III -- but never did .Mr. Bush allowed new procedures in the N.S.A. program , which officials have said included Justice Department audits , and the eavesdropping continued without the court warrants some legal authorities believe the law requires .Former colleagues say strains with the White House began after the arrival in 2003 of Jack L. Goldsmith to head the department 's Office of Legal Counsel .With Mr. Comey 's backing , Mr. Goldsmith questioned what he considered shaky legal reasoning in several crucial opinions , including some drafted by Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo .Mr. Goldsmith 's review of legal memoranda on the N.S.A. program and interrogation practices became a source of friction between Mr. Comey and the White House .He had a strong sense of personal integrity and he felt that the legal judgments of the Justice Department were not being honored , ' ' a former Justice Department colleague said , speaking on condition of anonymity .Mr. Yoo had the strong support of Mr. Gonzales and David S.

Lewis Libby Jr. .In 2004 , he backed Justice Department subordinates who withdrew a legal memorandum justifying harsh interrogations of suspected terrorists .This spring , more than a year after leaving the government , he publicly praised several United States attorneys who had been dismissed , undermining the administration 's claim that they were removed for poor performance .The Justice Department had ruled that the program would not be lawful without certain changes , and President Bush subsequently directed that the changes be made .Colleagues say Mr. Comey is , even now , a reluctant critic of the administration he served .But they say he feels strongly that there was no justification for the purge of prosecutors and remains furious about what he saw in 2004 as an improper attempt by the White House to bypass the Justice Department .Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York , who led Mr. Comey through his dramatic tale on Tuesday , said it was clearly an emotional release for the former No . 2 Justice Department official . ''When we asked him about it , it was like a dam broke , ' ' Mr. Schumer said .He had been carrying this weight around inside him and wanted the appropriate opportunity to get it off his conscience , ' ' Mr. Schumer added . ''When you watched him , he was both pained and relieved . ' ' Mr. Comey , a former federal terrorism prosecutor in New York and Virginia , is described by colleagues as a solid Republican but one whose devotion to the law trumped political considerations .Steven R. Peikin , who prosecuted securities fraud cases under Mr. Comey when he was United States attorney in Manhattan , said he found Mr. Comey 's intervention in the N.S.A. program ' ' totally unsurprising . ' ' We always joked that Jimmy Stewart 's going to play him in the movie , ' ' Mr. Peikin said . ''He 's the picture of rectitude -- a charming , engaging , funny guy , but one who set a tone for the office about doing the right thing , not necessarily about winning every case .

Lewis Libby Jr. .In 2004 , he backed Justice Department subordinates who withdrew a legal memorandum justifying harsh interrogations of suspected terrorists .This spring , more than a year after leaving the government , he publicly praised several United States attorneys who had been dismissed , undermining the administration 's claim that they were removed for poor performance .The Justice Department had ruled that the program would not be lawful without certain changes , and President Bush subsequently directed that the changes be made .Colleagues say Mr. Comey is , even now , a reluctant critic of the administration he served .But they say he feels strongly that there was no justification for the purge of prosecutors and remains furious about what he saw in 2004 as an improper attempt by the White House to bypass the Justice Department .Senator Charles E. Schumer , Democrat of New York , who led Mr. Comey through his dramatic tale on Tuesday , said it was clearly an emotional release for the former No . 2 Justice Department official . ''When we asked him about it , it was like a dam broke , ' ' Mr. Schumer said .He had been carrying this weight around inside him and wanted the appropriate opportunity to get it off his conscience , ' ' Mr. Schumer added . ''When you watched him , he was both pained and relieved . ' ' Mr. Comey , a former federal terrorism prosecutor in New York and Virginia , is described by colleagues as a solid Republican but one whose devotion to the law trumped political considerations .Steven R. Peikin , who prosecuted securities fraud cases under Mr. Comey when he was United States attorney in Manhattan , said he found Mr. Comey 's intervention in the N.S.A. program ' ' totally unsurprising . ' ' We always joked that Jimmy Stewart 's going to play him in the movie , ' ' Mr. Peikin said . ''He 's the picture of rectitude -- a charming , engaging , funny guy , but one who set a tone for the office about doing the right thing , not necessarily about winning every case . ' 'On Wednesday , in a letter to Mr. Gonzales signed by three other Democratic senators , Mr. Schumer reminded Mr. Gonzales that he had testified last year that ' ' there has not been any serious disagreement ' ' about the N.S.A. program and asked about the apparent contradiction .On Wednesday , Senator Chuck Hagel , Republican of Nebraska , joined the calls by lawmakers for Mr. Gonzales to step down .As with other Bush administration moderates , including former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and his deputy , Richard L. Armitage , Mr. Comey 's standing in the White House declined after he challenged some positions championed by Mr. Cheney .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.90442"}

{"text": "In other words , you do n't need to reference conservative media in any way to determine the truth about the Abedin family and their connections to Abdullah Omar Nasseef .As the masthead of this 1996 issue of the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs shows , Huma Abedin was an assistant editor at Journal .Down the masthead you can see the name of Abdullah Omar Nasseef .Because of the smear tactics used by Media Matters and repeated by the mainstream media , this point can not be stressed enough : this is a primary source showing Abedin was an Assistant Editor of the Journal .It 's not a right - wing theory , a conservative fever dream , Islamaphobia nonsense or anti - Muslim fear - mongering .It 's a fact , a cold hard fact shown on the Journal 's masthead at the site where the Journal itself publishes .Far from being \" spontaneous \" and \" indigenous , \" the uprisings known as the \" Arab Spring \" that swept North Africa and the Middle East were long planned and planned from abroad with the Muslim Brotherhood 's role hidden in plain sight .The Muslim Brotherhood was founded in Egypt in 1928 as a Sunni Islamist religious , political and social movement .According to Lawrence Wright in his book \" The Looming Tower , \" its founder Hassan al - Banna \" rejected the Western model of secular , democratic government , which contradicted his notion of universal Islamic rule .\" The fundamental goal of the Muslim Brotherhood remains Islam 's global domination , an effort that quickly turned violent and eventually spread to over eighty other nations .For example , one Muslim Brotherhood splinter group was responsible for the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat for his peace treaty with Israel and another offshoot is the terrorist organization Hamas .In addition to a wide - spread infiltration of the Muslim Brotherhood into the Obama Administration , Hillary Clinton 's longest serving assistant , Huma Abedin , has enjoyed an intensely close relationship with the Brotherhood for decades .Her father , Zyed Abedin , served as editor of an anti - Semitic journal funded by an Islamist ; her mother , Saleha Mahmood Abedin , replaced him as editor in 1993 when he died .As editor , Saleha has promoted the Muslim Brotherhood violent jihad and the \" right \" of women to be repressed under sharia .Therein rests the motivation for the policies formulated and actions taken by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in Egypt , Libya and Syria , all of which led to the growth of radical Islam in North Africa and the Middle East .In terms of US foreign policy and national security , the role of Hillary Clinton in the Libyan fiasco was as reckless as it was cataclysmic .Clinton was among the most vocal early proponents of using U.S. military force to topple Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi , claiming erroneously that Gadhafi was about to engage in a genocide against civilians in Benghazi , where the Islamist rebels held their center of power .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.601685"}

{"text": "Her reactions are priceless .Divisive President Laments On How Much He Sucked At Easing Partisan Rhetoric .Wednesday , February 10 .By Matt Vespa .Today , President Obama ventured back to Springfield , Illinois , where he launched his 2008 presidential campaign , to address the Illinois General Assembly .He lamented about how he 's been an utter failure regarding bridging political divides and calming the vicious partisan rhetoric ( via NBC News ): .Returning to the place where his political career - and his first presidential campaign - began , President Obama visited the Illinois capital Wednesday , renewing his call for healing the nation 's partisan discord and building a better electoral system .Bemoaning a \" poisonous political climate \" that made citizens cynical and disillusioned and leaders unable to achieve great goals , Obama posed the challenge : \" What can we do all of us together to try to make our politics better ? \"He outlined a few solutions , none of them new : limiting the influence of money in politics - including a Constitutional amendment , if necessary ; reforming the congressional redistricting process ; and making it easier to register and vote .Well , for starters , this president is the most divisive in the modern era .Second , gerrymandering really did n't have that much of an impact on our political process .But if Democrats want to continue this charade of throwing temper tantrums about the way congressional districts are drafted , then win some state and local elections .You actually have to care about the states , Democrats .By all accounts , you have zero interest in state legislatures , secretaries of state , governors , insurance commissioners , and other positions that are key to congressional maps , and finding future talent for the party .But enough about how Democrats have been completely eaten alive at the state level ; Obama added that not being able to shed his divisive nature is one of the biggest regrets of his presidency .In short , a divisive president lamented about how awful he was at trying to ... be not as partisan .That 's rich - almost as rich as Bill Clinton trying to accuse other of sexism given his sordid sexual history .President Obama at Illinois General Assembly : \" I had to acknowledge that one of my few regrets is my inability to reduce the polarization and meanness in our politics .I was able to be part of that here , and yet , could n't translate it the way I wanted to into our politics in Washington .Which is why , in my final State of the Union address , and in the one before that , I had to acknowledge that one of my few regrets is my inability to reduce the polarization and meanness in our politics .I was able to be part of that here and yet could n't translate it the way I wanted to into our politics in Washington .And people ask me why I 've devoted so much time to this topic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.6602"}

{"text": "Thanks to a report from Matt Steinmetz , I might have to add one more item to the list .Don Nelson reportedly met with Anthony Randolph 's parents over the summer , and all reports from the Randolph camp make it sound as if the meeting was a good one .It 's still just talk until Nelson and Randolph hit the court in sync with one another - but it 's the best talk Warriors fans have heard in a long time .Matt Steinmetz 's piece is well worth a read for lots of encouraging details , not the least of which are Randolph 's current measurements : 7 - 0 , 222 .Given his skills and body control , he 's entering into rare territory once he hits seven feet .If his frame continues to pick up muscle , the active but sometimes physically over - matched player we saw last year will have some surprises ready for the big men that occasionally beat up on him .Randolph 's physical development is great , but I 'm more impressed by what might be a development in Nelson 's coaching style .Nelson has famously feuded with players - particularly young , confident , and supremely talented big men - so his effort to reach out to Randolph 's family is notable .If Nelson works on his communication with Randolph , he can hopefully find the sweet spot between constructive coaching and alienating criticism .Randolph still has lots to learn , and there should be no higher priority on this team right now than making sure that he 's taught it - in whatever way works best for him .You figure out how to communicate with people by starting a dialog .Here 's hoping that 's what Nelson has begun with Randolph and his family .Advertisement .He 's the only player on our roster that looks capable of being outstanding on both ends of the court .He has shown nothing but fire and will to improve since he checked into his first game .For the long term success of this team - not this season or the next , but for the next decade - nothing is more important right now than maximizing Anthony Randolph 's potential .Ultimately , we 're left depending on a franchise that seems to get so much wrong to find a way to get the most important thing right .But for once , with the latest Nelson / Randolph reports , it sounds as if we can base what little optimism we have left on something more than just hope stacked atop of wishful thinking .Swift is gone , a combination of too big too fast and major injuries and bad tatoos .Off the topo of your heado you might remember Nenad Krystic , Nick Collison , and now Etan Thomas .The dubs \" pencil \" ( for geeks ) above OKC , Mem , Sac , Minn and , I think , LAC on paper - but that 's for starters and may not happen .What reason can you think of for the dubs to finish below any of those teams ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.058914"}
