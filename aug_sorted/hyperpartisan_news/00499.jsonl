Calhoun in 1896 , they praised his dedication to truth , justice and the Constitution - ignoring his devotion to slavery , which he famously called \" a positive good . \"Hundreds of similar monuments convinced generations of white Southerners , and others , that the Confederacy had gone to war to defend states ' rights , liberty and the Southern way of life .Anything but slavery . ...Rather than relegating slavery to the margins of memory , we must place it front and center .Decades ago , scholars demolished claims that slavery did not cause the Civil War and debunked fairy tales about faithful slaves and doting masters .New research has gone further , exposing how American capitalism and democracy - once thought to be antithetical to slavery - emerged hand - in - hand with it .Our nation 's capital is replete with memorials to presidents and veterans .Why not raise a slave monument alongside them ?Congress actually entertained the idea in 2003 , when the National Slave Memorial Act was introduced , but ultimately authorized the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture instead .There seem to be two impulses at work here , one commemorative and the other pedagogical .I think a national monument to slavery would only address the former .Monuments are great if you want to commemorate and pay tribute .They constitute a visible , public statement about what a community thinks is important about its past .As educational devices , though , monuments are n't exactly the most effective instruments .I hasten to add that I do n't think a national slavery monument is a bad idea .I just do n't think it would address the issues regarding public understanding of the history of slavery that Roberts and Kytle have identified .Like much of the rest of East Tennessee , Greene County was heavily Unionist during the Civil War .When the state held a secession referendum in June 1861 , 78.3 % of voters from Greene County opposed leaving the Union .Indeed , one Greene County resident became the most prominent Southern Unionist in the nation .Andrew Johnson - the only Southern senator to remain loyal to the U.S. , military governor of Union - occupied Tennessee , and Lincoln 's second running mate - started his political career in Greeneville , and his home and grave are still there .He wants to see the Confederate flag displayed at the courthouse as a \" historic exhibit , \" his resolution states .The resolution also states that the flag should be displayed to honor Tennesseans who fought for the Confederacy and that the flag represents \" heritage and history that our county should be proud of .\" The Confederate flag 's display has proven to be a divisive issue , as some say it represents history and heritage while others see it as representative of slavery and oppression .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.267467"}

Ramsey , who in turn gave it to his son as a wedding present in 1857 and moved a short distance away to his own estate of Mecklenburg .The house 's link to J.G.M. Ramsey was one of the main reasons I wanted to see it , since every aficionado of early Tennessee history is bound to cross paths with him sooner or later .Although his contributions to the state 's transportation development and finance were considerable , Ramsey 's role as chronicler of Tennessee 's past was probably his most important legacy .Some of the most prominent players in Tennessee 's formative years were guests at Ramsey House when J.G.M. was growing up , and he developed a passionate interest in the Volunteer State 's history , reflected in his massive collection of manuscripts and books .The crowning achievement of this historical work was his massive Annals of Tennessee to the End of the Eighteenth Century , published in 1853 and still an invaluable resource for students of the early southwestern frontier .Above all else , he was a committed believer in states ' rights and a defender of southern interests , serving as a Confederate treasury agent on the outbreak of the Civil War .His zealous support for secession ended up taking a tremendous toll on his family .The Union occupation of Knoxville in 1863 forced him to flee Mecklenburg , his daughter was exiled from the city , and his youngest son Arthur was one of the many Tennessee troops killed in action at Piedmont , VA in June 1864 .One wartime loss was as devastating for later Tennessee historians as it must have been to Ramsey personally - a Union arsonist put Mecklenburg to the torch , and its priceless collection of historical papers and relics went up in smoke .Ramsey himself blamed his nemesis William Brownlow , an outspoken Unionist with whom he had been at odds since before the war , for instigating the arson .One of the reasons Ramsey 's Annals is such an important resource is because much of the primary material that went into the work went up in flames along with his home .( Speaking as somebody who could 've made use of those documents , I can tell you that if I find the arsonist in the afterlife , there 's going to be trouble . )After the war , Ramsey was able to get a presidential pardon from Andrew Johnson .The family eventually returned to Knoxville , but J.G.M. 's son sold the ancestral home in 1866 .The Association for the Preservation of Tennessee Antiquities acquired it in 1952 and furnished it to match the period of Francis Ramsey 's occupancy , using items donated by descendants and an inventory of the patriarch 's estate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.262184"}

White ( 1869 ) provides an answer to this question : it basically states that no , the states were simply in a state of rebellion but were still members of the United States .However , the decision written by Chief Justice Chase was not based on any precedent or anything in the Constitution only on his view of the situation .The wording of the act is both careful and I am sure intentional .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.52898"}

{"text": "Soldiers Exposed to Blasts at Greater Risk for PTSD , TBI , Other Long - Term Injuries .The committee that wrote the report focused on health consequences experienced at least six months after a blast .Tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan have been killed or wounded by explosions during those wars .Blasts are the leading cause of death and injury on the battlefield , accounting for about 75 percent of all combat - related injuries in U.S. military personnel .Several major patterns of injury result from explosions , from injuries caused by the blast wave itself to those caused by fragments of debris propelled by the explosion , to subsequent illnesses from , for example , chemical substances released by a bomb .When the energy from the blast shock wave is absorbed in the human body , it disrupts the natural state of the body at a basic or even molecular level , which can cause tissue damage not immediately apparent after the blast .Some evidence suggests that blast exposure can result in long - term hearing damage and muscle or bone impairment such as osteoarthritis .However , the data on these outcomes were not strong enough to draw a direct cause - and - effect relationship .Though an association could exist , evidence was more tentative to link blast exposure to long - term effects on cardiovascular and pulmonary function , substance - abuse disorders , and chronic pain in the absence of a severe , immediate injury .While there is substantial overlap between symptoms of mild TBI and PTSD , limited evidence suggests that most of the shared symptoms could be a result of PTSD and not a direct result of TBI alone .The committee outlined several recommendations for urgent research to inform decisions on how to prevent and better diagnose blast injuries , and how to treat , rehabilitate and support victims of battlefield trauma in the immediate aftermath and in the long term .In this research agenda , it is especially important to emphasize that blasts create unusual patterns of injury that can affect multiple organs and systems of the body , a complexity that has often been overlooked in previous studies .Understanding these cross - system interactions should be a priority for future research , the committee stressed .It also is essential that future studies use a standardized definition of blast exposure , once it is developed .For health outcomes associated with blast exposure , the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs should evaluate the approaches already in place to detect , treat and rehabilitate blast injuries , the report says .Because injuries from blast may go undetected for long periods , the VA should conduct epidemiologic and mechanistic studies to identify biomarkers of blast injury through advanced imaging and molecular methods that could serve as surrogates of exposure .The majority of past studies have used self - reported exposure data , rather than objective measures .Therefore , the committee recommended DOD develop and deploy data collection technologies that quantitatively measure components of blast and characteristics of the exposure environment in real - time and also link these data with self - reported exposure histories and demographic , medical and operational information .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.723816"}
{"text": "The author 's inevitable plea \" that it is time we put it away \" leaves the reader with the impression that an inordinate number of white southerners remain preoccupied with the flag .This overly simplistic narrative masks a more complex history , as well as evidence suggesting that attitudes about the Confederate flag are , in fact , continually evolving in the South .Not all Confederate soldiers fought under the blue St. Andrew 's cross ( more accurately , the saltire ) .And apart from its use during veterans events , the flag 's visibility was minimal during the decades following the war .At the beginning of the 20th century , the United Daughters of the Confederacy sought to protect the flag 's connection to the men in the ranks by maintaining a strict code governing its usage in public .Misuse and alignment with questionable causes , they believed , would not only soil the meaning of the flag , but the memory of the Confederacy and the righteousness of its cause as well .By the 1940s , however , the flag could be seen at University of Mississippi football games and other popular events , ushering in what historian John Coski has called a \" flag fad .\" That fad eventually extended to the far reaches of the nation , and the flag can now be seen on every kind of trinket and tchotchke imaginable .During that period , the flag became the standard for those committed to defending classrooms , bus depots , and other public spaces ( now battlefields themselves ) from black encroachment .In fact , the flag 's use throughout the 20th century covered a time span significantly longer than its presence on Civil War battlefields .Its placement atop southern statehouses like South Carolina ultimately reinforced the flag 's connection to segregation and racism .Confederate flags no longer enjoy those privileged perches .In fact , over the past few years , white and black southerners have become less tolerant of the public display of the flag , which has relegated its supporters to the sidelines and a much more defensive posture .Last year , the city of Lexington , Virginia , banned the flying of the flag from public fixtures .This past spring , the Museum of the Confederacy opened a new branch at Appomattox that did not include the display of the flag outside its doors .Finally , late last year , the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond removed Confederate flags flying on the grounds of the Confederate Memorial Chapel , which the museum oversees .The museum 's decision led to the creation of a grassroots group called the Virginia Flaggers , but despite daily protests in front of the museum and a social media presence , its efforts have met with no success .The Sons of Confederate Veterans utilized their mailing lists and other resources in response to all three events , but they also have little to show for their efforts .These shifting fault lines suggest that while white and black southerners may tolerate the right of the individual to display the flag on private property , its display on public grounds and at other institutions will be met with suspicion and openly challenged .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.9516"}

{"text": "One of the most commonly - used tests is a biopsy .During a biopsy , a sample of the abnormal area is removed by a needle .The tissue is sent to a pathologist who studies it under a microscope .There are different methods of performing a biopsy ; a physician determines which method is most appropriate .Having a biopsy is not a comfortable procedure .Therefore , a local anesthetic may be used to numb the area .Other diagnostic tools used are magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and ultrasound .Both are painless procedures .An MRI creates strong magnetic fields and radiowaves and an ultrasound uses sound waves to create images of the breasts .It is important that a breast cancer diagnosis does not prevent a patient from acknowledging their other health needs .People do n't just heal physically .Considering the healing components of one 's emotional health is a crucial part of breast cancer treatment .It is normal for a breast cancer patient to feel a variety of upsetting emotions .To begin with , a person may greatly consider their own mortality or that their diagnosis may have negative effects on their family , friends and career .These thoughts can cause an enormous amount of stress , anxiety and depression .Addressing those emotional concerns is very important in the entire treatment process .It is a good idea to seek out professional help when experiencing those strong emotions .A primary care provider offers talk therapy that can make a big difference in changing how one thinks about a breast cancer diagnosis .Understanding those thoughts and concerns are a normal part of dealing with the diagnosis .Relying on good friends and family for support is equally as important ; patients need others for strength and comfort .They should consider cancer support groups , church or spiritual groups or online support communities .Hearing from and talking to others going through the same experience is a good way to communicate one 's fears and struggles .Almost everyone who is diagnosed with cancer could use some type of support , depending on individual personalities .The beginning of a cancer journey can turn one 's world upside down , but understanding what to expect and taking care of the emotional needs experienced during this time is a healthy way to start that journey .It is easy to get frightened by the infections that have made headlines lately ; like the Ebola virus in West Africa or the new enterovirus D68 that is making its way across the Midwest .While the spread of these infections is worrisome , the infection that kills most people in the US each and every year is still influenza and its complication , pneumonia .Influenza alone infects around 60 million people annually in the US and has claimed the lives of thousands of Americans each year ; but has rarely made the headlines .Over 200,000 people each year are hospitalized due to the influenza virus , and of course many more are absent from school and work .This highly contagious virus affects respiratory systems .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.00868"}

Samuel Carrick established Lebanon - in - the - Fork in 1791 , making it the oldest Presbyterian church in Knox County .The church building is gone , but the graveyard is well worth a look .The grave of Carrick 's widow is Knox County 's earliest marked burial , dating to 1793 .Also in the Ramsey plot is a memorial for Reynolds Ramsey , father of Francis and a veteran of the Revolutionary War who was at Trenton and Princeton .J.G.M. remembered his grandfather as a \" tall and graceful \" man who \" never entered a room with his hat on and never retired from it without a graceful bow and a modest and sincere adieu .\" I suspect it was J.G.M. himself , with his interest in history , who made sure his grandfather 's tombstone mentioned his Rev War service .Jeremiah Jack , another Rev War vet buried in the churchyard , was one of Knoxville 's early settlers .Ramsey 's Annals includes a brief account of a canoe trip Jack and another man made to Coyatee to purchase corn from the Cherokees : .They reached Coiatee without interruption .The warriors of that place refused to exchange or sell the corn , and manifested other signs of suspicion , if not of open enmity .They entered the canoe and lifted up some wearing apparel lying in it , and which covered their rifles .This discovery increased the unwillingness of the Indians to trade , and they began to show a disposition to offer violence to their white visitants .The beloved woman , Nancy Ward , was happily present , and was able by her commanding influence to appease their wrath , and to bring about friendly feelings between the parties .The little Indians were soon clad in the home made vestments brought by the traders - the canoe was filled with corn , and the white men started on their return voyage well pleased with the exchange they had made , and especially with the kind offices of the beloved woman .On their return , the white men landed and camped one night , a mile above the mouth of French Broad , on the north bank of the little sluice of that river .Mr. Jack was so well pleased with the place , that he afterwards selected it as his future residence , and actually settled and improved it on his emigration to the present Knox county , in 1787 .A few items relating to the Civil War and the ways we remember it caught my attention lately .First up , when Pope Francis visits Philadelphia , he 'll be speaking behind the same podium Lincoln used to deliver the Gettysburg Address .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.71146"}

{"text": "Electronic cigarettes are battery - powered devices designed to mimic the look and feel of a traditional cigarette without the harmful chemicals released from burning tobacco .Although not highly - publicized , these devices contain nicotine , the same addictive property in cigarettes , in varying amounts , depending on company and brand line .Electronic cigarettes work as a heating element that vaporizes a liquid solution of nicotine and other chemicals to create a cloud of vapor .This vapor is then inhaled the same way tobacco smoke is inhaled with conventional cigarettes .Despite extensive marketing campaigns and an ever - growing consumer population , little is known about the health risks associated with e - cigarettes .These devices currently are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and have not been evaluated for their safety or effectiveness .Additionally , studies on the long - term effects of inhalation of the vapors from e - cigarettes are not available .However , preliminary tests on samples of first - generation electronic cigarettes performed by the FDA have indicated that they contain carcinogens ( cancer - causing agents ) as well as toxins .Based on these limited studies , the FDA has concluded that control processes used in the manufacturing of these devices are \" substandard or non - existent .Many experts have raised concerns about the marketing of these products and the attraction to young people .The tech - friendly designs , attractive flavors , ( e.g. cherry , bubble gum , chocolate ) and ease of availability ( online , convenience stores , vending machines ) make devices like electronic cigarettes appealing to younger demographics .A recent press release from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates the number of calls they have received about e - cigarettes skyrocketed from one call per month in September 2010 to 215 calls in the month of February 2014 alone .More than half of those calls made involved concerns about children under the age of five .According to the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) , poisoning related to the electronic cigarettes liquid occurs in one of three ways : ingestion , inhalation or absorption through the skin and eyes .Ingestion of small amounts of nicotine by an adult can induce nausea and vomiting and could be potentially fatal for a small child .Without official FDA regulations and stringent quality control processes , the safety of electronic cigarettes remains in question .The discovery of carcinogens in e - cigarette samples , many of which are found in tobacco cigarettes , contradicts the claims that these devices are a healthy and safe alternative to smoking .Many major U.S. cities have added e - cigarettes into their clean air laws banning their use in public venues .Currently there are no universally - recognized studies to show that e - cigarettes are any more effective in helping people quit smoking than any tobacco cessation therapies .For individuals who are looking for assistance with trying to quit smoking , the FDA continues to recommend approved nicotine replacement therapies and medications .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.15487"}
{"text": "The Union is n't a coherent whole though - it 's both baby and bath water .Devolution allows us to selectively drain off the bath water and locate more power at Holyrood ( and , hopefully , from there to councils ) .Yes , that 's an entirely valid argument , but it is n't the entire argument .Further devolution lets us discard some of the bathwater - but some we have to keep for ever .It also alows us to keep some of the baby , but not all of it .I think it is fair to say that before too long we are going to end up with either a union under which there is maximal devolution - or independence with a great deal of cooperation .To be honest , there 's not a lot of difference between the two .I think we 've probably taken that metaphor as far as we can , and possibly quite a bit further than is really rational .I do agree there seems to be little difference between the logical progression of devolution and what seems to be the likely end stage of independence negotiations given recent SNP pronouncements and general trends with the EU .And that 's the real key for me - devolution is a gradual , evolutionary process which enables us to proceed at a pace which allows for consideration , reflection and adjustment of things that are working those that are n't .Independence is a big bang approach with a significant level of dislocation and uncertainty which is going to dominate politics to such an extent for such a long time that it will inevitably take time and attention from bread and butter issues .Worse , because it will be negotiated in a febrile haze of heat and light , we 'll inevitably get it wrong .Too much will be left at Westminster with too little Scottish influence and no means of further redress .That 's the real danger .You 're definitely right about the metaphor , and probably right in everything else you say .Devolution can be a process that can have either devo - max or independence as its end point .It would be nice if the unionist parties would trust the people enough to offer them devo - max , since that 's clearly the only position with a solid majority supporting it , but there 's little evidence of that happening right now .We have a common aim here .I 'd be happy with devo - max as a next step , you appear to be happy with it as a destination .We should work together and make it happen - thereafter we can get back to arguing about whether full independence is desirable or not .If a party won an election on the basis of campaigning for those powers they would have little choice .The problem the SNP are having levering more into the Scotland Bill is down to tactical decisions they made - not participating in the drafting process , not really campaigning on further devolution or even independence except to put it behind a referendum .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.468346"}
