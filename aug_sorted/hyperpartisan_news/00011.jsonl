{"text": "Yesterday at the Daily Beast , Lloyd Grove launched a bizarre attack on Rice that accused her of having a personality disorder .The left has also been driving the less personal attacks as well .Howard French said Rice 's Africa legacy is the further empowerment of dictators .Human Rights Watch 's Tom Malinowski knocked Rice for essentially enabling atrocities in Congo .Meanwhile , it should not go unnoticed that Hillary Clinton made her opposition to Rice clear to officials in Washington , which may explain the avalanche of leaks and criticism and personal sniping that came from the left as soon as the battle commenced .[ W]hy did Obama blink ?The reason can only be fear .Next week , Hillary Clinton is supposed to testify before Congress about Libya .There are some indications Clinton may now back out , or resort to insisting on a closed session hidden from the public .Whatever the result , President Obama clearly does not want to give Congress any more high - profile chances to ask someone under oath what happened in the hours and days after Stevens was killed .Rice was at ground zero of the real scandal : not in Benghazi , where the attack occurred ; but in Washington , where the cover - up was planned and executed .Furthermore , Obama probably thought that sacrificing Rice , who still keeps her job as UN ambassador , would assuage some congressional critics and distract from a pending report on what happened in Benghazi .Most importantly , it eliminates the troubling possibility of a Rice confirmation hearing .That likely still would have led to a confirmation victory for Obama - but a pyrrhic one given the ability of most Americans to sniff out a liar .This was certainly a political confrontation , and Obama backed down .But that does n't mean , necessarily , that he lost or that McCain won - at least not on any issue beyond whether Susan Rice will be nominated as secretary of state , something Obama had n't yet done in any event .It does n't necessarily tilt the outcome of any conflict to come .Rice 's withdrawal might even work to Obama 's favor , in the end , if he goes ahead and nominates his presumed second - favorite candidate for the job - Sen .John Kerry .I 've written ( and I 'm far from alone in this view ) that Kerry was always the better choice .Clearly Kerry wants this job ; surely he deserves it .U.N.

{"text": "Palin Is Suddenly Everywhere : What Has Happened .October 4 , 2008 .As an American , I have recently been surrounded at all angles by the financial crisis , both presidential and vice - presidential debates , and already interestingly enough , the ongoing saga of Sarah Palin .So as I tuned in to CNN , passing through images of Wall Street , abandoned houses and OJ Simpson 's Trial , I knew it was only a matter of seconds before I saw Sarah Palin .And when that did in fact become reality , I was completely dumbfounded - not only did I see her , but rather I heard her .What do I mean ?CNN 's routine coverage of a McCain campaign stop in Carson , California showed Palin addressing the public , but not like I was used to .I 'll get to the point - she was n't delivering a stump speech .Yes , a non - stump speech would n't have been such a spectacle at any other campaign event in recent history , but the truth is recent history has never seen Sarah Palin .Although today I will lay off the long saga of Palin herself , I must point out something like this has not only been a rarity in the past few months , but to me shows a turning point in the McCain campaign .Although I believe that Joe Biden won the Vice Presidential debate , I also will point out that Palin did n't lose it .She fought , but was taken captive by Biden 's foreign policy credentials and successful soundbite gambles .But what I think Palin accomplished in the debate gave her more long term firepower than any single thing she has done as running mate for John McCain ( and sorry for the bluntness ) - she is now no longer a joke .If you asked strategists from both the right an the left on the morning of the VP debate , there would be no disputing from them across the board that Sarah Palin has been in the public 's eye a PR ploy .Whether that is what the McCain campaign intended to accomplish is another analysis in itself , but my blunt point here is that the Vice Presidential debate simply changed the way people thought of Palin .She did n't have any coupe - de - grace moments , she did n't gaffe , and she certainly did n't win , but Palin kept up .And in doing that she passed a certain point of public status - from more of a joke and PR stunt to a vice presidential candidate .This will admittedly not change opinions on her policies , especially mine , but as pointed out in a rather comic tone by one of my friends , \" Palin achieved the expectations of stringing together multiple coherent and complete sentences . \"Although that comment was n't exactly correct , it was essentially in the right direction .Palin 's expectations were in fact incredibly low , and because she exceeded them in such a national stage , my guess is that Palin became a valid political figure to many people .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.243187"}

{"text": "And while it might be argued that Obama has had the luxury of keeping ( mostly ) to the high road , by virtue of his lead in the polls , I do n't think that 's fair to him .The fact is , there were some dark days for his team during the primaries , when it looked like Hillary was on a roll .There were some similar dark days in the wake of McCain 's convention bounce and the first wave of enthusiasm for Sarah Palin .Through it all , Obama has remained remarkably consistent .He has run a mostly positive campaign , focused on the issues , focused on challenging the nation to rise above the petty sound - bite politics by which we 've been led around too often .I know it 's not over .This is no time to relax .But I 'm confident that Obama is the right choice .I have no lingering doubts about that .However this chapter in our national history turns out , he is leading us in the right direction .Despite who he is , the weird name and \" exotic \" background and ( of course ) the color of his skin , the country is ready to follow him .I 've been enjoying reading about the Obama field organization lately .So a canvasser goes to a woman 's door in Washington , Pennsylvania .Knocks .Woman answers .Knocker asks who she 's planning to vote for .She is n't sure , has to ask her husband who she 's voting for .Husband is off in another room watching some game .I actually really liked the lead editorial in the Los Angeles Times today .I realize they 're cutting editorial staff left and right to align themselves with the new paradigm , but apparently they still have an editor or two who 's thinking about what it all means .McCain since has tried to cool off his supporters , but he lit this fire - he and no one else is responsible for those who shriek at Palin 's rallies , who proclaim that Obama is an Arab and who wish him harm .This campaign is more crass and more virulent because McCain made it so .That Palin has ended up alienating not only moderates but also conservatives is this race 's enduring irony .On the question of who will best bind up this torn nation , we are far more troubled by what we know about McCain than what we do n't know about Obama .It is proper to admire McCain 's service to his nation - as a military man and as a senator - and he deserves our respect .On the question of who best can reunite us , however , we can not put our faith in a man who has done so much to drive us apart .I do n't know if it 's sincere , or if he 's just playing Good Cop to Palin 's Bad Cop , but McCain apparently made some real effort to tamp down the lynch - mob thing today .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.828575"}

{"text": "Gregory Hicks : Benghazi and the Smearing of Chris Stevens Shifting blame to our dead ambassador is wrong on the facts .By Gregory N. Hicks Jan. 22 , 2014 7:18 p.m. ET .Last week the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence issued its report on the Sept. 11 , 2012 , terrorist attacks in Benghazi , Libya .The report concluded that the attack , which resulted in the murder of four Americans , was \" preventable .\" Some have been suggesting that the blame for this tragedy lies at least partly with Ambassador Chris Stevens , who was killed in the attack .This is untrue : The blame lies entirely with Washington .The report states that retired Gen. Carter Ham , then - commander of the U.S. Africa Command ( Africom ) headquartered in Stuttgart , Germany , twice offered to \" sustain \" the special forces security team in Tripoli and that Chris twice \" declined . \"Since Chris can not speak , I want to explain the reasons and timing for his responses to Gen. Ham .As the deputy chief of mission , I was kept informed by Chris or was present throughout the process .On Aug. 1 , 2012 , the day after I arrived in Tripoli , Chris invited me to a video conference with Africom to discuss changing the mission of the U.S. Special Forces from protecting the U.S. Embassy and its personnel to training Libyan forces .This change in mission would result in the transfer of authority over the unit in Tripoli from Chris to Gen. Ham .In other words , the special forces would report to the Defense Department , not State .Chris wanted the decision postponed but could not say so directly .Chris had requested on July 9 by cable that Washington provide a minimum of 13 American security professionals for Libya over and above the diplomatic security complement of eight assigned to Tripoli and Benghazi .On July 11 , the Defense Department , apparently in response to Chris 's request , offered to extend the special forces mission to protect the U.S. Embassy .However , on July 13 , State Department Undersecretary Patrick Kennedy refused the Defense Department offer and thus Chris 's July 9 request .His rationale was that Libyan guards would be hired to take over this responsibility .Because of Mr. Kennedy 's refusal , Chris had to use diplomatic language at the video conference , such as expressing \" reservations \" about the transfer of authority .Chris 's concern was significant .Transferring authority would immediately strip the special forces team of its diplomatic immunity .Moreover , the U.S. had no status of forces agreement with Libya .He explained to Rear Adm. Charles J. Leidig that if a member of the special forces team used weapons to protect U.S. facilities , personnel or themselves , he would be subject to Libyan law .The law would be administered by judges appointed to the bench by Moammar Gadhafi or , worse , tribal judges .Chris described an incident in Pakistan in 2011 when an American security contractor killed Pakistani citizens in self - defense , precipitating a crisis in U.S.-Pakistani relations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.81906"}
