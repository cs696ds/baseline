{"text": "17 Most writers agreed that Acheson had not given \" away state secrets \" and had said \" nothing new . \"18According to John W. Spanier , Acheson was .only verbalizing the basic American strategy of total war , ... that had not calculated on ... a less than all - out challenge by a Soviet satellite in Asia against an American friend , whose strategic importance was not \" worth \" the price of total war .In short , it was not American words but American policy that probably encouraged the Communists to believe that the United States would not defend South Korea .Certainly , historians had concluded that many US leaders shared blame for the failure to show a stronger commitment to South Korea 's survival .20 This policy , according to Korean historian Kim Chum - kon , invited North Korea to launch its invasion and therefore constituted appeasement .For thirty years , the consensus remained firmly in place that the United States gave North Korea the \" green light \" to invade South Korea .In 1982 , East Asian expert Claude A. Buss wrote that Acheson 's speech was \" virtually tantamount to an invitation \" for Communist aggression .Buss perceptively added , however , that the address reflected the Truman administration 's search for an effective policy in postwar Asia : .Far from abandoning the ROK , Secretary Acheson called for a much broader defense than the United States could provide on its own .In directing attention to the nonmilitary factors in security and to the need for nonmilitary measures to solve problems stemming from the expansion of communism , he voiced ideas which , if heeded , might have avoided many of the most bitter consequences of Korea - and Vietnam .Buss reiterated that although Acheson 's speech included the \" first clear - cut statement on a United States defense perimeter in Asia , \" it only confirmed a long - standing military strategy .Nevertheless , it was \" certainly an unwise and unskilled diplomatic maneuver to broadcast it openly to the world . \"22 Bevin Alexander agreed , arguing that the North Koreans concluded that the United States would not act to save South Korea .\" The mistake they made , \" he writes , \" was to believe \" the public pronouncements of US leaders .Release of classified US documents on policy toward Korea after World War II revived debate about whether the Acheson speech provided a \" green light \" for North Korea 's invasion .William Stueck pointed to the Press Club speech as a prime example of how US \" actions did not fall into a consistent pattern that conveyed a deep American commitment \" to South Korea .More public demonstrations of strong US support \" might have served as warning signals to the Kremlin . \" 24 Robert J. Donovan agreed , claiming that although Kim Il Sung already had developed his plans for invading South Korea before Acheson 's speech , \" it made Kim and Stalin and Mao more confident that the venture could succeed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.51725"}

Truman 's agreement to divide the peninsula forty years later at the end of World War II .Release of Soviet documents during recent years has removed any doubt that North Korea planned and initiated the Korean War with the reluctant endorsement of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin .North Korea 's leader Kim Il Sung had begun to press the Soviet Union to support an invasion shortly after creation of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( DPRK ) in September 1948 .But Stalin withheld approval until April 1950 mainly because he feared that the United States would intervene militarily , thereby risking escalation into a major war involving the Soviet Union .The reaction of shock and panic in the ROK to Acheson 's exclusion of South Korea from the American defensive perimeter has been well - documented .Still unresolved , however , is the far more important question of the impact of the National Press Club speech on Joseph Stalin , Mao Zedong , and Kim Il Sung .This article presents evidence from recently released Soviet documents that Acheson 's address had little if any impact on Communist deliberations .Stalin worried about US military intervention until the moment the Korean War began .Moreover , he feared that North Korea could not survive an attack that he was certain South Korea would stage in the future .His approval of Kim Il Sung 's plan was a mistake , but it derived more from a sense of weakness rather than strength .There were two primary motivating factors behind Acheson 's delivery of the National Press Club speech .First , the Truman administration was trying to implement a new China policy after the victory of the Communists in the Chinese Civil War .By late 1949 , Truman and Acheson had decided that the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) would launch an invasion of Taiwan in the near future to destroy the last remnants of Jiang Jieshi 's government . 1 The president announced his determination to remain uninvolved in the Chinese Civil War on 5 January 1950 , explaining that while the United States would continue economic aid to Taiwan , US military aid and advice would cease .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.44802"}

{"text": "Relying on as yet unreleased documents , Soviet scholar Evgueni Bajanov emphasizes that a desire to avoid war with the United States dominated Stalin 's thinking about Korea : .Until the end of 1949 Stalin did not plan any aggression against South Korea .Instead he was worried about an attack from the South , and did everything to avoid provoking Washington and Seoul .In 1947 - 1948 Soviet leaders still believed in the possibility of a unification of Korea , .... 39 [ emphasis added ] .However , Kim Il Sung , within months after the creation of the DPRK , had begun to press Stalin for approval of an attack on South Korea .Preparatory to an invasion , Kim Il Sung proposed in January 1949 signing a Soviet - North Korean Treaty of Friendship and Alliance .Stalin rejected the idea , arguing that it would receive world condemnation for perpetuating Korea 's division .But he no doubt also was refusing an obligation to defend the DPRK if Kim initiated a war and the United States intervened .Shtykov played a key role in causing Stalin to be cautious and skeptical in how he reacted to Kim Il Sung 's lobbying for an invasion .Starting early in 1949 , he began reporting a growing number of military clashes at the 38th parallel , complaining bitterly that North Korea \" did not have enough trained personnel , adequate weapons and sufficient numbers of bullets to rebuff intensifying incursions from the South .\" When Kim Il Sung headed a delegation that visited Moscow to secure expanded economic assistance , Stalin made it clear that he would not sanction the DPRK provoking a war in Korea .In their meeting on 5 March , Stalin agreed to provide North Korea with Soviet technical trainers and between $ 40 and 50 million in credit to buy imports , as well as promising cultural exchanges .But he then issued a blunt warning to Kim Il Sung : \" The 38th parallel must be peaceful .It is very important .\" It was the right time to attack because the Korean People 's Army ( KPA ) was stronger than South Korea 's army , guerrilla forces would support the invasion , and the southern people hated the Rhee regime .Stalin firmly rejected Kim Il Sung 's request , explaining that the United States likely would intervene because it would view an attack on the south as violating its agreement with the Soviet Union establishing the division at the 38th parallel , thereby igniting a major war .Moreover , US troops still were deployed in the south and the KPA was weaker than its adversary in South Korea .Stalin said that Kim could not invade until he gained \" overwhelming superiority . \" \" Does it mean that there is no chance to reunify Korea in the near future ? , \" Kim Il Sung persisted .\" Our people are very anxious to be together again and to cast off the yoke of the reactionary regime and their American masters .\" Stalin , according to Kim , then predicted that a North Korean invasion was \" not necessary \" because South Korea would strike first , thus allowing Pyongyang to portray its offensive as a counterattack .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.32654"}

{"text": "Former US basketball star Dennis Rodman has led a team of retired American players in a game to celebrate the birthday of the North Korean leader Kim Jong - Un .The match in North Korean capital Pyongyang is described by organisers as a \\\"birthday present\\ \" for Mr Kim , who attended along with his wife .American basketball players led by former National Basketball Association star Dennis Rodman trained with young North Koreans on Tuesday , the day before an exhibition match scheduled to mark the birthday of North Korea\\ 's leader .Former NBA stars including Charles D. Smith , Doug Christie , and Vin Ba .Recorded on January 7 , 2013 .Rodman experienced an unhappy childhood and was shy and introverted in his early years .After aborting a suicide attempt in 1993 , he reinvented himself as a \" bad boy \" and became notorious for numerous controversial antics .He dyed his hair in artificial colors , presented himself with many piercings and tattoos and regularly disrupted games by clashing with opposing players and officials .He famously wore a wedding dress to promote his autobiography .Rodman pursued a high - profile affair with singer Madonna and was briefly married to actress Carmen Electra .Amid increasingly combative rhetoric from Pyongyang , Adm. Samuel Locklear , commander of U.S. Pacific Command , said North Korea 's pursuit of nuclear weapons and long - range ballistic missiles represents a clear threat to the United States and its allies in the region .The admiral said Kim Jong Un , the country 's young and still relatively untested new leader , remains unpredictable after using the past year to consolidate his power .But Locklear told the Senate Armed Services Committee that he was confident that the U.S. military can thwart North Korea if it chooses to act .He made clear that any U.S. decision would be contingent on where the missile is headed , information that the U.S. could ascertain fairly quickly .\" Do we have the capability to intercept a missile if the North Koreans launch within the next several days ? \"Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz . , asked the admiral .\" We do , \" Locklear answered .He said North Korea is keeping a large percentage of its combat forces along the demilitarized zone with South Korea , a position that allows the North to threaten U.S. and South Korean civilian and military personnel .McCain said the saber - rattling of today struck him as the greatest tension between North Korea , South Korea and the U.S. since the end of the Korean War in the early 1950s .\" I would agree that in my recollection I do n't know a greater time , \" the 58-year - old Locklear said .Increasingly bellicose rhetoric has come from Pyongyang and its leader , with North Korea urging foreign companies and tourists to leave South Korea and warning that the countries are on the verge of a nuclear war .At the White House , spokesman Jay Carney brushed off the North 's declaration that nuclear war was imminent as \" more unhelpful rhetoric \" and part of a pattern of combative statements and behavior that Pyongyang 's leadership has demonstrated for years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.99893"}
