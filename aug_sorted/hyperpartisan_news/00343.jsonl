{"text": "Clinton has a big lead in the polls nationally - but those poll numbers will change .The polls in Iowa reflect the real race when people are closely paying attention to the candidates .In Iowa she has a slight lead .That is likely what her national numbers will reflect in about two months .While she is winning wide support in nationwide samples among Democrats in the race for their party 's presidential nomination , half of likely voters nationwide said they would never vote for New York Sen. Hillary Clinton , a new Zogby Interactive poll shows .The online survey of 9,718 likely voters nationwide showed that 50 % said Clinton would never get their presidential vote .This is up from 46 % who said they could never vote for Clinton in a Zogby International telephone survey conducted in early March .I am constantly amazed at the bigotry of the so called \" progressives \" .A number of responders here used this platform to take gratuitous swipes at Christians .I have news for you anti - Christian bigots out there , yes Christians believe in moral absolutes .But Christians also recognize that all human beings , including Christians , fail to live up to those absolutes ( the old fashioned term is \" sin \" ) .True Christianity also believes in grace , forgiveness and redemption .As a Christian , I am willing to give private citizens Bill and Hillary the benefit of the doubt as to the genuineness of his repentance and her motives for forgiving him .And I 'm not willing to accept the false argument that recognizing human failing and believing in forgiveness means that we can never make societal judgments about behavior .Actually , it 's the bigoted and hate - filled comments from the moral relativists which frighten me .Remember the lessons of history .It was Christians who were not afraid to call \" slavery \" evil and who led the abolition movement of the 19th century , when the \" progressives \" of the day accepted \" white superiority \" as the natural order .It was the \" enlightened \" atheistic and Social Darwinist philosophers of Europe , not Christians , who paved the way for the rise of fascism , totalitarianism and the Holocaust .I ask you , which philosophy is more dangerous ?I thought marriage is suppose to be so scared in America .Here is a woman who decided to stay with her husband after he cheated because she still loves him and believes marriage to one person for the rest of her life is a GOOD thing .I do not understand all the hating about this from most of the comments .Is not forgiveness a virtue ? ? ?Or are most of you just hating Hillary no matter what she says or does ? ? ?I feel you all need to do a reality check .A lot of us do not feel when something goes wrong in a relationship , that that is the time to run ; at least half of us feel that you stay and work on issues and resolve them if you can .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.08006"}
