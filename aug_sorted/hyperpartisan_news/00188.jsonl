{"text": "What can be done to stop it from occurring again ?What are our options ?Questions I 've asked myself over and over again , and slowly developed my own realistic answers which would have to happen .The first question : why not just outright ban guns ?The simple answer , you ca n't .The more complex answer , you are virtually asking for the entire restructuring of America .The first step that would have to happen is people who comply with the laws would turn in their guns .You have to follow this up by going after registered owners who have not turned in their weapons .Then comes the very hard truth ; be forced by authorities for being allowed to search your house for any guns , regardless if you were an owner or not .If you are going to ban guns , they must all be confiscated , which means a house to house , building to building search .There are no other ways around this ; it would have to be done .If the searching was n't bad enough , the entire boarder of Mexico and Canada would have to be shut down and every single import shipping container would have to be checked to prevent the already huge illegal arms trade .We already have difficulty enough just trying to stop the drugs and illegal crossings , so good luck getting the political will for a virtual customs blockade .So what do we do to prevent this tragedy from happening again ?Realistically , we ca n't .You ca n't stop lunacy or evil .It 's everywhere , every continent , every country , down to every city .Unless you want to completely wipe out the human race or figure out a drug that devoids us of emotions , the only responsible answer I can think of is free reign on concealed carry .What I mean by \" free reign \" is if you are licensed and have been trained to discreetly carry a gun , you are allowed to carry anywhere , anytime , regardless of circumstance .Of course , a yearly refresher course on training as well as a conversation with a police officer or some other authority figure to verify you are sane and are still able to carry your person would be required .As sadistic as this may come , you ca n't stop the attempt , but you can minimize the losses .Quoting Airstud ( Reply 4 ): The NRA has actually gotten stronger in the aftermath of Sandy Hook , not weaker .Let me first say that I have no idea whether that 's the case or not .I do n't have the necessary insight .However , on a more general note - when institutions radicalise , they appear to get stronger on first sight because they have a firmer grip on their core constituents , many of whom may be radicals themselves .People rally around the institution , and it appears to be on the upsurge .What really happens , however , is that the more numerous and probably more important people at the fringes turn away from the institution because they 're increasingly alienated .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.293434"}

{"text": "My own guess is that the people in Congress who voted for it probably held differing opinions .On the one hand , the ' United States ' at that time consisted only of the original 13 states , strung along the Atlantic coast .They had the British in Canada to the north , the Spanish in Florida and Texas to the south , and the French controlling the Mississippi to the west , and most of the Great Lakes .Plus a lot of ' Indian country ' between them and the French .On the other hand they only had a small population , and very limited scope for the sort of taxation required to build and maintain a large standing army .And the War of Independence had largely been won not by ' regular soldiers ' but by self - motivated groups that we would nowadays term ' freedom fighters . 'So there was every reason to fear invasion by one or other of the neighbouring ' great powers ' - and therefore to encourage people to arm themselves and form ' militia units ' on their own initiative ( and at their own expense ) .The second ' angle ' was that there were quite a few people in the newly - established USA who still had close links to Britain - so there was a clear risk that there might be some sort of internal ' counter - revolution . 'In which case a loyal ' citizen army ' that armed and trained itself at its own expense , and was prepared to fight again if necessary , could have proved to be a useful asset .So - in my opinion anyway - the Second Amendment was a very sensible measure back in those days .But it has no useful purpose nowadays .And it has resulted in a situation where there are now almost as many guns in private hands in the United States as there are men , women , and children .And more ' gun deaths ' per head of population per annum than any other halfway - civilised nation on earth .......... .The only answer is a proper , country - wide , system of licensing and permits .Even that will take years to establish itself and make progress towards preventing nutcases getting hold of guns .But it 's high time that it was introduced .The United States has the strongest and best - armed military in the world - a thing for which all of us have had cause to be grateful on many occasions .But , seems to me , there is no need whatever for it to have any sort of ' well - regulated militia ' any more ....... .Quoting NAV20 ( Reply 148 ): The only answer is a proper , country - wide , system of licensing and permits .Even that will take years to establish itself and make progress towards preventing nutcases getting hold of guns .But it 's high time that it was introduced .The United States has the strongest and best - armed military in the world - a thing for which all of us have had cause to be grateful on many occasions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.23346"}

'The Federal Reserve did have some opposition ; those who saw what the future would become if banking was outside of the government 's hands , the rates set by a private company such as the Fed .All the wealthy and powerful men the Jesuits wanted to get rid of were invited to take the cruise .Three of the richest and most important of these were Benjamin Guggenheim , Isador Strauss , the head of Macy 's Department Stores , and John Jacob Astor , probably the wealthiest man in the world .Their total wealth , at that time , using dollar values of their day was more than 500 million dollars .Today that amount of money would be worth nearly eleven billion dollars .These three men were coaxed and encouraged to board the floating palace .They had to be destroyed because the Jesuits knew they would use their wealth and influence to oppose a Federal Reserve Bank as well as the various wars that were being planned .It can also be mentioned that J.P. Morgan , the individual contracted to build the Titanic was scheduled to be on the maiden voyage , but canceled .A Jesuit tempore co - adjutor was picked to captain the ship , a man that would do anything for the order and God 's will ; Captain Edward Smith .Quite possibly the most experienced captain of the time , Smith had navigated the waters of the Atlantic for 26 years , a master of the icy waters that the Titanic would be sailing .He was a Jesuit and worked for J.P. Morgan .As National Geographic stated in their 1986 documentary entitilted ' The Secrets of the Titanic , ' \" Anyone could be a Jesuit and their identity not be known .\" When the ship departed southern England , on board was Father Francis Browne .He was the most powerful Jesuit in all of Ireland and the Jesuit Master of Edward Smith .Here is Jesuit treachery at its finest .The provincial Father Francis Browne boards the Titanic , photographs the victims , most assuredly briefs the Captain concerning his oath as a Jesuit , and the following morning bids him farewell .( Eric J. Phelps , Vatican Assassins Halcon Unified Services ) .Theorists believe that the mysteries surrounding the sinking of the Titanic are simply too coincidental not to be premeditated .Smith , being a mater navigator of the Atlantic , allegedly sailed directly into iceberg territory , failing to heed the numerous warnings given by other ships to decrease speed , and tread carefully .The glancing blow to the side of the Titanic is also said to violate basic safety measurements associated with sailing .Danger is meant to be met head on to avoid exactly what happened to the Titanic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "124.14633"}
