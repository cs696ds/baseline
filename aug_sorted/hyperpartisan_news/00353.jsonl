Lawrence in New York , which he said was a \" great research firm \" on Wall Street .Those were the days before the Internet when good equity research was at a premium in the market .Cyrus Lawrence was later acquired by Morgan Grenfell , a merchant bank in the United Kingdom , which in turn was bought by Deutsche Bank Group .Murren rose to managing director and director of equity research for Deutsche Bank , and ended up working on Wall Street for 14 years , many from an office in a Gothic - style building at 115 Broadway , overlooking the once - looming twin towers of the World Trade Center .In 1998 , he accepted a post as chief financial officer at MGM .He became chief operating officer in 2007 and then chairman and chief executive officer in 2008 .While working on Wall Street , Murren also met Heather Hay , who was group chief for global consumer products equity research at Merrill Lynch .Murren and Hay have now been married 22 years and they have two sons , ages 17 and 14 .James Murren speaks at a press conference in August at the MassMutual Center to announce the casino operator 's plans for Springfield .As a college student , Murren traveled to the building in the early 1980s to see concerts when it was called the Springfield Civic Center .The Republican photo by Mark M.

Pete King , and the Chairwoman of the subcommittee on Intelligence , Rep. Sue Myrick , have considered CAIR an extremist Islamist organization .There are bills introduced in the US House of Representatives calling for identifying the Muslim Brotherhood as a Terror organization .CAIR stood with the oppressive regimes against Christians and other sectors of civil societies and backed the genocidal regime of Sudan headed by the ICC indicted General Omar Bashir .CAIR backs the Muslim Brotherhood , who in Egypt has been responsible for attacks against Christian Copts and in Libya backed the Jihadi forces responsible for violence against civilians .But even more dangerous , CAIR politically backs the Islamists and the Jihadists who in Syria and in Iraq have persecuted Christians .Some of these factions joined the Islamic State known as ISIS , which has perpetrated war crimes and crimes against Humanity in Mosul , the Nineveh Plain , and Sinjar against Christians and Yazidis .CAIR and its executive director Nihad Awad have been notorious for suppressing educational programs , both in the public and private sectors , aimed at informing the American public about the persecution of Christian minorities in the Greater Middle East .Awad and his acolytes have politically harassed writers and intellectuals , academics who have been raising the issue of persecution of religious minorities and have become the main obstructers of truth about this persecution .In a sense , Awad and CAIR , by being supportive of the Jihadists and the Islamists and by suppressing the voices defending the persecuted Christians , actually bear some moral responsibility for the persecution and violence against Christians in the Middle East .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.86633"}

{"text": "CAIR , which claims to be a mainstream \" religious community service organization , \" is widely known to be a terror sponsor and a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - itself the wellspring from which all global Sunni Muslim terror organizations flow .They were named by federal prosecutors in 2007 as an \" unindicted co - conspirator \" in a Hamas funding case connected with the Holy Land Foundation trial .Hamas has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government since 2007 .According to federal prosecutors , Abdullah was a radical Islamist intent upon overthrowing the U.S. government .In July of 2009 , U.S. District Judge Jorge A. Solis supported CAIR 's request to strike its name from documents listing it as an unindicted co - conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation case .While Solis is often portrayed as having been critical of CAIR ( sometimes even being credited with publicly outing the CAIR - Hamas connection ) , the fact that he essentially acted on the organization 's behalf is evident in his order .Then , in October of 2010 , the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the Justice Department had violated the Fifth Amendment rights of CAIR and another Muslim advocacy organization by including them on the publicly filed co - conspirator list in the case .The pressing question here is how the government got from the firm belief in CAIR as a terror supporter to practically being an advocate for their so - called civil rights .I believe it is high time we expose the irresponsibility , incompetence and/or corruption in such instances - no matter where the trail leads .It is n't enough for Americans to be outraged time and again at the fact that our courts and government officials pay inordinate deference to malignant , subversive organizations and let it go at that .Judges are , of course , quite adept at crafting their rulings , opinions and orders to appear legally iron clad and rhetorically cogent , even if their premises are dramatically flawed .In the interest of expedience , we wo n't attempt to unravel those right now .In the interest of accountability and future reference , however , we can look at the justices involved in this case .Jorge Solis of the 5th Circuit Court is a George H.W. Bush appointee .Appeals Court Judges Emilio Garza , Fortunato Benavides and Marcia Crone entered the 2010 opinion .Garza , who wrote the opinion , is also a George H.W. Bush appointee .Justice Benavides was appointed to the court by Bill Clinton , and Crone by George W. Bush .On the other hand , it would not be the first time that even mainstream government officials ( including judges , who have political allegiances even though they 're not supposed to ) insisted upon treating suspect individuals , governments , or organizations as legitimate , law - abiding contemporaries .This , of course , lends credence to the argument ( some claim \" conspiracy theory \" ) that militant Islamic organizations are being deftly manipulated by globalists against America in their own bid for supremacy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.33631"}

{"text": "During merger discussions last week , Mr. Lay told Dynegy 's chairman , Charles L. Watson , that he wanted to rework the severance package , Mr. Palmer said .On Monday , Mr. Watson disclosed that Mr. Lay wanted much of the severance to be in the form of stock options .By yesterday afternoon , Enron officials were saying that Mr. Lay planned to take two - thirds of the severance in stock or other noncash compensation .And , they said , he wanted to give half of that amount , or one - third of his total package , to establish a charitable foundation to benefit Enron employees .It was about an hour later that Enron said Mr. Lay would give up the severance entirely .Mr. Lay has not decided whether to accept an invitation to be on the board of the combined company , which will be called Dynegy .The deal could still fall victim to antitrust objections or disclosures of further financial problems at Enron .Whether Mr. Lay 's gesture will placate Enron 's traders , who are now deluging other energy - trading companies with resumes , remains to be seen .Dynegy is known as a much more conservative firm than Enron , and analysts renewed their concerns yesterday about the cultural clash draining the talent , and value , from the combined company . ''So much of their top talent is going out the door , I do n't know what Dynegy gets , ' ' said a senior executive at another rival firm .The stunning near - collapse of Enron -- bankruptcy was only averted , some analysts say , by the Dynegy acquisition -- closes a chapter on one of the most influential careers in the history of the energy business .The ugly circumstances of Enron 's downfall , including the revelation that partnerships were used to move debt off the company 's balance sheet and that Enron overstated profits in the last five years by almost $ 600 million , have left Mr. Lay 's reputation in tatters .Just months ago , Mr. Lay was widely hailed -- or decried , in some circles -- as the genius behind energy deregulation .His friend , George W. Bush , had been elected president , and policies favored by Enron were front and center in the administration 's energy policy .Mr. Lay retired from day - to - day management , making plans to pursue new business interests .But he again assumed the chief executive 's post at Enron in August , after the unexpected resignation of his handpicked successor , Jeffrey K. Skilling , and the accounting problems swiftly unfolded in the weeks that followed .On Monday , Mr. Lay said he might revive the business plans he set aside during the summer , but he declined to say what those plans were .Even without the severance package , Mr. Lay has become enormously wealthy running Enron .All told , from 1989 through this year , Mr. Lay collected about $ 13 million in salary ( his exact salary for this year is not known ) and $ 26.8 million in cash bonuses .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.64061"}
