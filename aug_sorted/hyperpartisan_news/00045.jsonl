Kelly And Usher Get Played By The ' Same Girl ' .R. Kelly and Usher have both been called the King of R&B. Now it turns out they have more in common than just that : The same woman has been calling them her lover .The singers ' first duet , \" Same Girl , \" hit the Internet Wednesday night .On the track , Kells and Ush find out they 've been played .The record is in the form of a conversation between the two , during which the stars discover the truth and ultimately conspire to call the lady out on her lies .Kelly starts off describing his fictitious girlfriend , who he is madly in love with and wants to marry .She lives in Atlanta , drives a black Durango and has a tattoo on her ankle .Usher then interjects , giving his own set of details about the woman : She works for TBS , has a child and went to Georgia Tech University .A stunned Pied Piper confirms everything , to Usher 's dismay . \"So man , you telling me you know her ? \"Kelly asks . \"Do I know her ?Like a pastor knows his Word , \" Usher responds .In the song , it turns out Usher met the woman at a party in Atlanta , while Kelly met her at a party in Chicago .\" I even got some pictures on my phone , \" Usher later sings .\" Looka there , there she is with some boy - shorts on , \" R. responds .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.42399"}

Raymond ( Part I ) .In Georgia , there are two types of custody involved whenever couples with children are divorcing : physical custody and legal custody .Physical custody is exactly what it sounds like .It is the physical possession of the child or children .Legal custody is the possession of the ability to legally represent the child 's or children 's interests .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.725174"}

Usher and his attorney , Ivory Brown , may be involved in a personal relationship .j. Many news outlets that had carried daily coverage of the trial suddenly ceased to do so during the presentation of Tameka 's case .k. On Friday , less than twenty - four hours after the closing arguments in the case , Usher called Tameka and bragged about winning the case .\" How does it feel to lose custody of your children ? \"Usher taunted .\" One day , I will tell my boys that they once had a mother , \" he told Tameka .Usher did not know that Tameka was apparently recording his statements .How It Will Be : What Will Happen if .Usher Wins Custody ?In Georgia , there exists no legal authority allowing a court to grant sole or even primary physical custody of children to an absentee parent based upon the fact that the parent can afford to pay for a childcare support system for the children .If Usher wins sole custody of his children , this case will be the first .It will set a precedent , which means that it will establish a rule of law that all other cases must follow .And , that rule of law would state that a person who claims to reside in Georgia can simply buy or purchase custody of his or her children .And , inversely , a person in Georgia could lose custody of his or her children if he or she is unable to buy or purchase a childcare support system designed to be a surrogate caretaker .Such a rule , of course , sounds preposterous , but it is exactly the effect of a ruling in Usher 's favor on his custody petition .God help us all .Update : TMZ is reporting : .Usher just got bitch - slapped in court - a judge has ordered him to REOPEN his ex - wife 's Saks Fifth Avenue credit card in his name ... after the singer closed the account last year .The closed Saks card was just one of Tameka Raymond 's many grievances in her ongoing custody fight against Usher - and now , the court has taken her side ... holding the singer in contempt for pulling the plug on her fancy charge account .Tameka claims she needs the account to do her job as a stylist .As for the other grievances - Tameka said Usher owed her cash for the nanny bill ... and continually failed to keep her in the loop about where and when he traveled with the kids .The court agreed ... and awarded Tameka $ 1,300 for the nanny .While the judge in this case has not ruled on Usher Raymond 's request to gain sole custody of the children , her order has set the tone for what can be expected .She found the singer in willful violation of Tameka 's claim as it related to the handling of the children 's travel arrangements and the language in the order is very telling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.1658"}

{"text": "Despite continuous rumors and reports that the parties had settled or were near settlement , the case was tried before a judge over a three - month period , ending on Thursday .I initially intended to publish a celebrity journalistic piece about the juicy details of this case of which the average reader was unaware .But , as I delved deep into my research of the facts and the legal issues involved , I quickly realized it was much more important for me to write an investigative news feature and review .The reason ?The results of this custody case will not only affect Usher and Tameka , but could also affect every other parent in Georgia .How It Was : Custody of the .Children in Raymond v. Raymond ( Part I ) .In Georgia , there are two types of custody involved whenever couples with children are divorcing : physical custody and legal custody .Physical custody is exactly what it sounds like .It is the physical possession of the child or children .Legal custody is the possession of the ability to legally represent the child 's or children 's interests .For instance , a person who does not have legal custody of their child can not grant consent to any medical care for the child or can not authorize their child to enroll in any school or government program .In cases involving joint physical and joint legal custody , it is imperative that the parents have the ability to cooperate and communicate effectively with one another sans animosity or acrimony that can affect co - parenting .When Usher and Tameka divorced in October 2009 , they entered into a settlement agreement regarding the custody of their children , two - year - old Usher V , and one - year - old Naviyd Ely .Usher and Tameka agreed to share physical custody of the children , equally splitting the holidays but with Usher having the children twelve days per month and Tameka having the children eighteen days per the month .Usher 's monthly days are not pre - determined : he simply has to give Tameka forty - eight hours notice whenever he wanted to exercise his custodial time with the children .The custody agreement between Usher and Tameka also dictated that the person who did not have physical custody of the children at the time would be given telephone access to the children daily .On August 20th 2012 , Judge Lane held the singer in contempt of court for violating this provision .In addition to sharing physical custody , Usher and Tameka also agreed to share legal custody of the children .Although they would share legal custody , Usher and Tameka agree to Usher having final decision - making authority over any disagreements involving the children 's education , religion , medical care and extra - curricular activities .How It Is : Custody of the Children .Under Usher 's and Tameka 's Current Agreement .Both Usher and Tameka agree that the current joint custody arrangement is not working - - but , for different reasons .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.807335"}

{"text": "Both of them presented witnesses and documents in support of their claims .What Was Revealed During Usher 's Case .Usher presented the testimony of five witnesses .The first witness , Dr. Barrie Alexander , was the psychologist that the judge had appointed to conduct psychological evaluations of both Usher and Tameka .Prior to the psychologist 's testimony , Usher 's attorneys asked to confer with the judge and with Tameka 's attorneys outside the audible presence of the public .After conferring , the judge issued an order barring the public and the media from the courtroom .Thus , I did not observe the testimony of this witness .See video of media being booted from courtroom .Usher 's second witness was Daniel Bloom , the guardian ad litem appointed by the judge .A guardian ad litem is a person who is appointed by the judge to represent the interests of the children in a custody action .The guardian ad litem is obligated to conduct a thorough investigation of any significant issues raised in a custody action that may have an affect on the best interests of the children .This usually requires the guardian ad litem to talk to the children 's teachers , caregivers , doctors , and to review any documents pertaining to the children 's welfare .At the conclusion of his or her investigation , the guardian ad litem is expected to recommend which person he or she believes should awarded custody of the children .The guardian ad litem in this case recommended that Usher be granted custody of the children .Upon hearing this , my first thought was , \" It 's a done deal .Why is Tameka wasting the judge 's time fighting this ? \"But , when Tameka 's attorney , Lisa West , began cross - examining the guardian ad litem , I understood .Under cross - examination , the guardian ad litem testified that that there appeared to be a loving bond between Tameka and the children and that Tameka was affectionate with the children and they with her .Under further cross - examination , the guardian ad litem admitted not knowing that Usher had acknowledged that he also resided in New York and was present in Atlanta only part of the time .The guardian ad litem further admitted that Usher had not given him his nannies ' timesheets so that the guardian ad litem could determine how much time the children were being cared for by Usher 's nannies .The non - consideration of these fundamental facts by the guardian ad litem was simply inexplicable .I was astounded .Usher also presented the testimony of Jacqueline Martin , a recent short - term nanny of Tameka 's .Ms. Martin appeared to be no more than nineteen or twenty years old .Ms. Martin testified that , unbeknownst to Tameka , she had begun conversing with Usher about Tameka 's parenting and had even visited Usher at his home .Although she testified that Tameka appeared to spend little time with her children , Ms. Martin admitted on cross - examination that she only worked for Tameka a few hours a day for a few months .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.87482"}
