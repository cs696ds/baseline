{"text": "Click here for additional information .British law is significantly more forward thinking in regard to maternity and paternity leave than statutes in the States , first because it even includes fathers in the equation .In the U.S. , there is no nationwide , federally subsidized paternity leave policy , though a few states , like California , offer one .The Family Medical Leave Act only requires employees of a certain size to offer 12 weeks of unpaid leave to new mothers and fathers .In other words , your job will be protected during the time you take off to be with your new child , but you wo n't be compensated for it , at least not by the United States government .As for U.S. companies providing the perk on their own accord , a recent article in Forbes reports that only 13 % of companies do so .As Jessica Grose writes on Slate 's Double XFactor , tech companies across the board offer the best policies Facebook , Google , Instagram , Microsoft , Reddit , Pinterest , Twitter , and Yahoo .( Yahoo made news in April when it began offering men eight weeks of paid paternity leave , half that of what women can take on maternity leave . )Reddit , with less than twenty - five employees , is n't is n't federally required to provide paternity leave at all , but has chosen to do so - very cool .Policies in Britain are significantly more robust than in the States .Under a 2003 law , all men are guaranteed two weeks of paid leave .( The military will give Prince William his full pay for that period , though the law only requires employees get about 137 pounds , which is about $ 206 . )According to CBS News , only two - thirds of British men take some paternity leave , and less than half actually take the full two weeks .The case is the same here in the States , sadly .As I 've written about before , many American men who have the option of taking paternity also decide not to do it .Hey , blokes we 're only talking about two weeks !( Or should I say a fortnight ? )That 's not very long at all .The laws in England are changing to become even better for new dads , as they can now share some of their wive 's paid maternity leave ( women get 39 weeks , not at full salary ) .And Parliament is discussing expanding this to 50 weeks of leave which both parents can split .Though how many will choose to take it ?I hope that British men follow the lead of Prince William and spend at least those first , precious few weeks of their new child 's life at home with their family .I 'd also like to see the prince spend some time with Prince George on solo - dad duty .Even a short amount of time as primary caregiver leaves a big , lasting impact on father and child !", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.65528"}
