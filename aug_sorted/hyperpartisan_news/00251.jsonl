{"text": "This weekend I attended a symposium on the Law of Democracy at Stanford University .The schedule is here .Below I give live highlights of selected parts of the program , including : .February 6th , 2016 , 12:54pm by Sam Wang .Update , post - primary : Sanders outperformed his final New Hampshire polling margin by about four percentage points .That is interesting , but not out of bounds .It may reflect the difficulty of polling an open primary .It remains obviously true that Iowa did not have effects of a size to affect the likelihood of a Sanders win in New Hampshire .It is probably hopeless to counteract reporters who weave the tale that Sanders is surging .Based on actual data , it might be exactly the opposite .In aggregated data , Hillary Clinton has gotten approximately a 6-point bounce in New Hampshire .The median margin was Sanders +21.5 % in 4 surveys conducted January 26 - 30 .This narrowed to Sanders +15.5 % in 6 surveys conducted February 2 - 5 .A daily tracking poll from U.Mass .Lowell shows even more narrowing .On February 1 it showed Sanders +31 % , which by February 6th narrowed to Sanders +14 % , a 17 percentage point change in Clinton 's favor .In national surveys , Clinton went from a median of Clinton +12 % ( 4 polls , January 22-February 1 ) to Clinton +16 % ( 3 polls , February 2 - 4 ) .This is noisy data , but the median change is a national 4-point bounce for Clinton .It is possible there was little change in either direction ( see confidence intervals below ) .It is likely that Hillary Clinton has remained level or risen in her national standings .This may be counterintuitive , considering the tone of the coverage by the press corps .Since Sanders is still in the lead in New Hampshire , my guess is that few reporters will get static for portraying an imagined surge for him .February 6th , 2016 , 8:51am by Sam Wang .In New Hampshire , Donald Trump is right where he 's been since August .In seven polls done February 2 - 4 , he is at a median of 29.0 \u00b1 1.4 % .He was rising in late January , but that came back down after the Iowa caucuses on February 1 .So he 's stuck ... in first place .February 2nd , 2016 , 1:21am by Sam Wang .My preliminary take on the Iowa caucuses is that they did n't alter the trajectory of where things are probably headed for the Democrats : Hillary Clinton is still favored .However , the Republican field could potentially narrow to a three - way race ( Trump - Cruz - Rubio ) sooner than I had expected , thanks to a strong showing by Marco Rubio .On the Republican side , Donald Trump and Ted Cruz switched places relative to polls .The late swing for Rubio was visible in the final days of polling .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.71188"}
{"text": "As expected , multiple delegates went to Cruz ( 7 ) , Trump ( 7 ) , Rubio ( 6 ) , and Ben Carson ( 3 ) .Numbers updated to reflect exact vote shares .After all the fuss , Cruz and Trump appear to be tied for first .It is premature to say that Trump is doomed .However , he does look a little less inevitable .It is certainly possible that he can crash from his high position in New Hampshire , South Carolina , and nationally .But I think a bigger risk to him is the possibility that tonight 's results will pressure Rubio 's lower - tier rivals to get out sooner rather than later .As I 've written before , if the field gets down to three candidates after New Hampshire , that opens up a narrow route to stopping Trump .In short , tonight kept Marco Rubio 's chances alive .On the Democratic side , tonight was substantively bad for Bernie Sanders .After all the talk about hordes of Sanders supporters , in the end he only achieved a near - tie : 23 delegates for Clinton , 21 delegates for Sanders .Iowa is one of the most favorable states for him because of its ethnic composition .But it is not enough to win 50 % of white Democrats .Outcome ( a ) did n't happen .We 'll see about ( b ) .One of the most notable features of the Democratic race was the age gap .In an entrance poll , Sanders led by 70 % among voters aged 18 - 29 , while Clinton led by 43 % among those aged 65 and over .That is a 113-point gap .This difference surely is on the minds of both sides for the weeks and months ahead .Finally , a word about polling .There seems to be a persistent meme that polls are in trouble .There was no evidence for this .Primaries and caucuses are volatile situations - this is a well - known fact .I have been assuming that home - stretch polls can be off by an average of 5 percentage points .Any fuss tonight is based on the fact that in Iowa , with its tiny turnout and odd voting procedure , Trump was polling 3 points ahead of Cruz , and ended up losing by 3 points .It would be a mistake to conclude that Trump 's support is illusory in other states .Quite the opposite .A 6-point error would not affect his ranking anywhere else .For now .February 1st , 2016 , 7:50pm by Sam Wang . \" Will Marco Rubio come in a strong third , or a weak third ?\" That was an actual pundit question .Data - ish punditry welcome below .12:09am , Tim in CA : \" Iowa and New Hampshire may represent a high water mark for Sanders .And in the case of Iowa , that high water mark is a tie .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.762924"}

Bernie Sanders surging into a tie against Hillary Clinton .Sanders has closed a 31-point gap from Quinnipiac 's last national poll at the end of December .A new NBC / Marist poll finds Donald Trump with a 13-point lead in New Hampshire , down 6 points from the middle of January .With the state voting Tuesday , Trump has 30 percent support , followed by Marco Rubio with 17 percent and Ted Cruz with 15 percent .A new national survey from Public Policy Polling finds GOP frontrunner Donald Trump shedding 9-points since early January .The race for the Republican nomination is now essentially a 3-way tie between Trump and Sens .Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio .The latest tracking poll of New Hampshire finds Donald Trump dropping slightly , losing 2 points through Wednesday .Marco Rubio has moved into second place , gaining three points as Trump and Cruz extend their battle from Iowa .The change in Rubio 's fortunes happened before his surprise finish in the Iowa caucus on Monday .The shift in donations from Bush to Rubio was a reflection of the potential of each campaign .Now that Rubio has overperformed in Iowa and finished a strong third , the flow of donations to the Florida Senator will likely turn into a tidal wave .When the votes were finally counted , the Iowa caucus was n't that close at all .Texas Sen. Ted Cruz cruised to a 4-point win over national frontrunner Donald Trump and bested late - rising Sen. Marco Rubio by 6 points .As Hillary Clinton limps out of Iowa having managed to avoid a loss , the Democrat party establishment may exhale that it dodged an upset bid from socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders .The Republican turnout was around 180,000 , the highest turnout in its history .It is also the first time more Republicans turned out when both races were contested .Jeb Bush , the one - time presumptive Republican nominee , is facing a very real money crunch .His campaign raised only $ 7 million in the last three months of last year .Fundraising for his once mammouth Right to Rise super PAC has also dried up .The final Des Moines Register poll on the Iowa Caucus confirms a two - person race between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz .While Marco Rubio comes in a distant third , his support is far weaker than either of the two frontrunners .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "134.3258"}
