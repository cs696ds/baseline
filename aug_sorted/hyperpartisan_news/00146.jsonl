{"text": "The smoking gun can only really come by detecting radioactive material .To that end , CTBTO has radionuclide detection stations scattered throughout the globe .These come in two flavors .The first looks for radioactive dust - fallout .These systems use suction pumps to pull air through a filter , which then goes through a radiation counter .The types of particles present , and their radioactivity , would give a lot of clues as to the bomb 's type .Let 's say you have a typical atom bomb : Its fallout particles would be decayed bits of uranium or plutonium .A hydrogen bomb also uses those materials , but they 'd be mostly burned away by the super hot fusion reaction .According to this 1991 analysis of a Chinese explosion published in Science and Global Security , an H - bomb 's radioactive particulate signature would have a lot less decayed plutonium and uranium , and also different ratios of their various decayed isotopes .But if someone knew the exact particles found after an H - bomb went off , they could use that knowledge to build their own H - bomb ( that 's probably one of the ways the Soviets copied the US 's weapon ) .Which is why Wallace told me the details of the analysis are secret .But if the blast is underground , as this one seems to have been , radionuclide detection is little help - the particles get contained .The other type of detector looks for radioactive gases , rather than particles .Xenon gas is the most potent of these , partly because it is a noble gas that does n't interact with other substances .Xenon can , however , decay .And the rate of decay tells scientists the gas atoms ' exact age .For instance , after North Korea 's 2013 test , a Japanese sensor picked up xenon isotopes that scientists deduced were exactly 55 days old .The exact same day as North Korea 's test ....... .Kim also warned that his country was open to war if provoked by \" invasive \" outsiders .The North Korean leader made the comments on a tour of the Phyongchon Revolutionary Site , which commemorates the achievements of his father Kim Jong - il and his grandfather , Kim Il - sung , on Thursday , the official KCNA news agency reported .The work of Kim Il - sung \" turned the DPRK into a powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate a self - reliant A - bomb and H - bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation , \" Kim Jong - un was quoted as saying .A hydrogen bomb , also known as a thermonuclear bomb , uses more advanced technology to produce a significantly more powerful blast than an atomic bomb .The rare meeting is the first intergovernmental interaction since August when the two sides met to defuse a crisis that had pushed them to the brink of an armed conflict .Held in the border village of Panmunjom , about 34 miles north of Seoul , the meeting saw the two sides ironing out a framework to resume high - level talks , although they did not arrive at a precise timeline .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.39914"}
