Franken , Sen. Klobuchar and Rep. Nolan .Apparently , Sen. Franken 's letter was the only letter that caught their attention .That 's because Sen. Franken said \" As the FBI and other law enforcement officials continue to investigate a crime where 14 innocent people lost their lives only days ago , there are still a lot of questions that need answers .There are now reports that one of the suspects pledged allegiance to ISIS , and I believe that this , and all other investigative leads , must be vigorously and fully pursued .\"The editors did n't treat Sen. Franken gently , saying \" Suspects ?They were mass murderers who died in a shootout with law enforcement ; and they had a pipe bomb factory in their garage .Crime ?This was no Bonnie and Clyde bank robbery couple .Franken 's response was so off base from the question , that another email was sent to his staff providing an opportunity to give a direct answer or at least call it terrorism . \"Sen.

Franken is just the politician who 's getting sent out to spin a mess .It 's President Obama that created the mess by pretending that ISIS was n't really a threat .The question now is whether ISIS will carry out another successful attack or not .Josh Kraushaar 's article highlights a subject Democrats would rather forget .At minimum , they wish national security would just go away .Kraushaar hit it right when he wrote \" The signs of a pres\u00adid\u00adent in deni\u00adal over the threat of ter\u00adror\u00adism keep pil\u00ading up .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.72089"}

FEC .The Montana Supreme Court had essentially ruled that Citizens United is a decision based on facts rather than law - that is , that Montana 's situation of corporate corruption in elections was factually unique , thus exempting the state from compliance with Citizens United .In an admirable dissent , Justice James C. Nelson explained precisely where the court went wrong : .Unquestionably , Montana has its own unique history .No doubt Montana also has compelling interests in preserving the integrity of its electoral process and in encouraging the full participation of its electorate .And Montana may indeed be more vulnerable than other states to corporate domination of the political process .But the notion argued by the Attorney General and adopted by the Court - that these characteristics entitle Montana to a special \" no peeing \" zone in the First Amendment swimming pool - is simply untenable under Citizens United .Admittedly , I have never had to write a more frustrating dissent .I agree , at least in principle , with much of the Court 's discussion and with the arguments of the Attorney General .More to the point , I thoroughly disagree with the Supreme Court 's decision in Citizens United .I agree , rather , with the eloquent and , in my view , better - reasoned dissent of Justice Stevens .As a result , I find myself in the distasteful position of having to defend the applicability of a controlling precedent with which I profoundly disagree .That said , this case is ultimately not about my agreement or disagreement with the Attorney General or our satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the Citizens United decision .Whether we agree with the Supreme Court 's interpretation of the First Amendment is irrelevant .Unfortunately , the Supreme Court 's reliably liberal justices did not take the same admirable position as Justice Nelson .In a situation when they should have unanimously asserted the Supreme Court 's position as the final expositor the Constitution and chastised the Montana Supreme Court for its temerity , justices Kagan , Breyer , Sotomayor , and Ginsberg instead decided to re - visit their opposition to Citizens United .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.68483"}

Frosh ( D ) , who helped pass the law as a state senator , said Thursday that the court majority got it wrong .I think it 's just common sense that the Second Amendment does not give people a right to own military - style assault weapons , \" he said .In a strongly worded dissent , Judge Robert B.

Bernie Sanders ( D - VT ) and Hillary Clinton .The average age of the Democratic field is 71 .First , read Guy 's post about how the Clinton campaign is nervous about Monday night 's tallies , where she barely eked out a win over Sanders , mostly due to coin tosses .Another surprise was the fact that Sanders apparently overcame the biggest turnout obstacles he faced in the state : turning out voters who really do n't vote .And the voters we 're talking about are young liberals .With income , it was hero of the proletariat , Sanders , vs. money bags Clinton : .Under $ 30k : 57/41-Sanders .Clinton won the East Central , Des Moines Area and Central parts of the state , while she tied Sanders in the Eastern cities and the West .Those who described themselves as Democrats broke for Clinton 56/39 ; Sanders took the \" Independent and something else \" crowd 69/26 .He also nabbed the \" very liberal \" voters 58/39 over Clinton , whereas the former first lady took somewhat liberal and moderates 50/44 and 58/35 respectively .When it comes to health care , it was n't shocking either ; the Sanders people only trust him on the issue and vice - versa with Hillary .Another interesting aspect of the Democratic exits belonged to unmarried women .This key ( and mostly liberal ) voting bloc went to Sanders , showing that identity politics was n't really a factor in this contest .This is a woman who had a significant double - digit lead over Sanders - and wasted it ( throwback to Obama ) .The Des Moines Register poll released last August showing that her support had dropped by a third at the time , a course projecting an eventual defeat for her for the then - upcoming caucuses , serves as a prophetic event for the first 2016 bout for Democrats .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.74513"}

{"text": "The above electoral map prediction from Western Illinois University has received a lot of attention , especially among supporters of Bernie Sanders , for showing Sanders winning in a landslide .Some argue that we should take this seriously because the mock election model has been right in every election it was used in since 1975 .The catch is that it was only used three times since 1975 .They deserve some credit for correctly predicting victories for Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford before many people had heard of Carter , and for predicting the election of Obama when many were ( as with Sanders now ) claiming he was unelectable .While I would love for this to be true , it is also very hard to accept the results in specific states , such as Sanders winning Mississippi and Georgia but losing in Hawaii and Maryland .Of course the claims of being right are limited to the final results and not accuracy of state by state predictions .A victory for Sanders , even if closer and involving a different set of states , would still be welcome .It is easy to dismiss this prediction , and I could not blame either Clinton or the Republicans for denying any meaning to it beyond the enthusiasm of college students for Sanders .The bigger question this year is whether we can believe the conventional polls , especially when they are being used to determine who qualifies for the debates , which can potentially influence the outcome .Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie have been eliminated from Tuesday 's main debate , along with George Pataki and Lindsay Graham being excluded from the undercard debate .Even some pollsters have argued that the polls should not be used in this manner .One problem is that the Republican candidates are too close together to use the polls to separate them .Then there is the question of whether the polls are all that accurate in predicting a primary election well before the vote .I 've followed the Democratic primaries far more closely , and have noted many times how little predictive value the polls have .This polling report from December 2007 described how Clinton had a huge lead over Obama .In December 2003 , Howard Dean was pulling away in the polls .Eventual winner John Kerry was in sixth place with only 4 percent , even trailing Al Sharpton .Among the problems with these polls , many voters in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire do not decide until the last minute .People are far more likely to switch between relatively similar members of their own party than they are to switch from a liberal Democrat to a conservative Republican in a general election .Pollsters also adjust the raw results based upon projections as to who will actually vote , but that is difficult to predict .Some polls this year are basing their prediction upon whether someone voted in previous Democratic primaries , but this excludes the people are who , at least from discussions on line , are saying they have just recently registered to vote Democratic in order to vote for Sanders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.74099"}
