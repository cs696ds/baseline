Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) : .My thoughts and prayers are with Justice Scalia 's family and his colleagues on the court who mourn his passing .Scalia , 79 , was a guest at the Cibolo Creek Ranch , a resort in the Big Bend region south of Marfa , the paper reported .According to a report , Scalia , an associate justice , arrived at the ranch on Friday and attended a private party with about 40 people .When he did not appear for breakfast , a person associated with the ranch went to his room and found a body .The U.S. Marshal Service , the Presidio County sheriff and the FBI were involved in the investigation , the paper reported .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.42535"}

Bernie Sanders , D - Vt .\" We also need to strip away the immunity that President Sanders - excuse me - Senator Sanders , I hope not President Sanders ... , \" Chelsea Clinton said Wednesday as she reacted to the slip nervously and the Minneapolis crowd laughed .Although the slip was relatively small , it came as Chelsea Clinton begins to play a more significant role in her mother 's campaign .Initially Chelsea served as a voice to portray a softer side of her mother , but now has taken to the offensive to go against Sanders .\" The thing that tells you as much as anything about ( the Clinton campaign 's ) current state of mind is Chelsea going on the attack .It tells you everything you need to know , \" The Hill wrote , quoting one Democratic strategist .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.06957"}

{"text": "Now , on the east coast , deep - blue Maryland 's 2013 assault weapons ban is back in the legal crosshairs , with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that a stricter legal standard should have been applied to ascertain its constitutionality .It 's a tremendous decision , though the current ban remains in effect while the legal camps begin arming themselves for the fight ahead .This was applied to federal enclaves ; it was expanded to the states in the McDonald v. Chicago decision .Yet , the Court noted that this right was not unlimited , and that certain limitations on weapons considered \" dangerous and unusual \" could pass constitutional muster .Grenade launchers , rocket - propelled grenades , and atomic weapons fit this category , not AR-15 semiautomatic rifles .Yet , as Dahlia Lithwick wrote in Slate , it 's dubious whether the Supremes will get involved in Kolbe v. Hogan .It 's certainly a possibility , and it offers another legal avenue for Second Amendment supporters to make their case for a broader ruling over the entire country concerning the legality of assault weapons bans .On a side note , Ms. Lithwick , like most left - of - center publications , need to brush up on their firearms nomenclature ( of which I sometimes screw up ) right : .The 4th Circuit then argued that since handguns kill far more people than semi - automatic weapons , and that since Heller made handgun ownership constitutional , the less overall deadly semi - automatic assault weapons must not be dangerous and unusual either .Writing alone in dissent Judge Robert B. King is unequivocal : \" Let 's be real : The assault weapons banned by Maryland 's FSA are exceptionally lethal weapons of war .In fact , the most popular of the prohibited semiautomatic rifles , the AR-15 , functions almost identically to the military 's fully automatic M16 . \"He also notes that the Supreme Court specifically called out M16 rifles in Heller when defining \" dangerous and unusual .\" First , there are no weapons that are \" less deadly semiautomatic \" weapons , unless you 're referring to bolt - action rifles , commonly associated with hunting , or muzzle - loaders , of which no one has really used en masse since the 18 th and 19 th centuries .Second , most handguns in circulation are semiautomatic ( self - reloading ) .An AR-15 rifle is also a semiautomatic weapon , which is why this argument that the AR-15 and the M16 are pretty much the same is so silly .An M16 rifle , the ones used by our military , can fire multiple rounds per trigger pull .There are other firearms that will continue to fire as long as the trigger is pulled ( aka automatic ) as well .That makes these weapon systems wholly different from the AR-15 , not identical .And , yes , automatic firearms for civilians are legal if you are willing to undergo the long process overseen by the ATF , wherein you pay a tax and have your weapons catalogued in a database .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.043365"}

Bush presidency .When we look at Figure 1 we can see that naming popularity seems to be heavily affected by First Ladies .Most names experienced a steady downward trend in popularity .The name \" Rosalynn \" is an exception as it peaked in popularity during the Carter administration before falling by the end to have risen in popularity once again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.813354"}

Sanders said that our great task was not getting sucked into perpetual warfare in Syria and Iraq .As president , he said he would do his very best to make sure that does n't happen .Sending American troops is what ISIS wants for a propaganda campaign .Sanders would n't give in to that , but air support and the deployment of special operations ( when appropriate ) would be options on the table for a Sanders White House taking the helm on this issue .When asked about his foreign policy doctrine by Chuck Todd , Sanders said that we learned the lesson of the wars in Iraq ; we can not do it alone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.793465"}
