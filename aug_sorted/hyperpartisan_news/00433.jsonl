Jon Corzine to court over his plan to require unpaid furloughs for public employees .In New York , public - sector unions have hit the airwaves with caustic ads denouncing Gov. David Paterson 's promise to lay off state workers if they continue refusing to forgo wage hikes as part of an effort to close a $ 17.7 billion deficit .Call it a tale of two economies .Private - sector workers -- unionized and nonunion alike -- can largely see that without compromises they may be forced to join unemployment lines .Not so in the public sector .Government unions used their influence this winter in Washington to ensure that a healthy chunk of the federal stimulus package was sent to states and cities to preserve public jobs .Now they are fighting tenacious and largely successful local battles to safeguard salaries and benefits .Their gains , of course , can only come at the expense of taxpayers , which is one reason why states and cities are approving tens of billions of dollars in tax increases .It 's not as if we have n't seen this coming .When the movement among public - sector workers to unionize began gathering momentum in the 1950s , some critics , including private - sector labor leaders such as George Meany , observed that government is a monopoly not subject to the discipline of the marketplace .Allowing these workers -- many already protected by civil - service law -- to organize and bargain collectively might ultimately give them the power to hold politicians and taxpayers hostage .It was n't long before such fears were realized .By the mid-1960s , dozens of cities across America were wracked by teachers ' strikes that closed school systems .Groups like New York City 's transit workers walked off the job in 1966 , bringing business in Gotham to a near halt .The United Federation of Teachers led an illegal strike which closed down New York City schools in 1968 .Widespread ire against strikes by public workers produced legislation in many states outlawing them .That prompted government workers to retreat from the picket lines into the halls of government .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.845932"}

Hart Research Associates .Hart is a Democrat , and his firm lists sixteen unions among its clients on its website .I 'm not saying that Hart cooks his results , but it is curious that independent pollsters find nothing like the support that Hart does .( For a review , see the Public Service Research Council . )But the election results in Wisconsin , as well as overwhelming votes to cut public sector pensions in San Jose and San Diego , suggest that the public is not overcome with love for organized labor .In the face of all this , the reaction of many union people is to blame corporate power , big money , relentless antiunion propaganda , restrictive labor laws and the far right .All true enough , but that 's only a partial explanation .Those obstacles are going to be with us for a long time .So the question really is , How do you operate in this world ?The traditional approach towards organizing the private sector - trying to recruit a majority of workers and win a representation election - looks as good as dead .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.955208"}

Harris Deputy Secretary U.S. Department of Labor Before the Committee on Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions U.S. Senate .June 17 , 2010 .Chairman Harkin , Senator Enzi , and members of the Committee .Thank you for the opportunity to speak today about \" worker misclassification . \" \" Misclassification \" seems to suggest a technical violation or a paperwork error .But \" worker misclassification \" actually describes workers being illegally deprived of labor and employment law protections , as well as public benefits programs like unemployment insurance and workers ' compensation because such programs generally apply only to \" employees \" rather than workers in general .Worker misclassification occurs when a worker who is legally an employee is treated as a self - employed worker , often referred to as an \" independent contractor .\" Some misclassification is the result of uncertainty or misapplication of often complicated laws or situations .However , much worker misclassification is intentional .Misclassification as independent contractors also increases the opportunities for tax evasion , and some take advantage of those opportunities , with a resulting loss of Federal and state revenue .Too many workers are being deprived of overtime premiums and minimum wages forced to pay taxes their employers are legally obligated to payand are left with no recourse if they are injured or discriminated against in the workplace .Misclassification is no mere technical violation .It is a serious threat to workers and the fair application of the laws Congress has enacted to assure workers have good , safe jobs .In this difficult economic climate , millions of Americans are struggling to stay in the middle class .Worker misclassification exacerbates all of these challenges .It shortchanges workers , employers , states , and the federal government .Workers are not paid the wages to which they are entitled .Law - abiding , responsible employers are denied a level playing field in a hyper - competitive business environment .And the revenues flowing into federal and state treasuries are diminished when employers that should be treating workers as employees avoid paying , unemployment taxes , workers ' compensation premiums , and ( unless the workers pay them ) payroll taxes .When the misclassified workers themselves do not pay some or all of the employment taxes for self - employed workers , the Social Security trust funds suffer a permanent loss .Most workers in this country simply assume they are protected by our nation 's basic employment laws - minimum wage , overtime , health and safety , workers ' compensation , anti - discrimination , and unemployment insurance , among others .What they may not realize is that these protections are directly linked to their status as \" employees .\" For example , independent contractors , a label given to individuals who are genuinely self - employed , are not \" employees \" and , therefore , are not protected by these laws .Unfortunately , it is all too easy for employers to misclassify employees and get away with it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.96067"}

{"text": "Even if collective bargaining were eliminated tomorrow , school employees would have every reason to continue funding the self - interested political action that has served them so well in the past .So what would provide a counterbalance to unsustainable union demands ?To find the answer , it helps to know that while union membership was rising in the public sector it was falling steadily in the private sector - to just 6.9 percent of the workforce in 2010 ( see figure below ) .The reason is simple : when a business makes excessive concessions to a union and is thereby forced to raise prices above those of its competitors , it loses customers .As it loses customers , it lays off workers .If this situation continues , the business fails .Private sector unionization is thus self - regulating to a significant degree .Public school employee unions , by contrast , have no direct competitors .They can not drive their employer out of business because there is only one employer in the sector and its existence is mandated by law .The only real solution to the spiraling cost of our state school monopolies is thus to open them up to private sector competition , so that both parents and taxpayers have an alternative to the no - longer - affordable status quo .There are several ways of doing this , of which education tax credits seem the most promising .In Florida , Arizona and other states , taxpayers can claim a dollar - for - dollar credit for donations to non - profit scholarship organizations .These organizations , in turn , subsidize private school tuition for low - income families .In Illinois and Iowa , families who pay for their own children 's education are eligible for tax credits to directly offset part of the cost .So while curtailing collective bargaining wo n't rein in out - of - control spending , introducing real private sector competition will .And as the final figure reveals , we have got to get spending under control .... .Update : I should add that , as NRO 's Rich Lowry notes , the plan for the state to stop garnishing public school employees ' wages and sending the money to the union is highly commendable .If employees want to pay union dues , they should be free to do so , but the choice should be theirs .Of course , since public school employees benefit very handsomely from the status quo monopoly ( see below ) , it 's likely that most will continue to pay voluntarily for the lobbying and political contributions that will preserve their above - market compensation .So it 's still the case that introducing private sector competition is the best way to control education costs .High rates of unionization in the public sector have led to very high labor costs in the form of generous collective bargaining contracts .Now state and local governments are under increasing financial pressure , as a worsening national economy has led to decreased revenues for states and municipalities - many of which remain locked into the generous contracts negotiated in more flush times .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.14431"}

{"text": "Does civic reorganization matter for the health of American democracy ?Optimists correctly point out that public agendas have been enlarged by expert advocacy groups fighting for social rights and fresh understandings of the public interest .Yet those who look on the upside fail to notice that more voices are not the same thing as increased democratic capacity .And they do not see that gains in racial and gender equality have been accompanied by erosions of cross - class fellowship and democratic participation and representation .Scholars have established that a combination of resources , motivation , and mobilization explains who participates in public life , how , and at what levels .Individuals from privileged families have advantages of income and education , gain civic skills at work , and also tend to be regularly contacted by civic organizers and election campaigns .Nevertheless , civic disparities can be partially counteracted if popularly rooted political parties , unions , churches , and associations spread skills and mobilize and motivate average citizens .The bottom line is that variety and voice have been enhanced in the new American civic universe forged by organizing upsurges from the 1960s to the 1990s .But the gains in voice and public leverage have mainly accrued to the top tiers of U.S. society ; Americans who are not wealthy or well educated now have fewer associations representing their values and interests , and fewer opportunities for participation .The shift from mass - membership federations to professional organizations has profoundly affected the political economy of influence .Not surprisingly , research shows that highly educated , upper - middle - class people are the ones most likely to send checks to public - interest advocacy groups .And the same seems to be true of Internet - based movements , the latest twist in civic innovation .Given that powerful forces have propelled civic reorganization , what can be done ?Clearly , it is neither possible nor desirable to go back to the traditional world of American voluntarism .For all of their effectiveness in mobilizing citizens across class lines , traditional fellowship federations were usually racist and gender - exclusive .What 's more , they failed to pursue many causes that are vital for Americans today .Yet the recent proliferation of professionally managed civic organizations -- from advocacy groups to nonprofit agencies -- creates a situation in which the most active Americans tend to be higher - educated and privileged people doing things for their fellow citizens , rather than with them .On the liberal side of the spectrum , especially , there are too few opportunities for large numbers of Americans to work together for broadly shared values and interests .This leaves our public life impoverished and suggests that those organizing to shape the political future must find innovative ways to re - create the best traditions of American civic life while preserving and extending the gains of recent times .About the Author .Theda Skocpol is Victor S.

Detroit Board of Education , the Court identified two state interests sufficiently compelling to justify mandatory union fees - \" labor peace \" and the related interest in preventing nonunion workers from free - riding on the union 's statutorily mandated duty to represent all unit members fairly .Since Abood , the bulk of the Court 's labor decisions have focused on what procedures are used to exact fees from nonunion workers and how those fees are ultimately used by the union .Until yesterday , the Court had not analyzed whom public - sector unions can target for support .Because plaintiffs typically have not disputed their status as public employees , \" Abood has been a given . \"And in the absence of guidance from the Court regarding the \" who \" question , states and unions have pushed the envelope on the classes of workers they designate as public employees ( and thus expose to unionization and agency - fee provisions ) .At the same time , a majority of the Supreme Court has voiced extreme skepticism with the foundational principles in Abood .Two Terms ago , the Court in Knox - speaking through Justice Alito - gave exceptional weight to non - union workers ' associational rights and discounted Abood 's counterbalance \" free rider \" theory as \" something of an anomaly . \"As presented by the parties , these two competing forces came to a head in Monday 's decision .The plaintiffs are personal assistants ( or \" PAs \" ) in Illinois , each caring for a medically impaired customer ( often a family member ) who would otherwise be institutionalized .Like many states , Illinois funds the services of such personal assistants through a Medicaid - waiver program .But by any reasonable measure , personal assistants are the private employees of their customers .By law , the customer \" control[s ] all aspects of the employment relationship with the PA , \" including , for example , hiring , training , supervising , disciplining and , if necessary , firing the PA .The state 's role , by contrast , is circumscribed .The state disburses program funds to qualified PAs and aids customers in certain aspects of the employment relationship .But , at base , the state 's main role is ensuring that government funds aid Illinois residents in keeping with governing law .The employment relationship is fundamentally a relationship between the PA and customer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.08235"}

Wade .Diminished need for labor unions .Two - Party System & LDS Political Activity Third parties play an important role in U.S. politics because they can sometimes move the debate one way or another .They can occasionally influence the outcomes of elections .But they rarely win elections , and when they do , their tenure is usually brief ( except in New Hampshire ) .If you want regular political influence , you 've got to be in one of the two major political parties .History shows that if one of the two major parties disintegrates , another will rise to take its place , such as when the Republican Party rose from the ashes of the once powerful Whig Party .LDS Church leaders regularly tell members to be politically active , but they refuse to take sides with parties or candidates ( although they do occasionally take sides on issues ) .These facts together mean that most Mormons that follow the counsel to be politically active will choose to ally themselves more or less with one of the two major political parties .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.58273"}

{"text": "The Scope of the Misclassification Problem .In order to understand the scope of the problem , it is necessary to define what we mean by \" worker misclassification . \" In simple terms , worker misclassification is the practice of treating a worker who is an employee under the law as something other than an employee , thus depriving the employee of rights and benefits to which they are entitled .Whether a worker is an employee depends on which law is applicable .The extent to which the services rendered are an integral part of the employer 's business ; .The permanency of the relationship ; .The amount of the worker 's investment in facilities and equipment ; .The nature and degree of control by the employer ; .The worker 's opportunities for profit and loss ; .The amount of initiative , judgment , or foresight in open market competition with others required for the worker 's success ; and .The degree of the worker 's independent business organization and operation .We recognize that it is conceivable for a worker to be correctly classified differently under the different standards that apply for different statutory purposes .However , that is not typical , and in most cases , applying the various laws does result in the same worker classification .Of course , there are legitimate independent contractors who enter into arms - length contractual arrangements with other business owners for their mutual benefit .I want to be clear that the DOL does not define misclassification as an \" independent contractor \" problem .Legitimate independent contractors can play an important role in our economy and many companies make good and legally appropriate use of their services .But some employers intentionally misclassify workers as independent contractors who , under the law , are employees .Sometimes the misclassification may be forced on workers .Other times , the workers are complicit in the misclassification in an effort to increase their incomes by evading income and payroll taxes .Such workers may or may not realize the risks they are taking in losing all of the protections of the social safety net that are provided to employees but not to independent contractors .It is important to remember , however , that the workforce is not just divided into employees and independent contractors .Industries have developed a number of business models that are based on using the lowest cost labor possible , including independent contractors , leased employees , and outsourcing .Many workers do not know they have been misclassified by an employer until they need the law 's protection .As a result , they are often not prepared for the consequences .For example , I recently learned about a case settled a while back by the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development .Alvaro was a dishwasher at a family - style restaurant in Madison , Wisconsin .He was being paid less than minimum wage and did not receive overtime .When Alvaro met with the employer to discuss the issue , the employer initially said he would pay all of the overtime wages Alvaro earned .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.66419"}

Scott Walker ( R ) to curtail collective bargaining by most but not all of his state 's public - sector workers , including teachers .That is a long overdue reform - but the governor 's plan does n't go far enough !A dozen or so states , including Virginia , where I live , do not allow collective bargaining in the public sector at all , and these states are doing just fine without it .The government union issue is coming to the forefront because states , facing huge deficits , are desperate to reform their budgets and cut pensions .Wisconsin is just one of several states where legislatures , empowered by Republican victories last fall , are finally tackling one of the root causes : the ability of public - sector unions to squeeze taxpayers for exorbitant benefits .In states that have unionized workforces , needed reforms are facing huge and aggressive anti - reform lobbying campaigns by the unions .In 2010 , 36 percent of state and local workers were members of unions , which is five times the union share in the US private sector .Yet prior to the 1960s , unions represented less than 15 percent of the state and local workforce .At the time , courts generally held that public - sector workers did not have the same union privileges that private workers had under the 1935 Wagner Act , such as collective bargaining .The rise of public - sector unions .That changed during the 1960s and 1970s , as a flood of pro - union laws in dozens of states triggered a dramatic rise in public - sector unionism .Many states passed laws that encouraged collective bargaining in the public sector , as well as laws that imposed compulsory union dues .Today , the union shares in government workforces vary widely by state .About 26 states have collective bargaining for essentially all state and local workers .A further 12 or so states have collective bargaining for a portion of their state and local workers , and the remaining 12 states do not have public sector collective bargaining .At the same time , 22 states have \" right - to - work \" laws , which free workers from being forced to join a union or pay union dues .These differences in unionization between the states affect fiscal policy .Statistical studies find that unionized public sector workers earn a wage premium of about 10 percent over non - unionized public sector workers .This is important because employee compensation represents half of all state and local government spending .Aside from inflated wages , public sector unions have pushed for excessive pension benefit levels , which are creating a fiscal crisis for many governments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.76594"}

'In the end the answer has nothing to do with fairness , economics or even logic .The rather sad and obvious answer is that the cuts target disabled people because these are amongst the very few cuts that are politically feasible .So , for the Campaign , the next question becomes - how is it possible that disabled people have been targeted in this way .Several factors seem important : .Public prejudice against and fear of disabled people - especially when fueled by political leaders and civil servants .The complexity and particularity of the social care and benefits - these systems are not understood and they not treated as if they were part of a universal system for everyone 's benefit .The political weakness of disabled people - we are often divided against ourselves , isolated from society and mainstream politics - often endangered by our dependence upon government and unwilling to speak out .A good example of the public confusion that has helped to undermine the rights of disabled people is the misrepresentation of data about benefit fraud .Government estimates benefit fraud at about \u00a3 1billion .This sounds a lot of money , but it is only about 0.5 % of the DWP budget for pensions and benefits .Moreover it is dwarfed by three other figures : .\u00a3 15 billion lost through tax fraud .\u00a3 16.7 billion lost because disabled people and others do n't know that they can claim benefits that they are entitled to - this is effectively fraud by government , who 've made the system so complex and confusing .So this is why we need to organise ourselves afresh - why we need a campaign .And this is why the campaign must be : .Open - we need to welcome the general public , diverse groups and different perspectives .Universal - we need to reframe our solutions so they are universal - relevant to everyone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.201035"}
{"text": "But if this state of affairs is to be challenged , it will be a long , hard struggle .The challenge is not merely one of organisational and cultural reform inside the Liberal Party .There is a struggle at the level of popular and academic culture : a struggle for the \" common sense \" of Australian politics .This is the struggle to define those \" invisible boundaries \" of the contested \" relative centre \" : those boundaries which most political players are compelled to observe in mainstream debate for fear of electoral backlash .That said , organised labour in Australia needs to take note of these conditions , and what this implies for the interests of their members , and for the social democratic and democratic socialist values which they espouse .Influencing Labor Party policy should remain an important focus of organised labour in Australia .But unless unions are willing to \" play hard ball \" , Labor power brokers will continue to take their support for granted , resulting in a further decline in union influence .Unions must remain independent of parliamentary Labor as much as is necessary to retain a genuine , strong and independent voice and power , beyond that accommodated by purely electoral politics , and the opportunism this involves .By providing a genuinely independent voice in this context , unions could contribute to a shift of the relative centre in favour of social justice and the rights of labour .That is not to deny that politicians need to compromise in the pursuit of electoral success .It is to insist that this can only be justified as a means to a greater and more principled end .Looking beyond purely electoral politics , there is also the prospect of organised labour again realising its true and independent social power .A labour movement which systematically educates , involves and mobilises its members ; and which applies its power and militancy effectively in strategic sectors ; is more likely to achieve leverage , and secure a more favourable compromise at the policy table .Over the long term , hopefully , such conditions would progressively \" feed into \" the prospects of a rejuvenated and emboldened Australian social democracy .By contrast , a purely defensive labour movement , afraid to take a stand and staging a constant \" rear guard action \" , may continue to decline in the face of an aggressive employer lobby .This has already been the case over recent decades - with employer demands for ever greater \" flexibility \" in wages and conditions , and brutal sanctions meant to destroy the legal rights of workers to withdraw their labour .In this context : there are some individual unions which have already \" broken away \" from Labor Party affiliation .But a more co - ordinated response could perhaps yield better results .There has been talk , recently , of financial worries for the ALP 's organisational wing .This being the case , in the short - term , the ACTU could do well to realise the strategic worth of its affiliated member organisations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.20694"}

{"text": "In the idealized world of political - science textbooks of mid-20th - century America , civic \" pluralism \" complemented democracy , Tocqueville - style .You might have one set of religious and ethnic and professional affiliations , but you had crosscutting identities as a parent , a trade unionist , a fisherman , and a member of the Elks .In these associations , you met and interacted with people of different religious and partisan preferences .That brand of pluralism was said to produce cross - class and cross - party bonds and empathies .Groups that put professionals and working - class people , or Republicans and Democrats , in the same rooms created a social basis for stable democracy and tempered extremes .Or so the pretty picture of pluralism insisted .It was the great midcentury political scientist E.E. Schattschneider Jr. who demolished this idealized vision with the oft - quoted line \" The flaw in the pluralist heaven is that the heavenly chorus sings with a strong upper - class accent . \"He added , \" Probably about 90 percent of people can not get into the pressure system .\" Even in the heyday of trade unions , economic elites had more dense and influential networks than regular people .Half a century later , that imbalance has only worsened .In their classic 1995 work , Voice and Equality , political scientists Sidney Verba , Kay Lehman Schlozman , and Henry E. Brady demonstrated conclusively that political activity varied by class .Well - off people were more likely to be engaged with associations , more likely to get involved in campaigns and to contact their elected representatives , more likely to make political donations , more likely to vote .The study found that 86 percent of high - income people reported having voted but only 52 percent of low - income people did ; 73 percent of high - income people were involved with a political organization , compared to 29 percent of low - income people .In a survey of why so many people avoided politics , a key stated reason was that politics felt irrelevant .This , of course , was also correlated by class .Nobody in large corporations believes politics is irrelevant .In a forthcoming sequel , titled The Unheavenly Chorus ( in homage to Schattschneider ) , the authors offer new evidence of deepening chasms in political association and influence by class . \"As the amount of money in politics increases , any form of political voice based on money is going to become more unequal , \" Schlozman told me .Money not only underwrites campaigns ; it finances pressure groups and associations .So as income inequalities widen , so does the gap in political association and influence .Political disengagement on the part of less affluent Americans is circular and cumulative .Disconnection from politics leads to disaffection with government and doubt that government policies can make a positive difference , which leaves the field to elites .In October , a New York Times /CBS poll showed that a record 89 percent of Americans believed that government could not be trusted to do the right thing most of the time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.96434"}
