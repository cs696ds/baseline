{"text": "Trump says occasional things that should be anathema to Republican ideologues , things like the rich should pay more taxes and there are parts of Obamacare that he likes .None of this seems to matter to his fans , most of who are Tea Party types .They just sense his character , latch onto his pugnacious style and see a successful businessman who manages to get his way .They project this to the national stage and think : if anyone can make Washington work , Trump can !Trump of course has never held an elective office , something his supporters see as an asset .Given Trump 's attitude , he would likely take liberties with the Office of the President far beyond what even George W. Bush or Richard Nixon could have ever imagined .If he takes these sorts of liberties , he stands an excellent chance of being impeached and convicted rather quickly .Even Donald Trump can not trump the Constitution of the United States .Moreover , he will encounter the same institutional forces every president has to deal with , as well as lots of pesky rules and regulations that he ignores or bypasses at his peril .Whoever is president must be a politician first or he or she will fail .It drives us voters nuts , but that 's the way it is .Trump too will have to do inconvenient things like follow contracting laws to build his wall along the Mexican border , assuming he 's sincere about it , which I doubt .He will also have to persuade Congress to fund it .The president is not a dictator .The president must persuade not just voters but Congress to actually wield power his way .Democracy is slow , painful and inelegant by design .Trump wo n't make it dance .I continue to believe ( perhaps naively ) that Trump understands all this upfront .He understands that he wo n't be the next president so perhaps his aim is to change the national conversation , or to push for his agenda or he is a secret Democratic operative that even the Democratic Party is oblivious to .I would n't put it past the man .Or I could be all wet and he actually plans to be our next president and his following his instincts that served him well so far .All he has to do is persuade enough of us , and he 's a master at the persuasion business .It starts with commanding our attention , and he sure has done that .Maybe for him the thrill is to close the ultimate sales pitch .If anyone has the skills to bamboozle us into doing so , he probably has it , which makes him dangerous to our democracy .I am certain that Trump is being disingenuous and does n't actually believe half the stuff he is saying .I 'm hoping that voters will eventually figure this out .Perhaps many of them have and simply do n't care because they like his pugnacious attitude .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "37.050808"}

Wagner , who derives only a fraction of her income from the federal contract .Together with the Center for Competitive Politics , Cato last week filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

Ferguson in 1896 , which essentially gave constitutional protection to legal segregation enforced by state and local governments throughout the U.S. .As we know from history , the free market did not lead to a breakdown of segregation .Indeed , it got much worse , not just because it was enforced by law but because it was mandated by self - reinforcing societal pressure .Any store owner in the South who chose to serve blacks would certainly have lost far more business among whites than he gained .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.94279"}

{"text": "Of all the rights the U.S. Constitution protects , courts are probably most vigilant about protecting free speech .Freedom of expression is not only a cornerstone of democratic government , but also central to the more ordinary choices citizens make in their daily lives .Yet one class of speech has been almost entirely ignored by the courts : speech by professionals engaged in their business .In the new issue of Regulation , Cato scholar Timothy Sandefur argues that the Supreme Court should make it clear that censoring professionals is intolerable .The precautionary principle always rigs the outcome in favor of immigration restriction because it 's impossible to prove that all refugees will be harmless just like it is impossible to prove than any of us will be harmless .If the precautionary principle is a starting point for debate then those favoring refugees will always fail .No debate should be stacked this way .American leaders have cooperated with regimes around the world that are , to varying degrees , repressive or corrupt .Such cooperation is said to serve the national interest .But these partnerships also contravene the nation 's commitments to democratic governance , civil liberties , and free markets .In Perilous Partners , authors Ted Galen Carpenter and Malou Innocent provide a strategy for resolving the ethical dilemmas between interests and values faced by Washington .The Cato Institute has released its 2014 Annual Report , which documents a dynamic year of growth and productivity .\" Libertarianism is the philosophy of freedom , \" Cato 's David Boaz writes in his book , The Libertarian Mind .\" It is the indispensable framework for the future . \"And as the new report demonstrates , the Cato Institute , thanks largely to the generosity of our Sponsors , is leading the charge to apply this framework across the policy spectrum .Tag : First Amendment .This is a terrible result , for the freedom of speech and association , and for religious liberty .As I 've argued before , even supporters of marriage equality ( and equality generally ) should not be blind to other violations of fundamental rights .The New Mexico law is one of multiple state and federal \" public accommodations \" laws that prohibit private discrimination by companies that offer services to the public .These laws are antithetical to liberty and forbidden by the Constitution .The Supreme Court held in 1883 's Civil Rights Cases that the 14th Amendment - the provision that speaks to equal protection - does n't authorize Congress to legislate against discrimination by private citizens .A hundred years later , however , the Court held that such power exists under the Commerce Clause - even where the business is confined to a single state .This is just one more instance of Commerce Clause abuse , something Cato has fought on numerous occasions , including the successful Commerce Clause challenge to Obamacare 's individual mandate .The legislation at issue in Elane Photography did n't come from Congress , so the question of federal power does n't arise .But even if a state legislature has the authority to act in a specific area , that authority ca n't be exercised in a manner that violates the constitutional rights of the those subject to it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.58986"}

{"text": "When commenting , please stay on topic with the post under discussion .( Ok , back to my original point , and this is where its related ) Generally speaking , if i were to be involved in a serious relationship with a black woman , that black woman would have to be more \" culturally white \" then culturally black .As you already stated , you want a man that s going to approach you and make the first move .Which also leads me to believe that You 're more into the dominant rather then passive men .A dominant man is going to want a woman that shares the same views as him .Women that are more \" Culturally Black \" are more stuck in their ways then women that are culturally white .Not to mention , that black women , in general , are much more headstrong and dominant then white women .By a black woman being more cultrally white , we already know that she is able to see different perspectives ( whic is equivalent to being less dominant ) and there s only room for one dominant person in a relationship .If a woman is nt able to see the world from my perspective before i 'm involved with her then that tells me that she only wants me to see the world in her perspective .I myself am more of a give and take type of guy .I would probably consider myself slightly more dominant then passive .And i would still prefer a black woman that s more culturally white .And it has nothing to do with prejudice or lack of respect for black women .Now imagine if i were very dominant trying to get into a serious relationship with a black woman that s extremely culturally black .it just would nt work , unless i was extremely culturally black also , which i m not .As for some women ( Black , White , Asian , etc . ) being dominant or being passive , it depends on the situation the woman has been placed in .There are times when a woman must stand forth , and there are times when a woman must retire to the background .( I really do not care for such terms as \" dominant \" or \" passive \" , for such terms deal in absolutes , as no one person is shy and retiring all the time , nor forceful or adamant all the time . )As this goes for women , the same goes for men .People must bend as the situation presents itself , but , at other times , people must be strong in the face of adversity .And strength knows no racial or gender bounds .There is a time to take charge , and there is a time to defer .Men , as well as women , must learn this .There have been , and still are , Black women who respect their culture , and are able to see things from other culture , races , ethnicity viewpoints .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.60919"}

Cayetano , the Justices voted 7 - 2 to strike down a provision of Hawaii 's constitution that allowed only descendants of native Hawaiians to vote in elections for trustees of the state 's Office of Hawaiian Affairs .The Court correctly argued that the Constitution prevents a state from denying the right to vote on account of race , which is what Hawaii was doing in this case .This principle - that citizens are individuals with the same rights and duties regardless of their race , color , or ethnic background - will likely be put to the test in the Court 's future terms when it considers several racial preferences cases .Every term , a large percentage of the Supreme Court 's constitutional rulings deal with criminal law .This year , the most closely watched decision involved the warnings made famous by television and the movies : \" you have the right to remain silent , you have the right to an attorney , \" etc .In the 1966 case Miranda v. Arizona , the Court decided that the Fifth , Sixth , and Fourteenth Amendments require the police to observe procedural safeguards when they take suspects into custody and interrogate them .This was done for the laudable goal of ensuring that confessions are in fact voluntary , which is an essential protection for individual liberty .Even though many police departments around the country gradually have come to accept and even embrace Miranda warnings for the predictability they provide , the decision sparked enormous controversy in 1966 .Responding in 1968 , Congress passed a law that allowed the voluntariness of confessions to be evaluated on a case - by - case basis rather than according to the Miranda dictates .Congress claimed that the Miranda warnings were guidelines , not constitutionally - required rules .Finally , more than 30 years later , the Supreme Court has decided the issue in favor of Miranda .The case , Dickerson v. United States , involved a Virginia bank robber whose confession was thrown out because he had not received his Miranda warnings .Invoking the 1968 law , federal prosecutors proceeded anyway .They lost in District Court , but then appealed to the Circuit Court , where they won .Finally , Dickerson appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court .Despite appearances , the issue in this case is not the wisdom of the Miranda warnings .They may be good both for protecting people suspected of crimes and for providing police with consistent rules of interrogation .Just as disappointing , several Justices voting in the majority ( like Rehnquist and Anthony Kennedy ) had suggested in earlier cases that Miranda warnings are not always required in order to use a confession ( and therefore are not really constitutional rules ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.6739"}

{"text": "Like the Mudde quote above , this list does n't adequately describe far right currents today .None of this calls into question Chip 's basic point that we need to apply terms like fascism clearly and thoughtfully .But it does highlight the need for more scholarship that addresses the full , living reality of right - wing politics .A typology of fascism and more broadly of the far right or extreme right , whatever we call it , needs analytic precision , but it also needs to be flexible enough to account for variations and changes in what rightists say and do .After almost a century of debate , there 's still no agreement among scholars , or among activists , about what fascism is or what it encompasses .My own thinking on this question has continued to evolve .In 2007 , I offered a descriptive profile of fascism based on four core features : radical break with the established order , totalitarian mass politics , twisted anti - elitism , and autonomy from business control .More recently , I 've concentrated more on delineating the far right -- which arguably includes both fascists and non - fascists -- from other currents .In the context of the United States today , I use the term \" far right \" to mean political forces that ( a ) regard human inequality as natural or inevitable and ( b ) reject the legitimacy of the established political system .That covers some ( but not all ) white nationalists , the theocratic branch of the Christian right , the hardline wing of the Patriot movement , and a few other currents .But oppositional and system - loyal rightists are n't just in conflict .As Chip Berlet points out in \" Trump Bigotry , \" they also fuel each other .For example , \" the Trump candidacy and the shooting in Charleston are connected thematically by a mobilization to defend white nationalism while the racial and ethnic face of America changes hue .\" This is a complex , fluid situation , with different branches of the right both divided and interconnected , and we need a dynamic approach to understand it .Debates about terminology or definitions aside , I know that Chip and I agree about this .When a group built around right - wing conspiracy theories sends heavily armed white men onto streets filled with Black Lives Matter protesters , it makes sense to be worried .But if these are white supremacist vigilantes , why are they proposing to arm black protesters and march alongside them ?Police sharpshooter at Ferguson protests - a repressive response strongly criticized by Oath Keepers .Oath Keepers has drawn a lot of discussion and criticism for deploying men with guns to Ferguson , Missouri , last fall and again this summer .As a part of the Patriot movement , Oath Keepers ' politics are predictably right wing on a host of issues - it glorifies private property , promotes homophobia and anti - immigrant scapegoating , and accuses Marxists of making common cause with radical Islamists to destroy western civilization .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.53241"}

Wade .Warren 's opponent Scott Brown has already voiced his support for Justice Antonin Scalia , naming the ultra - conservative judge as his favorite on the Supreme Court .The Supreme Court announced today that it will hear a critical voting rights case next year .Arizona has appealed a 9th Circuit decision that barred the state from requiring proof of citizenship from those registering to vote via a federally - approved registration form .Current federal law allows voters to register via federal form instead of a state - specific form .Those opting to do so must swear under penalty of perjury that they are citizens .Arizona 's law , which is currently stayed , would require voters using that form to jump over an extra hurdle to register , requiring them to show proof of their citizenship , a provision disproportionately affecting low - income and minority voters .The ruling applies only to people who seek to register using the federal mail - in form .Arizona has its own form and an online system to register when renewing a driver 's license .The court ruling did not affect proof of citizenship requirements using the state forms .Arizona officials have said most people use those methods and the state form is what county officials give people to use to register .But voting rights advocates had hoped the 9th Circuit decision would make the federal mail - in card more popular because it 's more convenient than mailing in a state form with a photocopy of proof of citizenship .The mail - in card is particularly useful for voter registration drives , said Robert Kengle of the Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law , which is representing Native American and Hispanic groups in the case .The conservative wing of the Supreme Court has been eager to challenge voting rights laws in recent years .In 2008 , a 6 - 3 majority of the court upheld Indiana 's voter ID law , paving the way for suppressive voter ID measures throughout the country .The Court may also hear a challenge to section 5 of the Voting Rights Act , which requires federal preclearance for voting rights changes in states and counties with a history of discrimination at the ballot box .Successful court challenges to discriminatory voting law changes this year have shown just how essential that provision still is .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.62451"}

Bingham 's statement is NOT part of the legislative history of the 14th Amendment because he was not talking about that Amendment .He was talking about a separate bill with different language .A commenter named James Ho noted that \" proponents and opponents of birthright citizenship alike consistently interpreted the Act , just as they did the Fourteenth Amendment , to cover the children of aliens .In one exchange , Cowan , in a preview of his later opposition to the Howard text , \" ask[ed ] whether [ the Act ] will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country ? \" Trumbull replied : \" Undoubtedly . ...[ T]he child of an Asiatic is just as much a citizen as the child of a European . \" Does the definition apply to children of illegal aliens ?Yes .Did Bingham consciously intend it to ?This question is anachronistic , since illegal aliens did not exist until later laws excluded certain classes of aliens .Now this quote , as evidenced by google , is all over the internet .Nearly every posting takes it out of context , and makes no mention of its true purpose .If someone has time , it would be interesting to post the true context in each an every one of those nutsites .Others have already pointed out why this quote fails to prove any anti - Obama point , but I 'll just add that nowhere does Bingham say that those are the only natural - born citizens , simply that those are natural - born citizens .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.65289"}

Valeo , \" the right of association is a basic constitutional freedom that is closely allied to freedom of speech and a right which , like free speech , lies at the foundation of a free society . \" The Buckley ruling has since survived many assaults - including , most notably , Citizens United v. FEC -though Citizens United exposed certain instabilities in Buckley 's framework .In any event , challenges continue to arise at the intersection of campaign finance law , political association rights , and the freedom of speech .An important one comes from three individuals who have business contracts with the federal government .Accordingly , the three plaintiffs are prohibited from making their intended campaign contributions and thus from an important form of political participation .This rule applies even to someone like name plaintiff Professor Wendy E. Wagner , who derives only a fraction of her income from the federal contract .Together with the Center for Competitive Politics , Cato last week filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit , arguing that the plaintiffs should be able to exercise their right to political association and speech by contributing to political campaigns .Specifically , we argue that section 441(c ) is unique in that it entirely bans contributions by a class of individual citizens .Section 441(c ) does n't meet this test .If the government wants to ban her from this important form of political participation , then it must give more than bare assertions of the specter of potential corruption .The D.C. Circuit will hear argument in Wagner v. FEC on September 30 .Several major conservative thinkers suggested that the Constitution does not need to be changed , but rather to have its principle of limited government guide both Congress and the president .Michael Cannon at the Cato Institute noted that the Fourth Amendment protects against warrantless searches , \" yet the National Security Agency tracks everybody with Congress ' tacit if not explicit consent .\" First of all , and I fear I will be explaining this to reporters for the rest of my life , I am not a conservative .I support gay marriage , cutting military spending , closing all U.S. bases in foreign nations , and ending the prohibitions on drugs , gambling , and prostitution .Of such stuff conservatives are not made .Second , the above excerpt scarcely captures my response to the Times ' inquiry .Do n't change a thing ? ?Here is my response in full : .There are constitutional amendments I want to see .And yet .Americans do n't need to amend the Constitution so much as they need politicians to honor what the Constitution already says .The Constitution creates a government of enumerated and therefore limited powers ; Congress and the president routinely exceed those powers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.84654"}

Wells to the women of the present , the refusal of black women to remain silent about sexualized violence was part of a long - standing tradition .Black women described and denounced their sexual misuse , deploying their voices as weapons in the wars against white supremacy .Indeed , their public protests often galvanized local , national , and even international outrage and sparked campaigns for racial justice and human dignity .When Betty Jean Owens spoke out against her assailants , and when the local black community mobilized in defense of her womanhood in 1959 , they joined in this tradition of testimony and protest .The arrest , trial , and conviction of Owens 's white rapists by an all - white jury marked a dramatic change in the relations between this tradition of testimony and a tradition of silence that Darlene Clark Hine has termed the \" culture of dissem - blance . \" 4 The verdict not only broke with southern tradition but fractured the philosophical and political foundations of white supremacy by challenging the relationship between sexual domination and racial inequality .For perhaps the first time since Reconstruction , southern black communities could imagine state power being deployed in defense of their respectability as men and women .As a result , the 1959 Tallahassee rape case was a watershed event that remains as revealing now as it was important then .The sexual exploitation of black women had its roots in slavery .Slave owners , overseers , and drivers took advantage of their positions of power and authority to rape slave women , sometimes in the presence of their husbands or families .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.25352"}

{"text": "In other words , for them it was better to be consistent than to be right .A final critical decision in this year 's Supreme Court term concerned the problem of abortion .In the most recent case , Steinberg v. Carhart , the Court voted 5 - 4 to strike down a Nebraska law that outlawed partial birth abortions .The Court did so on fairly narrow grounds , contending that the law was overly broad because it would interfere with abortion procedures that are constitutionally protected .It did not say that a more specific law also would be struck down .Despite this narrow ruling the Court was badly divided ; in fact , Justice Kennedy , who generally supports a right to abortion , joined the dissent of the three other Justices who simply reject the Court 's 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade .Since that first case , the Court has struggled to articulate a coherent understanding of why a woman has a constitutional right to abortion and when that \" right \" can be limited by law .The struggle continues because no matter what side of the abortion debate a person is on , almost every scholar agrees ( if only privately ) that Roe v. Wade was bad constitutional law .It found a constitutional right for a practice that is not mentioned in the text and has no long standing protection in our legal tradition .Even worse , the Court did not clearly articulate any coherent philosophical foundation for this new right .This basic confusion is bound to arise when judges interpret the Constitution according to \" the times \" rather than according faithful to its original meaning .In the next abortion cases , we can only hope that the Court will return to sound principles of jurisprudence .Even though the Court has taken less than half the cases it will eventually decide this term , it already has some cases worth watching .In the area of criminal law , for example , the Court will rule whether police can set up checkpoints to stop cars , inspect drivers ' licenses and registration , look for signs of impairment , and walk drug - sniffing dogs around the exterior of the car .In the area of federalism , the Court will address whether Congress can allow state government employees to sue their employers in federal court or whether such intrusion in state affairs violates the little - known Eleventh Amendment , which protects state sovereign immunity .These are only two of the Supreme Court 's future cases .It will eventually take on more controversial issues like school vouchers , gay marriage , and religious freedom .Given the Court 's importance , especially in this presidential election season , we must familiarize ourselves with its activities .After all , with at least three Justices over 70 years old or not in the best health , Al Gore or George W.

Virginia making his view clear : He believes that the landmark 1971 Supreme Court case ruling that the government can not discriminate against women simply because they are women was wrongly decided .( Then - litigator Ruth Bader Ginsburg helped write the brief arguing for equality in that case . )When it comes to the rights of women , Scalia 's Constitution is a stiff , brittle document , relegating women to the limited rights they were allowed to have in 1868 , when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted .Interestingly , his approach is far more flexible for corporations , as we saw in Citizens United , when he concluded that mega - corporations have the same First Amendment rights as people for the purposes of election law .Perhaps if a woman wants to have full constitutional protection from Justice Scalia , she needs to incorporate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.38997"}

{"text": "The case this year , United States v.

Wade , some conservatives have used the \" penumbra \" passage to decry what they believe to be the alleged judicial \" creation \" of rights not found in the Constitution .Roe v. Wade , decided in 1973 , is a famous and extraordinarily controversial Supreme Court case that found the Constitution of the United States prohibits outlawing of abortion , or the imposition of undue restrictions upon it , at least during the initial stages of a pregnancy .Roe , a woman from the state of Texas , had an unwanted pregnancy .Texas law , at that time , forbade the termination of pregnancy except under certain medical circumstances , such as the endangerment of the pregnant woman 's life .Roe sued the state of Texas , alleging that her 14th Amendment right to privacy was being violated by the law forbidding termination of pregnancy .The case worked its way up through the several Federal courts , and reached the Supreme Court .The Supreme Court agreed with Roe , and found the Texas law to be an unconstitutional invasion of Roe 's right to privacy between doctor and patient .The decision in Roe was unique , though , as the Court did not just strike down the Texas law ; it issued guidelines as to what regulation of abortion it would consider permissible .( It is normally very unusual for the Court to say what is allowed to government , versus determining what is forbidden for government to do . )This decision caused immediate and immense controversy throughout the United States .Political and religious stereotypes scarcely capture the immense political and legal debate about the implications of Roe .This section reviews a few of these arguments .Supporters of Roe view Roe as an important decision that affirmed what they consider the basic rights of women , especially the right for women to control their own body and reproductive systems .Other supporters view Roe as an important triumph in the area of reproductive public policy , establishing the right to control over active pregnancy into the law of the land .Still others focus on sociological arguments , sometimes claiming that Roe led to decreases in crime in the years since the decision , as unwanted pregnancies , and therefore the number of unsupportable children was reduced by the availability of abortion .( Others claim that the decrease in unwanted children is due to effective contraception widely available upon request , and the rise of comprehensive sex education . )This view can be expressed by the slogan : \" Do n't like abortion ?Get a vasectomy ! \"Objections to Roe are numerous .Legal objections can be broken down into several arguments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.05004"}

Oakley argued for Ogden , while William Wirt and Daniel Webster argued for Gibbons .This section will depart from the normal style , as there are important changes that were made in the Constitution and Constitutional interpretation through means other than judicial interpretation , such as by means of amendment , or by right of the victor .Dred Scott was an African - American slave who originally lived in Missouri , and was taken to Illinois , a free state , by his master .Scott sued for freedom , as he was in a free state .The case worked its way through the courts , until it reached the Supreme Court .Although the case could have been dismissed for technical reasons , Chief Justice Roger Taney decided to attempt to resolve the slavery issue in the United States once and for all , by imposing his personal opinion ( his personal opinion as a slaver ) upon his fellow citizens .He dismissed the case .The most infamous passage of Scott is as follows : . \" The words ' people of the United States ' and ' citizens ' are synonymous terms , and mean the same thing .They both describe the political body who , according to our republican institutions , form the sovereignty , and who hold the power and conduct the Government through their representatives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.64365"}
