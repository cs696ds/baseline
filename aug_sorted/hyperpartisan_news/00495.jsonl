'And she put them on .\" We encourage students to reply to other people 's tweets to foster more of a conversation .Also , if students tweet their personal opinions , ask them to support their ideas with links to interesting / credible articles online ( adding a nice research component ) or retweet other people 's ideas that they agree / disagree / find amusing .We also value student - produced media linked to their tweets like memes or more extensive blog posts to represent their ideas .Of course , do as you can ... and any contribution is most welcomed .Huff Post article Sex - Ed Needs K-12 Foundation Like Math , According To New Standards In 2013 , The Chicago Board of Education approved a new sexual health education policy that would start sexual health education starting in Kindergarten .\" Clearly we wo n't be talking about sexually transmitted infections in kindergarten , \" said Stephanie Whyte , Chief Health Officer for Chicago Public Schools .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.082306"}

'The Supreme Court 's recognition that B.W. and all minors are victims of child trafficking resulted in the passage of two new laws in 2011 and brought relief to the state and national community .Victims are entitled to issue a protective order against their traffickers ( Texas Legislature 2011 , SB 24 Section 1.03b and Section 2.02a ) .In turn , SB 23 focuses on awareness programs and protective services for victims .Furthermore , Florida reflects Georgia 's , Alabama 's , Connecticut 's and Texas ' statutes on the need for training programs .Furthermore , it notes that cooperation between state agencies is vital in order to successfully aid the victims ( Florida State Legislature 2006 , Sec . 787.06 ( 1d ) ) .Lastly , the statute mandates that both law - enforcement officials and prosecutors need to receive continuous training on the reality of human trafficking ( Florida State Legislature 2006 , Sec .The ultimate proof that protective services help victims heal is seen in the Connecticut case .The statement by Robert Moossy , the Director of the Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit , confirms that protective services decrease the chance of victims becoming retrafficked .Conclusion .In the twenty - first century , slavery still exists in the world despite the widely accepted norm of respect for human rights embodied in the Palermo Protocol .In addition , the 13 th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibits slavery in all its forms .Notwithstanding the existence of these laws , the United States fails to comply by international norms .Georgia and Alabama are two examples of states that have taken important steps to protect children who have been victims of trafficking .Laws should include training for individuals who come into contact with victims , provision of rehabilitative and protective services , and no discrimination as to the nationality of the victims .As a result , these two state laws should serve as blueprints for the rest of the country .In this way , the United States could truthfully state that it complies with the Palermo Protocol 's prescriptions and become a genuine leader of the international community .My suggested policy prescription posits that the federal government should allocate greater funding to social service providers and state governments who agree to revise their laws and assist victims in order to entice states to revise their laws and therefore , to be proactive .The obstacle to this proposed policy will be the ability of the federal government to ensure accountability of the individual states .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.99106"}
