{"text": "I spent hours looking at pictures of bodies online- Taylor Swift 's legs , Jennifer Anniston 's arms , anyone 's abs but my own .I suffered from Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified ( EDNOS ) .I was not starving myself , nor was I binging and purging , yet I was going to unhealthy extremes to maintain a very low body weight .And although it was triggered by an actual medical problem , I was suffering from an eating disorder .This is National Eating Disorder Awareness ( NEDA ) Week .The theme this year is \" I Had No Idea .\" The goal is to point out the misunderstandings that people have , and rumors that people spread , about eating disorders .Eating disorders are not fad diets .Eating disorders do not only affect women .Eating disorders do not always result in skeletal figures .Eating disorders have different origins for different people .Thirty million U.S. men and women will suffer from an eating disorder in their lifetime , according to the National Eating Disorder Association , and 95 percent of sufferers are between ages 12 and 25 .By the time sophomore year came around , I had lost so much weight that my clothes no longer fit and all of my bones were visible in a bathing suit .I distinctly remember sitting on my couch one afternoon , looking through Facebook pictures , picking out which girls I wanted to look like , wondering how they got their bodies to look like that .How were they so perfect ?I could n't stop comparing , even though I knew that my negative body image and body dissatisfaction was heightened by doing so .I had to snap out of it .I started seeing a therapist and a nutritionist .My therapist advised me not to buy or pick up another magazine showing idealized women 's bodies ever again .Although both traditional and digital advertising are hard to control , the decision to stop buying magazines was one that was completely within my control and could help me resist obsessing over society 's unattainable thin ideal .I have not bought a single \" women 's \" magazine since 2011 .Not a fashion magazine , not a cooking magazine , not a fitness magazine .Trust me , this choice is not always easy .It 's hard not to stop at the kiosks at the airport and buy the newest issue of Cosmo or Us .It 's hard not to bring a bag full of magazines with me on a train or a plane or anywhere I could possibly get bored .It 's even hard not to stock my bathroom with tabloids to keep up on the daily gossip .But resist I must .Otherwise I see this : .Flatten your abs Fast ! 7Yummy Fat - Melting Foods .Sexiest .Body .Ever . 4 Steps .6 Minutes a day .Nearly every magazine boasts headlines promising fat - blasting secrets or weight - loss tips .Models typically have olive complexions , are extremely skinny ( yet big - breasted ) and have perfect skin .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.767113"}

{"text": "According to this PETA employee , the # 4 reason that \" Only Stupid Girls Brag about Eating Meat \" is that .Meat will make you fat .All the saturated fat and cholesterol in chicken wings , pork chops , and steak eventually leads to flabby thighs and love handles .I hope the upcoming \" Jessica Simpson 's Intimates \" line comes in plus sizes !Going vegetarian is the best way to get slim and stay that way .Here again , just like we saw with Skinny Bitch , is the perpetuation of the stereotype linking size to stupidity -- something that has been common at least since the pseudo - science of physiognomy .The reasoning goes as such : only a \" stupid \" person would eat meat because they 'll get cancer and fat ; just think how ashamed of herself she 'll be then when she gets caught shopping in the ' plus size ' section , gasp !Even worse , is that this fat phobic response is neither logical nor scientific : saturated fat and cholesterol intake are no more connected with weight - gain than carbohydrates and protein .On the front of the card is a sad , morbidly - obese child entitled \" Tubby Tammy ; \" on the back it explains \" how \" chicken makes you so fat you 'll have to wear a bungee cord for a belt .Fatness is thus framed as a mix between a social disease ( i.e. cruelty ) and a biological one ( i.e. sickness ) .Again , these three cases of fat phobia / shaming are in no way trivial .Each is part of a highly calculated marketing tactic to \" sell \" vegetarianism as a social panacea .Unfortunate for the well - intentioned female animal advocates of PETA , those who do not conform to the mainstream 's socially acceptable standard of beauty for women , the very standards PETA perpetuates , will be harassed and shunned .Take for instance the reactions at Perez Hilton to a publicity stunt in which a pregnant woman posed in a mock - gestation crate to protest hog farms .Comments included : .What 's a tubby naked bitch in a cage got to do with eating pork ? ?She needs to go on a diet wtf is this about ewwwwwwwww Moo cow .UGLY Why could n't they have chosen an attractive female ?Of course , no one deserves to be called such horrible , misogynistic and speciesist names ; but it would not be surprising if PETA , or some animal advocates in general , used the same rhetoric to attack a woman who was promoting pork . \"According to Sabayon : .She cites one blogger ( and believe me , I 've heard these comments from several animal advocates in person ) as an example of some of the fat - hate ARAs have to deal with , particularly women : .Fat vegans , however , have failed one important animal : themselves ... their audiences of meat - eaters and animal - abusers may be so distracted by their appearance that they can not hear the vital issues of animal rights .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.49505"}
{"text": "I 'm not even sure I know what an omnivore is .But I know what a skinny bitch is , and I know I want to be one . \" To put it simply , the Skinny Bitch franchise is so popular largely due to the clever marketing that went into it .As the fashion publicist said , women know skinny bitches , and they know they want to be them ; they do n't necessarily know ( or care ) what an omnivore or a vegan is .With a title like Skinny Bitch , the book drew on a much larger , mainstream audience , like a magnet for body - insecure women .But is this more of a success for vegetarianism or perpetuating body - image anxiety ?Klausner would probably agree with he latter : Skinny Bitch is more likely to perpetuate eating disorders than to nurture a sustainable compassion for animal others .For instance , the book exploits metaphors that are both misogynistic and speciesist as part of its \" in your face \" coaching : .The relentless bullying peppered throughout the authors ' advice accounts for much of the book 's humor , including quips like \" you need to exercise , you lazy shit , \" \" coffee is for pussies \" and \" do n't be a fat pig anymore .\" It was a formerly anorexic friend of mine who nailed it when she read excerpts from the book .\" When you have an eating disorder , \" she told me , \" that 's the voice you hear in your head all the time .\" Likewise , Joanna at Vegans of Color believes the book is being marketed as a tool to shame women into a vegetarian diet so they ca be skinny .She adds .I feel like the idea behind the book , & certainly how it 's being talked about , definitely plays the shame game .And competition & jealousy - I mean , women who do n't care about animal rights are picking this up because they want to be skinny .The authors of the book , understand that bullying voice internalized in women from all races , classes , and regions of America that drives them toward unhealthy eating , and they are not afraid of exploiting it to humorously shaming / motivating people into eating \" better \" food .Angie at Voice of Dissent further notes that the tag line , \" Stop being a moron and start getting skinny , \" \" is playing directly into the stereotype that all overweight people are stupid , ignorant and lazy .\" How ever tongue - in - cheek the humor of their tough - love style is , it trivializes that oppressive voice within women 's heads and further validates false associations between fat / stupid / lazy / bad and thin / smart / agency / good .In many ways , the humor actually is apologetic for that oppressive voice as well as misogynism and sizism .Nonetheless , some counter the criticism by noting that the authors admit at the end of the book that they tricked the reader into reading this pro - vegan book , that they really do n't care about being skinny .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.88876"}

{"text": "The way comedic performances frame sensitive subjects such as racism , sexism , and classism tell us much about society and about ourselves as viewers .In many instances , comedians seek to make their audience laugh through whatever means possible - including the use and reproduction of harmful stereotypes --in order to gain popularity and earn a living .However , in some cases comedians can serve as formidable weapons of cultural transformation because of their sanctioned authority to progressively debate even the most difficult topics .Accordingly , comedy has the potential to encourage audiences to critically think about why the joke made them uncomfortable and why they laughed at the joke .In analyzing humor from sociological perspective , it is important to consider what these jokes reveal about ourselves and our society .In this video , Sarah Silverman explores and critiques many different racial and ethnic stereotypes .She sings lines like \" I love you more than Jews love money \" and \" I love you more than Asians are good at math . \"To elaborate on one example , Silverman articulates that \" Jewish people driving German cars \" is similar to \" Black guys calling each other niggers .\" When the narrative cuts short to two deadpan African - American men , they stare at her in all seriousness and do not laugh at the comparison ; the tension created from the scene is unsettling .For a moment , Silverman looks taken aback and frowns sheepishly , until one of the African - American men starts laughing and she , relieved , playfully pushes one of them and starts laughing again .Both men immediately stop laughing and stare unbelievably at her in silence .Silverman cuts off the video mid - laugh by turning her head to the camera while smiling and singing \" Chachacha !Silverman 's use of the \" n - word \" creates a tense moment .While many people love Silverman 's humor , it is not for everyone .But stay with me here ; let 's unpack this to the degree that people do find it funny ( and based on the YouTube comments , at least some people do ) .How should we interpret Silverman 's comedy and the role of her race and ethnicity in her performance ?More broadly , how does the race or ethnicity of the comedian telling the joke affect our reception of the joke ?Is it okay for black people to do racially prejudiced jokes about African - Americans , or would n't that also be discriminatory of them to do so ?Are there times when it is acceptable for dominant racial or ethnic groups to make jokes about racial minorities ?To help us understand how humor functions and how audiences receive humor , we can draw upon a number of theories of humor .First , according to relief theory , we find humor in taboo topics and \" naughty \" thoughts ( Mulder and Nijolt 2002 ) .This theory of humor is based in Freudian theory which sees such taboo subjects as creating a nervousness or \" psychic energy , \" which is released through laughter .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.61542"}

{"text": "The basis for the charge is that there have been enough nominations and enough awards given to detect a bias .That is , if Oscars were awarded like lottery winnings , by sheer chance alone non - white actors would take home a more proportionate share of the little statues , so there is cause to believe that somehow the creep of racial bias is contaminating the nomination process .The fact that 94 percent of voting members are white does n't exactly ease fears that the Academy is playing racial favorites .My aim here is not to contribute to the growing criticism of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences .While the concerns of a whitewashed Oscars ceremony are certainly justified , in my view this criticism risks missing the forest for the trees .The more one obsesses about whether members of the Academy are racist or whether the ceremony is a racist production , the easier it is to miss the whitewashed media environment the Oscars celebrate .In other words , the Oscars matter , but the ceremony should not be conflated with the institution , where there is a discernible preference for creating white - centered media , and the pactice of doing so is routinely defended as merely an economic calculation .However , this explanation is far from complete , and I think there is cause for suspicion that the explanation shifts responsibility from the media makers to the media consumers .In order to grab the problem at its root and expose it , it 's necessary to define what is meant by whitewashing .In its simplest form , whitewashing refers to the tendency of media to be dominated by white characters , played by white actors , navigating their way through a story that will likely resonate most deeply with white audiences , based on their experiences and worldviews .There are four distinct types of whitewashing .My claim is that Hollywood is guilty of producing all of these types , and equally important is the fact that Hollywood also creates the conditions by which their continued production becomes almost inevitable .First , whitewashing happens in films based on historical events , where white actors play the role of non - white characters .An exemplar of this first type is the classic movie , Birth of a Nation , where a number of white actors notoriously appeared in blackface .A more recent example is the film Argo , which recounts the CIA plot to rescue six Americans during the Iranian hostage crisis in 1981 .In the film , Ben Affleck , a white man , plays the role of Tony Mendez , a Latino CIA officer who headed the operation .In addition to the incongruence between the real man and the actor , Tony Mendez 's last name appears to be downplayed in the film .A variation on this first type of whitewashing occurs in adaptations of written works of fiction .This happens when a fictional character from a novel is originally drawn or described as a person of color , yet in the live action adaptation , the character becomes inexplicably white .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.11508"}

{"text": "Other times the character 's original racial identity is entirely abandoned and the character simply becomes white , as appears to be the case with The Last Airbender .A second type of whitewashing can be observed in films that claim to be based on true stories .Here , the constellation of events that comprise a historical moment are reconfigured , forcing the audience to experience the story from a white perspective , as such , this type of whitewashing is a principal agent in shifting the public memory of real events .For example , Dances with Wolves ostensibly depicts a period of what has been euphemistically described by some historians as the Western Expansion , but is more accurately characterized as a patchwork of genocidal practices and policies by the United States government against the Native Peoples of North America .By inveigling its audience to experience this historical period through the eyes of a white protagonist , Dances with Wolves privileges the white experience .Dances , and other films like it , are whitewashed insofar as they succeed in prioritizing the white experience of witnessing this tragedy over the experiences of Native families who lived through it and died from it .A third type of whitewashing can occur , even when the majority of characters in a film are played by black and brown actors .Here , the term refers to the observation that white actors secure all the major roles of a film , or they play the most well - rounded , complex characters of a film .Again , Dances of Wolves is an example of this type of film , but other examples include The Last Samurai and Dangerous Minds .Finally , it is also possible to speak of whitewashing as a description of a genre or a particular film industry .Any given film might be dominated by white characters because some stories just happen to be told about white people .Similarly , it sometimes happens that white characters are protagonists in stories , and white actors are sometimes just the best actors for major roles .However , these films might justifiably be called whitewashed if the majority of films produced over a given span of time fit this pattern .In other words , whitewashing can not always be discerned on a film - by - film basis .There is an old cliche that the only color Hollywood executives see is green .Indeed , as I alluded to above , one common defense offered by those who make films is that they are simply giving the public what it wants .What is rarely discussed is that people are not simply born with fully formed preferences .The defense fails because Hollywood films are directly implicated in shaping people 's racialized preferences in the first place .If it is true that the paying public truly wants white actors to dominate the silver screen , then Hollywood producers need to own up to the fact that they have played a central role in shaping that desire .In this post , Kendra Barber reviews the documentary film , Black Church , Inc. : Prophets for Profit ( 2014 ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.48703"}

Williams that takes a critical look at the Black Church and how the pursuit of profit corrupts the morality of the Black Church and its ability to serve the community .The documentary begins by explaining the history of the Black Church as a central institution in the black community and what sociologist E. Franklin Frazier called a \" refuge in a hostile world .The documentary asserts that prosperity gospel is particularly detrimental to poor black communities who give their money to megachurches with the expectation that they will achieve the same financial success as megachurch pastors .According to Black Church , Inc. , black megachurches are popular because they specialize in entertaining people and , as a result , congregants are distracted from asking critical questions about church finances and social problems affecting the black community .In the end , Black Church , Inc. alleges that \" black megachurches have caused the Black Church to lose its prophetic voice .The sanctuary of Bishop Eddie Long 's New Birth Missionary Baptist Church .While Black Church , Inc. provides a suitable starting point to discuss changes in the black religious landscape and the role of black churches in black communities , there are a number of weaknesses in the documentary .The primary weakness is the treatment of black megachurches and prosperity theology as interchangeable .Undoubtedly there are black megachurches whose pastors preach prosperity theology and abuse their leadership positions for financial gain .However , the entire documentary is based on generalizations that all black megachurches are prosperity churches .Black megachurches , just as smaller black churches , adhere to a range of theological orientations and it is imprudent to assume that all black megachurches are prosperity churches and therefore have rejected efforts to improve the black community .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.491196"}

Evans became the Klan 's Imperial Wizard .Under his leadership the organization grew rapidly and in the 1920s Klansmen were elected to positions of political power .This included state officials in Texas , Oklahoma , Indiana , Oregon and Maine .By 1925 membership reached 4,000,000 .Even on the rare occasions they were arrested for serious crimes , Klansmen were unlikely to be convicted by local Southern juries .After the conviction of the Klan leader , David C. Stephenson , for second - degree murder , and evidence of corruption by other members such as the governor of Indiana and the mayor of Indianapolis , membership fell to around 30,000 .This trend continued during the Great Depression and the Second World War and in 1944 the organization was disbanded .In the 1950s the emergence of the Civil Rights Movement resulted in a revival in Ku Klux Klan organizations .The most of important of these was the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan led by Robert Shelton .In the Deep South considerable pressure was put on blacks by klansmen not to vote .An example of this was the state of Mississippi .By 1960 , 42 % of the population were black but only 2 % were registered to vote .Lynching was still employed as a method of terrorizing the local black population .On Sunday , 15th September , 1963 , a white man was seen getting out of a white and turquoise Chevrolet car and placing a box under the steps of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church .Soon afterwards , at 10.22 a.m. , the bomb exploded killing Denise McNair ( 11 ) , Addie Mae Collins ( 14 ) , Carole Robertson ( 14 ) and Cynthia Wesley ( 14 ) .The four girls had been attending Sunday school classes at the church .Twenty - three other people were also hurt by the blast .A witness identified Robert Chambliss , a member of the Ku Klux Klan , as the man who placed the bomb under the steps of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church .He was arrested and charged with murder and possessing a box of 122 sticks of dynamite without a permit .On 8th October , 1963 , Chambliss was found not guilty of murder and received a hundred - dollar fine and a six - month jail sentence for having the dynamite .In 1964 the NAACP , the Congress of Racial Equality ( CORE ) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) organized its Freedom Summer campaign .Its main objective was to try an end the political disenfranchisement of African Americans in the Deep South .Volunteers from the three organizations decided to concentrate its efforts in Mississippi .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "123.2713"}
