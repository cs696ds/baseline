Rul .He mentioned an organization formed to sell advertising in its members ' publications as an example of how the NFL 's arrangement for television contracts could pose a problem .Spector , however , said LTR 8325001 states that a tax - exempt sports league may collect television rights fees as the agent of its teams without jeopardizing its tax - exempt status or paying tax on the fees , and that the rights fees are taxable to the teams .The Revenue Act of 1928 amended the law to include professional football leagues and 501(c)(6 ) changes that would ensure that a league 's tax - exempt status would not be risked by its operation of a player pension fund , the CPE document says .The CPE document says regulations define 501(c)(6 ) organizations as groups of people with a common business interest whose purpose is to promote that interest and not \" engage in a regular business of a kind ordinarily carried on for profit .\" The NFL is n't the only football league in the country -- multiple indoor leagues , including the Arena Football League , exist .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.37532"}

{"text": "You would think that decertified union would be powerless , but clearly the NFLPA 's decertification was nothing more than a legal technicality based on their attempt to prevent highly ranked college players from attending the NFL Draft in April .Players only get drafted once .Those who are invited to attend the draft with their families have earned the right to be there .Most college players do n't get drafted at all , and only a small percentage ever get the chance to play in the NFL .Making it to the top of the draft is an honor that should not be tainted by negotiations that have nothing to do with these players .As it is , the NFL Draft is going to be very anticlimactic for the players selected because they will not do anything with their new team until the next Collective Bargaining Agreement is completed .The irony of the request by the NFLPA is that the players who are likely to be hurt the most under the next Collective Bargaining Agreement are the ones who are being asked to take a stand against NFL owners .When the posturing ends and negotiations begin in earnest between the NFL owners and NFLPA , it is no secret that a rookie wage scale will be put into place .This makes fiscal and logical sense , but the fact of the matter is that the rookie wage scale is going to cost the players at the top of the draft millions of dollars in guaranteed money .College players are not a part of the NFLPA , which technically is nothing more than a trade organization at this point since they are no longer a union .It is unfair of the NFLPA to try and use this small group of players as leverage in contentious negotiations .Quite frankly , even if the players succumb to the pressure being put on them , it will serve no purpose .The NFL Draft is going to happen with or without the top players in attendance .The fans who were planning on attending the event will still do so , and the television viewership will not be affected at all .ESPN and NFL Network can easily allow their analysts to evaluate each pick and show footage of them in college with missing a beat .Ultimately , the only ones who will suffer if the top players do not attend the draft are the players and their families who will miss out on a once - in - a - lifetime experience .Their attendance ( or lack their of ) will have absolutely no bearing on the next Collective Bargaining Agreement .Current NFL players should step up and tell the NFLPA to back off of this ridiculous request because it is making the players look bad in the court of public opinion .Eventually , a deal will be worked out regardless of what happens with the NFL Draft .Those who choose to succumb to the unfair NFLPA pressure will ultimately regret the fact that they allowed themselves to be used as pawns in childish game .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.36834"}

{"text": "There 's no guarantee that the \" break - even \" point from a profit or business standpoint would result in championship level output .It might be to have a winning season but avoid New York Yankees levels of expenses .This tension is not new , and the two motives have generally been able to coexist .The most beloved owners tend to be the ones who establish an image of being willing to spend and even lose money to see their team succeed , even if in practice that is really the case .But things have gotten more interesting in recent years .There are a number of factors now that have not always been present in major sports .The first factor is the one that underlies them all , which is that , at least in certain sports like professional football , it would be very difficult for a franchise to actually be unprofitable .This is because the league as a whole generates massive revenues , and it redistributes much of that revenue among the various teams , including TV revenues , merchandising , and even some team specific revenues get redistributed to other teams ( though that may change ) .Buttressing this is that , despite the high demand for professional football , the league has an effective monopoly over the sport and limits the numbers of teams .It 's the old supply and demand argument : if you are making big profits making widgets , eventually - unless there are significant barriers to entry - others will jump in and sell widgets too and get profits too , until the market got saturated .Do n't think others would start teams ?I believe they would ( though I admit this example is very artificial ) as there are many geographic areas of the country without a football team and , further , football , being a sport , would attract many wealthy hobbyists .Think about horse racing : The sport of kings is profitable for very few owners despite the large purses for winning , because , to oversimplify , wealthy people can buy a horse , get it cleared , and begin competing .The point is that NFL teams effectively make monopoly profits , which allows them more freedom to \" go for winning \" as opposed to always focusing on profitability .But that 's not always the case with sports leagues , as we 've seen with European soccer and other leagues , including non - NFL football leagues .Next , you have the imposition of the salary cap , which is a great deal for owners and a terrible one for players .Of course , that is different than saying it is bad for sports fans , because it might well be good for them ( competitive balance and all that ) .On the other hand , for owners it protects them from the hard business versus winning decisions owners in leagues with looser salary caps must make .In Major League Baseball , every team is compared to the Yankees and Red Sox , simply because they tend to outspend everyone else .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.96707"}

{"text": "By the last years of the deal , annual revenue could more than double the current amount .\" Three to 4 percent of $ 9 billion is a lot less than 3 to 4 percent of $ 20 billion , \" said Marc Ganis , a sports consultant with close ties to the NFL .A league source said the deal motivates the NFL even more to generate national revenue , which should help ease the strains between low - revenue and high - revenue clubs .The league is moving right away to ease tensions over the subsidy system , which is the league 's supplemental revenue sharing , that previously had transferred about $ 100 million annually to low - revenue teams .Beginning this year , the league is capping at $ 3.5 million the amount that any single club must pay into the system , whereas under the old formula , top teams could pay millions more than that .In addition , in that old system , the top 15 teams in revenue paid out to the lower - revenue teams .It 's unknown how many teams will give and receive because of different formulas now .Top teams will now be assessed not on their overall revenue , but on their amount of locally derived revenue .Teams ' eligibility also will be loosened a bit , with those clubs for whom player compensation consumes 63 percent of their revenue now being eligible .Previously , that requirement was 65 percent .It 's possible then the amount paid out to needy clubs could rise , but high - revenue clubs wo n't have to fund it all themselves because new revenue now will come from greater access to club - seat fees .In the coming years , waivers that have allowed many teams to keep the visitors ' share of club - seat revenue will expire .That money now will be banked in a revenue - sharing pool .The NFL anticipates , though , that as national revenue rises , fewer clubs will need extra help .The fact that supplemental revenue sharing is even necessary underscores that the owners did not get everything they wanted in the new labor agreement .Players won significant victories in the negotiation , like a higher salary floor and more cash spending , as well as health and safety measures .The NFL Players Association also had been deeply concerned about capturing its share of the explosion of media dollars expected in coming years .One reason it walked away from the table on March 11 was because the league 's proposal that day could have cut off their chance to enjoy that growth .Now , the players will get 55 percent of media revenue , which is treated as a unique stream of revenue . \"National revenues have the least costs associated with the them , \" said Mark Murphy , Green Bay Packers president , explaining why the league would share this money more generously .Players will get less of high - cost revenue , such as local , club - raised revenue and NFL Ventures revenue , which comes from areas like NFL Network and licensing and merchandise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.253265"}
