{"text": "Even so , this volume is not only highly informative about the mainstream patterns of the evolution of antisemitism in post - Communist Hungary but also offers laudably measured overall judgments about it .A crossroads for antisemitism ?Antisemitism : A Very Short Introduction .By Steven Beller .In the conclusion to Antisemitism : A Very Short Introduction ( 2007 )I saw antisemitism as an almost completely spent force .Events since then give one pause for thought .Israel appears no more accepted as a \" good citizen \" by much of the international community , and Jews continue to be attacked for their supposed support of the \" Jewish state \" .Moreover , nationalist parties that have links to an antisemitic political past are on the rise in Europe .It is thus not surprising that Jews around the world , and especially in Europe , increasingly fear a return of antisemitism .Yet antisemitism is still a spent force and will remain so - if the right measures are taken by reasonable actors , both non - Jewish and Jewish - in Israel and in the rest of the world .The main difficulty in combating antisemitism is that the two main strategies for doing so are increasingly at cross purposes .The first sees antisemitism from the perspective of Jewish nationalism ( Zionism ) , for which the answer to antisemitism is Israel , as the political expression of the Jewish people 's right to national self - determination .From this perspective attacks on Israel are against the national rights of the Jewish people and hence are antisemitic because anti - Zionist .This linking of antisemitism with anti - Zionism , conceptualized most recently in the theory of \" the new antisemitism \" , has garnered strong support in the world 's Jewish communities , and is also written into the European Union 's working definition of antisemitism .If we approach antisemitism as a Jewish problem alone , this has a certain sense .It makes little if any sense from the perspective of the second strategy , which sees antisemitism as the ultimate expression of the exclusionary logic of nationalism .The Zionist perspective actually undermines the most powerful arguments of antisemitism 's main antidote : liberal pluralism .In this view , as Jean - Paul Sartre famously suggested , antisemitism is not a problem for Jews but rather for non - Jews , indeed for all of us .It is representative of a universal moral evil : the exclusion , fear and , ultimately , destruction of the other in society simply because of difference . \"Never again \" becomes a promise not about preventing Jewish genocide , but any genocide .It is the refusal or inability to accept and embrace difference within a society that is the root of the problem .These two perspectives often intertwine , but they can result in clashing responses to antisemitism .The \" Zionist \" response targets Israel 's \" antisemitic \" enemies , including many among the Muslim immigrant communities in the West and their pro - Palestinian Western sympathizers on the political Left .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.906513"}

{"text": "The dark truth is that our country 's birth is inextricably linked to the dislocation and ethnic cleansing of indigenous peoples this land .It was , moreover , built upon the backs of slaves who were forcibly removed from their homes and brought to this country in chains .It is , indeed , a history we have yet to collectively own up to as a nation .We have not atoned for this legacy of human dislocation .On the contrary , we continue to rationalize it away behind the myths of American exceptionalism : a dream of hope and opportunity for all .And there 's no getting around it : those who are not included in this \" dream \" - the dislocated ones , if you will - are invariably people of color .Whether we 're talking about Native Americans and African Americans , the Latino migrants we imprison and deport , or the Syrian , Iraqi , Afghani or Yemini refugees of the Middle East .If we are going to reckon with this legacy , we can not and must not avoid the context of racism that has fueled and perpetuated it .As a Jew , of course , I think a great deal about our legacy of dislocation .To be sure , for most of our history we have been a migrating people .Our most sacred mythic history describes our ancestors ' travels across the borders of the Ancient Near East and the Israelites ' wanderings in the wilderness .And in a very real sense , our sense of purpose has been honored by our migrations throughout the diaspora - yes , too often forcibly , but always with a sense of spiritual purpose .For centuries , to be a Jew meant to be part of a global peoplehood that located divinity anywhere our travels would take us .Our sacred tradition demands that we show solidarity with those who wander in search of a home .The most oft - repeated commandment in the Torah , in fact , is the injunction against oppressing the stranger because we ourselves were once strangers in the land of Egypt .And given our history , it 's natural that we should find empathy and common cause with the displaced and uprooted .However , I do fear that in this day and age of unprecedented Jewish success - and dare I say , Jewish privilege - we are fast losing sight of this sacred imperative .One of my most important teachers in this regard is the writer James Baldwin , who was an unsparingly observer of the race politics in America .In one particularly searing essay , which he wrote in 1967 , Baldwin addressed the issue of Jewish \" whiteness \" and privilege in America .It still resonates painfully to read it today : .It is galling to be told by a Jew whom you know to be exploiting you that he can not possibly be doing what you know he is doing because he is a Jew .It is bitter to watch the Jewish storekeeper locking up his store for the night , and going home .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.5609"}

{"text": "My conclusion , as someone who pays close attention to the Israel - Palestine discussion within progressive venues is that , yes , the progressive movement and the activist base of the Democratic Party has betrayed its Jewish constituency via an acceptance of anti - Semitic anti - Zionism .That they have accepted anti - Semitic anti - Zionism as part of the larger constituency is irrefutable .Those of us who pay attention see it on a daily basis .Until friends of Israel , Jewish or otherwise , are willing to recognize this situation and acknowledge it and discuss it , we can never actually address the issue in a manner that will be helpful .We can not create strategies and tactics until we are ready to acknowledge that the situation exists .I want to thank Fizziks for taking the time to address the issue , despite our disagreement , because this is the only way we can even begin to move forward .It has to start with a recognition of political conditions as they are .40 comments : .I feel like you changed the topic mid - debate , to something that one could n't possibly disagree with .I thought we were debating whether Jews should abandon the Democratic party .I did n't think we were debating whether the far left has betrayed the Jews .On the later question , the answer is obvious , it is hell yes , and there can be no debate .If that was the topic , then we wasted our time because we already agree .Those were the three topics that I tried to explore .So therefore , Jews have no reason to abandon the Democratic party .There is a segment of anti - Israel left - leaning Democratic activists that have more influence than realized , especially among their uniformed brethren , and more voices need to be raised within to confront them .Too many liberal Democrats want to pretend that it 's a nuisance , when it is much more .If only liberal Democrats were less prone to fear the calls of bigotry , especially from those who practice bigotry .Excellent comment , fizziks .What I would add , when it comes to Republican \" support \" for Israel is that that support does not come out of any genuine love for the Jewish People or the State of Israel .Instead , this \" support \" comes out of the apocalyptic fantasies of the evangelicals that compose a significant portion of the Republican base .In fact , that is nothing but a different facet of antisemitism .And of course the Republican support shows in it 's candidates .Let 's look at them for just a minute : .Little Newt - He , who supposedly is so Pro - Israel wants to send arms to the Rebels fighting the Assad Regime .You know who else wants to do that : Al - Qaeda .Now , if President Obama did that , these jokers would be up in arms regarding this and saying : \" How can Obama support the Salafists \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.48427"}

{"text": "Israel 's first prime minister , David Ben Gurion , said in the 1930s that ' le malheur of the Jews was the chance of Zionism ' , and he and his followers knew all too well how to mobilize antisemitism for the achievement of their vision .And there is another very contemporary example of how Israel and the Zionist movement are not beyond making common cause with antisemites .Millions of fundamentalist Christian Zionists in America are now among Israel 's staunchest supporters .Since 9/11 they have made funding pro - Israel propaganda groups , right - wing Zionist organizations and settlement activity , and providing political backing to the Israeli government 's hard line policies , a central plank of their foreign policy .But they do this because they believe that Christ 's Second Coming will only occur once the land of Israel is fully united .All believers will be transported to meet the Lord , while everybody else , including the Jews , will perish in the battle of Armageddon .So for Christian Zionists , Jews are merely a means to an end .However , it 's no secret that this ideology is suffused with antisemitism .But right - wing Zionists are quite happy to ignore such an awkward fact on the grounds that the support of Christian Zionists for Israel trumps their Jew - hatred .Ten years on .Since 9/11 , the growing popularization of the redefinition of antisemitism as hostility to the state of Israel has given licence to Jews and Zionists to act according to the maxim ' my enemy 's enemy is my friend ' .Regrettably , Israel , encouraged by hard line Jewish and non - Jewish supporters , has n't learnt these lessons .Not only is it continuing along the path followed since 9/11 , more inclined than ever to see the world through the distorting prism of the ' new antisemitism ' , it is conniving in worsening its own isolation by drawing the wrong conclusions from events in its region .Rather than seek a positive accommodation with the democratic forces struggling to overturn dictatorships and autocracies in the Arab world , Israel has sought to prop up military juntas on the grounds of the narrowest and ultimately mistaken interpretation of its security interests .This , argues Zvi Bar'el in Haaretz , is because Israel is now run by its own form of military junta .The result is likely to be increasing defensiveness , a strengthening sense of victimhood and even more reliance on an America that the Netanyahu government has made clear it does not trust .This is a high price to pay for treating the destruction of the shared understanding of what constitutes antisemitism as a victory .Antony Lerman is an Honorary Fellow at the Parkes Institute for the Study of Jewish / non - Jewish Relations , Southampton University .He is also a member of the Black - Jewish Forum , a member of the Advisory Committee of the Holocaust Exhibition at the Imperial War Museum and a founding member of the Jewish Forum for Justice and Human Rights and the Independent Jewish Voices steering group .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.96846"}

{"text": "Rabbi Yaakov Ariel , a contemporary Israeli rabbi , has suggested that the commandment of tzedakah should be understood as two separate laws : an obligation for individuals to give tzedakah and an obligation for the state to end poverty .He bases this proposal on the classical division of mitzvot into two categories : h ? ovot gavra and h ? ovot h ? eftza .H ? ovot gavra are mitzvot incumbent on individual people - such as the mitzvah to pray or to observe Shabbat or holidays .Every person ( or every man in non - egalitarian communities ) is equally bound by these mitzvot .In contrast , h ? ovot h ?eftza are mitzvot occasioned by particular objects .There is no obligation to eat a piece of fruit , but if one does , one recites the appropriate blessing .There is no obligation to grow produce , but if one does so in the land of Israel , one is obligated to separate out the required tithes .Tzedakah , Ariel argues , is a h ? ovat gavra insofar as every individual is obligated to give tzedakah even if no poor people are present .When there is no immediate need , each person should put the recommended ten to twenty percent of income into a communal tzedakah fund , to be distributed when the need arises .Even full compliance with this mitzvah will not , however , guarantee an end to poverty .Therefore , says Ariel , tzedakah is also a h ? ovot h ? eftza in that the appearance of a poor person imposes an obligation on the community to care for the needs of this person .He writes , \" Today , economists believe that the state is not able to carry all of this heavy burden that it has taken upon itself .[ 3 ] In other words , individual members of society can help individuals to get by , to find jobs , or to secure loans .Only the government , though , can establish the preconditions for tzedakah to be effective .In his levels of tzedakah , Rambam addresses the individual , not the community .Within a society that allows equal access to opportunity , well - paying jobs , and accessible paths to the middle class , the eighth level of tzedakah offers a sufficient response to individual poverty .But in a society in which large systems conspire to maintain poverty and hamper economic mobility , individual solutions only go so far .Rather than ignoring this gap between our own reality and the reality that Rambam addresses , we might allow the eighth level of tzedakah to spur us to consider how to create a society in which self - sufficiency is the norm , and emergency support is the rare exception .This approach will mean cutting through the Jew / non - Jew divide to think about which communities are the most vulnerable , and then changing the systems that maintain these communities in a vulnerable position .In the end , perhaps , we will achieve a world in which individual support , whether through money , jobs , or loans , will be all that is necessary to alleviate periodic suffering .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.732086"}

'In other words , anti - Semitism has over centuries been used as a political tool by both the political right as well as the political left .We now appear to have entered another historical period of political anti - Semitism on the political left .It was n't always like that : Israel was founded on socialist principles in 1948 .Her political leaders were among the founders of the Socialist International : the social - democratic leadership forum of social democratic political parties that were established after WWII .But everything changed with the 1967 war .Though widely recognized as a war of defense for Israel , the subsequent occupation of Arab lands branded the country as a neo - colonialist power in the eyes of the left .Even today , almost 50 years later , it is the only functioning democracy in the Middle East .But the majority of the Socialist International continues to view Israel with political distain .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.31457"}

{"text": "Kov\u00e1cs states that by picturing Jews as posing an external threat , ethnopopulists articulated \" a structured antisemitic worldview \" ( p. 21 ) .Such ethnopopulists tended to belong to the largest governing party until some of their leading representatives , notably Istv\u00e1n Csurka , founded their own moderately successful \" Christian nationalist \" party .Kov\u00e1cs maintains that there was no hidden antisemitic agenda behind mainstream national conservative views as articulated , most crucially , by J\u00f3zsef Antall who served as prime minister between 1990 and his death in office in 1993 - -in spite of their political cooperation with ethnopopulists .Nevertheless , the national conservatives ' image of history included elements that \" in a different context , may have formed part of an antisemitic discourse \" ( p. 29 ) .Kov\u00e1cs argues that such ambiguities could make the spectrum from the conservative center to the antisemitic margins appear continuous , which in turn helped leftist and liberal forces delegitimize the national conservatives through recontextualizing their statements as antisemitic .While this is in many ways a laudably balanced assessment , it comes at the expense of highlighting , above all , the n\u00e9pi - urb\u00e1nus divide that characterized Hungarian politics of the early 1990s but has lost much of its explanatory value in the meantime .In other words , Kov\u00e1cs devotes insufficient attention to the political discourses of more recent years when such intellectual oppositions seem to have lost much of their political relevance .In the meantime , the currently ruling Fidesz introduced a new activist conception of conservative politics and largely succeeded in changing the terms of debate through their anti - Communist nationalism .As Kov\u00e1cs explains in chapter 2 , early quantitative research into antisemitism showed that around 10 percent of the Hungarian population could be considered \" consciously antisemitic \" while around one - quarter could be described as prejudiced against Jews ( pp .39 , 48 ) .At the same time , only 7 percent of the latter group , i.e. , 1 - 2 percent of the total population , consisted of what the author calls integrated members of society who could be susceptible to what he calls political forms of antisemitism ( p. 79 ) .While debates on the \" Jewish question \" and antisemitism recurrently preoccupied the Hungarian public already at this time , none of these results were exceptional by international standards .The data even shows comparatively high levels of sympathy toward Jews in Hungary ( see pp .32 - 33 , 67 ) .According to the result of the 1995 survey , Kov\u00e1cs notes , attitudes were more important as explanatory factors of antisemitism than place of residence or social economic resources .While strong national sentiments had a serious effect on antisemitism and conservatives were considerably more antisemitic than the average , ideological factors accounted only moderately for antisemitism .At the same time , latent pressures turned out to be much greater among left - wingers : as their political camp was anti - antisemitic , leftists judged the freedom to be antisemitic to be much more restricted .Kov\u00e1cs subsequently explains that the structure of the causal model accounting for antisemitism in Hungary was greatly simplified by 2002 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.82778"}
{"text": "It emerged as a moral revival movement in nineteenth - century Lithuania , which was then characterized by a Jewish intellectual culture like none other in Jewish history .Traditionalist , Lithuanian Jewish rabbis of the era were best known for their truly single - minded focus on the study of Talmud and codes of Jewish law .Scholarship was their highest value ; other modes of Jewish piety and practice were highly suspect .Though they accepted all of the commandments required by Jewish law , they made it clear that the ideal form of behavior was the highly intellectual study of traditional rabbinic texts .Such study was seen as sufficient for guaranteeing proper moral character and reverence for God , sometimes because of the supernatural powers ascribed to it , but also because of a conviction that knowledge of moral ideals is the essence of moral education .From within this culture , in the middle of the nineteenth century , emerged a small group of traditionalist rabbis who challenged it .The pietistic Musar movement , led by Rabbi Israel Salanter ( 1810 - 1883 ) , argued that the intellectual study of texts was necessary but insufficient for the development of virtue .He contended that the intellect , with its limited strength , can not easily uproot the bad moral habits that are planted deeply in human hearts .Salanter and his disciples suggested that character education requires supplementing conventional study with a range of practices that can help a person to identify moral struggles and bring discipline , \" musar , \" to wayward appetites and emotions .Moreover , they encouraged individuals to design personalized exercises , tailored to their own natures and targeting their own problematic character traits .The Musar movement 's leaders sought to focus the Jewish people on the cultivation of virtues - qualities including love , justice , compassion , generosity , reverence , faith , humility , equanimity , and patience - and they argued that such virtues are not easily acquired .They saw moral development as requiring constant labor - ongoing introspection and continual efforts to improve one 's character traits .But , as Salanter observed , all people resist making these sorts of efforts .Businesspeople may devote great energy to selling their products , he noted , and scholars may devote great energy to making sense of scriptural passages , but few people devote much effort to the \" work of Musar\"-to the work of improving moral character .Indeed , relatively few of Salanter 's contemporaries wanted to make such efforts .Salanter 's attempts to create a mass movement focused on Musar were largely unsuccessful , though the Musar movement was successful enough to provoke an outspoken opposition .Traditionalists in Lithuania argued in favor of the established , intellectually focused model of moral education , and liberalizing Jews argued in favor of more modern , Western European approaches to education .Traditionalists also opposed the Musar movement 's sectarianism and its focus on social criticism , while liberals opposed its theological orthodoxy and its sometimes - fanatical pietism .Over time , the movement made some inroads in traditionalist academies , and it gained a positive reputation among Jews in general , but by and large it remained a sectarian movement within Eastern European Orthodoxy that had little impact on Jewish culture on the whole .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.88414"}

{"text": "The summary of this report on European antisemitism published by the European Union Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia ( EUMC ) , which covered the first half of 2002 , said : .France , Belgium , the Netherlands and the UK witnessed rather serious antisemitic incidents such as numerous physical attacks and insults directed against Jews and the vandalism of Jewish institutions ( synagogues , shops , cemeteries ) .[ 2 ] .Statistics on antisemitic incidents in the Netherlands over the past six years show an overall level much higher than in previous decades .When analyzing the various types of antisemitism including anti - Israelism one has to keep in mind that the Netherlands is not a country of extremes or major uncontrolled violence .Any analysis of a phenomenon such as antisemitism , thus has to be nuanced .National Characteristics .Before analyzing the nature and manifestations of antisemitism in the Netherlands , one should understand the country 's characteristics , in particular those of its political debate and culture .Over the centuries , the Netherlands ' major constant enemy has been the sea .A large part of the Dutch population lives in dried areas below sea - level , behind dikes , in polders .Until a few years ago , it was agreed that the country was governed by a poldermodel .Its underlying metaphor is a legacy of the past , when the dikes were in danger due to floods .All those living behind it had to collaborate according to agreed principles in order to prevent its collapse .Though mainly used in the economic arena , the poldermodel approach reflects Dutch society at large .Disagreeing parties make efforts to reach a broad consensus on important issues .In order to do so they discuss matters as long as necessary .This also explains why the Dutch like to find practical solutions to problems without defining ideological or intellectual positions too sharply .The country 's prevailing culture is frequently defined as a praatcultuur ( talking culture ) .One example of the poldermodel is that the establishment of coalition governments may take several months .Thereafter the coalition partners are supposed to stick to what has been agreed .It fits the country 's culture that no political party after the war has obtained anything close to a majority .A Culture of Permissiveness .A second defining element in the Dutch societal culture has been that many transgressions or near - transgressions of the law are tolerated .This is called gedoogcultuur ( the culture of permissiveness ) .It has become synonymous with \" closing one 's eyes \" to multiple transgressions of the law .In its most simple form , this has meant , for instance , that the police did not intervene when cyclists rode through a red traffic light , even when it was forbidden .It was considered better to permit minor transgressions in order not to overload the police and justice apparatus .This culture was prominent in the attitude toward disparate matters such as soft drug use , immigration policies , industrial safety , and some transgressions of the law on euthanasia .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.3692"}

{"text": "In general , there is a considerable amount of Hebrew in the synagogue services .Conservative Judaism is often seen , perhaps unfairly , as the middle ground between Orthodoxy on its right and Reform and Reconstructionism on its left .Conservative rabbis will not perform or attend an intermarriage , that is a marriage between someone born Jewish and an unconverted Gentile .A marriage between a born Jew and a born Gentile who has converted to Judaism is a Jewish marriage and not an intermarriage , so a Conservative rabbi will perform such a marriage .Conservative rabbis require a male convert to undergo a circumcision or a ceremony of drawing a drop of blood if a circumcision has already been performed , immersion in a ritual bath , and appearance before a religious court .Women converts must also be immersed in a ritual bath and appear before a religious court .( See the section \" The Conversion Process \" for further details ) .Conservative rabbis generally recognize the conversions performed by other rabbis as long as these ritualistic requirements have been met .There is not one on - line site for the whole of Conservative Judaism .Like other movements , Conservative Judaism is made up of various organizations .These include , for example , the Rabbinical Assembly , the association of Conservative rabbis and United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism which is the association of Conservative congregations .The major rabbinical seminary for the movement is the Jewish Theological Seminary .ORTHODOX JUDAISM Orthodox Judaism is a relatively small movement , making up about 10 per cent of those Jews who affiliate .Orthodox Jews accept the halachah but , unlike Conservative Jews , Orthodox Jews do not believe that the halachah itself can evolve .Orthodoxy accepts the idea that the 613 mitzvot in the Torah are binding on all Jews .They believe that God literally gave the Torah to Moses and therefore its rules are divine and must be obeyed .Because of this , the Orthodox are the most traditional of Jewish groups .There often is a barrier between men and women at services .There are no Orthodox women rabbis .In practice , Orthodox Jews tend to observe Jewish law on such matters as keeping the Sabbath and keeping kosher .The Orthodox requirements for conversion are the same as those of Conservative Judaism .The crucial difference is that Orthodox rabbis generally do not recognize conversions performed by non - Orthodox rabbis .This fact has caused considerable friction within the Jewish community , and it is important for potential converts to be aware of the problem .The difficulty arises in limited cases .Here is an example : a born Gentile mother was converted by a non - Orthodox rabbi and is married to a Jewish man .Their children , raised as Jews , considered by their community to be Jews , are not considered Jewish by Orthodox rabbis .( The children of Jewish mothers are considered Jewish ) .Therefore , if that child wanted to marry someone Orthodox , an Orthodox rabbi would refuse to perform the marriage without an Orthodox conversion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.92745"}

{"text": "The Musar movement also appeals to Americans because of the way it directly addresses individuals as individuals .While on the one hand Musar is hardly individualist in its focus - it seeks to train individuals to overcome self - centeredness and to be highly responsive to the needs of others - it is very much an individual spiritual discipline .Musar demands that each person focus on one 's particular moral situation , work on the particular character traits with which one struggles , and find the particular practices that work for him or her .Morinis emphasizes that \" Musar practice is always geared to the uniqueness of the individual , \" as each person needs to discover how to most effectively bring about \" deep and lasting spiritual change .\" We should utilize the Musar practices that proved to be effective in previous generations but , in the final analysis , \" different practices will work better for some and not others .\" 11 Visualizations designed to strengthen patience might be essential for a person who struggles with patience , but not particularly useful for a person who is naturally patient and who has other , more pressing character traits to attend to .Such an emphasis on finding what works is not unique to contemporary Musar teachers ; Israel Salanter taught that individuals must find whatever practices can help them to overcome the particular vices with which they struggle .The nineteenth - century Musar movement encouraged each person to find particular \" stratagems \" that would work for him or her , which would inevitably depend on his or her nature and character .The practice of Musar must , in part , be tailored to the individual .To be sure , Salanter taught that such personally tailored practices must be supplementary to aspects of practice required by Jewish law , binding upon all Jews .Stone continues this traditional emphasis in his teaching , but in Morinis 's writing , there is much less talk of binding law and more emphasis on finding a personalized approach .This is deeply appealing to contemporary American Jews , who are little interested in submitting to communal norms or commandments but who are deeply interested in selecting religious practices that \" work . \" Many of the particular practices of Musar are appealing in and of themselves - American Jews are attracted to therapeutic exercises that help them to understand themselves better , and they see music , meditation , and conversations with friends as particularly attractive spiritual activities .12 The Musar movement 's encouragement of these sorts of activities , and its pragmatic willingness to adopt whatever activities \" work \" to make us into better people , make it an attractive model for contemporary Americans , even if they would rather avoid its more demanding aspects .Musar is also appealing today insofar as it offers a way for Jews to engage with the Jewish tradition outside of conventional communal structures .As Cohen and Eisen show , Jews have limited enthusiasm for communal institutions and certainly for synagogues ; even those who do attend synagogue services tend to find more meaningful Jewish experiences in private settings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.89688"}

Although I know that many of its members are sincere in their desire to pray in this unusual way ; and simply want to be left alone to do so , I can not say the same thing for WoW 's leadership .They have consistently been quoted as having the real goal of religious tolerance , pluralism , and mostly feminism .WoW is simply a clever means so get this done .They have found a way to technically not violate Halacha and thereby recruit the left wing segments of Orthodoxy to support them .And as this new development shows , they are gaining traction .That feminism is at the core of this issue is not mere speculation .For these leaders this is a feminist issue .The New Republic has a lengthy article pointing to WoW as the \" highest example of the renewed fighting feminist spirit in Israel \" .They describe this as a new alliance between left wing Orthodox feminist groups like Kolech and the Reform movement 's IRAC ( Israel Religious Action Center ) .( I should add that such coalitions were bred by some of the more disgusting attacks by extremist Charedim against non Charedim .Attacks that seem to be coming with more frequency these days .Reading about the multiple attacks against Nili Philipp , a Dati Leumi religious woman living in Bet Shemesh , made my blood boil .And this happened a year after 8 year old Naama Margolese was attacked by the same kind of people !This is a far bigger problem in my view that has yet to be properly addressed - but it is beyond the scope of this post . )The more public opposition WoW gets from the right , the more support it will gain from the left .Left Wing Orthodox organizations like Yeshivat Chovevei Torah whose founder and leaders have rejected the ruling by Rav Soloveitchik about joining heterodox movements on religious issues and now enthusiastically joins them - have added Orthodox legitimacy to WoW 's ranks .So a Rabbi on the far left of Orthodoxy will feel very comfortable joining WoW in their quest for equal rights at the Kotel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.08205"}

{"text": "I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws .One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws .Conversely , one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws ... .Now , what is the difference between the two ?How does one determine whether a law is just or unjust ?A just law is a man made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God .An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the moral law .To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas : An unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law .Any law that uplifts human personality is just .Any law that degrades human personality is unjust .All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality .It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority .Segregation , to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber , substitutes an \" I it \" relationship for an \" I thou \" relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status of things .Hence segregation is not only politically , economically and sociologically unsound , it is morally wrong and sinful .In light of King 's words , it is worth noting that the rise of Nazism in Germany was facilitated by largely \" legal \" means - through a myriad of laws and regulations that successfully segregated them from the rest of German society .King himself pointed this out in his letter when he wrote : .We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was \" legal ... \" It was \" illegal \" to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler 's Germany .Even so , I am sure that , had I lived in Germany at the time , I would have aided and comforted my Jewish brothers .In this regard , Dr. King 's insight might well inspire us to commemorate this sacred day by redoubling our resolve to eradicate laws that segregate peoples on the basis of their national , ethnic or religious identities .Segregated Shuhada street in Hebron , February 2012 ( photo : Hithabrut - Tarabut ) .While it pains me to say it , I can not help but note that the very country that first established Holocaust Remembrance Day itself enforces its own form of legal segregation between Jews and non - Jews .As one Israeli observer wrote in Ha'aretz five years ago , \" Segregation of Jews and Arabs in Israel ... is almost absolute . \"In the West Bank , Jews and non - Jews are segregated by separate legal systems , separate roads , separate transportation systems , and in some cases , separate sidewalks .And in Gaza , Palestinians are segregated from the outside world entirely .I have no doubt that there will be those who consider it unseemly of me - or worse - to point this out on Yom Hashoah of all days .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.89182"}
