{"text": "The Fall of 1968 was characterized by social upheaval throughout the nation and the world , with universities serving as hubs for political activity and discourse .Mexican - American students at the UW , few as they were , organized in ways that reverberated widely .[19 ] No longer satisfied with the second - class status they had experienced with their families as laborers , students began to radically reconceptualize their identities .They began to write their own histories from their own perspectives at the university , renaming themselves Chicanos , a Nahuatl term that expressed their self - determination , strength , and pride in their heritage .Having already possessed an understanding of the plight of farm workers from their communities , Chicano / a students could not separate their student struggles for representation , respect , and empowerment at the university with the exploitation of farm workers in their communities .Modeled after the group that was founded at the University of Southern California in 1967 , the UW UMAS worked to establish a Mexican - American Studies class through the College of Arts & Sciences .This class would educated others about the history of Mexicans in the U.S. , a history which before had always been told from a white male perspective .UMAS also engaged in a campaign to halt the sale of non - union table grapes at the University of Washington .However , efforts to persuade the Husky Union Building ( HUB ) to cooperate proved more difficult .[21 ] Nevertheless , on February 17 , 1969 the UW Grape Boycott Committee was victorious , as the HUB officially halted the sale of grapes .[ 22 ] The victory made the University of Washington the first campus in the United States to remove grapes entirely from its eating facilities .At the national level , the grape boycott organized by the UFWOC achieved success in 1970 , when the union finally won a contract .Even more notable was the UMAS ' skill at building coalitions among other activist student groups , especially the Black Student Union , as evidenced by the diverse array of student groups on the boycott committee .[ 23 ] In fact , the BSU was the reason why Chicanos were on campus in the first place .Through minority recruitment programs , black students went to the fields of Yakima valley to recruit ethnic Mexicans to the university .As the University of Washington Daily mentions , \" In all of these activities , UMAS has the full support of the BSU .The Chicanos are fully aware that most of them would n't be here if it had n't been for the BSU 's successful drive for and execution of a minority recruitment program .The UMAS - BSU alliance is fairly tangible .The BSU welcomes a UMAS representative ...And three BSU officers attended the UMAS conference held in Toppenish during vacation .The Chicanos say , ' The two groups give each other mutual help - time , effort , funds and active support .

Forum ( AGIF ) , which was formed by returning Mexican American veterans , joined in the efforts by other civil rights organizations .[ 2 ] The AGIF first received national exposure when it took on the cause of Felix Longoria , a Mexican American serviceman who was denied funeral services in his hometown of Three Rivers , Texas after being killed during WWII .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "43.67075"}

Chavez .And our own M.E.Ch .A de CSUN led by Professor Acu\u00f1a have done quite well in struggling for Raza Studies and in combating the blatant racists who have scapegoated our Raza as the people responsible for this nation 's severe economic and social problems .Unfortunately , too many critics believe that Chicana / o Studies is where the brown and poor students learn to HATE white people .In his multilingual poetic manifesto \" Pensamiento Serpentino , \" Valdez calls for a nonviolent revolution and shift in political consciousness .In this way , the label Chicana / o is neither limited to U.S. born Hispanics or Latinas / os or to people of exclusively Mexican and/or Central American heritage born in the United States .Instead , to call oneself Chicano requires a serious and lifelong commitment to social justice and civil right struggle which we hope to develop in this graduate seminar .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.48168"}

Garcia founded the American GI Forum and was later appointed to the United States Commission on Civil Rights .In Denver , Rodolfo \" Corky \" Gonzalez helped define the meaning of being a Chicano through his poem Yo Soy Joaquin ( I am Joaquin )[ 2 ] .In California , C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez and the farm workers turned to the struggle of urban youth , and created political awareness and participated in La Raza Unida Party .Some women who worked for the Chicano movement felt that members were being too concerned with social issues that affected the Chicano community , instead of addressing problems that affected Chicana women specifically .This led Chicana women to form the Comisi\u00f3n Femenil Mexicana Nacional .In 1975 , it became involved in the case Madrigal vs. Quilligan , obtaining a moratorium on the compulsory sterilization of women and adoption of bilingual consent forms .These steps were necessary because many Hispanic women who did not understand English well were being sterilized in the United States at the time , without proper consent .[ 7 ] [ 8 ] .A major element of the Movement was the burgeoning of Chicano art fueled by heightened political activism and energized cultural pride .Chicano visual art , music , literature , dance , theater and other forms of expression have flourished .During the 20th century , an emergence of Chicano expression developed into a full - scale Chicano Art Movement .Chicanos developed a wealth of cultural expression through such media as painting , drawing , sculpture and printmaking .Similarly , novels , poetry , short stories , essays and plays have flowed from the pens of contemporary Chicano writers .Chicano , Mexican - American , and Hispanic cultural centers , theaters , film festivals , museums , galleries and numerous other arts and cultural organizations have also grown in number and impact since this time .The Chicano Art Movement also opened a gate for women Chicanas who felt oppressed by Chicano men , or the Chicano Movement in general .In 1949 and 1950 , the American G.I. Forum initiated local \" pay your poll tax \" drives to register Mexican American voters .Although they were unable to repeal the poll tax , their efforts did bring in new Hispanic voters who would begin to elect Latino representatives to the Texas House of Representatives and to Congress during the late 1950s and early 1960s .[ 9 ] .In California , a similar phenomenon took place .When World War II veteran Edward R.

Rosen , the agency 's former senior environmental planner and cultural resource specialist and a champion of the park . \"Clearly , mural art is not something they knew how to deal with .\" The murals are a powerful blend of politics , myth and history - looming images of Mayan ruins , triumphant Mexican heroes , contemporary themes like farm labor and poverty .In \" Colossus , \" an early mural by Torero and others , the figure of Atlas appears to be straining under the weight of the Coronado Bridge .\" This is our movement symbolically represented , embodying the tremendous effort of the community , \" Torero explained .With restoration now under way , a festive mood resembling a barn raising is inhabiting the park .On a recent weekend , working artists , some hoisted on boom lifts to reach the tops of pillars , were joined by hip - hop dancers , families eating carne asada and men listening to scratchy Mexican romance music on an old record player teetering on a plastic stool .Among the artists was Rosette , who now lives in Taos , N.M. , and has just finished restoring \" Chicano Park Takeover , \" a three - month effort that included three weeks of cleaning the concrete by hand .He noted the tools of his trade - paints , gels and sealants - have made big technical leaps since the 1970s .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.760452"}

{"text": "This is the subject of Sweet Nata , a memoir about familial traditions and the joys and hardships the author experienced in her youth .Set during the 1950s and 1960s in Mora and Corrales , New Mexico , Zamora reveals her interaction with her parents , grandparents , and other extended family members who had the greatest influence on her life .She paints a picture of native New Mexican culture and history for younger generations that will also be nostalgic for older generations .Examined in this volume is the neglected field of Mexican history at the regional level during Porfirio Di\u00adaz 's long rule .The panorama of regional perspectives and center - periphery relationships includes essays on eight states that combine original research and synthesis .These chapters present political , economic , and social developments in specific regions , based on long - ignored archival materials and new points of view .An introductory chapter gives an overview of the period , and the final two chapters respectively indicate promising opportunities for additional research and provide a selection of suggested readings .This collection is an exotic , aphrodisiacal perfume wafting through the senses , thickly spiced by the dual nature of a poet whose culture and experience effortlessly blend concrete imagery with a quiet , fierce longing for a world that may only exist within memory -- or verse .Jessica Helen Lopez sings in these poems ; they are signal flares drawn from those pivotal moments of living that evoke the feminine , the sensual and the surreal in equal measure .These are the songs of the bruja , the bread - heavy hands of a mother , the beautiful indignation of a hopeless optimist . '--Zachary Kluckman .Between 1539 and 1542 , some two thousand people under Spanish leadership , mostly Indians from central and western Mexico , made an armed reconnaissance of a place they knew by the name Tierra Nueva , now the American Southwest .They intended to seize control of the people who lived there , in places called Ca\u00adbola , Marata , Totonteac , Tiguex , Tusayan , and Quivira .The expedition eventually failed and most of those who survived returned to Nueva Esparza disillusioned and heavily in debt .They left in their wake dislocation and destruction , and their disruptive presence set the stage for further friction when the Spaniards next entered the region .This book examines the environmental and cultural impact of the Coronado expedition while also placing it in the context of what was happening in Mexico as Spain expanded west and north of Mexico City .Including multidisciplinary studies by archaeologists , historians , and others , the volume gives a much fuller biographical account of the actual members of the expedition as well as a clearer understanding of how and where this large assemblage moved each day .In 1560 , General Pedro de Urs _ _ led an expedition through the Amazon in search of El Dorado .Three months later , Ursaa was murdered .His replacement , Fernando de Guzman , was also murdered .Emerging from the chaos was the Biscayan Lope de Aguirre , who turned away from El Dorado and led his men to Peru to overthrow the royal forces and declare independence from the Spanish Crown .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.640953"}

{"text": "Blea writes , \" researchers must be vigilant and well informed before entering the field \" ( p. 46 ) .Vigilant about what ?Although the author 's writing style is simple and accessible in terms of vocabulary , Blea 's narrative degenerates into colloquial phrases , convoluted sentences , and repeated use of passive instead of active sentences .This reduces the agency of some of the subjects she wishes to empower .For example , under the bold section - heading \" Shoving the Paradigm , \" Blea writes , \" Biographies of women and much Chicana poetry appeared \" ( p. 81 ) .This passive \" appearance \" of Chicana scholarship hardly indicates the agency and hard work of Chicana scholars and certainly does not indicate a \" shove .\" The colloquial nature of her sentences also detracts from the text .Blea writes , \" At one time I had gone to the archives to do research on some dead people \" ( p. 83 ) .As well , Blea 's sentences consistently refer to an idea presented in a prior passage and draw conclusions without analysis--\"The consequence of this resistance is poverty \" ( p. 68 ) .This writing style creates an unstable trajectory of thought and disables such paragraphs from standing on their own narrative integrity .Similarly , although Blea provides several bold headings to provide organization throughout the text , the discussions often do not engage the heading and are curiously buried inside another topic .In a discussion of \" environmental issues , \" Blea introduces \" la virgin de Guadalupe \" ( not la virgen ) without explicit explanation of her connection to the environment ( p. 138 ) .In fact , whole discussions , such as \" social space \" and \" theory and practice , \" occur in chapters other than those that bear these titles .Although this could be explained as healthy slippage in the dynamic subject of Chicana / o research , these misplaced passages occur without textual cognizance .As such , the reader must continually remind herself / himself what section and chapter is being read .Blea indicates in the introduction that she directs a gendered lens to the communities ( or really community ) under study .The author accurately writes , \" Chicana feminism is incorporated because Chicano Studies and the civil rights movement , which so heavily influenced Chicano Studies , have been inappropriately characterized as male \" ( p. xii ) .As well , Blea states that \" Gender , as well as sexual orientation , influences [ sic ] every aspect of life , including the research process that permeates how the community is conceptualized and studied \" ( p. xiii ) .However , the author 's treatment of gender and sexuality , like other topics in the text , is generalized , often superficial , and at times reaffirms dynamics she wishes to subvert .Most obvious is Blea 's constant reference to \" la Chicana \" as the terminology to describe Chicanas in the United States .Blea 's \" la Chicana \" denies the heterogeneity within Chicana communities and reduces the dialogue to a singular Chicana who somehow represents the multivalent experiences of Chicanas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.745895"}
{"text": "--Zachary Kluckman .Between 1539 and 1542 , some two thousand people under Spanish leadership , mostly Indians from central and western Mexico , made an armed reconnaissance of a place they knew by the name Tierra Nueva , now the American Southwest .They intended to seize control of the people who lived there , in places called Ca\u00adbola , Marata , Totonteac , Tiguex , Tusayan , and Quivira .The expedition eventually failed and most of those who survived returned to Nueva Esparza disillusioned and heavily in debt .They left in their wake dislocation and destruction , and their disruptive presence set the stage for further friction when the Spaniards next entered the region .This book examines the environmental and cultural impact of the Coronado expedition while also placing it in the context of what was happening in Mexico as Spain expanded west and north of Mexico City .Including multidisciplinary studies by archaeologists , historians , and others , the volume gives a much fuller biographical account of the actual members of the expedition as well as a clearer understanding of how and where this large assemblage moved each day .In 1560 , General Pedro de Urs _ _ led an expedition through the Amazon in search of El Dorado .Three months later , Ursaa was murdered .His replacement , Fernando de Guzman , was also murdered .Emerging from the chaos was the Biscayan Lope de Aguirre , who turned away from El Dorado and led his men to Peru to overthrow the royal forces and declare independence from the Spanish Crown .When Aguirre was finally killed , the aftermath was astonishing : hundreds dead , entire towns .depopulated , and a nascent revolution quashed .Deliberately provocative , Evan Balkan 's The Wrath of God examines Aguirre , a symbol of Basque fury and rampage , arguing that Aguirre 's historical representation as a one - dimensional madman deserves revisiting .Indeed , Aguirre may be the Americas ' first true revolutionary , a view shared by Simon Boli\u00advar , among others .2011 marks the 450th anniversary of one of the most extraordinary and least known events in the history of the Americas , and Balkan 's work offers a timely investigation into the revolutionary 's life and controversial methods .First published in 1555 , Cabeza de Vaca 's narrative of his South American expeditions is a detailed account of his five years as governor of Spain 's province of the Rio de la Plata in South America .Cabeza de Vaca was already a celebrated explorer by the time he went to La Plata , known for his great trek across North America in the 1520s and 1530s and for the Relaci\u00c3\u00b3n he wrote about that journey .His tales of his river and forest explorations in South America show that he had lost none of his early curiosity and drive .He was the great secular champion of the native peoples of the New World and the only Spaniard to explore the coasts and interiors of two continents .This book is one of the great first - person accounts of the Spanish conquest of the Americas in the sixteenth century .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.9539"}

{"text": "This thoughtful bilingual book helps them understand the abstract concept of largescale sickness and appreciate the role children play in the health of their community .It introduces young readers to a fascinating aspect of southwest history , and invites discussion of folk medicine and science , while also addressing children 's curiosities and fears .Through the eyes of the protagonist Jose Amado ' Amadito ' Domi\u00adnguez a real child of the flu epidemic era who would later become Taos County 's first nuevomexicano physician -- folklorist Lamadrid weaves together culture , history , mortality , and hope into a life - affirming lesson .Raised in a Mexican home in an Anglo neighborhood , David Sanchez was fair - skinned and fluent in Spanish and English when he entered kindergarten .None of this should have had any influence on the career path he chose , but at certain moments it did .With the birth of the Chicano Movement and affirmative action , a different and sometimes disturbing significance became attached to his name .Sanchez 's story chronicles his life and those moments .No matter how we transcend our origins , they remain part of our lives .This autobiography of an outstanding mathematician , dedicated to others , whose career included stints as a senior university and federal administrator , is also the story of a young man of mixed Mexican and American parentage .Grandparents are our teachers , our allies , and a great source of love .They supply endless stories that connect us to a past way of life and to people long gone -- people who led ordinary lives , but were full of extraordinary teachings .This is the subject of Sweet Nata , a memoir about familial traditions and the joys and hardships the author experienced in her youth .Set during the 1950s and 1960s in Mora and Corrales , New Mexico , Zamora reveals her interaction with her parents , grandparents , and other extended family members who had the greatest influence on her life .She paints a picture of native New Mexican culture and history for younger generations that will also be nostalgic for older generations .Examined in this volume is the neglected field of Mexican history at the regional level during Porfirio Di\u00adaz 's long rule .The panorama of regional perspectives and center - periphery relationships includes essays on eight states that combine original research and synthesis .These chapters present political , economic , and social developments in specific regions , based on long - ignored archival materials and new points of view .An introductory chapter gives an overview of the period , and the final two chapters respectively indicate promising opportunities for additional research and provide a selection of suggested readings .This collection is an exotic , aphrodisiacal perfume wafting through the senses , thickly spiced by the dual nature of a poet whose culture and experience effortlessly blend concrete imagery with a quiet , fierce longing for a world that may only exist within memory -- or verse .Jessica Helen Lopez sings in these poems ; they are signal flares drawn from those pivotal moments of living that evoke the feminine , the sensual and the surreal in equal measure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.20849"}

{"text": "You should take notes on all reading assignments and are encouraged to ask additional questions and/or seek clarification on material that is covered .This experience is a groups project with mutual cooperation from the class , instructor , and discussion leader .Constructive criticism and a mutual respect and professionalism is always expected especially in evaluating each other 's creative work and scholarly presentations .What actually happens when you write a pr\u00e9cis ?First , you must understand the complete work so that you can abstract the central argument and express it cogently and completely .Next , you must develop the argument exactly as the writer has presented it AND reduce the work by 75 - 80 % of its size .Of course , this is possible when you consider exactly how you \" learn \" to critically read the work .The key word here is assimilation .When you read the material , it is probable that you will understand only those parts which have associations within your own experience ( intellectual , emotional , physical , cultural , class , gender , sexuality etc . ) .How you actually go about writing a precis depends largely on your ability to restate the writer 's central ideas after you have assimilated them in your own mind .Here are the rules of the game : .a. Read all of the articles as many times as necessary most carefully and critically .b. Write a pr\u00e9cis for your article in which you state the entire argument and present the logical progression ( the development ) of the critical argument as clearly and cogently as possible .c. Reduce the article to one - fifth to one - quarter of its original length and omit nothing from the essential argument .This is , in reality , the key to the whole enterprise !d. Type the pr\u00e9cis and begin with your abstraction of the central , inform - ing idea of the article .Having understood and written the central idea , present the essential argument in as cogent manner as possible .( Clue : Once you have assimilated the article through the musical illustrations , notated transcriptions and examples the writer uses to make his / her abstract ideas concrete , you do not have to include these in your pr\u00e9cis ! )e. Here is a central rule : Do not copy a single sentence from the article !This assignment is not easy !When you have completed it well , you will never , never forget the arguments , the examples , and the development of the articles .Assessment : Students are expected to have completed all of the weekly reading assignments before coming to class and have prepared notes and questions for the discussion leader .Many of the works are discussed in terms of aesthetics , emotional content and impact , rehearsal preparation and final presentation , enthusiasm and performance ability , musical , theatrical , and dance talent and exceptionalism .Discussions should attempt to make broader conceptual connections across the arts and through aesthetics .Students read current scholarship , criticism , and ethnography devoted to the role of the humanities in the expression of ethnicity , class , gender , sexuality , spirituality , identity , and nationalism among the diasporic and diverse communities throughout Greater Mexico and the Southwestern Borderlands .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.625916"}

' and so on .This happens with almost all children at some point during their upbringing .The issue becomes more challenging when children enter into their adolescence with an array of teenage matters taking centre stage , from boy - girl relationships to the ever - changing fashions of the day .This can create commotion in most families , especially within those that suffer from instability , weak parental relationships and poor parenting .It takes strong moral authority and persuasive power from parents and adults to keep children interested , motivated and inspired .Motivation and theory is very important in academic research and organisational performance .What motivates some to altruistically serve others with time , energy and hard - earned money ?What is it that motivates people in their actions ; is it an urge for personal fulfilment , a desire for fame or just benevolence to others ?Does this urge come from one 's human instinct , sympathy for others , patriotic fervour , ideological commitment , religious zeal or spiritual solace ?Why do some people have this ' fire ' in them , while most others do not even bother beyond their own sphere ?Motivation is very complex .It is what causes us to act or ' get going ' .It is defined as ' the process that initiates , guides and maintains goal oriented behaviours . 'Motivation is the inner urge that involves biological , emotional , social and cognitive forces that activate our behaviour .Various triggers , inner or external , work to bring motivation in us .Material reward and sanction are important for some , but others are motivated regardless .The issue of faith and religion become pertinent at this point .For believers it is the reward of God 's mercy and penalty of His justice that acts as a motivater .In the Muslim faith , Islam , meaning ' peace ' through ' wilful surrender to God ' , motivates Muslims to behave righteously , serve people and sacrifice for the truth .In his phenomenal book Islam Between East and West , the great Bosnian philosopher and politician , Alija Ali Izetbegovi\u0107 , rightly proclaimed ' Islam , thy name is surrender . 'However , for people of a higher level of religious spirituality it is the Divine Love , or love of God demanding a total surrender to Him , that motivates them .In Islamic history Rabia Basri in the 8th century and Jalaluddin Rumi in the 13th century spread the love of God that reverberates in the Muslim world .Rabia Basri used to pray ; ' O God !", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.80028"}

{"text": "Mexican American college youth , quite logically , no longer viewed unionization as the only goal .Rather , as college students they criticized racism in college recruitment and the lack of courses on the Mexican American experience .Corona articulates some of the tensions that existed within the Chicano community in the late-1960s , conflicts which historians have as yet failed to analyze .Corona 's account is valuable as an example of the political impact of multiculturalism .Corona grew up speaking Spanish and English and seems to have had few problems adjusting to mainstream society .Precisely because of his comfort in both the Mexican and Anglo societies he became an effective union organizer .His multiculturalism began very early and shaped his political views throughout his life .For example , the 1930s Corona read Jack London 's account of the life of Joe Rivers , a Mexican campesino who joined Pancho Villa 's forces in the Mexican Revolution after his wife was raped and killed by federal troops .During the war , he became a prizefighter in El Paso and donated his winnings to the revolution .Corona remembered that Rivers delivered ice to his family after retiring from boxing .The strong impression London 's story had on Corona suggests how political activism often springs from the interaction of ethnicities and cultures in the United States .Unfortunately , the account 's portrayal of Corona 's success as an organizer overshadows almost all other aspects of his life .Perhaps the book 's relative silence on such personal matters reflects the collaborators ' effort to produce an \" oppositional history .\"Because they believe the account must serve that role , there is little room to explore cultural issues that do not directly relate to discrimination , unionization , community organizing , and politics .Despite this shortcoming , Corona 's history is valuable because it represents a first - hand account of many important historical developments that directly affected the Mexican American community .Sanchez 's Becoming Mexican American is similarly valuable for its wide - ranging approach .Sanchez 's study is the most wide - ranging history of an urban Mexican American community now available .He succeeds in synthesizing an impressive amount of secondary material and fills out the history with numerous facts culled from primary sources .Sanchez skillfully compares the Mexican - American experience with the current literature in the fields of American social and ethnic history .On occasion Sanchez offers new insights .For example , he notes that Los Angeles Chicano gangs originated partly from youth clubs formed by Protestant reformers seeking to inculcate leadership among Mexican Americans .Sometimes he promises more than he can deliver .For example , though he suggests he will discuss the impact of the repatriation on those who remained behind he never accomplishes that goal .When considered together , these books interact in interesting ways .His friendships with white organizers and his reading of works by white authors , rather than producing a desire to assimilate , helped motivate his efforts to ensure that all workers were treated fairly and equitably .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.372375"}

{"text": "But if I worship You for Your Own sake , grudge me not Your everlasting Beauty . 'Love of the Divine thus creates deeply rooted motivation .But how do we motivate ourselves and our children in our mundane life , day in day out ?Here are a few ideas ; .Create a deeper and loving relationship with your children .There is no alternative to a loving relationship with your children in motivating them .Men and women have unique personalities designed to complement each other for the benefit of the family and the children .Parenting is a joint responsibility and parents should know how and when to harmonise each other while dealing with their children and addressing any concerns with their behaviour .Build a positive home and community environment .A positive home environment , where love , respect , sharing and caring are abundant , is the source of motivation for a growing child .Home is the basic human organisation and a positive home culture , like positive culture in an organisation , motivates its members .Be role models to your children .Parents genuinely expect their children to grow as motivated individuals ; it is vital they themselves become motivated role models .All children want to see their parents practice what they preach .In the days where celebrity role models are beamed in through the media , parents should remain living role models , and present in their everyday lives .As children grow , the mother and father should be the practical role models to their daughters and sons .Look for positive features in your children and praise them .Every one of us has distinctive strengths and weaknesses naturally .Parents should be able to cultivate the positive features in their children and use them to motivate .This is how a child 's self - esteem will grow and how their confidence will rise .We should not undermine our children 's worth for their occasional misdemeanours .Give full attention to your children .Children are born out of our love and every child deserves our special attention .Children should know that they are exceptionally dear to their parents ; they should get full attention for whatever demand they come up with so that they feel worthy .Link them with your family and ethnic roots .One important responsibility , especially when dealing with teenage children , is to link them with their roots .This gives them confidence in their identity and a sense of continuity . \"To remain ignorant of things that happened before you were born is to remain a child \" , observed Cicero .This is a powerful and telling statement .A people neglectful of their history is like a person suffering from dementia ; without a sense of belonging or roots they find it difficult to have a direction in life .This is why all developed nations ensure history is one of the most important curricula in their school education system .Religious texts , such as the Qur'an , have given special attention to history and the knowledge that can be drawn from it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.04048"}

{"text": "What does a leader who \" looks like you \" look like ?What kinds of role models do our colleagues benefit from finding ?A few days ago , at the CES2012 Women in Tech panel discussion , senior women from Google , Flickr , Cisco and CNET , discussed role models .Jay Greene 's report offers an intuitively plausible example of how social barriers can affect men and women differently , underscoring the importance of visible women .A challenge for many young women in the [ technology ] industry is that it can be hard for them to reach out to older male colleagues to ask advice .There are societal constraints in a 25-year - old woman sending a note to a 45-year - old man wanting to talk about career options after work .Stories and intuitions help us identify where research is needed .They also help us communicate to a broader public .So it 's fitting that this kind of speculation is part of a panel discussion .Ultimately , though , we need research .It 's a fact that there are few women role models in senior positions in many professions .But it 's a conclusion that we should work to repair this gender imbalance .Conclusions must be based on the sound argumentation that can be built only on knowledge ; conclusions should be based on research .Is there research on the importance of role models ?If so , what does it tell us ?Female students , Lockwood demonstrates , are more influenced by the gender of role models than are male students .That is , female students report greater motivation after reading about an outstanding woman than they do when they read about an outstanding man .Male students are also inspired by reading about successful people , but their level of inspiration is not affected by the gender of the person in the story .Lockwood asked students to tell her about career role models .Female students tended to identify women while male students tended to identify men .A difference was revealed when male and female students were asked if gender was a factor in their choice of role model .For the men , it was not .But many of the women identified a female role model because she had surmounted gender - specific challenges they anticipate facing themselves .Women tend to underestimate their potential for success in STEM .But those expectations can be modified .The conclusion of this study , however , was that gender does not matter as much as nerdiness .Incoming women were not inspired by potential role models who were perceived as typical STEM folks .But incoming women did gain confidence from role models who contravened the stereotypes .Women see themselves as outsiders in these subjects and they are influenced when they see that other outsiders can make it .In a study specifically looking at the mentoring impact of women in leadership positions , similar results emerge .Crystal L.

Garc\u00eda based on Rice 's short story \" She Flies . \"Rice skillfully balances humor and sensitivity in his writing , and his imaginative tales and colorful characters appeal to young readers on many levels .Culture and place figure prominently in these narratives ; most are set in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas and explore issues encountered in contemporary Mexican American life near the border .The author 's distinctive wit and style are apparent throughout the collection and are sure to secure his place in Chicano literature .Ramon Eduardo Ruiz would be the first to admit that he is not your typical Mexican American .But he has always known who he is .Historian , author , and intellectual , Ruiz has established himself through such books as Triumphs and Tragedy : A History of the Mexican People and Cuba : The Making of a Revolution , and in 1998 he was awarded the National Humanities Medal by President Clinton .Now he turns his pen on his own life to offer a personal look at what it really means to be American by birth but Mexican by culture .Little has been written by or about persons of Mexican origin who have achieved the academic stature of Ruiz , and his memoir provides insights not found in the more common biographies of labor leaders and civil rights activists .His early life straddled the social worlds of his parent 's Mexico and semi - rural America , where his father 's success as an entrepreneur and property owner set his family 's experiences apart from those of most other Mexican Americans at the time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.04501"}

{"text": "A man bigger than life in the trading and investment business who taught me all there is to know in the space .It 's ironic , I suppose , that growing up I never wanted to go into business .I had no desire to follow in my father 's footsteps .But life is funny , and I eventually wound up in business anyway .Only then did I begin to realize how much my father had taught me .At the time , however , I did n't appreciate the education I was getting .I was only 12 years old .He was the one , for example , who first explained to me the importance of maintaining high gross margins .He called them something else - big markups - but the thought process was the same .\" Always make a good sale with a big markup , \" he 'd say . \" Make sure your customer is someone you can collect from . \"\" Do n't take advantage of people . \"\" Be fair .\" Those are fabulous business lessons embedded in my mind , and they came straight from my father .I use ' invisible friends ' .I should probably explain that before you assume I am 4 .When I have a task at hand , I think about the people similar to me who would be disappointed in me if I gave up on something .Usually , they are highly competent in the field where I want to be doing something , and usually they are people I know very well .I do n't want them to go ' aw never mind ' .I think I want to avoid the discomfort of it , to use Ann 's term .Many of them are not mentors or even potential mentors , but they are ' me models ' , not role models .They represent what I want to be in a particular world .There is a second part to this that Ann has only briefly touched on , though .When you quote a celebrity , you get a sense of release or relief at having done something , which is similar to sharing hopes without sharing plans .You get positive feedback just from the act of sharing , and when that fades , you are left on a down - slope , and it is easy to stop at that point .Unless you have a plan in action , quoting is the equivalent of hoping .It lets you off the hook because you have done something , and the guilt of not doing it is gone . \"Sharing hopes without sharing plans \" I guess is the equivalent of making a wish .As you say , Diana , without some kind of action , that 's likely all it will ever be .I love the idea of invisible friends .In life , rather than business , my mother , long dead , still fills that role , an invisible but powerful guide to doing the right things just because its the right thing to do .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.79724"}
