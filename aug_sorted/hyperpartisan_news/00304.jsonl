{"text": "Obama added a day of service projects to the inaugural schedule in 2009 , and he 's hoping the event becomes a tradition for future presidents .On Monday , there will be formal balls , an inaugural parade and , of course , the president 's address from the steps of the Capitol .Even as Washington delves into the once - every - four - year celebration of the presidency , there is decidedly less energy surrounding Obama 's second inauguration than there was in 2009 .That history - making event drew 1.8 million people to the National Mall to watch Obama be sworn in as the nation 's first black president .This time around , Obama takes the oath of office following a bruising presidential campaign and four years of partisan fighting .He 's more experienced in the ways of Washington , and he has the gray hair and lower approval ratings to show for it .For at least the inauguration weekend , the fiscal fights and legislative wrangling will be put aside in favor of pomp and circumstance .The White House did not say in advance what Obama 's service project would be on Saturday .In 2009 , he helped spruce up a shelter for homeless teens in one of Washington 's porter neighborhoods then visited wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center .In an effort to expand the day of service , former first daughter Chelsea Clinton will headline a volunteer summit on the National Mall and the inaugural committee has organized volunteer events in all 50 states .The White House sees the call to service as a way for Americans across the country to honor the memory of Martin Luther King Jr.The day Obama takes the oath of office publicly - Monday - marks King 's birthday , and 2013 is the 50th anniversary of the civil rights leader 's March on Washington .Also Saturday , Mrs. Obama and Mrs. Biden will host the Kids ' Inaugural Concert , an event paying special tribute to military spouses and children .The crowds pouring into Washington this weekend will be far smaller than they were four years ago , and there will be fewer inaugural balls for the president and first lady to attend .Still , Obama 's swearing - in at the Capitol on Monday is expected to draw up to 800,000 people , which would make it the largest second presidential inaugural ever .The president was still working on his inaugural address heading into the weekend .He is n't expected to delve deeply into the policy objectives he 'll tackle in a second term , but the tone and theme of the speech will set the stage for the policy fights to come .Aides said he will make the point that while the nation 's political system does n't require politicians to resolve all of their differences , it does require Washington to act on issues where there is common ground .And he will speak about how the nation 's core principles can still guide a country that has changed immensely since its founding .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.325974"}

{"text": "And it 's never been more important .Unfortunately , it 's also never been more expensive .And most of you guys I 'm sure have reported about this and know this - students who take out loans to pay for college graduate owing an average of $ 25,000 a year .And I know what this is like , because when Michelle and I graduated from college and law school we had enormous debts , and it took us a lot of years to pay off .So that 's probably why I feel this thing so personally .For a lot of working families , the idea of owing that much money means higher education is simply out of reach for their children .And for the first time now we 've got Americans owing more debt on their student loans than they do on their credit cards .The key point here is , is that in America , higher education ca n't be a luxury .It 's an economic imperative that every family has got to be able to afford .We 've already taken some important steps to make college more affordable .So , for example , we extended Pell grants to 3 million more students , and we signed a tax credit worth up to $ 10,000 to help middle - class families cover the cost of tuition .We 've eliminated a major expense for young people by allowing young adults to stay on their parent 's health insurance plans until they 're 26 .But there 's clearly more work to be done .And that 's why I 'm going to colleges across the country .I want to talk to students right now about how we can make higher education more affordable , and what 's at stake right now if Congress does n't do something about it .So the key point I want to make : If Congress does n't act on July 1st , interest rates on Stafford loans , on student loans from the federal government will double .Nearly 7.5 million students will end up owing more on their loan payments .And that would be , obviously , a tremendous blow .And it 's completely preventable .So the bottom line here is we ca n't just cut our way to prosperity .Making it harder for our young people to afford higher education , allowing them to earn their degrees - that 's nothing more than cutting our own future off at the knees .And Congress has to keep interest rates on student loans from doubling , and they need to do it now .And I have to say , from my perspective , this is a question of values .We ca n't let America become a country where a shrinking number of people are doing really well , a growing number of people struggle to get by , and you 've got fewer ladders for people to climb into the middle class and to get opportunity .We 've got to build an economy where everybody is getting a fair shot , everybody is doing their fair share , everybody is playing by the same set of rules .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.00502"}
