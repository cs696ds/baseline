{"text": "Archive for November , 2010 .When wearing a nude - colored dress , it 's hard to keep from looking washed out without a lot of makeup , which makes Elizabeth Moss ' recent look so impressive .At the 38th Annual International Emmy Awards Gala in New York City , Moss sported a flesh - toned gown and minimal makeup , and appeared more fresh - faced than ever .The secret seemed to lie within her impeccably applied cheek color .The rose blush , which featured golden undertones that warmed her complexion , was concentrated on the apples of her cheeks , mimicking a natural glow .Moss added a pop of color to the ensemble with vibrant red nail polish , but aside from the blush and a sheer lip gloss , she wore little else on her face .Her ethereal look was further emphasized by her relaxed hairstyle , as her loose waves gently cascaded over her shoulders .Women wearing a nude - colored outfit who want to recreate Moss ' natural beauty should remember to keep makeup minimal , cheek color warm and hair soft and simple .Balance the abundance of natural tones with a bright nail polish and you 're ready to go .When selecting makeup for an elegant ensemble , there are few colors that can pair perfectly with gowns of any hue .However , judging from the glamorous gals at the 2010 Pride of Britain Awards , there is one product that will look great with a multitude of different tones - bright red lipstick .English pop star and Girls Aloud member Kimberley Walsh walked the red carpet in a crimson - colored gown and sported lipstick to match .The lipstick enhanced Walsh 's pout while also creating a cohesive overall look .Fellow Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding painted her pout a similar shade , but wore a dress in a completely different hue - cream .Pairing a soft - colored gown with a vibrant lipstick directed attention to Harding 's face , and the dress ' unobtrusive shade did n't compete with the strong lip color .However , can you still rock red lips if your gown is just as bright as your pout ?Yes you can , according to British television personality Jameela Jamil , who wore a yellow dress and scarlet lipstick .Jamil paired the feminine lemon - colored piece with touch black leather booties , creating an edgy look that begged for a burst of bright lip color .There 's the proof - crimson lipstick can perfectly complement a variety of looks , whether you 're wearing reds , neutrals or contrasting brights .There are few accessories more synonymous with celebrity than a large pair of sunglasses .Whether starlets want to walk around incognito or simply feel like hiding behind large frames , oversized eyewear is immensely popular in Hollywood .While it 's common knowledge that Nicole Richie loves her sunglasses , she recently explained why she is rarely seen sans - shades .\" When I wear sunglasses , it 's because I do n't wear makeup , \" the former reality TV star revealed to Women 's Wear Daily .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.75105"}

'The closer Joanna gets to the truth about what 's really going on in Stepford , the more danger there is for her .In Camilla L\u00e4ckberg 's The Ice Princess , writer Erica Falck has returned to her home town of Fj\u00e4llbacka after her parents ' deaths so she can go through their things and sort them all out .While she 's there , a former friend Alexandra ' Alex ' Wijkner is found dead in what looks at first like a suicide .But very soon it 's proved that she was murdered .In part to deal with her grief at the loss of a friend she had n't really seen in twenty - five years , Erica decides to write Alex 's biography .In that way she begins to ask questions about how and why she was killed .In the meantime the police , mostly in the form of Patrik Hedstr\u00f6m , investigate the death officially .Patrik and Erica are drawn to each other and we learn that they 've always liked one another ; it 's just that the timing was never really right for either to pursue a relationship .One night Erica invites Patrik over for a home - cooked meal .Usually , she is a very casual dresser who does n't take a lot of pains with her appearance .But not tonight : . 'The first dilemma had arisen ... when , like her favorite literary heroine Bridget Jones , she was faced with the decision of which panties to choose .Should she wear a beautiful , lace - trimmed thong , for the slim eventuality that she and Patrik ended up in bed ?Or should she put on the substantial and terribly ugly panties with the extra support for tummy and backside , which would increase her chances that they might end up in bed at all ?A hard choice , but ... she decided after much deliberation on the support variety .Over them she would wear pantyhose with a tummy - flattening panel .In other words , the heavy artillery ... .After another look at the pile on the bed , she pulled out from the bottom the first outfit she had tried on .Black was slimming , and the classic , knee - length dress in a Jackie Kennedy style was flattering to the figure .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.42702"}

'This is especially funny because usually , Cherry makes fun of Lulu 's wardrobe .It is interesting what a big difference a change in appearance can make .Thanks to Colm Redmond for the inspiration .And now , may I suggest you pay a visit to Clothes in Books ?It 's the place to shop for interesting discussions about fashion and culture in books of all kinds .I LOVE the Corina Chapman series although it is definitely not Kerry Greenwood 's most popular series .As far as clothes go whether we like it or not or whether it is fair or not , clothes really do \" make the man \" or woman .I think that is what spurs the popularity of the makeover shows on tv .Depending upon how you are dressed you can be treated differently , receive better ( or worse ) service , form relationships , etc .I do n't know if it is the fact that most people exude more self confidence when dressed well or whether people treat you differently and so you feel more self confident - like a chicken and egg question .AGC - Thanks for the kind words .I agree completely that the way we dress has a lot to do with the way others treat us .I think that may be part of the reason people do decide to go for a different look or way of dressing .You make an interesting point too that if we dress in a way that makes us feel more self - confident , we show that self - confidence .And that in turn affects the way we 're treated , which in turn affects our way of dressing , holding ourselves and so on .Each affects the other .And I love the Corinna Chapman series too .Thanks for the shoutout Margot , and I think the Guest Blogger will be very pleased too .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.881805"}

'She [ Mistress Dread ] flung it over my head with a practised hand and it settled on me ...The dress was a full - skirted number with built - in black petticoats , slashed sleeves and a neckline which could be mistaken for a waist it was so deep .It was a gorgeous shade between venous and arterial blood and as I moved I rustled in the most entrancing fashion .Then she slipped a black leather corset over the dress and began lacing it at the front ... ' .With a few final touches , Chapman 's transformation is complete and she feels gorgeous with her new look .She also finds that it gets her and Cohen easily admitted into Blood Lines , where they find out the truth about the heroin deaths .Willam Ryan 's Sergeant Nadezhda Slivka usually does n't worry too much about the way she looks .She wears her police uniform when on duty , and when off duty she wears utilitarian clothes .But as The Twelfth Department begins , she needs to change her look .She and her boss Moscow CID Captain Alexei Korolev are on the trail of a criminal and have tracked him to a park .In order not to reveal that she 's a cop , Slivka dresses up a bit : .
