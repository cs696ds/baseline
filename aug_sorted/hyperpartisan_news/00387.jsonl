Buckley founded National Review to give some order and literary polish to this cacophonous jumble .But his magazine had a small audience at the outset .Its basic message would reach a far wider audience through a widely popular book , The Conscience of a Conservative , ghostwritten for Barry Goldwater by Buckley 's brother - in - law ( and his coauthor for McCarthy and His Enemies ) , L. Brent Bozell .Summary : The military is often described as a test tube for American social science , running experiments such as integration of race , sex , and gender in its relatively controlled society .But the largest social science experiment in the military - perhaps the largest in US history - is DoD 's socialism .We close our eyes , preferring not to see it .Now the military 's spending priorities are changing , and we 'll see the effects on recruitment and retention as it is eroded away .Here Jennifer Mittelstadt explains the history and workings of the military \" welfare state \" .Military socialism under siege .Under pressure from the increasingly outlandish cost of hardware ( e.g. , carriers , the F-35 ) , DoD has chosen to cut compensation of its people .It is one of the most important and least covered defense issues ( a minor sideshow , keeping the A-10 Warthog , has received 100x the attention ) .Her essay does not respond the usual rebuttal to these facts : this social safety net is compensation for risk borne by our troops .In fact it covers everybody in our uniformed services , during peace and war .It is not limited to those in war zones .It is not limited to those experiencing non - combat risks greater than those of most civilian jobs ( and the even smaller number exposed to risks greater than those of the most dangerous civilian job ( logging and fishing ) .I assume Mittelstadt called it \" military welfare \" for the shock value .In fact welfare is much more selective in its benefits than the \" safety net \" inside the military - so \" military socialism \" fits better .Opening of \" Welfare 's last stand \" .Over the past four decades in the United States , as the country has slashed its welfare state and employers gutted traditional job benefits , growing numbers of people , especially from the working class , grasped for a new safety net - the military .Everyone recognises that the US armed forces have become a global colossus .But few know that , along with bases and bombs , the US military constructed its own massive welfare state .In the waning decades of the 20th century , with US prosperity in decline , more than 10 million active\u2011duty personnel and their tens of millions of family members turned to the military for economic and social security .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.49417"}

Bush was the most outspoken supporter : \" I unequivocally support the president - no ifs , ands , or buts ...He made a difficult , courageous decision . \" Afterward , the president 's approval ratings , previously plummeting , actually stabilized - until he was easily defeated by Ronald Reagan .I was but 14 at the time and just at the beginnings of my political consciousness - which was awakened by the Hostage Crisis and the 1980 campaign .I was no fan of Carter 's presidency and thought his handling of the hostage situation spineless ( positions which I 've somewhat revised given the advantages of maturity and hindsight ) .But , even in the wake of the disastrous mission , my sense was \" Thank God he finally did something .\" I think that was the consensus view .But even in today 's toxic political climate , most Americans would have applauded a SEAL raid to get the bastard behind 9/11 even if it had ended in catastrophe .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.46083"}

Security Council resolution must be fulfilled , \" says a statement released Mar. 20 by Mexico 's foreign ministry .[ ... ] .Lima - Peru 's presidential front - runner Ollanta Humala said on Monday he would respect free - trade agreements and the central bank 's independence as he tries to persuade voters he is no longer a left - wing hard - liner .In what was the most moderate speech of his political life , Humala also said that he would be fiscally responsible and said financial markets worried about his rise in the polls have no reason to fear him .Despite his speech , Peru 's sol fell to a three - month low of 2.813 per dollar on Monday as traders worried Humala might unwind market - friendly policies that have been in place for the last two decades in one of the world 's fastest - growing economies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.766815"}

Mitt Romney standing between him and the GOP presidential nomination .But as all of America knows , he came crashing down amid poor debate performances and a lack of preparation .Perry is much more ready this time around , and it was reflected in last month 's B - team , GOP debate .He has policy positions that most Republicans like .He 's shown courage - perhaps a little glory - seeking - in taking on Republican front - runner Donald Trump .While it must be frustrating that none of it has worked , Perry should be pleased that he 's shown himself to be a better candidate .Quitting at this point , especially if he 's the first major candidate to drop , would be an insult to all of his hard work .He owes it to himself and his donors to hang around until after Iowa , when it will be clear that he gave it his best shot .Is staying in the race until the February caucuses a waste of time ?Perhaps , if the measure of a campaign is only about victory .But if Perry bounces back even a little , he has a better chance of being remembered for his tenure as Texas ' longest - serving governor , rather than a poor presidential candidate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.999695"}

{"text": "The fact is that any form of overcentralization is evil .Whether it is central control or central ownership , it is Socialism and it is evil .It looks like you 've come across a Marxist definition of fascism , and not an especially clear one .Fascism is a form of tyranny adopted in countries where there is great insecurity and political combat .Fascism differs from other forms of tyranny in its dynamic aspect .It 's not simply the army imposing martial law .There 's a political movement involved and it includes a large scale mobilization of society .In its day , fascism involved combat and suppression of Marxists and communists , but the opposition between fascism and communism has often been exaggerated .On the one hand , opposition to communism motivated many to support fascism in defense of property and private enterprise .On the other hand , Leninism was in many ways a model and precursor for fascism , as well as an opponent .Both sought total mobilization and control of society .It 's egocentrism that makes communists think that it 's all about them .Another important element behind historical fascism was the First World War .The vision of civil society as a battlefield , the hunger for redemption through violence , and the idea of mobilizing society for combat made their way into the bloodstream of the era , left and right .Many Third World dictatorships in recent years have had much in common with fascism , but the intensity , the hunger for war and conquest , and the fear and desire for revolution were n't present .Fascism is \" hot \" and impassioned , while contemporary society tends to be \" cool \" and dispassionate .But if you asked a fascist what his movement was about , he might well talk about the corporate state and representation by occupational groups , things that get left out of modern polemical definitions of fascism .I disagree with this definition of fascism , racism is not a necessary component ( even though it is almost always present in fascist systems , because it is such a useful tool ) .Fascism is a dictatorial ideology which calls for government control and organization of private industries ( not necessarily all of them , but especially ones vital to the survival , success , and warmaking capability of the nation ) .Fascism has inherent in it the glorification of strong leadership , strong soldiers , and war as an end and not a means .Iraq fits this definition of fascism completely . . .The economic / industrial description does not fit America , but we do come superficially close to matching the ideological component .We do like having a strong leader , and we do celebrate our military victories , and we do place a very high social value on military service .We like having a strong military , we believe it is very important to our nation .But I said the resemblance is only superficial : we do n't want to rush headlong into war , we 've been trying to avoid it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.402"}

Roosevelt .At the beginning of World War II , President Roosevelt ordered the internment of Japanese residents - many prohibitied from citizenship by the 1923 immigration law and earlier \" oriental exclusion \" acts - because of fears that they owed loyalty to the Emperor of Japan .This act by a Democrat President was supported by California 's Republican Governor , Earl Warren , but has since been repudiated by a bipartisan majority in Congress , which voted reparations to decendents of the Nisei .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.47246"}
