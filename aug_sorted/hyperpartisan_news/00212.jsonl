{"text": "In this sense the restraints on men , as well as their liberties , are to be reckoned among their rights .But as the liberties and the restrictions vary with times and circumstances and admit to infinite modifications , they can not be settled upon any abstract rule ; and nothing is so foolish as to discuss them upon that principle .While modern conservatives like Russell Kirk have pointed to Burke as their philosophical inspiration , one can clearly see that Burke is here merely restating ideas from the true father of modern conservatism , Thomas Hobbes .Hobbes asserted that in the state of nature man had \" a right to everything , \" even a right to one another 's bodies .Hobbes asserted , as Burke implies here , that man 's passions would always overcome his reason and because of this the state of nature was a state of war of \" everyone against everyone . \" For Hobbes , as for true conservatives today , man has to give up his natural rights upon entering society and accept those privileges to liberty and property that the government grants him .For Hobbes , not only did man give up his natural rights upon entering society , but he also had to grant the \" sovereign \" absolute and undivided power .This was necessary in order to completely dominate man 's natural impulses , which would always lead him to harm his neighbor if they were not checked .This power must literally keep each individual \" in awe , \" to make him fearful of committing any unlawful act .To secure this absolute power , the sovereign needed control over the economy , which he consolidated through a privileged , wealthy elite .He also needed control over education and even the religious beliefs of the people .No individual could ever be allowed to follow the dictates of his own will , as it would inevitably lead him to harm his neighbor or the commonwealth in general .On foreign policy , Hobbes also viewed all nations as existing in a state of nature .However , since he viewed the state of nature as equivalent to the state of war , he viewed all nations not under control of the sovereign as de facto enemies .In reading Leviathan , one can almost hear George W. Bush 's famous remark , \" You are either with us or with the terrorists .\" This is why conservatives support the deployment of troops all over the world .Like Hobbes , they believe that we are in constant danger from any nation that we are not completely dominating with the threat of force .The reason that conservatism seeks to \" conserve \" the status quo is because its adherents do not believe that natural rights are inalienable .Upon entering society , man has to give up all of his natural rights , so the only rights that man has in society are those he has been given by government in the past .Thus , if you get rid of the past , you get rid of the rights .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.46216"}

{"text": "The Patriot Act passed after 9/11 and its later version not only destroyed the wall between investigation and prosecution , they mandated that investigators who obtained evidence of criminal activity pursuant to FISA warrants share that evidence with prosecutors .They also instructed federal judges that the evidence thus shared is admissible under the Constitution against a defendant in a criminal case .Congress forgot that it can not tell federal judges what evidence is admissible because judges , not politicians , decide what a jury hears .Then the Bush administration and Congress went even further .The administration wanted , and Congress has begrudgingly given it , the authority to conduct electronic surveillance of foreigners and Americans without even a FISA warrant - without any warrant whatsoever .Director of National Intelligence J. Michael McConnell told the House Judiciary Committee last year that hundreds of unsuspecting Americans ' conversations and e - mails are spied on annually as a consequence of the warrantless surveillance of foreigners outside the United States .So where does all this leave us ?I 'm not sure I entirely agree with the characterization of FISA as it was originally enacted in 1978 .The far more important point , though , is that since 1978 , Congress has repeatedly and dramatically expanded the president 's ability to conduct surveillance with minimal oversight .Whether those changes went too far in 1978 , 2001 , or somewhere in between is debatable .But it 's clear that since 2001 , the executive branch has had sweeping powers to eavesdrop on suspected terrorists with minimal judicial oversight .What the Bush administration is doing here is moving the goalposts .In 2001 , the president said that the changes to FISA that were found in the Patriot Act gave him plenty of authority to spy on terrorists that were using the latest communications technology .Now , seven years later , he 's saying those reforms were n't good enough and that he needs even broader powers to spy with minimal court supervision .If Congress approves the changes the president is requesting this year , we can expect a future president sometime in the next decade to insist that she 's still subject to too much judicial scrutiny .At some point , we have to say that enough is enough .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.62871"}
