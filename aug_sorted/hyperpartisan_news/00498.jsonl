{"text": "As the years passed , the basic concept of the NSC 's role in the direction of the Agency became reversed , or at least greatly diverted .In the earliest of such instances we may be quite certain that the operations so presented were reasonably modest .The NSC undoubtedly overlooked the variance in procedure and felt that its approval of such minor requests was tantamount to \" direction \" of the Agency .Thus the establishment of the first Special Group .As things progressed , the Special Croup 5412/2 became not just the working group of the NSC but rather a select group that had assumed the responsibility for clandestine activity .By that time in the course of events , a new process had evolved , and the DCI felt perfectly at liberty to prepare all the clandestine operations his intelligence sources would support and to present them to the Special Group for nothing more than approval .But even this was not enough .The next step was to have Agency - affiliated men in the Special Group itself , or at least to have them working with the Group as special advisers .This is why the President 's appointee has always been so important to the DCI .Since the appointment of Maxwell Taylor in that position after the Bay of Pigs , the DCI has had men in that position whom he could count upon as a two - way conduit .When the DCI wanted to get information to the President he would use this man , and when he wanted the President 's approval on something , he would use him for that , too .The same has been true with the representatives in State and Defense .During much of the crucial build - up years in Indochina , men such as Bill Bundy and Ed Lansdale have represented State and Defense on this committee .Of course , both of these men were CIA alumni , and as a result the DCI could always count upon them to grease the way for any of his proposals to the NSC .This has been a significant evolution away from the language and the intent of the law .It has meant that the sole authority established as a final resort to oversee and control the CIA has become no more than a rubber stamp for all clandestine operations .And throughout all of this the ST has been able to carry out its desires under a cloak of secrecy that has kept its moves shielded from the highest officials of this Government .For example , in those crucial early years of Vietnam , did McNamara and Rusk look upon Lansdale and Bill Bundy as Defense and State men under their command and control , or did they recognize them as CIA agents under the direction of the DCI ?This shift of command control over the Agency from under the direction of the NSC was undoubtedly as important a move as has occurred in any part of the Government since the passage of the National Security Act of 1947 .It explains why the CIA has operated so free of effective and ironclad control during the past ten to twelve years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.74696"}

{"text": "The Kissinger NSC system sought to combine features of the Johnson and Eisenhower systems .The Senior Interdepartment Group ( SIG ) of the Johnson White House was replaced by an NSC Review Group ( somewhat similar to the Eisenhower - era NSC Planning Group ) together with an NSC Under Secretary 's Committee .The Kissinger NSC relied upon interdepartmental working groups ( IGs ) to prepare for NSC directives .Critics observed that 10 IG meetings prepared the way for each SIG - level meeting , and 5 SIG meetings were needed to prepare for each NSC meeting .White House direction of foreign policy meant the eclipse of the Department of State and Secretary William Rogers .Nixon did not trust the Department bureaucracy .According to Kissinger , Nixon picked Rogers , who was inexperienced in foreign affairs , to indicate that the President would dominate the relationship between the NSC and the Department of State .Throughout Nixon 's first term , only Kissinger participated in the President 's important discussions with foreign state visitors .Nixon excluded Rogers from his first meeting with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin in February 1969 .The NSC also took control of the process of clearing key policy cables to overseas posts .Kissinger and Rogers became rivals and developed formal contacts in place of substantive discussions .The NSC(Department of State power relationship was reflected in institutional arrangements .During the transition period before Nixon assumed power , Kissinger recommended that the NSC be buttressed by a structure of subcommittees to draft analyses of policy that would present clear decision options to the President .The National Security Adviser was to be chairman of a Review Group to screen interagency papers before their presentation to the full NSC chaired by the President .Nixon insisted on the abolition of the SIG chaired by the Department of State .These recommendations were incorporated in National Security Decision Memorandum ( NSDM ) 2 , issued shortly after Nixon 's inauguration on January 20 , 1969 .NSDM 2 was rightly perceived as a victory for Kissinger and helped to establish his foreign policy authority at the outset of the administration .Kissinger moved quickly to establish the policy dominance of the NSC .He expanded its staff from 12 to 34 ; not only was it the cadre for his centralized policy - making , but it was also his antennae throughout the bureaucratic structure .In the President 's name , Kissinger set the NSC agendas and issued the numerous National Security Study Memoranda ( NSSM ) that set forth the precise needs for interagency policy papers .An NSC Under Secretaries Committee , chaired by the Deputy Secretary of State , gradually withered away .Nixon also increasingly bypassed the Department of State to supervise personally sensitive negotiations in order to avoid what he and President Nixon agreed were likely bureaucratic disputes and inertia .The President made clear that he wanted the National Security Adviser to conduct important matters directly out of his office .Nearly every foreign ambassador called upon Kissinger at least once .With Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin , Kissinger maintained a special relationship that completely bypassed the Department of State and Secretary Rogers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.51487"}
{"text": "It also sparked the NSC process to reenter the arena of monitoring the implementation of policy .The most important step in this direction was the establishment of the Situation Room in the White House in 1962 .The Sit Room allowed the President and his foreign affairs advisers to keep abreast of all the cable traffic from overseas posts .More than anything else , the Sit Room allowed Bundy and his NSC staff to expand their involvement in the international activities of foreign affairs community and become , in essence , \" a little State Department . \"As National Security Adviser , Bundy divided his work with his Deputy , Walt Rostow ( and later Carl Kaysen ) .While Bundy dealt with the immediate day - to - day crises and the range of European affairs , Rostow focused upon long - term planning with a particular concentration on Latin American affairs .Kaysen focused upon foreign trade and economic affairs matters that became increasingly important in the latter part of the Kennedy Presidency .In addition to Bundy and the NSC staff , President Kennedy reached out still further for foreign affairs advice .Early in 1961 the President appointed General Maxwell Taylor to serve as his military representative and provide liaison with the government agencies and defense and intelligence establishments on military - political issues confronting the administration .Taylor in effect took up the role filled by Admiral Leahy in the Roosevelt White House .General Taylor advised the President on military matters , intelligence , and Cold War planning and paid special attention to the continuing Berlin crisis and growing difficulties in Indochina .The Taylor(Rostow mission to Indochina at the end of 1961 and the resulting report led to military decisions on aid to South Vietnam and the entry of the United States into the Vietnamese quagmire .Taylor had a very personal connection with the President and was not replaced in 1962 when he left .But in 1962 Kennedy appointed former State Department Under Secretary Chester Bowles to serve as his Special Adviser on Foreign Affairs .Bowles had not survived conflicts with Secretary of State Rusk and his appointment to the White House was partly compensatory .His brief was seemingly intended to be the development of policy toward the Third World , but after a year he left Washington to become Ambassador to India .The NSC continued to meet during the Kennedy Presidency , but far less frequently than had been the case under his predecessor .It met 15 times during the first 6 months of 1961 , then averaged one meeting a month for the rest of his Presidency , reaching a total of 49 meetings . \" Much that used to flow routinely to the weekly meetings of the Council is now settled in other ways , Bundy reported in September 1961 .Some of the NSC activities were taken up by a smaller , more select body called the Standing Group .This small NSC coordinating panel was chaired by the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs and included the Deputy Secretary of Defense , the Director of Central Intelligence , and Bundy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.56323"}

{"text": "The President counted on the free flow of ideas , unencumbered by a formal setting , to increase the chances of an informed decision .Critics have contended that the Carter NSC staff was deficient in certain respects .The NSC 's emphasis on providing advice was effected at the expense of some of its other functions , particularly its responsibility to monitor implementation of the President 's policies .Also , the President 's and some of his principals ' commitment to arms control skewed the formation and execution of a broad range of foreign policy options on national security questions .Without any clearly - developed foreign policy principles beyond a commitment to arms control , he often changed his mind , depending on the advice he was receiving at the time .Carter 's preference for informality and openness increased the diversity of views he received and complicated the decision - making process .Every Friday , for example , the President breakfasted with Vice President Mondale , Secretary of State Vance , Secretary of Defense Brown , Brzezinski , and several White House advisers .No agendas were prepared and no formal records were kept of these meetings , sometimes resulting in differing interpretations of the decisions actually agreed upon .This problem led to one of the most embarrassing episodes of the Carter administration in which the United States had to retract a UN vote involving Israel and Jerusalem .Brzezinski was careful , in managing his own weekly luncheons with Secretaries Vance and Brown in preparation for NSC discussions , to maintain a complete set of careful notes .Brzezinski also sent weekly reports to the President on major foreign policy undertakings and problems , with recommendations for courses of action .President Carter enjoyed these reports and frequently annotated them with his own views .Brzezinski and the NSC used these Presidential notes ( 159 of them ) as the basis for NSC actions .At the outset of the administration , Brzezinski successfully persuaded Carter to make the National Security Adviser chairman of the SCC .This meant that Brzezinski was given oversight responsibility for the SALT negotiations , which became an important focus of the Carter administration 's foreign policy .Brzezinski 's coordination of the arms control process also gave him major input into the administration 's policy toward the Soviet Union .Thus from the beginning , Brzezinski made sure that the new NSC institutional relationships would assure him a major voice in the shaping of foreign policy .While he knew that Carter would not want him to be another Kissinger , Brzezenski also felt confident that the President did not want Secretary of State Vance to become another Dulles and would want his own input on key foreign policy decisions .Vance voiced his displeasure with this arrangement , which threatened to diminish the role of the Department of State on arms control .The SCC , however , functioned fairly smoothly on arms control .Following Vance 's visit to Moscow in March 1977 to present new arms control proposals , which the Soviet leadership abruptly rejected , the SCC developed and refined arms control proposals for U.S. negotiators at the SALT talks in Geneva .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.73886"}

Allen , who came to the position after serving as a foreign policy adviser to Reagan during the 1980 campaign .Allen was pushed out in the end of 1981 after allegations surfaced that he had accepted a bribe to secure an interview with Nancy Reagan .Lesson # 1 : If you give anyone a reason to call for your resignation , you 'll be out the door before you can say South Succotash Wisconsin .William \" Judge \" Clark , a former Supreme Court justice in the state of California ( appointed by Governor Reagan ) , moved from California to Washington with Reagan in 1981 .Clark replaced Allen after spending a year at the State Department , where he was primarily keeping an eye on Secretary of State Haig .Clark 's appointment served Reagan by allowing him to show his conservative base that the moderates , like Haig , were not going to push him around .Clark lasted almost 18 months , which probably would have been shorter if not for his close relationship to Reagan .In fact , Clark was believed to be one of only a few people in Washington who could walk into the Oval Office unannounced .Clark also left an extensive record of his time as national security adviser .These files show that Clark was both a close confidant of Reagan and an active participant in foreign policy making decisions .Out of all the memos from the national security adviser to Reagan that I 've seen at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library , Clark 's memos are not only the longest and most detailed , but also include many of his own recommendations .It was no surprise to anyone in Washington that Clark was forced out in 1983 .This brings me to lesson # 2 : Know your role , act the part , and whatever you do , do n't tread on the secretary of state 's turf .Like President Obama looked within the NSC when deciding to appoint Mr. Donilon , Reagan also promoted from within , making Robert \" Bud \" McFarlane his third national security adviser .Out of all of Reagan 's national security advisers , McFarlane 's approach to the position is the only one that I have found to be documented : .There are many models for providing advice to the President and we should pursue the one which the President prefers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.245"}

Rubin was the first to be appointed to this position .The NEC was to deal with foreign and domestic economic issues in much the same way as the NSC coordinated diplomatic and security issues , and the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy was to be included in meetings involving international economic issues .In January 1993 , Clinton appointed W. Anthony Lake as his National Security Adviser .Lake , a former Foreign Service officer , served under Henry Kissinger , President Nixon 's National Security Adviser , and as director of the Department of State Policy Planning Staff during the Carter administration .During the Carter years , Lake had witnessed the negative effects of bureaucratic infighting and squabbling between Secretary of State Vance and National Security Adviser Brzezinski .As Clinton 's National Security Adviser , Lake was effective in maintaining cordial relations with Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher and in developing an atmosphere of cooperation and collegiality .Lake initially maintained a low public profile , avoiding public appearances and television interviews , so as not to upstage the Secretary of State as Kissinger had done in the Nixon administration .In September 1993 , however , in response to criticism that the Clinton administration had not adequately explained its foreign policy , Lake began to appear as a public speaker .The National Security Council framework in the Clinton administration included an NSC Principals Committee , a forum available to Cabinet - level officials to discuss and resolve issues not requiring the President 's participation .An NSC Deputies Committee served as the senior sub - cabinet interagency forum for considering policy issues affecting national security and for reviewing and monitoring the work of the NSC interagency process .This process included Interagency Working Groups ( IWGs ) , which were to convene on a regular basis to review and coordinate the implementation of Presidential decisions in their respective policy areas .Among the most urgent issues the NSC dealt with in the first year of the Clinton administration were Bosnia , Haiti , Iraq , and Somalia .The several dozen other questions the NSC system dealt with initially included such issues as illegal drugs , United Nations peacekeeping , Zaire , strategic arms control policy , China , and global environmental affairs .Samuel R. \" Sandy \" Berger , a longtime foreign policy adviser to Clinton who had been Lake 's deputy since 1993 , became National Security Adviser in March 1997 , after Clinton nominated Lake to be Director of Central Intelligence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.27101"}

{"text": "Kissinger also maintained similar relationships with Chinese leader Chou En - lai and Israeli Ambassador Rabin .In carrying on his activist , operational undertakings , Kissinger relied upon special controlled communications .CIA communications were used for his \" back channel \" messages so that the Department of State was kept in the dark .He also used the White House Communication Agency including the use of special aircraft as communication centers .With his negotiations in Paris in 1971 regarding Vietnam , with Israelis and Arabs after 1973 , and with the Soviet Union in advance of summit meetings , Kissinger was a traveling negotiator , and the NSC was a system on the move .Jeanne Davis , the NSC Executive Secretary , also facilitated the handling of sensitive correspondence by propelling the NSC staff into the computer age with a document tracking system unheard of by Kissinger 's predecessors .The waning of Nixon 's power during the Watergate affair further increased Kissinger 's influence .On September 22 , 1973 , Kissinger became Secretary of State , replacing Rogers .For the first time , one individual held simultaneously the positions of National Security Adviser and Secretary of State .Under these unique circumstances , Kissinger strengthened his institutional base as the administration 's principal foreign policy adviser .Kissinger later admitted , however , that the union of the two positions did not work .Department of State representatives were his subordinates while he wore his Secretary of State hat .When he chaired a meeting , they had to represent his point of view or else all interdepartmental matters would be outside his control .Kissinger indicated he was in an inherently absurd position of either pushing his Department 's views as chairman or dissociating himself from his subordinates .President Ford , who assumed office in August 1974 , was relatively inexperienced in foreign affairs .He therefore relied almost exclusively on Kissinger 's expertise and advice .During 1975 , however , there developed strong public and congressional disapproval of the accretion of so much power over foreign policy in the hands of one man .As part of a Cabinet shakeup on November 3 , 1975 , Ford named Lieutenant General Brent Scowcroft , Kissinger 's deputy at the NSC , as National Security Adviser .Kissinger was at first resentful of the loss of his unique , dual position .Kissinger continued to have a cordial relationship with Scowcroft , and both men exchanged ideas constantly .In turn , Scowcroft was content to operate in a quiet , unobtrusive way .He took seriously the NSC obligation to present the President with clear analyses and options for decision .He managed a toned - down version of the Kissinger NSC system that was compatible with the Secretary of State 's role as the President 's chief foreign policy adviser .Many of the most aggressive members of Kissinger 's NSC team also made the move to State , allowing Scowcroft to fashion a staff that reflected the new relationships .Carter began his term determined to eliminate the abuses he ascribed to the Kissinger NSC under Nixon and Ford .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.202736"}
{"text": "Carter resolved to maintain his access to a broad spectrum of information by more fully engaging his Cabinet officers in the decision - making process .He envisaged the role of the National Security Council to be one of policy coordination and research , and reorganized the NSC structure to ensure that the NSC Adviser would be only one of many players in the foreign policy process .Carter chose Zbigniew Brzezinski for the position of National Security Adviser because he wanted an assertive intellectual at his side to provide him with day - to - day advice and guidance on foreign policy decisions .Initially , Carter reduced the NSC staff by one - half and decreased the number of standing NSC committees from eight to two .All issues referred to the NSC were reviewed by one of the two new committees , either the Policy Review Committee ( PRC ) or the Special Coordinating Committee ( SCC ) .The PRC focused on specific issues that fell largely within the jurisdiction of one department .Its chairmanship rotated to whichever department head had primary responsibility for the issue , most often the Department of State , and committee membership was frequently expanded as circumstances warranted .Unlike the Policy Review Committee , the Special Coordinating Committee was always chaired by the NSC Adviser .Carter believed that by making the NSC Adviser chairman of only one of the two committees , he would prevent the NSC from being the overwhelming influence on foreign policy decisions .The SCC was charged with considering issues that cut across several departments , including oversight of intelligence activities , arms control evaluation , and crisis management .Much of the SCC 's time during the Carter years was spent on SALT issues .President Carter changed the name of the documents in the decision - making process , although the mechanics of NSC review differed little from that of previous administrations .The Presidential Review Memorandum ( PRM ) replaced the National Security Study Memorandum ( NSSM ) , and the Presidential Directive ( PD ) supplanted the National Security Decision Memorandum ( NSDM ) .PRMs identified topics to be researched by the NSC , defined the problem to be analyzed , set a deadline for the completion of the study , and assigned responsibility for it to one of the two NSC committees .If the selected committee were the Policy Review Committee , a member was designated to serve as study chairman .The study chairman assigned an ad hoc working group to complete the study , which was ultimately reviewed by the responsible committee ( either the PRC or SCC ) .When the committee was satisfied that the study had incorporated meaningful options and supporting arguments , the study 's conclusions went to the President in a 2- or 3-page memorandum , which in turn formed the basis for a Presidential Directive .The actual operation of the NSC under Carter was less structured than under previous Presidents .The Council held few formal meetings , convening only 10 times , compared with 125 meetings during the 8 years of the Nixon and Ford administrations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.23956"}

{"text": "The critics suggested replacement of the formal , \" over - institutionalized \" NSC structure with a smaller , less formal NSC which would offer the President a clear choice of alternatives on a limited number of major problems .Eisenhower was certainly not a passive President , dominated on foreign policy and national security issues by his Secretary of State .In fact , Eisenhower was actively in command of his administration , and the NSC system met his instincts and requirements .There is substance in the criticism that the Eisenhower NSC became to some extent the prisoner of a rigidly bureaucratic process , but the criticism misses the point that Eisenhower and Dulles did not attempt to manage fast - breaking crises or day - to - day foreign policy through the NSC apparatus .An examination of several of the major foreign policy problems that confronted the Eisenhower administration reveals that the NSC system was used to manage some and was virtually bypassed in others .Eisenhower sometimes used trusted NSC staffers to serve as an intermediary to gain information outside the chain of command as he did with Colonel Goodpaster during the Quemoy crisis in 1955 .When Eisenhower briefed President - elect Kennedy on the NSC system , and when Gray briefed his successor McGeorge Bundy , they emphasized the importance of the NSC machinery in the management of foreign policy and national security affairs .They might have been more persuasive had they pointed to the fact that the NSC system was essentially limited to policy review and was not used to manage crises or day - to - day foreign policy .President Kennedy , who was strongly influenced by the report of the Jackson Subcommittee and its severe critique of the Eisenhower NSC system , moved quickly at the beginning of his administration to deconstruct the NSC process and simplify the foreign policy - making process and make it more intimate .In a very short period after taking office , the new President moved to reduce the NSC staff from 74 to 49 , limit the substantive officers to 12 , and hold NSC meetings much less frequently while sharply curtailing the number of officers attending .The Operation Coordination Board was abolished , and the NSC was , at the President 's insistence , pulled back from monitoring the implementation of policies .The coordination of foreign policy decisions was ostensibly left to the State Department ( and other agencies as necessary ) .McGeorge Bundy 's appointment as the President 's National Security Adviser inaugurated this position as it has essentially continued down to the present .The definition of Bundy 's responsibilities and authority unfolded and grew during the Kennedy presidency .Bundy 's considerable intellectual and bureaucratic abilities as well as close personal relationship with the new President contributed much to evolution of the National Security Adviser position and the new role of the NSC .In a letter to Senator Jackson in September 1961 Bundy sought to define the early relationship sought with the State Department . \" . . .the President has made it very clear that he does not want a large , separate organization between him and his Secretary of State .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.822586"}

{"text": "Whereas the NIO is focused on future ( although sometimes near - term ) requirements for collection , production , and analysis , the Sit Room analyst was focused on ensuring access to today 's information already available in the Community , and on effecting close coordination at the working level .Interagency Connections .In addition to providing current intelligence support to the NSC staff in important regional and functional areas , the Sit Room has a more independent role to play as an operations and intelligence center .There is a constant need for daily coordination on current issues with other centers , especially at the Defense and State Departments and CIA .This coordination takes place largely out of view of the NSC staff and leadership , but is nonetheless critical to the effectiveness of the interagency system .Sit Room responsibilities sometimes extend beyond intelligence and national security functions .Comparisons With Other Washington - Area Centers .Perhaps the most distinguishing feature of the Sit Room is its proximity to the President .As in real estate , the operative principles are location , location , and location .To be sure , the President gets most important intelligence advice and inputs from the Director of Central Intelligence , NIOs , and other key officials .But these officials can not be at the White House 24 hours a day .The Sit Room often is the \" first phone call \" when senior White House officials are looking for the latest intelligence information , and it plays a key role in synthesizing cables and intelligence products originated by other agencies .A second feature is that the Sit Room is both an operations and intelligence center for the White House .These activities are divided in most departments and agencies .In the Department of Defense , for example , the National Military Command Center is colocated but separate from the National Military Joint Intelligence Center .Likewise , in the State Department and at CIA headquarters , operations and intelligence activities are separated .In the White House , this means that the relationship between policy development and current intelligence can be extremely close .The close connectivity between intelligence and policy also means that the White House is not a passive consumer of intelligence .Even at the national level , information has an \" operational \" and sometimes \" tactical \" dimension .Diplomatic and intelligence cables may be closely correlated with Presidential events , perhaps allowing a glimpse of the talking points of a foreign head of state only hours or minutes before he meets with the President .A third feature is the small size of the Sit Room staff .By all measures , the Sit Room is the smallest of the Washington - area operations and intelligence centers .This has come to mean a relatively junior staff .Senior Duty Officers are perhaps O-3 , or GS-12 or 13 equivalents , as compared to O-6 or GS-15 equivalents elsewhere .Limitations of size and depth , however , can in part be offset by quality personnel , high standards of performance , the Sit Room 's interagency character , excellent technical support , and the motivation that comes with working inside the White House .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.77199"}

{"text": "Because of the Sit Room 's role in the alert process , its position as the funnel for national security information when the President is traveling , and its 24-hour capability , a close working relationship with the National Security Adviser usually develops .For the system to work at its best , a special trust has to be established among the National Security Adviser , the Executive Secretary , and the Sit Room Director .This trust is especially important in establishing the thresholds for warning and alert after hours and providing advance notice of future events .Upon the death of a foreign head of state , for example , it may not be necessary to awaken the National Security Adviser or the President in the middle of the night .If there are no threats to American citizens involved and no action for the President to take , perhaps a \" wake - up \" notification at 5 a.m. would suffice .Similarly , it is not unusual for the Sit Room Director to be included in sensitive interagency meetings before initiation of military operations or for the National Security Adviser to instruct the Sit Room that a special \" Eyes Only \" message should be brought directly upstairs .Establishing such trust can be developed only through close and routine personal interactions .Through daily interaction with the Executive Secretary and National Security Adviser ( including the Deputy ) , and routine access to the schedules and agendas of interagency meetings , the Sit Room Director is able to provide effective operational guidance to Watch Teams .The teams are then in a better position to assess the value and importance of incoming cables and newswires in the context of long - range policy issues under discussion at the highest levels , as well as fast - breaking crises that will demand Presidential attention .This intimate knowledge of the President 's schedule makes the Sit Room unique among Washington - area operations and intelligence centers .Support to the NSC Staff .The NSC staff is organized into regional and functional directorates located in the Old Executive Office Building ( OEOB ) .A directorate is headed by a Senior Director , who is appointed by the President to coordinate and oversee Presidential policy in a particular area .A Senior Director 's counterpart at State or Defense would be at the Assistant Secretary level .The Senior Director supports the National Security Adviser , in effect coordinating the interagency policy agenda in a given area .The directorates are best described as a mile wide and an inch deep because they usually consist only of a Senior Director assisted by two to four directors .On a day - to - day basis , the Sit Room supports the NSC directorates by electronically routing nearly 1,000 messages to staff members ; scanning cables , newswires , and press reports ; and monitoring CNN for fast - breaking events .It is important that the NSC 's Directorate for Intelligence Programs not be confused with Sit Room operations .The Intelligence Directorate oversees interagency intelligence policies and programs such as covert action Findings , counterintelligence , major procurement projects , and the interagency intelligence budget ; it has no responsibility for production , dissemination , or coordination of current intelligence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.6654"}

{"text": "He advised Johnson neither to pretend to use the Council meetings for making major decisions nor to focus on day - to - day operations .Instead he proposed regular , \" anticipatory - type \" sessions devoted , as Johnson explained at the first of the new series , to \" discussion of complex problems requiring careful exploration before they were to come to him for decision . \"Clearly intended to complement rather than challenge the primary advisory roles of the Tuesday luncheons and the National Security Adviser and his staff , NSC meetings for the balance of the administration considered a broad range of anticipated rather than pressing issues and gave little attention to Vietnam .As one NSC staff member put it , Council members now convened for \" reflective and educational discussions , rather than decision - making meetings .When not relying for advice and support on the Tuesday Lunch Group and the National Security Adviser and his small staff , Johnson turned to a variety of ad hoc groups and trusted friends inside and outside the government .Following the outbreak of the Six Day War , for example , he established an NSC Special Committee , modeled on the NSC Executive Committee that met during the Cuban Missile Crisis , to coordinate U.S. policy in the Middle East for several weeks .But none of these arrangements substituted fully for the functions that the NSC 's Planning Board and the Operations Coordinating Board provided under Eisenhower .In March 1966 the Johnson White House sought to remedy this situation through issuance of NSAM 341 , the brainchild of General Maxwell Taylor .The innovations of a Presidential administration often do not survive its close , reflecting as they do the distinctive views and management style of the President and his immediate advisers .The close of the Johnson administration brought an end to several of the adaptations it had made to manage foreign policy : Tuesday luncheons , anticipatory - type NSC meetings , and the SIG / IRG structure .President Nixon and his National Security Adviser , Henry Kissinger , dominated the making of U.S. foreign policy during the Nixon Presidency .As Nixon recalled in his memoirs : \" From the outset of my administration , . . .I planned to direct foreign policy from the White House .Therefore I regarded my choice of a National Security Adviser as crucial . \"Henry Kissinger worked through a National Security Council apparatus he revised and fashioned to serve his needs and objectives and those of the President .The close relationship between the President and the National Security Adviser was the basis for their ability to carry out American foreign affairs leadership around the world .The National Security Council system was the mechanism for the period of unprecedented American activism in foreign policy and the exercise of Kissinger 's growing power .Kissinger wrote later that \" in the final analysis the influence of a Presidential Assistant derives almost exclusively from the confidence of the President , not from administrative arrangements .\" The two men developed a conceptual framework that would guide foreign policy decisions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.98409"}
{"text": "The strength of the NSC system under Eisenhower was that it provided for regular , fully - staffed , interagency review of major foreign and national security issues , culminating in discussion and decision at the highest level of government .The resulting Presidentially - approved NSC papers provided policy guidance at every level of implementation .Eisenhower felt that the regular policy discussions kept his principal advisers fully informed , in step with one another , and prepared to react knowledgeably in the event of crisis .His commitment to the system was such that he chaired every Council meeting he could attend ( 329 of a total of 366 ) .The NSC meetings , including prior briefings and subsequent review of NSC Actions , constituted the largest single item on his weekly agenda .Secretary of State Dulles , on the other hand , had reservations about the NSC system .He was the strongest personality in the Eisenhower Cabinet and jealously guarded his role as principal adviser to the President on foreign policy .He had constant , direct access to the President and did not feel that some of the most sensitive issues should be discussed in groups as large as were involved in most NSC meetings .He drew a sharp line between the NSC policy review process and the day - to - day operations of foreign policy , which he maintained were the province of the Department of State .Dulles and his deputies were not comfortable with the scope the NSC review system gave to Secretary of the Treasury George Humphrey , another strong figure in the Cabinet , to intrude budgetary limitations into policy considerations .And Dulles successfully resisted a proposal to substitute the Vice President for the Under Secretary of State as chairman of the OCB , arguing that such a change would impinge on his role as principal adviser to the President on foreign policy .Critics of the Eisenhower NSC system have argued that it was inflexible , overstaffed , unable to anticipate and react to immediate crises , and weighed down by committees reporting in great detail on long checklists of minor policy concerns .The most thorough critique of the system emerged from the hearings conducted in 1960(1961 by the Senate Subcommittee on National Policy Machinery , known as the Jackson Subcommittee for its chairman , Senator Henry Jackson .Cutler and NSC Executive Secretary James Lay testified in support of the effectiveness of the system , but their testimony was offset by that of former Truman administration officials such as George Kennan , Paul Nitze , and Robert Lovett .They argued that foreign policy was being made by a passive President influenced by a National Security Council rendered virtually useless by ponderous , bureaucratic machinery .Basically , they argued , the NSC was a huge committee , and suffered from all the weaknesses of committees .Composed of representatives of many agencies , its members were not free to adopt the broad , statesmanlike attitude desired by the President , but , rather , were ambassadors of their own departments , clinging to departmental rather than national views .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.98952"}

William Donovan , USA , returned to civilian life .What could not be demobilized , however , was the newly dominant position of the United States in a changed world .US political leaders had for years been planning how best to advance US interests in the postwar world .They wanted to avoid the problems caused by misguided policies pursued after World War I , and they had already made their most fundamental policy choice of engagement rather than isolation .Two world wars in the first half of the twentieth century had shown that the country could not avoid being drawn into wars on other continents .The United States therefore had to take an active role in international affairs so as to make conflicts , and the need for US military intervention abroad , less likely .Even before the final moment of victory , Washington helped establish new international institutions - notably the World Bank and the United Nations - to deal with political , social , and economic issues on a global scale .Intelligence Support for US World Role .US leaders planned for a foreign intelligence capability to support the country 's new world role .Donovan 's persistent campaigning during 1943 - 1945 for the establishment of a postwar peacetime intelligence structure had attracted serious consideration by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and key officials , especially Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal .Donovan 's plan , however , aroused opposition within the government .Many did not believe that a new intelligence organization should report directly to the president , as Donovan wanted .Others criticized OSS for wasting money and for security lapses , and the press reflected these concerns plus fears of a \" Gestapo \" organization as the debate widened .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.88874"}

{"text": "Later President Eisenhower , although inclined to regard it as ' the council ' , made clear nonetheless that NSC was absolved of any responsibility per se for national decisions .\" The NSC advises ; the responsibility for decision is the President 's , insisted Eisenhower .President Kennedy came to office with an apparent bias against the kind of use Eisenhower made of NSC .Borne into office on a great chorus of rhetoric about the need for purposeful , energetic Presidential leadership , Kennedy \" at first made little use of the Council \" as a formal advisory body .Following the 1961 Cuban fiasco , however , \" the NSC was restored somewhat \" .In a very prescient paragraph , Ransom shows how important this grasp for power by an inner secret team was becoming as far back as 1952 .Even as the NSC was getting started , a struggle for control of that body was under way ; and the control was to be elected by gradually making that advisory committee into an operating power center .Ransom 's comment is worth repeating here : . \" Early in NSC 's life , according to President Truman , ' one or two of its members tried to change it into an operating super - cabinet on the British model . 'Truman identifies the members as his first two Secretaries of Defense , James Forrestal and Louis Johnson , who would sometimes , Truman recounts , put pressures on NSC 's executive secretary to use NSC authority to see that various governmental agencies were following NSC policy .The executive secretary declined to do this , on the ground that his was an advisory staff rather than an executing ' line ' function .Truman fought to keep the subordinate nature of NSC clear to all , emphasizing that Congress had in fact changed the title of NSC ' Director ' to ' Executive Secretary ' .Forrestal had , Truman notes , advocated using the British cabinet system as a model for the operation of postwar American government .To change to this system , wrote Truman , \" we would have to change the Constitution , and I think we have been doing very well under our Constitution .Nowhere was this behind - the - scenes struggle more significant than it was in the attempt to make of the \" quiet intelligence arm of the President \" an operational and extremely powerful secret agency .During the Eisenhower years the NSC , which at times was a large and unwieldy body , was reduced for special functions and responsibilities to smaller staffs .For purposes of administering the CIA among others , the NSC Planing Board was established .The men who actually sat as working members of this smaller group were not the Secretaries themselves .These men are heads of vast organizations and have many demands upon their time .This means that even if they could attend most meetings , the essential criteria for leadership and continuity of the decision - making process simply could not be guaranteed .Thus the subcommittee or special group idea was born , and these groups were made up of men especially designated for the task .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.00047"}

NSDD(266 of March 31 , 1987 , adopted the Board 's major recommendations : reduction of the size of the staff , appointment of a legal counsel , removal of the Crisis Pre - Planning Group , and its replacement with Policy Review Committee .The spirit of the reforms was given more content by the new NSC leadership appointed by President Reagan in November 1987 :National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci and Deputy National Security Adviser Lieutenant General Colin Powell .Carlucci reformed the NSC by replacing more than half of the professional staff within 3 months .Carlucci largely withdrew the NSC from its operational roles , but in the matter of Nicaragua , NSC continued to exercise the coordination that was not forthcoming from any of the agencies .In the autumn of 1988 , Carlucci was called to the Defense Department to succeed Caspar Weinberger , and for the third time among his six appointments to the position of National Security Adviser during his presidency , Reagan promoted the Deputy .General Powell directed an NSC that strived to provide balanced coordination of major foreign policy presentations for the President .Managing the Policy Review Group and the National Security Planning Group that Poindexter had so favored in preparing the NSC for discussions , Powell conducted an NSC process that was efficient but low key .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.79259"}

Elsey , Rear Admiral Robert Dennison , and W. Averell Harriman(to coordinate for him major foreign policy matters .Initially , Truman named the Secretary of State as the ranking member of the Council in his absence and expected the Department of State to play the major role in formulating policy recommendations .This decision disappointed Defense officials who hoped that the Secretary of Defense would be allowed to preside in the President 's absence and had offered to locate the NSC staff in the Pentagon .Clifford managed to resist Secretary of Defense Forrestal 's efforts to gain control of the NSC .During its initial years , the NSC suffered from haphazard staffing and irregular meetings and was sometimes bypassed entirely .The executive secretaries of the Council had no real authority or influence beyond managing the staff process .In 1949 , the NSC was reorganized .NSC standing committees were created to deal with sensitive issues such as internal security .Even Truman 's overhaul of the machinery in 1949 did not create a National Security Council that fulfilled the role originally envisioned .Truman was partly to blame .He insisted on going outside NSC channels for national security advice , relying directly on his Secretaries of State and Defense , and increasingly on the Bureau of the Budget .Attendance at NSC meetings gradually increased to a point where the Council became too large for free discussion and degenerated into a bureaucratic battleground of departmental rivalries .NSC lines of authority , never clear , became increasingly blurred .By not attending most NSC meetings , Truman ensured that Council members would seek him out to press their own viewpoints privately .In 1949 , events reinforced the need for better coordination of national security policy : NATO was formed , military assistance for Europe was begun , the Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb , and the Communists gained control in China .The Department of State seized the opportunity to review U.S. strategic policy and military programs , overcoming opposition from Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson and his allies in the Bureau of the Budget .Initially sidestepping formal NSC channels , State won approval of an ad hoc interdepartmental committee under its Policy Planning head , Paul Nitze .Their report , NSC 68 , was submitted directly to Truman in February 1950 , who sent it to the NSC for a cost analysis .An NSC committee authorized to consider costs and broader implications of NSC 68 began its work , but before it could be completed the Korean war broke out .The war in Korea dramatically changed the functioning of the NSC under Truman .Thereafter the Council met every Thursday and the President attended all but 7 of its 71 remaining meetings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.600784"}

Leahy - of some of the ideas about setting up a peacetime intelligence apparatus being considered by senior administration officials .He had one very specific requirement for whatever organization would handle foreign intelligence : he wanted a central coordinating function performed with respect to the information about the world coming to the president .He wrote in his memoir that \" the President must have all the facts that may affect the foreign policy or the military policy of the United States \" and went on to mention no fewer than eight different agencies involved in gathering information during the war .\" This scattered method of getting information , \" he wrote , first struck him when he was in the Senate and did so again in his initial months as president .[ 7 ] His assistant Clark Clifford has testified that this complaint increased as he moved toward making a decision on intelligence : \" By early 1946 , President Truman was becoming increasingly annoyed by the flood of conflicting and uncoordinated intelligence reports flowing haphazardly across his desk .\" [ 8 ] .Truman 's approach to intelligence differed from Roosevelt 's .Before and during World War II , President Roosevelt in effect operated as his own chief of intelligence , setting up both informal private and formal governmental arrangements for the collection and funneling of information about world affairs to him personally .After the war , President Truman sought advice from a range of close advisers , but he depended more than Roosevelt on public servants charged formally with giving him information and advice about foreign and military policy .By 1946 , when he initiated the postwar intelligence system , Truman found it natural to assign to someone other than himself the role of \" director of central intelligence \" to pull together all strands of important reporting .Centralizing Intelligence .An important study of how the executive branch should be organized for \" national security \" affairs , written by New York banker Ferdinand Eberstadt and completed in September 1945 , called for a central intelligence agency as well as for a national security council and other mechanisms .The study carefully delimited the centralized intelligence functions and made clear that they would be enmeshed in a broader organization dealing with national security affairs .This addressed a major concern of the military services ( in particular the Navy and Secretary Forrestal , who had commissioned Eberstadt 's study ) , which feared that Donovan wanted to absorb or destroy their intelligence activities .As long as the important field of intelligence remained grounded in organizations in which they had considerable influence , they were willing to accept that some functions were best done centrally .[ 9 ] .President Truman did not wait for the establishment of what would become the national security system enacted in 1947 to start his intelligence service .This group was charged with planning , developing , and coordinating \" all Federal foreign intelligence activities . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.57962"}

{"text": "Thus , in postwar Washington , the notion of coordination of activities and of information was a concept familiar to and favored by key leaders as a counter to sliding back into comfortable , insular patterns of organizational behavior .Some even felt \" coordination \" was perhaps the most overused word in postwar planning .Just what this coordination function meant for postwar intelligence , however , was far from clear .President Truman 's 1946 memorandum directed the DCI to \" plan for the coordination \" of the activities of various intelligence organizations .In the 1947 law , the coordination charge is to \" make recommendations to the President through the National Security Council . \"Thus , in the basic charter documents , the DCI is not charged with accomplishing coordination himself , only planning and recommending what should be done .The basic reason for this formulation probably flowed from the notion that coordination between elements belonging to different executive departments necessarily had to be agreed upon by the department heads .[ 11 ] .Implementing directives adopted pursuant to these charters purported to give the DCI a somewhat greater role .Roscoe Hillenkoetter , USN , however , and it vanished completely when the 1947 law abolished the NIA and the CIG .Neither the law nor the first implementing directive of the NSC on the DCI 's duties conferred this level of authority on the DCI .It would not be until President Eisenhower 's second term that language directing the DCI to coordinate federal intelligence activities would return to bolster the DCI 's authority .The relative priority of the coordination function did rise between 1946 and 1947 .In listing the duties of the DCI , President Truman 's 1946 memorandum gives first place to the function of correlating , evaluating , and disseminating intelligence ( not surprisingly , in light of Truman 's emphasis on seeking a single compilation of national security information for himself ) .The charge to \" plan for the coordination \" of activities is listed second .In the National Security Act , passed in the summer of 1947 , the coordination duty is listed ahead of the \" correlate and evaluate \" duty , implying a belief that broader actions across organizations needed more emphasis .In both charter documents , the lines of authority between department heads and their intelligence units are unchanged .For intelligence coordination actions to be achieved , the department heads must agree to whatever plan the DCI might put forward .In truth , it could not be otherwise in the absence of a centralized structure commanded by the DCI and with the departments continuing to have their own intelligence organizations .[ 13 ] This structure of authority makes clear an important aspect of the president 's importance to the DCI : the president is the only official who holds sway over the department heads who command the non - CIA elements of the intelligence establishment .[14 ] .Expectations Regarding Community Role .Clark Clifford , a key White House aide who worked directly with the president on intelligence matters in the postwar period , claimed in his memoir ( published in 1991 ) that \" the DCI 's oversight of the intelligence community falls far short of our original intent . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.035034"}

{"text": "Kennedy , who preferred policy - making with ad hoc groups , dismantled Eisenhower 's elaborate NSC machinery and allowed the Special Assistant for National Security Affairs and his staff to assume the primary coordination role .Kennedy 's freewheeling style tended to erase the distinction between policy - making and operations that President Eisenhower 's regimented staff system so carefully observed .Sharing Kennedy 's affinity for informal advisory arrangements , President Johnson let the NSC structure atrophy still further and , like his predecessor , relied instead on the National Security Adviser and his staff and various ad hoc groups and trusted friends .But he also consulted regularly with his Tuesday Lunch Group and in 1966 officially turned over responsibility for the supervision and coordination of interdepartmental activities overseas to the Secretary of State , with mixed results .Under Presidents Nixon and Ford , Henry Kissinger 's expanded NSC staff concentrated on acquiring analytical information from the various departments that would allow the National Security Adviser to put before the President the best possible range of options for decision .This system was in perfect accord with President Nixon 's preference for detailed written expositions rather than interpersonal groupings .Kissinger concentrated on a handful of major issues and allowed some foreign matters to devolve by default on the Department of State , while weapons and international financial questions were dealt with by the Departments of Defense and the Treasury .Kissinger at first attempted to restore the separation between policy - making and implementation , but eventually found himself personally performing both roles .Under President Carter , the National Security Adviser became a principal source of foreign affairs ideas and the NSC staff was recruited and managed with that in view .The Department of State provided institutional memory and served as operations coordinator .Some saw this as an activism - conservatism duality , and the press eventually picked up on the tensions that were present .The National Security Adviser 's role as public advocate rather than as custodian exacerbated the difficult relationships with State and other departments .A collegial approach to government decision - making was emphasized in the Reagan administration .The National Security Adviser was downgraded , and the Chief of Staff to the President exercised a coordinating role in the White House .The collegiality among powerful department heads was not successfully maintained and conflicts became public .The NSC staff tended to emerge as a separate , contending party .President Bush brought his own considerable foreign policy experience to his leadership of the National Security Council , and restored collegial relations among department heads .He reorganized the NSC organization to include a Principals Committee , Deputies Committee , and eight Policy Coordinating Committees .The NSC played an effective role during such major developments as the collapse of the Soviet Union , the unification of Germany , and the deployment of American troops in Iraq and Panama .The Clinton administration continued to emphasize a collegial approach within the NSC on national security matters .For 50 years , 10 Presidents have sought to use the National Security Council system to integrate foreign and defense policies in order to preserve the nation 's security and advance its interests abroad .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.386475"}

{"text": "The best evidence of how unrestrained the ST became lies in the record of the great proliferation of the concept of counterinsurgency ( CI ) .Almost as soon as the Kennedy Administration got under way -- certainly as it entered its second year -- the CIA , the White House , and certain elements of the DOD added one country after the other to the counterinsurgency list .To the believer in the blind anti - Communist doctrine , it sounded almost preordained that he should search for and then route out all \" Communist - inspired subversive insurgency \" wherever it was found .This flimsy disguise for clandestine operations brought together men who had little experience in the type of operation being developed and even less idea of the political situation in the countries involved .It was a shattering experience to attend some of these meetings and to hear men , some high in the councils of government , not even - able to locate some of these countries and to pronounce their names .The man in the Institute would then make copies of this \" operational concept \" .In normal times this concept would have been highly classified and revealed to a very few cleared officials ; but during this Kennedy - inspired CI period it was not necessary to bother with that bit of detail .The others would not know that this proposal had begun with the CIA .The main purpose of their meeting would be to discuss this operation , designed to combat the influence of \" Communist inspired subversive insurgency \" in the country listed .After such a meeting , this ad hoc group would propose that either the CIA or OSD work up the operational concept and present it to the NSC Special Group CI for approval .The idea of fighting Communism had become so blindly accepted that they began to forget that such activity was properly a \" clandestine operation \" and should not be performed lightly .The feeling of urgency and of an almost missionary zeal to combat and root out real or imagined subversive insurgency anywhere was such that the great importance of national sovereignty was all but overlooked . \" Subversive insurgency \" meant third - nation involvement ; so the Secret Team just assumed the right to become a party to the action in any country without even asking .What had been covert operations only a few years earlier were then considered perfectly acceptable under the definition of counterinsurgency .This did not mean that they were not concerned with the need for secrecy in the United States to keep the knowledge of what they were doing elsewhere from the public and Congress ; it only meant that they worked openly and almost unrestrictedly in the host CI country .The Army , Navy , and Air Force all had developed many units of Special Forces , Special Air Warfare squadrons and SEAL ( Sea , Air , Land ) teams , and these were sent into any country that would accept them .These teams were heavily sprinkled with CIA agents , and most of their direction in the field was the operational responsibility of the CIA .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.75461"}

Byrnes believed that the diplomatic information used in CIA 's intelligence summary was \" policy \" information that he should transmit to the president and took his case to the president .Truman simply told him the DCI 's summary was \" intelligence \" to him and not to stand in its way ( although he continued to accept daily reporting from the State Department , thus undercutting his own objective of non - duplication ) .The first national intelligence estimate ( NIE ) , a lengthy study of broad scope prepared on a short deadline in response to a White House request , was prepared in July 1946 , when Vandenberg was DCI .Written by a single author and not coordinated , the estimate drew complaints from the chiefs of the various intelligence agencies .The DCI defended what had been done as reasonable given the task and deadline .At the same time , he conceded that the precedent was not a model to follow in most instances and agreed that coordination of such papers was desirable .Nobody questioned that the DCI was the proper person to oversee products of this kind .The most basic challenge voiced by intelligence chiefs was that the DCI did not , under the law , have the right to \" produce \" intelligence unilaterally at all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.954475"}

{"text": "Like Kennedy , Johnson much preferred small , informal advisory meetings to large Council meetings supported by an elaborately organized staff .According to one of his aides , Johnson felt the NSC was \" not a live institution , not suited to precise debate for the sake of decision . \"Moreover , Johnson thought NSC meetings were prone to leaks -- they were \" like sieves , \" he once remarked -- and he inherited advisers who shared his views .Secretary of State Dean Rusk later observed that during the Kennedy Presidency neither he nor Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara liked to \" get into much discussion \" in the NSC with \" so many people sitting around the room \" and the possibility of leaks so great .Despite his misgivings about the Council , Johnson started out convening it fairly regularly , about every 2 weeks on average during his first 11 months in office .The sessions dealt with a broad range of issues but were relatively brief in duration and , after May 1964 , consisted largely of briefings .With the approach of the Presidential election in November , Johnson suspended NSC meetings , but then in early 1965 he shifted gears .From February 1965 through mid-1966 he convened the NSC almost exclusively to discuss Vietnam , doing so irregularly and , following a flurry of meetings in February 1965 , infrequently .Several participants later charged that Johnson used the NSC during 1965 not to consult on Vietnam as he committed major U.S. ground forces but to \" rubber stamp \" decisions made beforehand .The other major foreign policy crisis of the period , the intervention in the Dominican Republic during April and May 1965 , was not brought before the Council at all .As the Council 's formal advisory role diminished , so too did its institutional support .Johnson treated the NSC staff as a personal staff , and dropped meetings of the NSC Standing Group , which convened intermittently under Kennedy to deal with planning and operations problems .Official records of Council actions were discontinued , and National Security Action Memorandums , which Kennedy had instituted to inform government agencies of Presidential decisions requiring follow - up action , were issued with decreasing frequency .Whereas Kennedy had issued 272 NSAMs in less than three years , Johnson issued 46 in 1964 , 35 during 1965 and 1966 , and a mere 14 during his final 2 years in office .Disinclined to use the Council meetings for advice , Johnson , like Kennedy , relied heavily on his National Security Advisers : McGeorge Bundy , who remained in office through February 1966 , and Bundy 's successor , Walt Rostow , who served to the end of the administration .The small , informal , Tuesday luncheon meetings were much more to Johnson 's liking than formal NSC meetings and quickly gained a prominent place in the decision - making process .Embracing the Secretaries of State and Defense and the National Security Adviser , the Tuesday Lunch Group met 27 times between February and September 1964 .In all Johnson convened some 160 Tuesday luncheons during his Presidency , and the group was gradually expanded to include his press secretary , the Director of Central Intelligence , and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.545586"}

{"text": "The National Security Council was created by Public Law 80(253 , approved July 26 , 1947 , as part of a general reorganization of the U.S. national security apparatus .Proponents of the reform realized that no institutional means for the coordination of foreign and defense policy existed , and that the informal management techniques employed by President Roosevelt during the war and President Truman after the war were not suitable for the long haul .The State - War - Navy Coordinating Committee ( SWNCC ) had been established in 1944 at the Assistant Secretary - level , and by 1945 the Secretaries of State , War , and Navy began holding weekly meetings .President Roosevelt had tended to trust White House aides like Harry Hopkins and Admiral William D. Leahy to carry on necessary day - to - day coordination .President Truman for a time relied upon Special White House Counsel Clark Clifford to provide the Hopkins(Leahy type of personal coordination .Clifford , who was dismayed by the disorder among agencies taking major post - war policy - making decisions , was a key figure in establishing the National Security Council to give institutional stability to national security policy - making .The President could designate \" from time to time \" the Secretaries of other executive departments and the Chairmen of the Munitions Board and the Research and Development Board to attend meetings .While the new Central Intelligence Agency was to report to the NSC , the Director of Central Intelligence was not a member , although he attended meetings as an observer and resident adviser .The function of the NSC as outlined in the 1947 act was to advise the President on integration of domestic , foreign , and military policies relating to national security and to facilitate interagency cooperation .At the President 's direction , the NSC could also assess and appraise risks to U.S. national security , consider policies , and then report or make recommendations to the President .The act created a small permanent staff headed by a civilian Executive Secretary appointed by the President .In neither the National Security Act of 1947 nor subsequent amendments was there provision for the position of National Security Adviser .Initially , the permanent NSC staff had no substantive role in the formulation , let alone implementation , of national security policies .The NSC did , however , serve other purposes beyond its stated goal of advising on policy formulation .For Forrestal and the Navy , who were opposed to a strongly - unified Department of Defense , it provided top - level coordination of the three armed services without integration or unification .For Defense officials , it ensured a continuing military voice in formulation of related foreign and domestic policies during peacetime .For those , especially in Congress , who doubted Truman had adequate experience in foreign affairs or even doubted his abilities in general , the NSC offered the hope of evolving into a collegial policy - making body to reinforce the President .Truman was clearly sensitive to this implied criticism and jealous of his prerogatives as Chief Executive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.30054"}

{"text": "Intelligence Support to Policymakers .Efforts to strengthen intelligence support to policymakers have a long history .Every administration seems to reach its own modus vivendi , squaring expectations with realities between the policy and intelligence communities .As in the creation of the Sit Room itself , postcrisis evaluations often are catalysts for change .Many adjustments in organization , process , and personnel have been made over the years in response to the problems perceived at the time .We describe below a model that was used successfully in the late 1980s to strengthen intelligence support at the NSC Senior Director and Interagency Working Group level .In the late 1980s , the connectivity of the Sit Room to the NSC staff benefited from the assignment of several regional and functional intelligence analysts to the Sit Room staff .These analysts worked for the Sit Room Director but had offices in the OEOB and were assigned to the NSC 's regional and functional directorates .Their job was to provide tailored current intelligence support to the staff and to serve as a focal point for Sit Room support in the directorates .Though a recent casualty of personnel cutbacks , this approach was developed after several years of trial and error focused on improving internal and external intelligence support for the National Security Adviser and the NSC staff .Use of intelligence analysts to provide daily intelligence augmentation to NSC directorates was previously considered necessary to keep up with even the normal volume of relevant intelligence and cable traffic .At the same time , resulting from their close association with the policy staff , intelligence analysts also garnered an insider 's perspective on interagency policy deliberations .This perspective strengthened the Sit Room 's ability to anticipate specific intelligence requirements .During crises , the Senior Director would have a familiar face who would coordinate intelligence support in the Sit Room and who would know where to find key information in the IC .In turn , the Sit Room Watch Team would be augmented by appropriate functional or regional expertise from an intelligence analyst familiar with current interagency policy deliberations .It proved on many occasions to be a useful marriage .Use of on - scene intelligence analysts was also a valuable means for the IC to enhance its support to the White House .With insights gained through daily interaction with the NSC directors , the analysts communicated the precise current needs of the directorates to the IC 's production elements .The analysts served as a soundingboard for IC - initiated studies and would discuss with NSC directors the gist of draft or just - published studies , often resulting in requests for deskside briefings .Finally , the analysts were responsible for framing the bulk of the issues included in the Sit Room 's Weekly Emphasis List , which was often exchanged with other agencies .Again , it is important not to confuse the role of the Sit Room Watch Team or intelligence analysts with the role of other , more senior players in the interagency intelligence process .The interagency process includes National Intelligence Officers ( NIOs ) , who are responsible for coordinating the preparation and adjudication of formal interagency National Intelligence Estimates in support of the policy community .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.4953"}

Clinton on January 20 , 1993 , the day of his inauguration , issued Presidential Decision Directive l to departments and agencies concerned with national security affairs .PDD l revised and renamed the framework governing the work of the National Security Council .A Presidential Review Directive ( PRD ) series would be the mechanism used by the new administration to direct that specific reviews and analyses be undertaken by the departments and agencies .A Presidential Decision Directive ( PDD ) series would now be used to promulgate Presidential decisions on national security matters .The Bush administration 's National Security Review ( NSR ) series and National Security Directive ( NSD ) series were abolished .On January 21 , 1993 , in PDD 2 , President Clinton approved an NSC decision - making system that enlarged the membership of the National Security Council and included a much greater emphasis on economic issues in the formulation of national security policy .The President , Vice President , Secretary of State , and Secretary of Defense were members of the NSC as prescribed by statute .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.03588"}

{"text": "Early DCIs expanded the capabilities of CIA to enable them to carry out these responsibilities .Clandestine collection of human source intelligence had been an integral part of CIA 's activities from the beginning .The War Department had transferred the relevant resources left over from OSS to CIG , and CIA inherited them when it began operations in 1947 .Executive branch leaders , intelligence professionals , and most congressional leaders considered this to be an appropriate \" service of common concern \" at the time the 1947 law passed .The duty of mounting covert actions to influence events abroad came very soon after CIA was established , beginning as the Cold War developed in Europe .This duty was justified under the \" other duties and functions \" responsibility , a connection not known to have been considered at the time the 1947 law was passed .The phrase seems to have been meant to cover unforeseen contingencies .Its inclusion in Truman 's January 1946 memorandum precedes many of the events that convinced US leaders of the onset of the Cold War with the USSR and the need for a whole range of steps appropriate to that struggle , including covert actions assigned to CIA .[ 27 ] .Centralization and coordination of intelligence activities were key objectives sought in giving these responsibilities to the DCI and to CIA .A fundamental goal was to ensure that clandestine operations abroad not suffer from crossed wires such as having two or more US organizations trying to hire the same agents .For some years after the war , DCIs had to deal with US Army clandestine collection efforts not favored by CIA and about coordination of activities in occupied Germany .The 1949 Dulles - Jackson - Correa Report urged the merger of the two offices into one clandestine service in CIA , and the NSC endorsed that recommendation .Again , it was DCI Smith who took decisive action toward these goals .He first insisted that OPC report via him to its cabinet - level policymaking superiors , resolving what had been a somewhat ambiguous situation without dissent from either Frank Wisner , OPC 's head , or the cabinet officers involved .He then adopted the halfway measure of placing the two clandestine operations offices under the same senior officer ( Allen Dulles ) while keeping them separate ( again , without dissent from the NSC despite its endorsement of merger ) .In 1952 , he finally merged them into a single CIA directorate .In this way , the DCI gave priority to the aim of coordination despite misgivings about the wisdom of joining two activities with different and not always compatible purposes .The \" services of common concern \" rationale applied to a number of activities other than those connected with clandestine operations abroad .Prominent examples discussed among the intelligence chiefs and then given to CIA to handle were the interception and exploitation of foreign radio broadcasts and press and the gleaning of intelligence from US citizens who traveled abroad .CIA : A Complicating Factor .It is worth pausing to consider how the DCI 's use of CIA , the one organization that he unambiguously headed , complicated his community leadership role from the beginning .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.40264"}

Edgar Hoover 's Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) should be cut back to prewar levels and confined to operations in the United States .He also said that he envisaged \" a quite different plan for intelligence \" than that proposed by Hoover , who had suggested an expansion of the FBI 's wartime intelligence operations in Latin America to other regions of the world .A week later , in a conversation with the same official in which he confirmed his determination to close down OSS , Truman \" again commented that he has in mind a broad intelligence service attached to the President 's office .\" [ 6 ] .Aware that the Joint Chiefs of Staff ( JCS ) and others were studying the issue , the president directed the secretary of state to consider what foreign intelligence arrangement would best serve national interests .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.01346"}

{"text": "I had entered the country by way of Tehran , Iran , and flown mountains near Baku .Then our course took us further north over Makhachkala and northwesterly along the Manych River to Rostov .Although I had seen many bombed and burned cities during the war - from Italy to Manila and Tokyo -- I had never seen anything to compare with the absolute devastation of Rostov .From there we flew toward Kiev to the city of Poltava , where we landed and remained for a few days .Our return was over essentially the same route .Since I had been free to fly a varied course , I flew at about five hundred feet above the ground for the entire trip and wandered off course right and left as random cities and towns came into view .The major lesson from such a flight was that the war areas of Russia had been terribly destroyed by the German onslaught and by the Russian scorched - earth policy .The other outstanding factor was that over this fifteen - hundred - mile area of the Russian heartland there were absolutely no roads .There were trails and horse or farm - vehicle paths , but no roads of any kind .There were a major railroad and the great Manych Canal .In 1944 , one could observe that Russia was going to have to recover from a devastating war and was going to have to make a major effort to develop its backward economic base , which without modern road transportation would certainly be limited in its growth .It was clear that when the great anti - Communist hue and cry began only two years later , it was founded more on the potential danger of Russia as a developer of an atom bomb capability than it was on Russia 's potential threat to the United States .The result of the \" Communist threat \" emotionalism was to create in the minds of Americans and others in the Western world the image of a Soviet monster , which was only part flesh and mostly fantasy .However , it was just this sort of thing that played into the hands of those alarmists who supported a movement to create a strong central intelligence authority with clandestine operational powers .There were then several factors that came together in support of the creation of a central intelligence agency .The Administration had seen the woeful deficiencies of uncoordinated intelligence as practiced during World War II .Also , the Administration saw the real importance and necessity for a strong intelligence arm of the President as a result of the new pressures of the Nuclear Age .However , the early Truman Administration was trying to provide leadership for the one world defined by Secretary of State James Byrnes and to keep the world from being torn into armed camps again so shortly after the war .By 1948 the Truman Administration was no longer advocating what it had preached in early 1946 .All of these pressures -- and they were great pressures at that crucial time -- played a major part in the decision to create the Central Intelligence Agency and in the behind - the - scenes battles that were incidental to the passage of the law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.71954"}

{"text": "The September 1984 issue of Soldier of Fortune magazine includes an article about Red Dawn 's production , particularly its weaponry , that begins : \" Military strategists have often discussed the repercussions of a communist takeover of Central America .One worst - case scenario has the Soviet Union training Cubans and Nicaraguans in the offensive use of advanced weapons such as the MiG 25 and T-72 tank .\" The article ends : .Red Dawn seriously attempts realism .Milius spent $ 17 million trying to give the American public a taste of what Soviet weaponry , tactics and occupation practices are all about .Liberal critics will howl about Reagan 's deleterious effect on the creative arts and scream that Red Dawn is unabashed saber - rattling propaganda .It sounds like our kind of movie .Red Dawn opens across the country on 17 August .So yes , Red Dawn was propaganda in 1984 .But it was not merely propaganda ; there is cleverness and even humanity to it .It 's an action / survival movie , so character development is n't a particular goal , but where it spends it moments of character development are telling .Instead of just building of family melodrama , the original Red Dawn gave humanity to some of the antagonists ( particularly Colonel Bella ) .While the Soviet commanders are cartoons , the Russian soldiers are clearly just as trapped in the horrific logic of war as the Wolverines .The new Red Dawn also wants to be propaganda , as the opening montage shows us .But there are more subtle connections to not just right - wing militarism , but extremist nuttiness .The key is three letters : EMP .How do the bad guys invade North America ?They wipe out the American defense infrastructure , and apparently the entire American military , by setting off at least one electromagnetic pulse ( EMP ) .Now , EMPs are real .Boeing is even developing an EMP missile .But who gets really excited at the idea of an EMP knocking out electronic infrastructures ?The apocalypse addicts at WorldNet Daily .Famed doomsayer Newt Gingrich brought it up during the Republican primary .Right - wingers get positively giddy at the idea .Why ?Because it justifies lots of spending on missile defense .But according to the right wingers , President Obama is not spending nearly enough money to defend us from missiles .We could be wiped out at any moment by an EMP .But the weak , appeasing black guy in the White House is , whether he knows it or not , a traitor .Whatever can be said about John Milius , at least he was committed enough to his concept to have thought it through .The new Red Dawn seemingly unintentionally opens itself to all sorts of odd moments , such as when Jed says , \" When I was overseas [ in Iraq ] , we were the good guys , we enforced order .Well , now we 're the bad guys .We create chaos . \" In 1984 , when the Wolverines went into the desert on horses , they evoked images of the Mujahideen in Afghanistan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.938416"}

{"text": "To postwar American leaders well aware of its role in World War II and of its continuing importance , however , it seemed entirely natural to treat it separately .Top officials continued to believe after the war that the special nature of this intelligence merited strict compartmentation .[ 37 ] Also , the organizations performing this kind of work were military , not civilian , and their continued integration with military organizations made operational sense , especially for tactical support .Finally , the creation of a DCI aimed especially at the objective of adding a US capability for national intelligence , not gathering existing intelligence activities into one organizational basket .The early DCIs thus contented themselves with ensuring that they - and the CIG or CIA - had access to communications intelligence products and did not press for a greater role than membership or chairmanship of the interagency committee that dealt with communications intelligence issues .They believed that access to that discipline 's finished products adequately fulfilled the charge to them to \" correlate and evaluate \" all sources of intelligence information in rendering \" national \" intelligence to top - level policymakers .DCI Smith did , however , play a role in the process that led to the creation of the National Security Agency ( NSA ) .[38 ] Late in 1951 , he requested that the NSC review this field of intelligence , and a committee headed by Herbert Brownell , Jr. , who became President Eisenhower 's first attorney general , took up that task .It concluded that communications intelligence was a \" national \" intelligence responsibility and should be conducted by a new agency , NSA , which was duly created by secret presidential order in October 1952 .The field nonetheless remained in important respects separate from other intelligence activities .NSA reported directly to a special committee of the NSC , and the secretary of defense became the NSC 's executive agent for the nation 's signals intelligence effort .Foothold Established .By the time Dwight Eisenhower became president and moved Smith to become John Foster Dulles 's deputy at the State Department early in 1953 , the DCI position had been accepted as a valued one that contributed to national security decisionmaking at the topmost level .Smith personally had extensive personal access to President Truman , and he dealt confidently with him and with cabinet officials regarding the full range of intelligence issues .His establishment of a system for producing national intelligence in the form of NIEs blended personal DCI leadership with a process that involved and drew upon the entire Intelligence Community .It was perhaps the best example of an accepted and useful DCI community leadership role .Smith 's influence , however , was also connected with CIA 's growing role as an action agency fighting the Cold War .He had carried further the process begun by Vandenberg in 1946 of increasing intelligence capabilities directly under his command and had formed the basic structure for the modern CIA .Thus , as he strengthened - indeed established - an important personal role for the DCI within the executive branch , he also promoted the dual nature of the intelligence capabilities underlying the DCI 's power and influence , the two \" hats \" coming to symbolize separate agency and community roles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.6129"}

Giffords .Political commentators gasped and wondered if maybe bipartisan rancor contributed to the event .Progressives pointed out that there is one side in America which gleefully , frequently uses violence - tinged rhetoric when discussing responses to the actions of the opposite side , and it ai n't us .But what we hear is \" both sides are equally bad and responsible .\" All of that said , I firmly believe in Dr. King 's advice to \" love the hell out of \" one 's enemies .You will not find me accusing even the most reprehensible members of the modern American right of being Hitler or advocating spiritual , physical or mental harm toward them .But I find nothing praiseworthy or noteworthy in discovering or proclaiming that people on the other side of the aisle from me are human after all ; that 's the point of the story about Bull Connor I related in my previous post .And it is because I know they are human that I urge them to stop being assholes to people and to stop remaining willfully ignorant of how the policies they advocate are causing great harm to large portions of the Earth 's population and to the planet itself .posted by lord_wolf at 11:59 AM on April 10 , 2012 [ 7 favorites ] .I have despised Mr. Breitbart since forever ... but his final proposal ?His willingness to try and SEE another America ?It 's given me pause ... .Now , SEE what happens when you try being civil to your rivals for a change ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.8082"}

'That 's the question I do n't understand .The person who asks that question has to come in the room and explain it to me .\" Just the fact that Joel Coen equates black and Asian people with \" Martians \" is very telling .He also said : \" You do n't sit down and write a story and say , ' I 'm going to write a story that involves four black people , three Jews , and a dog,'-right ?That 's not how stories get written . \"Indeed .They get written by white men who think that equating people of color with aliens and dogs is an acceptable thing to do .Yes , please ! \"An apocryphal tale of a night Princess Diana spent at a gay bar with Freddie Mercury as a drag king is the subject of a new musical .\" Will watch . \"Surprise !I 'm still alive ! \"-Noela Rukundo , whose husband hired hitmen to kill her , but who , through a series of extraordinary events , ended up at her own funeral in order to confront the man who paid $ 7,000 in Australian dollars to end her life .Noela Rukundo sat in a car outside her home , watching as the last few mourners filed out .They were leaving a funeral - her funeral .Finally , she spotted the man she 'd been waiting for .She stepped out of her car , and her husband put his hands on his head in horror .\" Is it my eyes ? \" she recalled him saying .\" Is it a ghost ? \" \" Surprise !I 'm still alive ! \" she replied .Far from being elated , the man looked terrified .Five days earlier , he had ordered a team of hit men to kill Rukundo , his partner of 10 years .And they did - well , they told him they did .They even got him to pay an extra few thousand dollars for carrying out the crime .Now here was his wife , standing before him .In an interview with the BBC on Thursday , Rukundo recalled how he touched her shoulder to find it unnervingly solid .He jumped .Then he started screaming .\" I 'm sorry for everything , \" he wailed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.381935"}
{"text": "China has seriously lagged behind the US and Europe in aggressive war - making capacity .In the nineteenth century British imperialism demolished China 's global position with its military superiority , seizing China 's ports - because of China 's reliance on \" mercantile superiority \" .The conquest of India , Burma and most of Asia allowed Britain to establish colonial bases and recruit local mercenary armies .The British and its mercenary allies encircled and isolated China , setting the stage for the disruption of China 's markets and the imposition of the brutal terms of trade .The British Empire 's armed presence dictated what China imported ( with opium accounting for over 50 % of British exports in the 1850s ) while undermining China 's competitive advantages via tariff policies .Today the US is pursuing similar policies : US naval fleet patrols and controls China 's commercial shipping lanes and off - shore oil resources via its overseas bases .The Obama - Clinton White House is in the process of developing a rapid military response involving bases in Australia , Philippines , and elsewhere in Asia .The US is intensifying its efforts to undermine Chinese overseas access to strategic resources while backing \" grass roots \" separatists and \" insurgents \" in West China , Tibet , Sudan , Burma , Iran , Libya , Syria , and elsewhere .The US military agreements with India and the installation of a pliable puppet regime in Pakistan have advanced its strategy of isolating China .While China upholds its policy of \" harmonious development \" and \" non - interference in the internal affairs of other countries \" , it has stepped aside as US and European military imperialism have attacked a host of China 's trading partners to essentially reverse China 's peaceful commercial expansion .China 's lack of a political and ideological strategy capable of protecting its overseas economic interests has been an invitation for the US and NATO to set - up regimes hostile to China .The most striking example is Libya where US and NATO intervened to overthrow an independent government led by President Gaddafi , with whom China had signed multi - billion dollar trade and investments agreements .The NATO bombardment of Libyan cities , ports and oil installation forced the Chinese to withdraw 35,000 Chinese oil engineers and construction workers in a matter of days .The same thing happened in Sudan where China had invested billions to develop its oil industry .The US , Israel , and Europe armed the South Sudanese rebels to disrupt the flow of oil and attack Chinese oil workers 6 In both cases China passively allowed the US and European military imperialists to attack its trade partners and undermine its investments .Under Mao Zedong , China had an active policy countering imperial aggression .It supported revolutionary movements and independent Third World governments .Today 's capitalist China does not have an active policy of supporting governments or movements capable of protecting China 's bilateral trade and investment agreements .China 's inability to confront the rising tide of US military aggression against its economic interests is due to deep structural problems .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.39278"}

{"text": "The 1984 Red Dawn was not even remotely a feel - good movie , but it gave us a space in which to feel proud of an idea of America that could survive even the most devastating attack by the Soviet Union ( and its Latin American minions ) .This , to my father and many other people , demonstrated exactly why even the most minimal type of registration of guns is not merely annoying , but a threat to freedom .I vividly remember my father saying , \" If the Russians come , we burn those damn forms . \"Red Dawn was not merely an action movie ; it was a documentary .But Red Dawn was a movie made during a time when the U.S. was not officially at war .It appeared in U.S. theatres less than a year after the invasion of Grenada , and just at the time when the actions that would eventually become the Iran - Contra Scandal were making their way into the public consciousness .The hawks of the Reagan administration needed the public to be both patriotic and fearful of the Red Menace , because otherwise it was difficult to justify the massive transfer of wealth into the Pentagon .Red Dawn did that better than any other movie of the time .( For much more on this background , see the article by J. Hoberman in the Nov / Dec 2012 issue of Film Comment . )Now , though ?The new Red Dawn comes as the Iraq war is winding down and the war in Afghanistan ( our longest ) may be nearing some sort of end .( And then , of course , there 's Libya . )But these have been wars where we have been invaders fighting insurgents .They have been long , unfocused wars with no clear victory conditions .They began with some popularity and unanimity of public opinion , but the longer they went on , and the more that people learned about them , the less popular they became .They continued because the U.S. military is , while a huge part of the national budget , not a particularly concrete and visible part of everyday life and concern for many Americans .Without the threat of a draft , and with the rise of long - distance and drone strikes , most Americans can ignore the immediate reality of American wars , the hundreds of thousands of deaths and injuries on every side .It 's in what the new Red Dawn makes us attach our feelings of pride , joy , and power to that it really differs from its predecessor , because the idea of America that it presents is neither particularly clear nor the product of much conviction .There are flags and some general genuflecting in the direction of \" freedom \" , but the original Red Dawn offered a vision of how its idea of \" freedom \" actually works in the world , and what threatens it .Milius made numerous references to his masculine hero Theodore Roosevelt , and the vision he presented was stark , painful , and apocalyptic , more Hobbesian than Amurrican .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.706985"}

{"text": "So too does the thought of armed plucky rebels defending America from tyranny .In fact , such scenarios would no doubt make for successful Hollywood films .But what is appealing and what might make a blockbuster film are not the same as what is , in fact , true .Naturally enough , the general idea of the role of civilian armaments in deterring tyrants can be debated extensively .This is , of course , a worthwhile debate and would be a rather interesting project for historians to sort out .However , what is under discussion here is the rather specific matter of whether or not the right to keep and bear arms is warranted by the deterrent value of this right against tyranny .This , obviously enough , involves some key matters of fact .One obvious matter of fact is the issue of whether or not gun rights frightens politicians with tyrannical intentions - that is , whether worries about assassination keep them in check .As argued above , it makes sense to think that a politician would be less inclined to do something if she believed doing so would result in people attempting to kill her .Naturally , if the population has easy access to firearms , then an assassin could easily acquire a gun .If there were strict controls on guns , then politicians would have less to worry about in terms of assassins drawn from the ranks of the general population .They would just have to worry about the military and police forces ( and anyone who could make a bomb or wield a knife ) .Obviously , even in a state with strict civilian gun control , the politicians would need to win over the majority of the military and police forces to their tyrannical agenda - or their attempts at tyranny would end rather quickly .In the United States , this would require winning over the national forces ( the military , FBI , and so on ) as well as the state ( National Guard and state police ) and local forces ( police and sheriffs ) .Interestingly , democratic states with stricter gun control than the United States , such as the United Kingdom , do not seem to have fallen into tyranny .This suggests that it is not fear of assassination by citizens exercising their guns rights that keeps a democratic state from tyranny , but rather other factors .But perhaps they are just biding their time and the United Kingdom will soon be back under an absolute monarchy .A second obvious matter of fact is the issue of whether or not civilian gun ownership would deter the military and police forces from imposing tyranny on the people at the behest of the tyrant(s ) .That is , the tyrant has won over the American citizens in the military and police forces to the degree that they would be willing to throw aside the Constitution and turn their weapons against the general population - including their friends , family , spouses , and children .In such a scenario , it would seem that civilian weapons would be of little use .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "117.63713"}

{"text": "Handguns , rifles and shotguns would be of rather limited use against such forces .Back in the time when civilian weapons and military weapons were essentially on par ( muskets ) and the most destructive military weapons were very limited ( muzzle loading cannons ) an armed civilian population would reasonably be regarded as a deterrent .However , it is hard to imagine suburban Americans battling successfully against tanks , Predator drones , and Hellfire missiles using AR-15s and .38 specials .That said , there is something to be said for an honorable death fighting against impossible odds .Of course , the civilians could turn to the sort of tactics used by insurgents and terrorists to resist the military and police of the tyrant - but this would not be a case of the right to keep and bear arms deterring tyranny .However , the main thing that seems to defeat tyrants is a lack of support - without that a tyrant is a just a single man .Naturally , it can be pointed out that civilian arms could be used to resist a small scale tyrannical incursion ( perhaps a takeover in a small town ) .However , in such a scenario the tyrant would soon be dealt with by the police or military of the state .Also , the main deterrents against American tyrants grabbing American towns would seem to involve not guns but other factors - like an unwillingness to go along with a tyrant .It would thus seem that civilian gun ownership would be little , if any , deterrence or defenses against a serious tyrant .It is also interesting to note that if such armaments provided considerable power against the state , there would be the fear that they would be used by a segment of the population to impose their own tyrant on others .In light of the above , the defense against tyranny argument would seem to provide little in the way of justification for civilian gun rights .This should not be terribly shocking - after all , the second amendment does not justify the right to keep and bear arms in terms of having an armed population ready to shoot it out with other armed citizens .There are , however , good reasons for gun rights , but these are beyond the intended scope of this essay .22 Comments .Currently the political stuff is working , so not so much the need for direct action .But do you think the US is somehow free of Taliban like crazies ?Do you think there are n't enough latent terrorists ?The odd thing is that the biggest threat from government tyranny in the US comes from the extreme conservative right .The fundamental religious , the greedy military industrialists , are all more likely to pose an anti - democratic threat to liberty ; and the brainless gun totting bozo underclass is easy for them to whip up into a frenzy .How else would they come to equate liberal democratic politicians with Stalinism , Fascism and Islamic terrorism in equal measure ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "126.73735"}

{"text": "There 's just that one tiny point that will irk the diehards specifically because of how woven it is into the backstory .For myself , I do n't let it bother me .I found it to be a rather cool nod to an early prequel era comic , and let 's be honest here : neither the novels nor the comics are actually canon .Forget this \" layers of canon \" nonsense , because Star Wars is the only franchise where the younger fans have n't figured it out yet .Regardless ... it 's a non - issue to the plot of this story .I will simply say this instead , that much like with Darth Plagueis , this book should probably be elevated to a higher level closer to the canon of the films because of the material it does cover .What IS an issue to the plot of this story is an inside look at the culture of the sand people .As with other appearances of this race here and there throughout the EU , they are suitably creepy and fearsome , and it 's a treat for this fan to get a story revolving around them .One tiny personal disappointment I do have , and this is a bit of a character spoiler , but not a plot spoiler , is that Kenobi at no time learns that Darth Vader is still alive .I was hoping to have this scene , but perhaps they 'll leave that for another story .There is no Vader in this story ; it 's Kenobi - centric , and all that implies .Tatooine is remote , after all , and the news travels slowly .A sense of how slowly is depicted here .To make up for that tiny little disappointment , what we 're given is a range of characters , most of them moisture farmers , who are actually interesting .These characters are so well written that you come to care for their plight in short order , which connects you to Kenobi as he fights his instincts to get involved .I 'll also add that I am a huge fan of ironic justice , and the ending of this book just works for me .It 's brilliant , it 's huge , and it 's a bit disconcerting , and I 'll say no more about that .From there , you sprinkle in a few well - placed classic Ben Burtt sound effects and musical cues from the maestro John Williams , and what you have is one of the better written , better performed , and better produced Star Wars audiobooks on record .I 've heard it said in early reviews that it 's perhaps better than Darth Plagueis .I do n't know that I 'd go quite that far , but it is an excellent companion novel to Dark Lord : The Rise of Darth Vader , covering pretty much the same time frame and type of character transition in the wake of Ep .III .Bottom line , in terms of importance to the EU and caliber of quality , this is one of the best in the line , and one that the fans simply must have .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "129.38321"}

{"text": "The NRA / Teaparty always treat the \" tyrant \" as an individual who rises without popular support , and then tyrannizes with the aid of an alien faceless state ( Bond villain style henchmen ) .But this is not so .Hitler rise to power was through a movement so similar to the American Teaparty as to be nearly indistinguishable .The same authoritarian anti - democratic rhetoric dressed up as patriotism and \" freedom \" .Although there were tighter gun laws in Germany , because of political instability and popular support for the extreme right , Hitler 's Teaparty thugs were easily able to acquire guns .Guns , which they used to intimidate and murder political opponents - they even went as far as attempting an armed revolution in Munich in 1923 .These thugs saw themselves just as the Teaparty ; patriots defending their country against tyranny - against the enemies within .The reality of gun control in Germany in the 1920s .Hitler at all times was able to parade around with fully armed militias of paramilitaries - his SS , among others .They were tolerated by the German state as they were seen as bulwark against the possibility of a communist revolution .Both communist and fascist activists were armed and did kill each other .The availability of guns contributed to the political instability , which then contributed to the availability of guns .Funnily , the NRA never use the Klan as an argument for the right to bear arms .As for the argument of Jews being able to defend themselves against the German Teaparty if only they had had the 2nd Amendment , why were the hundreds of people lynched in America , who did have the 2nd Amendment , unable to defend themselves .The simple reason , like the Jews in Germany , they were out gunned by both the thugs and the state .Was an armed resistance possible in Germany .Well there initially had been by the communists but as the Horst Wessell Lied goes Kam'raden , die Rotfront und Reaktion erschossen , they were mostly shot .The first concentration camps were for political opponents not Jews .And back to the myth of the tyrant acting alone .Hitler 's state relied on the help of ever vigilant patriots for its ' defense .People were able to have their next door neighbours sent to the concentration camps simply for being un - German .It was n't the Gestapo you had to worry about ( they were bored silly - they had the public doing all their investigating and terrorising for them ) .Who you had to worry about was your next door neighbour , the ever vigilant ( and armed ) patriot who was staunchly defending your \" freedom \" and \" liberty \" .By 1938 , the German guns laws were relaxed to the point nearly everyone ( apart from Jews ) could own a gun .By the end of the war , even Pope Bernard , who was a child at the time , had a gun .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "138.69006"}
