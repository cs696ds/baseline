{"text": "The question is : can it become a crescendo in time ?There are many political and institutional forces that will put up obstacles to such a plain man from the heart , including Democratic Party chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz .During the next couple of months , this will all become much clearer .One of my nightmares is waking up the first Wednesday of November and finding out that Donald Trump is our president elect .There are lots of sane reasons to think that this simply ca n't happen .The Donald 's negatives are through the roof .Last July a Washington Post / ABC News poll reported 61 percent of voters would never vote for Trump , but that was before he started running in earnest .In December , according to a Quinnipiac survey , fifty percent of registered voters last month said they would be embarrassed if he were our president .One thing that makes me leery is that people were saying the same things about Ronald Reagan but mainly by force of his personality plus that certain intangible something that people saw in his eyes he became president anyhow .We are still stuck in the Reagan wreckage , and arguably Donald Trump is the latest creature to crawl out of it .There is no question that Trump has charisma , although lots of people see past it .So many factors affect who will be our next president .Much could hinge on the economy , but a lot of it will simply have to do with who gets nominated and how enthusiastic each party is about their candidate .Republicans probably wo n't be enthusiastic if Trump is nominated , at least not establishment Republicans .But Trump though is going for a bigger audience and he is attracting principally disaffected whites , many of which have n't voted in recent elections .They like his brash style and take charge attitude and see it as authentic , but mostly he plays on their fears , an unstated fear of losing white privilege .While Trump has high negatives , so does Hillary Clinton .Trump is a master persuader , Clinton not so much considering how President Obama managed to win the 2008 Democratic nomination .So yes , it 's possible , although I would like to take comfort in polls that suggest it just wo n't happen .Back in 2012 as that process went forward I offered my thoughts on how to deal with political bullies .Four years later the post still gets regular hits .The Republican presidential field has many bullies .Trump certainly is one but ( among those still in the running ) others include Ted Cruz , Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina .All are used to getting their way and will use tactics fair or foul to achieve it .Trump though combines bullying with other non - bullying tactics including humor , demagoguery , flippant remarks and a well - practiced technique of staying in the news .Pretty much every day he will say or do something controversial specifically so he will stay at the top of the news .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "40.67865"}

{"text": "Sanders though could land a little jab at Clinton by focusing on her catering to big banks , which she attributed to a natural reaction following September 11 when lower Manhattan had suffered such devastation .The logic was stretched , to say the least .Sanders at least had authenticity on his side , but it did n't seem to matter much .He pointed out that Clinton took money from PACs , while his campaign was PAC - free , and thus not tainted .The reason it did n't help much is because Clinton is now a seasoned debater and not easily ruffled on the stage .And Democrats would be happy to have any of the three debaters as their party 's nominee .The debate was a bit sharper and at times heated , but I doubt it changed anyone 's preferences except possibly Martin O'Malley will get a modest bump with a solid and polished debate performance .The terrorist incidents in Paris that killed 129 people on Friday of course were discussed at the start of the debate .The candidates agreed that terrorism like this was not the responsibility of America to solve alone , but generally was something on which America should lead .Sanders rightly pointed out that most of these sorts of wars come back to bite us .O'Malley got a gotcha question when asked if he could point to experience that would show he could handle complex international incidents like this .No governor of course would have this sort of experience so it was pointless to ask .Sanders struck me as a little more grounded .In discussing terrorism , he argued that climate change was fueling terrorism .This is true in Syria , where a long - term drought is likely a result of climate change and feeding instability there .Unquestionably as the climate changes there will be more instability and mass migrations , and the latter will feed the former .Sanders was also correct in his analysis that the Defense Department 's priorities were pretty screwed up , with most of it going to maintain an inefficient infrastructure designed to address 20 th century military problems , and comparatively little going to address terrorism itself .All candidates walked a fine line on immigration but unanimously agreed that Islam itself was not a problem , only those perverting it .There was none of the xenophobia against immigrants we saw in all the Republican debates so far .All want to make college more affordable but Clinton wants to make is so students and parents are stakeholders .This effectively meant that she does not want a wholly free college education for our students .No one addressed the larger issue : with so many failing schools , fewer students are graduating with the skills to tackle college .A holistic educational solution is needed .Charter schools are probably contributing to the problem , as profit - driven schools have no incentive to keep poorer performing students .Overall O'Malley did well , but not enough to make him look unique or to offer a compelling reason to vote for him over Clinton or Sanders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.373924"}

{"text": "\" Of course , it 's hard not to notice that some groups can tug better than others .So in the 1950s , social scientists , like C. Wright Mills , author of The Power Elite , developed another theory of \" elites \" - those who wield more pull thanks to factors like education , social networks and ethnicity .In this view , wealth is just one of many factors that might help someone become the leader of a major business or gain a government position , thereby joining the elite .But neither theory explains how the super - rich are turning public policy to their benefit even at the expense of the moderately rich .Also , neither theory takes into account the unique power that comes with enormous wealth - the kind found in that one - tenth of the 1 % .Whether or not the super - rich hold any official position in business or government , they remain powerful .Only when we separate wealth from all other kinds of power can we begin to understand why our tax system looks the way it does - and , by extension , how the top one - tenth of 1 % of the income distribution has distorted American democracy .Enormous wealth is the heart of oligarchy .So what 's an oligarchy ?Without this massive concentration of wealth , there are no oligarchs .In any society , of course , an extremely unequal wealth distribution provokes conflict .Oligarchy is the politics of the defense of this wealth , propagated by the richest members of society .Wealth defense can take many forms .In ancient Greece and Rome , the wealthiest citizens cooperated to run institutionalized states that defended their property rights .In Suharto 's Indonesia , a single oligarch led a despotic regime that mostly used state power to support other oligarchs .In medieval Europe , the rich built castles and raised private armies to defend themselves against each other and deter peasants tempted by their masters ' vaults .In all of these cases oligarchs are directly engaged in rule .They literally embody the law and play an active role in coercion as part of their wealth defense strategy .Contemporary America ( along with other capitalist states ) instead houses a kind of \" civil oligarchy .\" The big difference is that property rights are now guaranteed by the impersonal laws of an armed state .Even oligarchs , who can be disarmed for the first time in history and no longer need to rule directly , must submit to the rule of law for this modern \" civil \" arrangement to work .When oligarchs do enter government , it is more for vanity than to rule as or for oligarchs .Good examples are New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg , former presidential candidate Ross Perot and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney .Another feature of American oligarchy is that it allows oligarchs to hire skilled professionals , middle- and upper - class worker bees , to labor year - round as salaried , full - time political advocates and defenders of the oligarchy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.939285"}

Bernie Sanders ( D - VT ) said during the Democrats ' New Hampshire debate that he would welcome an audit , but he does n't want to blow this out of proportion ; noting that both he or Hillary need 2,382 delegates to clinch the nomination .The Iowa Caucuses allocated 23 delegates to Clinton and 21 to Sanders .This is n't the end of the world for the Sanders camp .The self - described democratic socialist also mentioned that if an audit would occur , it would probably break even between him and Mrs. Clinton .Iowa Democratic Party officials are reviewing results from the Iowa caucuses and making updates where discrepancies have been found .Party Chairwoman Andy McGuire the day after Monday 's caucuses said no review would be conducted , and that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton 's narrow victory over Bernie Sanders was final .But as errors are being discovered , the final tally is being changed , party officials confirmed to the Des Moines Register on Friday .\" Both the Sanders and Clinton campaigns have flagged a very small number of concerns for us , and we are looking at them all on a case - by - case basis , \" Iowa Democratic Party spokesman Sam Lau told the Register .The latest development follows widespread questions among Iowa Democrats and national media about the accuracy of the counts reported on caucus night , which saw the second - highest number of participants and closest result in Democrats ' caucus history .The Register had previously called the Democratic Iowa Caucus a \" debacle , \" and implored the state party to conduct an audit , including a list of each precinct that executed a coin flip to break a tie and the results .Pro - abortion Group Uses Zika Virus to Pressure 2016 Frontrunners to Support Their Agenda .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.68302"}

{"text": "I had thought for a long time that the Republican Party was a racist party .Research now proves me right .Some will doubtless point out the success of some black candidates like Ben Carson as proof that the party is not racist .However , when a Carson or Herman Cain comes along they only \" succeed \" when they parrot principles that keep members of their own race from succeeding .In short , if a black candidate in the Republican Party is stupid enough to say stuff that amounts to \" let the beatings on us continue \" then the party is happy to let them in .Still , it 's very discouraging to realize that the Republican Party is basically about maintaining white privilege at all costs .This is after all the party that succeeded in freeing the slaves .Republicans talk all about their party being for an opportunity society while giving those without opportunity fewer means to climb the ladder .In fact , they work actively to remove rungs from that ladder .They actively disenfranchise voters likely to vote for candidates they do n't like .Most red states wo n't extend the Medicaid franchise to the working poor ( which includes lots of whites ) .With Medicaid there is some semblance of a floor under their feet that might allow them to get to the next rung .They actively whip up the poorer white folk to work against their own interests .Kentucky governor - elect Matt Bevin won office principally from votes from poor white Kentuckians who are likely to have their new Medicaid benefits ( under a KyNect program umbrella ) removed .In any event Trump has moved from carnival barker to pied piper .If the Republican Party were a church , a great revival would be underway , the parishioners would be dancing in the pews and more than a few would be talking in tongues .Trump has effectively hypnotized his own party and has whipped them into a frenzy .He is counting on this of course , because enthusiastic voters vote disproportionately and he will need an overwhelming white vote and a lackluster Democratic vote to win the presidency .The nightmare for most of us is imagining how a President Trump would actually govern .One would hope he would quickly sober up , but there is little likelihood of that .This is because he shows no signs that he actually believes and respects the constitution and laws of the United States .Trump is an egomaniac .He believes himself not only gifted but also faultless .Of course he is the only person savvy enough to navigate us through these turbulent times , in spite of his many failed marriages and four bankruptcies .He has many of us hypnotized .Since civics is rarely taught anymore he has many of us believing that he could actually do things like building a wall along the Mexican border and making Mexico pay for it .The real danger is that he will do by fiat the stuff he says he will do , which will be against the law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.69423"}

John McCain led the charge , railing against his Democratic colleagues for moving to repeal the policy before the military completed a study of how this decision would affect troop morale and unit cohesion .He cited opposition from the chiefs of the four military branches , who want to wait until the review is completed before considering changing the policy .Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , however , has come out in favor of a repeal , as has Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff .While \" Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell \" was the center of attention , the authorization bill also included a slew of other measures that keep the military running on a day - to - day basis .If the Senate does not manage to pass the authorization bill this year , it will be the first time Congress has let it slide in 48 years .In this event , lawmakers would pass a continuing resolution that would fund the military on existing levels .Most likely , however , the Senate will take up the bill again after midterm elections .Majority Leader Harry Reid changed his vote to no at the last minute , once it was apparent that Democrats would not achieve cloture , in order to allow him to bring the bill up again later this session .Were the Senate to consider it during a lame - duck session , after midterm tensions have defused a bit , it 's possible some senators would be more open to compromise .Today 's vote was 56 - 43 for cloture , short of the 60 votes needed to advance to a final vote .In addition to Reid 's last - minute switch for procedural reasons , Democrats lost votes from Arkansas Sens . Blanche Lincoln and Mark Pryor .While Dems had entertained hopes of luring in Maine Republicans Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe , both senators objected to limitations on Republican amendments and voted against cloture .One Democratic amendment that sparked particular animosity among Republicans was the DREAM Act , an immigration measure that would provide a pathway to legal residency for the children of illegal immigrants .McCain slammed it for being non - germane -- though Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin , a Democrat , slammed McCain right back for amending his own non - germane measures , including campaign finance reform , to previous defense authorization bills .Senate Republicans saw Reid 's addition of the DREAM Act as a play for Hispanic votes in upcoming elections in Western and border states ( such as Nevada , Reid 's personal battleground ) .In a press conference this afternoon , Levin shot down suggestions that today 's vote doomed the DREAM amendment .It will remain on the table , he said , as he and his Democratic colleagues seek to get the authorization bill passed this year .About the Author .Most Popular .For decades the Man of Steel has failed to find his groove , thanks to a continual misunderstanding of his strengths .Superman should be invincible .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.80635"}

Cruz propose building a wall and tripling the amount of border patrol agents .He noted that once you 've secured the border , we could tackle our illegal immigration problem .On the wall Cruz added , \" I 've got someone in mind to build it , \" while looking at Trump .Rubio wants to expand the border patrol , have an entry / exit system to track the number of visa overstays , and have mandatory e - verify for businesses .Yet , the ghosts of the 2013 \" Gang of 8 \" bill reared its head , with Christie chiming in pushing the senator if he fought for his bill .Again , Christie noted that this is a difference between a governor and a legislator , touting his record in taking on the teachers unions - and winning the fight over tenure .The Democrats did n't shut down the government , and the tax increase was n't passed , because they knew , according to Christie , that he would fight for what he thinks is right for the state .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.37193"}

'More of those heavily edited videos the right is so fond of have mysteriously been released to fuel this latest round of outrage , showing that the organization donates fetal tissue from abortions - with the full consent of the woman - for research in diseases like Parkinson 's .This is completely legal .Yet Republicans in Congress and across the country are acting like some horrible crime has been unearthed , actually using words like \" felony . \"( Not even a minor misdemeanor was committed ) .It has long been the goal of Republicans to destroy Planned Parenthood , as part of its campaign to re - enslave women by taking away their control of their bodies and forcing them into childbearing against their will .There have been numerous attempts to take away funding , including in Ohio where such a measure was stuffed in secret into a previous budget bill .Such efforts are not popular because of the vast range of women who have accessed health care through PP over the years - some estimates have said as many as one in six .The organization provides contraception , family planning information , STD testing and treatment and cancer screenings .We 're getting bombarded with emails responding to Republican policies and statements in view of the impending first GOP presidential debate in Cleveland tonight .And most make good points : the GOP actions and policy statements of late have bee increasingly out of touch with the public and detrimental to its well - being .In the following statement from Toledo - through - Cleveland Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur , she makes some good points about the ways in which Republicans have made things more challenging for the Great Lakes region .She makes an especially good point in the second to last paragraph of her release , when she points out , \" Our state 's representation in Congress does n't reflect our population .Voters here split close to 50 - 50 between the major parties ; but 12 of 16 Congressional seats are held by R's-- a truly undemocratic gerrymandering achievement .Republicans have done the same thing in many other states .That 's not the path to free and fair elections .It 's why Congress is so out of kilter .That 's a fact .Our four Democratic congresspersons from Ohio are all go - getters , really fighting for their constituents .Half the GOP delegation , if not more , are little more than chairwarmers , voting in lockstep with the extremists that have taken over their part .Seriously , what have congressmen like Mike Turner , Bob Latta or Bill Johnson done for Ohio lately ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.83796"}

{"text": "Deodorants : Yes , they existed !There is an entire section containing 4 recipes for deodorising .Hess - Dragovich stated that idea that everyone smelled in the Middle Ages and Renaissance was a myth .She decided to replicate these deodorant recipes and try them on her friends .The solid deodorant was made with white lead but since lead is quite dangerous , she replaced it with Borax .Why did the Venetians use white lead ?They used it because it was anti - fungal and anti - bacterial .Borax does the same job but is much safer , and in keeping with using medieval ingredients .In the Middle Ages , Borax was scraped off the river beds in the Middle East .So how do you make medieval deodorant ?In one recipe , you mix camphor , rose water and Borax and dry it on a leaf .She also made Trotula deodorant recipe # 205 : wine , used with a towel boiled in berries .Did the recipes work ?The end result : She tried them on approximately 100 people and half of the recipes were as accurate as modern day drugstore deodorants !The favourites from her test group were from the Trotula and the white lead recipe .The ever popular , White Wine and Nutmeg deodorant was nicknamed \" Medieval Axe \" , and it apparently really worked !On May 28 , 1453 , the Byzantine emperor Constantine XI entered Hagia Sophia , \" the church of the divine wisdom , \" to pray .Constantinople was under siege , and the fate of the great basilica was unclear .The emperor prayed there before returning to the city walls , where he coordinated the defense effort against the army of Mehmed II , who would be christened conqueror by day 's end .As the two armies struggled to outmaneuver each other , those caught inside Hagia Sophia waited anxiously , fearful of what might happen if the capital of Greek Orthodoxy fell into Muslim hands .Emperor Justinian had commissioned the church in 532 A .D . ; planned by the mathematician Anthemius of Tralles and the physicist Isidore of Miletus , and built by more than ten thousand laborers , it was intended to symbolize the magnificence of Christianity and become the seat of the Orthodox patriarch .Twenty years after its completion , two major earthquakes shook Hagia Sophia and destroyed its eastern arch .After extensive renovation , it reopened in 562 A .D . to the delight of Justinian , who , three years before his death , saw his great church survive one of nature 's worst calamities .On May 29 , 1453 , Mehmed II and his army entered the city , immediately marching on Hagia Sophia .In their book Strolling Through Istanbul , John Freely and Hilary Sumner - Boyd describe how Mehmed \" dismounted at the door of the church and bent down to take a handful of earth , which he then sprinkled over his turban as an act of humility before God .In the five centuries following that symbolic act , the greatest religious building of the Ottoman Empire continued to shine - but this time , the glory belonged to Islam .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.4171"}
