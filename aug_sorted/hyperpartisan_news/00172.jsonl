{"text": "But that 's not what happened .In the wake of NAFTA , manufacturing jobs have evaporated , family farms have been decimated and income inequality has increased .Projections that this time around the TPP would generate increasing prosperity are met with a healthy dose of skepticism or outright disbelief .Another part of the story is the strong opposition across borders .An important element of the eventual defeat of the Free Trade Area of the Americas was the creation of the Hemispheric Social Alliance , allowing national and sectoral coalitions to coordinate analysis and actions across borders .Last week Mexican civil society groups convened organizations from the NAFTA countries plus Peru and Chile to reenergize that collaboration in the context of TPP and build an action plan moving forward .It was great to see allies from Mexico and Canada , especially the coalitions that began during the NAFTA debate .It was inspiring to meet leaders from vibrant coalitions in Chile and Peru , as well as people working on digital rights and other issues that are relatively new in the trade debate .The move represents a threat to both U.S. national sovereignty and national security , given the role of energy policy in protecting the homeland .The suit could also establish a precedent for challenging sovereign rights to address climate change through energy policy , not just in the U.S. , but in any country that is party to the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) .The standing of TransCanada to sue the American government is provided not in any formal U.S. legal judiciary setting , but through rules laid down in a trade regime , NAFTA .The terms of this agreement , and other similar trade agreements , are designed to protect the rights of foreign investors over the rights of the states in which they are investing .If successful , the suit will incur more losses to U.S. citizens than those associated with sovereign rights and national security .TransCanada is asking for $ 15 billion dollars in lost potential future profits .Furthermore , in an additional suit filed in Houston , Texas , TransCanada is seeking to limit the power of the President of the United States in setting U.S. energy policy by claiming that the Keystone decision was unconstitutional .The World Trade Organization 's 10th Ministerial Conference , held in Nairobi , Kenya from 15 - 18 December came right on the heels of the final outcome of the 21stConference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC ) .The contrasts were striking , and not just because of the shift from Europe to Africa , from northern winter to equatorial rains , and from environment to trade .There was also the level of interest : everyone who could not be in Paris was watching what went on there from afar , while few came to sit in the make - shift tents put up by the Kenyan Government as an NGO centre .The protest marches , organized by farmers ' organizations , gathered dozens of people rather than the several thousands who had come to WTO Ministerials past .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.29494"}
{"text": "Going along with the West would be a costly mistake for developing countries .They may well be facing a new era of low crop prices in which highly subsidised crop production in the US and other rich countries creates overproduction and dumping of cheap goods on global markets .If ever there were a need for new agricultural trade rules , now would be the time .COOL informs consumers where animals were born , raised and slaughtered before turning into meat .The meat industry has spent millions of dollars lobbying legislators trying to repeal COOL since it was first enacted in 2002 .The World Trade Organization ( WTO ) turned 20 this year - it is young in the world of multilateral agencies ( by way of comparison , the UN turned 70 ) but it is no longer new .There is now a sizeable group of people working on trade who do not remember a time before the WTO .It has become the default trade institution - the organization everyone thinks of when they think about global trade .Yet the young organization , birthed with such hyperbole , has lost its way .It is spurned by many of those who initially worked so hard to bring it into being , including the U.S. government , which seems to have lost interest in the organization .The hopes and the fears expressed at the WTO 's inception were premised on what looked like real power in the multilateral system , including a dispute settlement system that can enforce penalties on governments that break the rules .On the eve of the WTO 's tenth Ministerial Conference , to be held in Nairobi December 15 - 18 , the conviction that the WTO would be an effective new design for multilateral governance looks misplaced .The WTO has not negotiated a single tariff reduction in its 20 years of existence .The members adopted a negotiating agenda in Doha in December 2001 and have failed to bring it to conclusion .A vocal number of WTO members from among the richest countries , led by the United States , have openly declared that the Doha Agenda should no longer be even mentioned once Nairobi is done .So much of trade policy involves searching through legal texts and leaked documents for clues about what 's coming next .Careful examination of the recently released text for the Trans Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) is already revealing new risks for our food system .Those findings also tell us what to watch out for in the other big pending trade deal - the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) with the European Union .Unlike earlier trade agreements focused primarily on reducing tariffs to open up markets , these agreements are likely to include extensive provisions intended to reduce or eliminate state and federal regulations viewed as \" trade irritants .\" The focus on state and local rules and programs is one of the \" innovations \" in recent trade deals .First , the good news .Sort of .Farm to School programs funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) that provide bidding preferences for healthy , locally grown foods have been kept out of federal procurement commitments in TPP .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.97148"}
