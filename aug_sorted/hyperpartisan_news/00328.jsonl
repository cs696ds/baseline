Joe level understanding of international relations offered up by the Tea Party GOP base .In all , Obama has a record to defend .Romney , has no record ( save for gaffes abroad)--this can be spun as a plus for there is no track record to evaluate him against .But , Obama can hammer him on his lack of experience .As I said earlier , the third debate is about style and posturing over substance .The issues are too complicated for the average voter to fully comprehend .Regardless of what occurs , my prediction is that the pundits will call this third fight a draw .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.8625"}

Tim Scott , the first African American to be elected to Congress in South Carolina since the late 19th Century , appears to be the frontrunner .Other candidates include South Carolina 's former first lady , Jenny Sanford , widely admired for her stoicism in the face of the mortifyingly public philandering of Mark Sanford , the state 's former governor and now , her former husband .Scott , seen at right , is a Tea Party favorite with a past as a successful businessman , and those two aspects of his career are also the most represented among his top campaign donors .His biggest all - time donor : The political action committee of the fiscally conservative Club for Growth , which has given him more than double as much as any other entity .The group raised $ 65,550 for him for his 2010 race , when he was first elected to Congress , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .That year , he beat former Sen. Strom Thurmond 's son in the GOP primary .Scott 's appointment would be history - making and a sweet bit of irony given South Carolina 's long representation by Thurmond , a Democrat turned Republican who once ran for president as head of the segregationist Dixiecrat Party .The Club for Growth has given him a very favorable 92 percent rating on his House voting record .The group also paid for his flight and lodging to participate in a congressional panel on conservative policies at the group 's annual winter conference on March 8 and 9 earlier this year , according to his spokesman Sean Smith .The trip was listed on his 2011 House personal financial disclosure form .Scott owned an AllState insurance branch before being elected to Congress , which he sold for between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million in April 2011 , his personal disclosure form shows .Despite exiting the insurance business , the business keeps being good to him -- the industry is his second biggest donor behind real estate , according to CRP .Health professionals are third on the list .In April 2011 Scott sold the insurance branch -- Tim Scott & Associates , LLC -- according to his personal financial disclosure .He earned a $ 5,500 salary from the company and between $ 5,001 and $ 15,000 in dividends during the time before the sale , according to Smith .According to House rules , members of Congress can still earn a salary from outside employment as long as it does not exceed $ 26,955 in 2012 .The website of Tim Scott & Associates says that the company 's services are coaching , consulting and speaking .It glowingly sells Scott 's abilities , calling him a \" bred \" leader who has been guided by God .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.337395"}

{"text": "Sometimes it was a commentary on what was good and bad in the Black freedom movement .There is the occasional talk of opposing colonialism .But overall , it was not an overwhelming response .The relatively weak answer to Black oppression is puzzling .Opposing Jim Crow was a no brainer from the libertarian point of view .Blacks had been slaves , which is the antithesis of personal freedom .Then , after Reconstruction , they had been subjected to humiliating and painful legal regulations in addition to extensive personal violence .While libertarians may disagree with liberals about the remedy for state violence and segregation , you would think that they would have been marching arm and arm with liberals in the 1960s .But that did n't happen .Black repression takes a back burner on the libertarian shopping list .But why ?I think it has to do with the sociology of elite libertarians .My views on libertarian political thought are pretty straight forward .Like many schools of political thought including Liberalism , Communitarianism , Socialism , etc . the abstract concepts can not be separated from the social moment which birthed them , or the realities of the society in which they will be applied .Here , I proceed from a number of inter - related premises .Roughly speaking , the people who defined the libertarian agenda in the mid to late 20th century were defined by two social processes .First , nearly all of the major libertarian intellectuals belonged to the Jewish diaspora in America .Some were refugees from East European communism , like Ayn Rand .The Austrian school of economics was lead by central European Jews like Mises and the second generation was led by New Yorker Murray Rothbard .Second generation Jews were also very prominent , like Milton Friedman and Robert Nozick , whose father , according to wiki , was from a Russian shtetl .While these writers did occasionally address Black issues , American civil rights probably did not loom in their minds as much fascism and socialism in Europe .Second , many , if not most , of the leading libertarian intellectuals were strongly rooted in American and Western European academia ... .Now , it did n't have to be that way .Imagine if some group of Black intellectuals had set out to systematically develop an anti - statist political philosophy , much as Third World intellectuals developed indigenous versions of Marxism , like liberation theology .For example , what if DuBois had an evil twin brother who looked at the post - Reconstruction South and developed a theory of the state as an illegitimate racial coalition ?Or , imagine , if some people in the Harlem Renaissance had taken a sort of proto - Tyler Cowen position about how capitalism allows black cultural forms to flourish ?I have always appreciate the appeal of libertarianism in the abstract for those of us who suffered under Jim and Jane Crow , chattel slavery , the lynching tree , and ( now ) colorblind racism .The state failed us .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.329346"}

Q. Last April you were ranked north of 200 , and now you 're almost in the top 20 .What do you attribute this incredible jump to ?JAMES BLAKE :Well , unfortunately I 'll attribute the drop first , which was due to injury and illness .It was n't just that I was n't playing well , it was more that I was hurt and was n't able to play .Once I did get back , I felt I put in a lot of hard work .Even when I was sick , there were times when I could n't sit around the house , I had to get out , and I was working on a few things .Then even when I was 200 in the world , I started telling a few people that I felt confident and my game was there and I felt fine , it was just a matter of getting a few matches and winning .Unfortunately nobody believed me when I was 200 in the world , and they started believing me a little bit more after New Haven and the U.S. Open .Q. I 'm sure there was a better showing there in Australia .Can you describe what your state of mind is coming out of there ?JAMES BLAKE : I definitely would have liked to have done better in the Australian Open , but it was great to play as well as I did in Sydney .Adelaide was my first round outdoors , I had been practicing indoors , so I did n't have high expectations going in there .Going into Sydney , my second outdoor tournament of the year , playing as well as I did was great .I beat Andre Agassi in the finals , and there was another really close match where I came out on top , which is always exciting no matter what you 're playing .Once again , when there 's a tie - breaker , it does n't matter who you are ; anyone can win .It 's either one or two points , and it 's great to have the confidence to feel like you can win .Going into the Australian , I felt like I was playing great going into Sydney , and I lost to a guy that was playing great tennis that day .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.590096"}

I guess going off of that , now you come to San Jose , and I 'm thinking about some of the top players that are going to be there and how they like to finish points .Andy looks to crack big serves and then get a sitter or maybe hit some big forehands .If your game goes well , where do you want most of your points to end ?Where are you at on the court and what are you doing to finish off a point ?JAMES BLAKE : Amazing what I 'm doing .I 'm looking to push the other person back .And when I do that , amazingly , when I 'm not trying to hit winners , I hit winners a lot more than if I 'm trying to hit a cold winner from the baseline .That 's generally not going to be effective because the setup is longer and people have that extra split second of seeing where you 're going to go and you end up missing more .My goal generally is to be moving forward and a decent amount of points -- I think mine is more of a balance .I 'll end some of them while I have gotten to the net , and some of them will just end without me even getting to the net even though I was trying to get there .Q. I wanted to ask you a two - part question .First , what 's your status for Davis Cup ?I know he 's supposed to select a team next week .And secondly , seeing Baghdatis and how the crowd really supports him and responded to him , he reminds me of you with the crowd in New Haven and at the Open .What kind of effect can a crowd have on you , and are you surprised by what Baghdatis has done ?JAMES BLAKE : First of all , I always go for the Davis Cup , and I do n't know if he has made a decision , but I think he 's going to announce it very soon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.65532"}

Cohen .Cohen 's main opponent in the August 5 Democratic primary in his predominantly African - American district is Nikki Tinker , who is black .The Commercial Appeal wrote an editorial in Wednesday 's paper condemning Tinker for not speaking out against the anti - Semitic literature .\" What does Nikki Tinker think about anti - Semitic literature being circulated that might help her unseat 9th District Congressman Steve Cohen in the Democratic primary next August ? \" the editorial asked . \" The question goes to the character of the woman who wants to represent the 9th District , and 9th District voters deserve an answer .But Tinker declined to return a phone call about the flier .\"The editorial also noted that last summer Cohen came under attack from black ministers who challenged the congressman 's support for federal hate crimes legislation to protect gay rights .Cohen tells the Sleuth it was \" shocking \" to receive the flier , \" particularly coming from an African - American the week after Dr. King 's birthday .This was just such an ignorant and racist and prejudiced type of flier -- it 's hard to fathom we 're in the 21st century , \" Cohen says .The first - term congressman hopes Barack Obama 's success will trickle down .\" Obama is showing us that Americans have gotten beyond race .He 's gotten a good number of Caucasian votes , so I think we 're making advances , \" says Cohen , who endorsed Obama .While he says he has plenty of support from the \" old guard \" African - American leaders in his district , Cohen is having difficultly wooing influential black colleagues from Congress to campaign on his behalf .He 'll surely be looking for support from Rep. John Lewis ( D - Ga . ) , who is scheduled to be honored as this year 's April 4th Foundation awards banquet in Memphis along with actor / singer Harry Belafonte - whose sister , Shirley Cooks , coincidentally , serves as Cohen 's chief of staff .Cohen battled racial and religious innuendo in his 2006 campaign for Congress , but not anything as blunt as the flier he received last week .After winning , he tried unsuccessfully to become the first white member of the Congressional Black Caucus , leaving him decidedly white .\" It 's a chink in my armor , \" Cohen says .\" I 'm always going to be white .I do n't have to always be Jewish -- but I am , and will be .\" Perhaps Obama and most of the voters have gotten beyond race , but clearly Rev. Robert Poindexter and his ilk have not .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.99269"}

Packer , entitled Follow The Rule .This talk was given at BYU , in Provo , Utah on January 14th 1977 .It was strictly forbidden by God .The \" Blacks get the Priesthood \" revelation , did n't happen until 1978 and only after the Church realized that they were about to face a major PR disaster in Brazil .Fist of all , most of the people in Brazil were either black or had a black heritage , which terrified the Mormon Hierarchy .Can you imagine if a person with even one drop of black blood entered God 's house ?Oh , the terror ! !Unbelievable ! !Racists ! !Black people were also the major contributors , that were donating to help build the temple , but then would n't be able to enter it .I 'll be doing another post on this one .Boyd K. Packer , still believed at this time , in 1977 , that blacks would never have the Priesthood , nor be allowed to enter or marry in the temple .Of course , he was n't just racist against blacks , for good measure , he threw in several other races .I always knew that we were advised in the Church to marry within our own race but I never knew where it came from .Now I know and it 's a real mind blower .I should n't be surprised that it was Boyd K. Packer behind that idea .Again , I 've never seen this anywhere else .If you do a search on MSN , for the phrase , \" Marry Into Your Own Race \" , only 1 result comes up .If you do that same search on Google , only 7 items come up , including the reference to the BYU speech site , which I link you to below .The other links make no reference to Mormonism or Boyd K.
