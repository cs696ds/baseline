Reagan 's press secretary , Jim Brady , was shot in the head .The Brady Handgun Violence Act of 1993 , signed into law by President Bill Clinton , mandated that federally licensed dealers complete comprehensive background checks on individuals before selling them a gun .The legislation was named for James Brady , who was shot during an attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981 .The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act , signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994 , instituted a ban on 19 kinds of assault weapons , including Uzis and AK-47s .The crime bill also banned the possession of magazines holding more than ten rounds of ammunition .( An exemption was made for weapons and magazines manufactured prior to the ban . )In 2004 , ten years after it first became law , Congress allowed a provision banning possession of magazines holding more than ten rounds of ammunition to expire through a sunset provision .Brady Campaign President Paul Helmke told HuffPost that the expiration of this provision meant that Rep. Gabby Giffords 's alleged shooter was able to fire off 20-plus shots without reloading ( under the former law he would have had only ten ) .Following the deadly shooting at Virginia Tech University , Congress passed legislation to require states provide data on mentally unsound individuals to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System , with the aim of halting gun purchases by the mentally ill , and others prohibited from possessing firearms .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.981026"}

{"text": "If you , like thousands of other Americans , have Googled to find out why we are in the middle of a nationwide ammunition shortage , you would have stumbled across this 2007 blog entry .In it , I corrected a poorly researched Associated Press story by Estes Thompson that claimed the military 's consumption of ammunition was responsible for police ammunition shortages here in the United States .The real fact of the matter is that the military got the bulk of its small arms ( pistol , rifle , machine gun ) ammunition from one contracted ammunition plant , and that plant was n't even running near capacity .The military 's consumption clearly was n't to blame , and anecdotal evidence and statements from ammunition manufacturers strongly suggested that police departments themselves caused the 2007 ammunition shortage by purchasing far more ammunition than they had in the past .But what is causing our current ammunition shortages here in 2009 ?Much of the demand comes from continued high law enforcement demand , the same demand that led to shortages two years ago .Police agencies around the nation have become more militarized in recent years and two trends within this militarization have led to greater police ammunition demand .An increase in the size and number of paramilitary police units .Once upon a time , highly trained , heavily armed police units with alphabet - soup acronyms such as SWAT , SRT , SRU , or ERT were generally found as part of large , metropolitan police departments .Today , law enforcement agencies of every size - including some university police forces - have SWAT - type units armed with some combination of submachine guns , assault rifles , and sniper rifles to add to the traditional compliment of pistols and shotguns .To become proficient to the level expected of these units , each officer must fire thousands of rounds in training every year .An increase in the use of \" patrol carbines \" in law enforcement .Some agencies prefer to call them \" patrol carbines \" ; others refer to them as \" tactical rifles .\" But whatever you call them , rifles based upon the AR-15 are becoming increasingly common as a weapon deployed to police officers outside of SWAT units , for some very logical reasons .AR - type rifles extend the range at which patrol officers can engage armed criminals , and because rifles have more practical accuracy than pistols , they can potentially reduce the number of shots fired to neutralize a suspect .Paired with the right kind of ammunition , the .223 Remington/5.56 mm caliber rifle also has surprisingly less over - penetration , theoretically reducing threats to civilians who might be downrange .Each of these weapons will also require officers carrying them to fire hundreds of rounds in training each year , and in a city that rotates rifles from one shift to another among their patrol units , this can necessitate tens of thousands of rounds of training ammunition .Fears of draconian gun and ammunition restrictions .The 2008 elections that saw the Democratic Party extend their power in both houses of Congress and saw Barack Obama elected president made gun owners very nervous , and with good reason .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.074646"}
