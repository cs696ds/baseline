Yanukovych , from power .( See Moon of Alabama post from February 23 for b 's discussion of why Yanukovych 's removal is not legal . )This slender paragraph in the \" paper of record \" ( a paper synonymous with the U.S. State Department ) bodes ill for the putschists .The Russians have asserted the facts on the ground in the Crimea and those facts are spreading to the east .The putsch government can not project power ; they rely on the U.S. for that .Will Obama threaten further escalation ?After seeing his brief statement yesterday , I think not .We might see some terror bombings , but anymore tough talk from Kerry and Obama will just be an embarrassment .Maybe the U.S. , we can hope , will begin now to walk back off the ledge .I also wonder when and how the actual Ukrainian security forces will react .They ca n't just keep hiding ( there seem to have been quite a number of resignations and dismissals ) for ever and pretend that they are ' neutral ' and have no play in this game .Otherwise they will be irrelevant and eventually completely replaced ( say goodbye to your state paid pension ! ) by one or the other side .The Syria scenario simply will not work in Eastern Ukraine .In Syria , the NATO strategy relies on Turkey and Jordan permitting terrorists to hide , resupply and base in their countries , knowing that Syria is constrained from striking at them .There is no neighboring country dumb enough to do that for the usurper government western Ukraine .Poland , Romania , Moldova , etc . are not stupid enough to think that Russia will be as constrained as Syria .And I doubt they can be coerced into it by the US / NATO high commands , as they will certainly fear Russia much more than their own masters .I suspect that Mike Maloney in 12 has correctly identified the beginnings of a gradual climb down .The take home lessons from this , if Georgia 2008 was not enough , is that puppets are easily expendable .Future puppets encouraged to do something really stupid should keep this in mind .Coming after the heals the Syria debacle , the \" new world order \" is indeed coming into view .As it becomes more clear that there is more than one real power in the world , many countries that were coerced into the western alliance will begin to see alignment with Russia and China as a serious option .This is not a one day process , but over the next 20 years , the international scene will have a very different appearance .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.832314"}

{"text": "In James Madison : A Life Reconsidered , Cheney repeats the standard view consistently .Madison 's contemporaries considered Benjamin Franklin their country 's great intellectual ornament .Cheney judges Madison greater , but she does not stop there : although a good case can be made that Sir Isaac Newton was history 's greatest scientist , Cheney says that Madison was more brilliant than he .( Thomas Jefferson would have been shocked to find himself ranked above Newton as well . )She reports Madison 's 1818 address to the Albemarle Agricultural Society without even hinting that it was long an object of derision .Although a slaveholder , and a substantial one , to the end of his days , Madison in Cheney 's account was unhappily so .One has not the slightest hint here that contrary to the practice in the preceding Jefferson administration , Dolley Madison stationed a slave at the elbow of every table guest at White House dinners .My point is not that this is surprising : in fact , Madison does seem to have held more liberal racial views than Jefferson .Still , he was an extremely wealthy politician whose power was built on slavery , and he did essentially nothing to change that .Further , he raised no objection when slaves were excluded from the Virginia Declaration of Rights ' statement that all men were born free and equal .Here we may pause to recollect that Lynne Cheney first came to public attention in an imbroglio 20 years ago over proposed national history standards .She was perhaps the only person in the know who was surprised that a process headed up by UCLA social historian Gary Nash had produced a proposal stressing academia 's holy trinity of race , class , and gender .( Nash was right to wonder what else she expected when she , as chair of the National Endowment for the Humanities , funded the project . )In response , Cheney advocated a polar - opposite fixation on Great Men and their Great Deeds .The breathless , one might almost say schoolboy attitude underlying Cheney 's criticism of the proposed standards is in evidence in James Madison : A Life Reconsidered at various junctures .For example , she opines that \" The homes of the early presidents are sources of enlightenment and inspiration for anyone working in the founding period . \"Her time at Madison 's Montpelier , she says , helped her \" to better understand the greatness of Madison 's accomplishments .\" A visit to the National Archives provided an opportunity to \" marvel \" over the Constitution .Not only is the Constitution marvelous , but so apparently is each Madison datum she has collected .Cheney seems to have determined not to allow a single notecard to go to waste .Over and over , she tells what color and style Dolley was wearing , what type of flower or tree was in bloom , what kind of precipitation occurred , which obscure relative accompanied the Madisons from Washington to Montpelier or from Montpelier to Washington , etc .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.43361"}
{"text": "In part , this entails acknowledging and controlling the effects of factional competition between different minority groups in light of the continued cultural and economic dominance of the white majority , precisely because factional competition among minority groups strengthens the power of the majority .9 The task demands not only a recognition of the role played by race in interest group politics 10 but heightened sensitivity to racial differences beyond black and white .Last Term , however , the Supreme Court ignored Madison 's warning about the inevitability of faction and took aim at race itself as if to eliminate one of the great causes of faction in American history .In three major decisions , on voting rights , 12 affirmative action , 13 and school desegregation , 14 the Court reiterated its color - blind jurisprudential stance and its hostility to the ways in which legislation and public policy speak overtly to racial inequality .The Court implied , for example , that alleviating racial inequality is an illegitimate basis for public collective action through legislation where such legislation reflects the majority 's impulse to remedy past discrimination or where it embodies a disfavored minority 's struggle for economic or political inclusion .15 The Court also reasserted its longstanding position that the equal protection mandate does not authorize the redistribution of economic and other social goods on the basis of race , even where such redistribution directly eases racial inequality .These decisions reflect a common theme of hostility toward the official recognition of race , racial difference , racial discrimination , or racial inequality .The Court has reasoned that race consciousness causes racial factionalism , and in particular , that racially sensitive legislation such as the Voting Rights Act 17 and small business set - asides exacerbate and even create rather than alleviate racial divisiveness .18 Perhaps Justice Scalia best articulated the Court 's desire to eliminate race consciousness when he denied racial difference altogether .\" In the eyes of government , \" he wrote , \" we are just one race here .It is American . \"19 More fundamentally , the Court 's assertions taken together imply that racial factionalism itself is the evil at which the Equal Protection Clause is aimed , and not historic discrimination , exclusion , or inequality .Madison 's theory that factional differences are not only inevitable but that their interplay actually produces a vibrant body politic 21 strongly undermines the Supreme Court 's reasoning .In Madisonian terms , the Court can no more eliminate race - based political interests than it can \" giv[e ] to every citizen the same opinions , the same passions , and the same interests . \"22 Instead , the task of the Court and legislators alike should be to ameliorate the effect of racial faction , which would mean restraining the ability of one faction to exclude and discriminate against another in ways that create structural inequality .In an era where \" playing the race card \" has become a political term of art , Madison 's prescriptions should be understood to apply to white racism as to other forms of pluralistic majoritarian tyranny .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.721054"}

{"text": "James Madison 's insight was that the main reason democracies , from Athens to city - state republics , did n't survive ( and until the American Republican they mostly did n't ) was a problem of majoritarianism .Put simply , any time there 's a clear majority and a clear minority in a democracy , the minority will find its lot so helpless that it will prefer nondemocratic solutions .Madison 's brilliant remedy is twofold : a very large republic , so that no natural majorities will occur , and a set of institutions ( checks and balances , federalism , separated institutions sharing powers ) that discourage the creation of majorities .What these solutions depend on is that even on those issues where pollsters can find \" majorities , \" the more important truth is that most people do n't care very much about most issues .So those public - opinion \" majorities \" do n't really exist .Instead , only minorities are for and against most policy areas .The result , in Robert Dahl 's phrase , is \" minorities rule , \" rather than any single majority winning .That 's important , because people in any temporarily losing minority will still believe they have a chance to win in the future .It turns out there are three ways that Madison 's solution to long - term democratic stability can be threatened and real majorities can be created anyway .One is if the nation winds up divided around a single policy issue .In that case , the majority will outvote the minority , which will have no other recourse within normal democratic politics .That , oversimplifying , is probably the story of the Civil War .The second is intense partisanship , in which everyone is convinced that all that matters is if their party wins .The third is intense ideology , when all that matters is if a particular ideology wins .The problem is clear : combine strong partisanship with intensely ideological parties , and the losing side does n't just believe it has lost an election , it feels it has lost the nation .There 's no real danger of this happening now .Even in our era of strong partisan voting , relatively few of us really believe our political aspirations are permanently crushed if our side loses the next election .But for those who do feel that way , it 's extremely difficult to retain support for democracy when it only promises defeat .For now , I 'll just say that it 's hard to treat the one - party , restricted - citizenship South through the early 1960s as any kind of democracy in the first place .But just as it would be a mistake to reject federalism because it was tainted by \" state 's rights \" racists , it would be a mistake to reject traditional U.S. parties because of the mistakes of the New Deal Democrats in the 1930s , 1940s and 1950s .And the idea of democracy dedicated to organizing the polity around fundamental choices of any kind is a bad idea .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.494934"}
{"text": "The point is that the West , from the origins of the idea , has always been in the process of becoming ; it is never fully in a state of being .It is real , but it has been fluid and evolving .Geographically , the West now refers to Europe , including Russia and Turkey , and the significant European settler colonies in Asia , Africa , the Americas , and Oceania .It was Arnold Toynbee , among others , who argued that civilizations are internally coherent and self - enclosed entities .Samuel Huntington 's Clash of Civilizations is only the latest version of this misconceived view .This approach , taken up in the curriculum today for many courses on modern Europe and/or the West , ignores the fundamental fact that civilizations have always communicated and interacted , not just in warfare , and that these encounters have had a significant influence on their histories .Europe itself was hardly the wealthiest or most powerful area of the world in the Renaissance .Certainly , China and India had more sophisticated civilizations and more wealth .Even in the Americas , the city of Tenochtitlan was larger and more populated than was any European city in 1520 , with a large trading culture that reached into distant parts of the continent .That Spain destroyed it does not argue for European superiority .That the New World influenced Spain and Europe 's culture is clear , even in the horrors of the acceptance of slavery .Thus , to take the teleological view that Europe in the Renaissance was destined to become the most wealthy and powerful area of the world is to teach bad history .Few in 1500 , if any , thought it possible that what Marshall Hodgson described as an \" insignificant outlier of mainland Asia \" would rule most of the earth in the 19th century .And despite the achievements of the European Union , its place in the 21st century is far from certain .The historical notion that modern Europe developed without great influence from other cultures is also an error .The outcome was far from certain even into the 17th century , when Europe was still on the defensive against the expansive power of the Ottoman Empire .And , of course , Europe in the 21st century is hardly at the center of the world , either in terms of political power or economic development .Europe dominated the globe for more than two centuries , but its time at the center of the planetary stage is ending .We are suggesting that the new task , therefore , is to change how we teach the West .First , we must acknowledge that the West and/or Europe is more than Britain , France , the Germanies , and a few others at certain times .Second , the West must be taught as a civilization in process , not one with a set of core values expanding to other areas .When one moves beyond the realm of \" great books , \" the concept of core values itself looks very flimsy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.63494"}

{"text": "\" Such expressions seem to me entirely anachronistic because no one in those hierarchical empires was \" a citizen , \" and the mass of Muslim subjects can not in any meaningful sense be regarded as part of \" the ruling class . \" Besides , Muslim rulers often employed Christians , Jews , and Hindus in positions of power and trust - who therefore had authority over Muslims .In saying this I do not intend to imply that Muslim rulers and populations were never bigoted and never persecuted non - Muslims .The social and moral assumptions around which such empires and kingdoms were constructed are , of course , no longer viable , but they did embody certain principles of toleration that were absent not only in Latin Christendom , but in post - Enlightenment European states too .They did not require everyone ( whether Muslim or not ) to live according to a single set of \" self - evident truths .\" What I wish to emphasize here is that the zealotry so characteristic of many Islamic political movements in recent times is a product not of the mainstream historical tradition of Islam .It is the product of modern politics and the modern state .Many academic commentators have pointed to the modern ideologies and organizations characteristic of contemporary Islamicists .Such analyses are nearly always conducted to demonstrate the speciousness of the claim to authenticity made by these movements .By asserting that there is a sharp split between \" traditional Islam \" and \" modern developments \" these analysts imply that authentic ( \" traditional \" )Islamic tradition can not become genuinely modern .I believe that these commentators are mistaken in making this sharp opposition .But more important , they rarely go on to ask themselves what their conclusion indicates about modern historiography and the modernizing state .They fail to note that it is the unprecedented ambition of the latter , its project of transforming the totality of society and subjectivity in the direction of continuous productive progress , that creates a space for a correspondingly ambitious Islamicist politics .Islamic history had no such space .That space , with its totalitarian potentialities , belongs entirely to Western modernity .Indeed , there was no such thing as a state in the modern sense in Islamic history - or , for that matter in pre - modern European history .There were princes , of course , and dynasties ( the modern Arabic word for \" state , \" dawlah , is an extension of the classical Arabic word for \" dynasty \" ) , who headed centralized institutions for securing law and order , extracting tax , etc .But there was no state in the modern sense of a sovereign structure that stands apart from both governors and governed , which it is the government 's duty to maintain , and which articulates , through the territory it controls , the entirety of society .For Islamicists and orientalists later Muslim history is seen as a falling away from that model , a process in which a separation occurred between religious and political institutions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.72861"}
{"text": "Some of these politicians , citizens , and analysts were dissenters ; they did not believe in a Soviet threat , and some thought the United States a greater danger to peace than the communists .When the Soviet Union ended in 1991 , the logic of this structure of institutions and events also ended .Two new , or hitherto overshadowed , factors brought long - term history , including the history of Western institutions , ideas , and realities , back to the agenda .The first was the new landscape of world politics , no longer dominated by a single major conflict , but by a variety of relationships and dynamics , some tense , others loose .The second was the self - doubt within the West and in particular within the United States .Unfortunately , many people in the 1990s continued to discuss both world politics and domestic American problems with little or no reference to any history going back more than a few years .Indeed , at times it seemed that the close time horizon of Cold War debate had been replaced by an even closer horizon .At least , during the Cold War , those who discussed politics , survival , and the future agreed to look back to the 1940s .After the Cold War , many people seemed to think that the world began anew in 1989 - 91 and that no earlier history , even that of the Cold War , was relevant to understanding the present or predicting the future .This was the opposite of the truth .No discussion of the West , whether in an optimistic , a pessimistic , or a radically hostile vein , could properly take place after 1991 without a longterm perspective .Thus , one of the sources of confusion in the discussions of the West after 1991 was that many people continued to talk as though the historical perspective was unnecessary .The optimists looked forward to democracy and capitalism spreading worldwide without much thought about how these two principles related to the history of Western civilization and how this complex relationship might fare in the post - Soviet world .The various pessimists and enemies of the West continued , often , to talk as though the West was adequately defined as a political system consisting of the United States , NATO , and very little else .It is to combat this chronological myopia that I offer these reflections .Although this book does not defend optimists , pessimists , realists , or anti - Westerners , its author does have an opinion about the prospects of the West .Democracy and capitalism were indeed in harmony with human nature , as late - twentieth - century evolutionary psychology and sociology were describing it .But that did not mean either that they would easily spread across the world , or that their spread meant universal Westernization .Three points will illustrate these uncertainties .The first is that human nature is flawed .Just because the natural and social sciences of the late twentieth century gradually gave us a better fix on what arrangements were good for people , what made them flourish , this did not mean that people or institutions would quickly , or ever , conform to this knowledge .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.74316"}

{"text": "The attacks on the Western canon , the fight over relativism , and the opposed diagnoses of decline or triumph indicated that something was at stake below the surface of debate on short - term policies in education , international affairs , or race relations .Clearly there was a battle over the West and its identity .The attacks also demonstrated , however , that nothing had been put in its place .By the 1980s , academics and politicians had largely dismissed its canon of great books and ideas as apologies for privilege and assimilationism .In response to Bernal , Sale , and the other radicals , the liberals did not look to Bloom for moral rearmament and for renewed faith in their idea of the West .Rather , they vilified Bloom as an elitist enemy of justice and of the essential new pedagogy of diversity .In short , they became more liberal , assuring their critics that they , too , deplored the sins of the West .Proponents of this revised , superficially optimistic version combined a revised liberalism with a Fukuyama - like belief in its universalist virtues , but without Fukuyama 's robust and unapologetic faith that liberal democracy was deservedly superior .The result was an idea of the West from which all the incorrect , hard edges -- of science , meritocracy , sexism , and racism -- had been filed away .The result was a West fit for the new universalism , a West without the West , as it were .This book argues that the chanting students , the Bernals , and the Sales were right to attack the liberal idea of the West , but for the wrong reasons .The Grand Narrative 's idea of the West fell to history because it forgot history .It was , as the critics maintained , inadequate , but not because it was exclusive , chauvinistic , or politically incorrect .It was inadequate because it defined the West as modernity and its core , liberty , as an abstract principle derived from the Greeks and transported , outside time , to its modern resurrection in the Enlightenment and in twentieth - century liberal American democracy .These interactions did not take place in the elevated atmosphere of great books and great ideas .They were full of destructive as well as creative passion and , often , of cruelty .The marriage of Germanic and Christian ideas of liberty with the Roman idea of imperial order yielded democracy and capitalism , but they also yielded holy wars , black slavery in the New World , religious inquisitions , and economic exploitation .By presenting the West as a moral enterprise , the Grand Narrative made itself fatally vulnerable to moralist assault .This is not to say that the critics will welcome an idea of the West that roots its manifestations -- emphatically including democracy and capitalism -- in what I call the Old West or the medieval synthesis , the blend of Christianity with Germanic and classical culture .Returning the New West to its historic identity is to defy both the multiculturalists and the centrist liberals in their 1990s incarnation as global universalists .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.69795"}

{"text": "So far from validating and protecting the social order , the Western hero is heroic because he challenges order .The individual can be right , and the whole rest of the world can be wrong : this idea is the essence of the West and distinguishes it from all other cultures .All of these are rooted in the Western orientation towards the truth .For most of their history , white cultures have been highly authoritarian ; however , there was always greater room in the West for criticism of authority than in non - Western cultures .Even during the most dogmatic period in our history , the Middle Ages , whites were relatively free to express their own versions of the truth , even if they tended to undermine authority .In part , this freedom was a result of another Western tradition : the separation of church and state .The substantially autonomous church had great freedom to criticize the temporal authorities .And criticize them the clerics did .In the fifth century , St. Augustine declared that there was no difference in essence between a king and a robber : .What are kingdoms but great robberies ?For what are robberies themselves , but little kingdoms ? ...Indeed , it was the apt and true reply which was given to Alexander the Great by a pirate who had been seized .Not only did the church criticize the state , but it permitted internal self - critique .Deutsch gives the example of Peter Abelard and other scholastic philosophers , who , in the 13th century , demonstrated that the opinions of the church fathers frequently contradicted each other .By undermining authority , these thinkers won limited freedom to argue for their own views .In subsequent centuries , whites gained greater and greater freedom to challenge authority .As Deutsch says : . [The ] successors [ of Abelard ] went further .They attacked authority directly , and eventually demanded reforms in the church itself .William of Ockham , John Wyclif , Martin Luther , John Calvin all used critical thought to make a free way for their beliefs .Attacking existing authority , they then most often proclaimed their own and insisted others conform to it .But these new authorities were then in turn attacked by new thinkers who came after them , preserving some elements but radically changing others , in a succession that is still continuing .Such a continuous and robust tradition of critical thought has never existed outside of the West .Try criticizing Islam in Saudi Arabia and Iran , or communism in China and see what happens to you .Japan is more receptive to critical thought , but even there , if you start a lively discussion , you may well get pounded down .The second major intellectual trait of the West , natural science , is the quintessential expression of our orientation towards the truth .Indeed , the term \" science \" means a method for establishing the truth .The basic rule of science is that only hypotheses that survive empirical testing count as true .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.768555"}

{"text": "The method adopted is to move through the stages of Western evolution , as conventionally defined , from Greece to the twentieth century , taking the Grand Narrative as the starting point and showing its shortcomings .By contrasting this catalog of opinions with the actual cultural characteristics of the regions of the West at various times , we obtain what I take to be a fuller and more accurate delineation of Western identity .What also emerges , I hope , is an account of the central belief system of the New West , democratic liberalism , which refutes its three weaknesses : the illusion of newness , economism , and its ambivalence about whether liberty is absence of coercion or empowerment .These three weaknesses appear the moment that liberalism is defined as a purely secular and individualistic doctrine .Does the West , appropriately redefined , have a future ?And if it does , what sort of future ?One of the most significant political and philosophical distinctions at the end of the twentieth century was between those who thought such questions silly and those who took them seriously .Those who thought it silly to doubt the future of the West were the optimists , the new universalists .According to them , the West not only had a future , it was the future .They pointed out that , in the 1980s and 1990s , the vast majority of the world 's people had demonstrated by their actions and their stated desires that they wanted market capitalism , liberal democracy , and human rights .The most dramatic illustration of this was the fall of communism in central and Eastern Europe , including the former Soviet Union .But the Western optimists could easily adduce other illustrations .In many Latin American countries , for example , new or reinvigorated political movements for democracy , human rights , and economic freedom had transformed the political landscape since the 1980s .Since democratic capitalism , human rights , and personal freedom were Western in origin , the optimists held , their worldwide spread would yield a Westernized world , or at the very least , one favorable to Western survival and Western interests .The optimists differed on how long this would take .Some saw a Westernized , democratic world as a likely reality in the space of a few decades ; others predicted a longer transition , of perhaps a century or two .But the final outcome was , they thought , certain , and it was also certain that it was an outcome that the overwhelming majority of people , of whatever race , creed , or country , eagerly desired .Some optimists justified their vision by anthropology and biology .Human beings , they said , were naturally disposed to want , and whenever possible , to establish democracy and capitalism .Another way of putting this was to say that human beings achieved their true and full potential only in democratic and capitalist regimes .Since , in the optimist vision , men must naturally want to live as full and free a life as possible , it was inevitable that , once democracy and capitalism became possible , they therefore also became desirable and their ultimate and universal victory inevitable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.20441"}

{"text": "The reason for this weakness , Burnham argued , was liberalism itself , which he presented as a reaching that believed in progress and universal common purposes , and that therefore had no answer to those who refused to accept those premises .Liberalism , he claimed , was the ideology of Western suicide , for it taught the West to accept its own destruction as reasonable and even desirable .All the older and deeper traditions of pessimism were temporarily overshadowed by this more urgent variant .In 1991 , this case became moot .The Soviet Union unilaterally ended the contest ; the West won by default .The result was not that the optimists gained sole control , but that older varieties of pessimism reemerged .As for the anti - Western Westerners , those who thought the West did not deserve to survive , they had been active all along , but also found themselves , perhaps to their own surprise , with new freedom and new arguments after the Cold War .One paradox of the 1990s in the West was , then , that the wind went out of the sails of Western self - confidence just as that self - confidence had received its possibly greatest boost ever .Some people , the optimists , were unaffected .But the paradox , as it affected those many other people who found themselves assailed by new or revived doubts about the legitimacy , viability , or justification of the West , was not impossible to understand .One reason for it was that many people were not sure whether the victorious forces of democracy and capitalism were really as solid or as full of promise as they seemed .Another was that some people thought they were solid enough , but wondered if they were as beneficial as the optimists claimed .A third reason for the paradox , and the main reason for this book , was that the confusion about the West 's future rested on a prior confusion about the West itself .This confusion explains why both those who believed in and those who doubted the West 's future came in so many guises .It was not that they were unusually imaginative or creative ; rather , the West they were praising , deploring , criticizing , attacking , or merely investigating was ambiguous and protean .A feature identified by one analyst as the core of the West , say , capitalism , might seem to another as the mere by - product of its real core , say , Christianity .Likewise , two people might agree on the definition but disagree about its implications ; what one considered a great good might seem to another to have produced disaster .For example , some identified the West with the impulse to discovery , which led to science and to Christopher Columbus .The optimists might consider both results beneficial : science uncovered the laws of nature and revealed the universe ; Columbus connected the New World to the Old and thereby made possible the modern world economy and the United States of America , the most powerful liberal democracy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.31669"}

{"text": "In This Section .The Teaching of European History :The Next Task .Arthur Haberman and Adrian Shubert , October 2005 .The origins of teaching a European history survey course in colleges and high schools were rooted in the notion that the West provides the historical backdrop for the culture and civilization of Europe and North America .What became known as Western Civ , beginning either with the Greeks or the Renaissance , was created during World War I to teach U.S. soldiers what they were fighting for in Europe , and it has been a core part of history education from the 1950s .At first , the Western Civ courses emphasized the political , diplomatic , and military history of Europe , with a nod to intellectual history .Indeed , the Europe that was taught was a highly restrictive notion of what Europe was - geographically as well as thematically .If the course began in the Renaissance , it started in Italy and moved quickly to northern Europe .In effect , the course became one that emphasized the histories of Britain , France , and the Germanies , with another look at Italy during the Risorgimento and the Fascist era , and some Russian history .The master text was R. R. Palmer 's ( later on Palmer and Colton 's ) rather oddly titled History of the Modern World .A big shift occurred in the last two decades , and that turn is recorded in the newer texts , such as those of John P. McKay ( A History of Western Society ) and Lynn Hunt and others ( Making of the West : Peoples and Cultures ) .Now , social history was to be taught as well - including such areas as the history of women , labor , migration , and the family .This task is now complete , as witnessed by the materials used in basic texts and by the European history AP curriculum and examination .It should be noted that little changed in terms of the geographical notion of what was important in the West , and perhaps even in the very concept of the \" West . \"Western Europe was most important .Actually , not even all of western Europe , because the Iberian states were not considered to have contributed much to modernity .The next task for the curriculum is to transform both the concept of \" the West \" and of \" Europe \" and to include other societies which played an important role in Western development .Geographically and conceptually , \" Europe \" must now be understood to include more than those states which traditionally were considered to have contributed to the development of the liberal democratic West .Indeed , the curriculum has yet to catch up with the new Europe of today , which , in the EU , includes much of eastern and southern Europe , and is discussing the possibility of embracing Turkey and making some sort of arrangement with Russia .After all , Turkey and Russia were part of Europe for centuries and their cultures deeply influenced the West and drew from Western ideas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.40816"}
{"text": "It established a false dichotomy between some high principles , which existed outside history , and a flawed reality , characterized by inequality , prejudice , exploitation , and war .But the fact that political institutions did not satisfy all ideals was neither surprising nor unique to the West .What was unique to the West was how the prejudices , passions , and cruelties that we correctly see as the stuff of history engendered the niches of liberty that founded both prosperity and democracy .Western liberty was not something marvelously distinct from historical reality , but the initially unintended side effect of the drive for power .Rulers competing for power found that the niches of liberty of local communities made their societies stronger and more prosperous , hence more fit to compete .The passion for God , gold , and glory that launched the Christian holy wars of the crusades and sent the conquistador Hernan Cortes to Mexico yielded cruelty and war , but also spawned Western liberty out of the womb of ambition .The Grand Narrative 's second error was its universalism .It saw liberty and democracy , conceived by the Greeks and revived by modernity , not only as results of Western history and thus part of Western identity , but as universally valid .This universalism went with a third error , which I call the illusion of newness .The Grand Narrative imagined modern democracy as an invention of the Enlightenment and of the American and French Revolutions , an invention that owed less to Western history than to its own ambitions to shape the future .No one expressed that ambition better than Jean - Jacques Rousseau when he said , \" it makes no sense for the will to put bonds on its own future actions .\" True democracy lay ahead , not here and now .It thus became a future - oriented search for justice , whereas democracy was in fact an old practice in the niches of liberty , and one impossible to explain apart from the Christian ethnicity of the Old Western synthesis .Democracy and its political philosophy of liberalism were not creations of the eighteenth century , but practices constantly being invented , oppressed , and revived throughout Western history , and impossible to understand or appreciate apart from that history .The modern ( or postmodern ) West therefore was no abstract universalism based on some imaginary set of multiculturally applicable political ethics , but no more and no less than the institutional and cultural result of over a thousand years of the joint practice of power and liberty .This book is not a history of liberty or of economic development in the West , for good histories exist , from which I have drawn or extrapolated the insights summarized above .It explains , rather , why the conventional Grand Narrative and its ideology of centrist liberalism were always inadequate as accounts of Western identity and its history .For some decades in the mid - twentieth century , they served a political purpose as a lowest common denominator in American -- and to a lesser extent European -- higher education and public opinion of an idea of the West as progressive , secular , democratic , and moderately capitalist .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.513954"}

J.A. Croson , Co. 47 require people of color seeking beneficial legislation to find legislative proxies for race such as poverty , residence , educational attainment , or in the small business context , size .48 Such decisions pressure people of color with common interests to express those interests legislatively in terms of these nonracial proxies , which are constitutionally permissible classifications , in order to mitigate the economic , political , and social manifestations of racism and racial exclusion .Simultaneously , however , the Court asserts that these proxies can not be used judicially to identify racial discrimination or to craft remedies .District courts battling school segregation , for example , may not use the proxies of poverty or educational attainment to alleviate racial inequality in education between cities and suburbs .50 Courts may not use the proxy of de facto residential segregation to strike down racially exclusionary zoning laws .51 Courts can not rely on the proxy of statistical disparities in the workplace to combat employment discrimination without a showing of discriminatory intent .52 In other words , the Court has declared racial proxies to be ineffective constitutional tools for racial equalization , even as the Court indicates in other ways that they may be the only tools left .People of color , whose disadvantage is rooted both in racial discrimination and economic exclusion , have thus been thrown back into the political marketplace with a severe handicap .On the one hand , economic disadvantage and other proxies for race do not provide a basis for heightened judicial protection .On the other , the Court has identified race as an impermissible legislative tool with which to remedy the effects of discrimination .In other words , not only do the courts now offer less redress for manifest racial disadvantage , but the Equal Protection Clause now hampers people of color from using the representative process to forge beneficial legislation that might counter that disadvantage by other means .III .CONCLUSION .The Supreme Court has imposed a color - blind mandate on an increasingly multicultural , racially diverse body politic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.627945"}

{"text": "To be testable , hypotheses need to be stated precisely , and the most precise form statements can take is mathematical .Thus , science does not come into its own until scientists move beyond verbal descriptions of phenomena and begin expressing them as equations .There is some dispute as to who did this first , but it was certainly a Westerner .By the time of Newton 's laws of motion , the mathematical nature of science was fully established .Western science has had the massive effrontery to hold up all of our traditional beliefs to empirical testing , and virtually none of them has survived .Thus , natural science is a product of the Western capacity for critical thinking .In the 17th century , when natural science began in earnest , there was such a revulsion against traditional ways of thinking about nature that the major intellectuals of the day decided all prior work had to be scrapped .Francis Bacon , one of the originators of the scientific method , said : .There [ is ] but one course left ... to try the whole thing anew upon a better plan , and to commence a total reconstruction of sciences , arts , and all human knowledge , raised upon the proper foundations .This attitude is completely Western .In no other contemporary culture would this bald assertion of the preeminence of individual reason over tradition and authority have been possible .As the Western predominance in science indicates , no other world culture autonomously invented the experimental method .Although the Indians , East Asians , and Muslims studied mathematics , none of them grasped that nature had a mathematical structure that could be expressed through equations .It is no coincidence that Westerners have been just as dominant in technological innovation as in science .Technological innovation is rooted in an understanding of the natural world .Besides that , the same orientation towards the truth that undermined dogmatism in the study of nature also led Westerners to be receptive to new ways of doing things .In Humility and the West , I contrasted the dogmatic traditionalism of China with the Western openness to novelty .The same anti - dogmatic spirit led the West to be more receptive to foreign inventions as well .The orientation towards truth underlies the characteristics of the Western political tradition outlined in the last article .People who hold to their own vision of the truth will naturally be individualists and insist on a tolerant attitude towards divergence from social norms .A ubiquitous drive towards the expression of individual perspectives will inevitably push a society towards pluralism and tolerance .The combined effect of all these traits led to another distinguishing characteristic of Western culture : a tradition of major social revolutions .Our orientation towards the truth , along with the relatively pluralistic and tolerant societies that it creates , has made white cultures more dynamic and mutable than those of other races .As Deutsch says : .No other culture shows such a long and profound tradition of dynamic change .The social revolutions in non - Western societies that took place 19th and 20th centuries were caused by the introduction of Western ideas and practices , like communism , capitalism , and liberal democracy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.62781"}

{"text": "( These political histories , incidentally , should not be confused with the belief held by pietists that successive generations after the Prophet declined in virtue . )But contemporary Muslim scholars are beginning to ask whether it is right to represent Islamic history in these terms at all .That representation , it may be argued , is the product of a nineteenth - century European historiography in which the modern categories of \" religion \" and \" state \" are used anachronistically .After all , the Prophet Muhammad did not seek divine authority for all his political actions , and it is known that his followers often argued with him without being branded apostates .He had to rely on personal loyalty and on persuasion to keep his followers because he possessed no coercive state institutions .Indeed , it was the Prophet 's immediate political successor , Abu Bakr , who first undertook military action against fellow Muslims throughout the Arabian peninsula designed to subordinate them by force to centralized political authority .It was he who introduced the argument that obedience to an Islamic prince was a necessary part of being Muslim .However , I stress that even the principle of subordination to an Islamic prince does not constitute an Islamic state in the modern sense .This is a complex historical and theological theme which can not be pursued here .I touch on it merely in order to question the idea that the indisputable fact of an original Islamic theocratic state remains the real cause of contemporary Islamicist ambitions .In my view it is irresponsible to invite readers to regard Islamicist politics as an outgrowth of tendencies essential to an original politico - religious Islam .The idea that Islam was originally- and therefore essentially -a theocratic state is , I argue , a nineteenth - century European one , developed under the influence of evolutionary theories of religion .Of course its European origin does not in itself render it invalid .My reason for mentioning that nineteenth - century origin is simply that if today 's Islamic militants have accepted this perspective as their own , this does not make it essential to Islam .( It is necessary to add , however , that my argument is not intended to undermine the validity of any kind of \" politicized Islam \" ; I claim only that \" a religious state \" is not essential to the tradition of Islam . )It also wo n't do to represent all forms of Islamic revival as merely accidental growths caused by deteriorating economic conditions combined with Western ideologies .People respond to contemporary conditions , they are not passively determined by them .Their traditions and interpretations of history , and therefore their formulation of the problems they face , are part of these conditions .In fact , Islamic movements of revival predate the impact of Western modernity in Muslim countries .Thus in the eighteenth century ( to go back no farther ) there were several attempts at social reform and theological renewal in the Muslim world .In general the reforming thinkers took pains to distinguish between the absolute truth of the divine text and the authority of interpretive positions adopted by traditionalists and legal scholars over the centuries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.96952"}
