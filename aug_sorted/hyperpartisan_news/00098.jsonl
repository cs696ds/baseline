{"text": "They have , in large measure , provided an introduction to the literature that redresses the dominant pathological analysis of people of African descent .The need for black theorists to define black reality demanded a return to the afore- mentioned fundamentals .Other nondominant groups - Native Americans and Latinos in particular - have also had to redress the dominant pathological dis- course .Proponents of the pathological analysis of African people , however , have also utilized their version of an ontological critique to make their case .They have resorted to the age - old tendencies to characterize differences as deviations from a defined norm and utilize a profile as opposed to a processed character- ization of the group that identifies a list of static qualities totally contrary to the human tendency to evolve .Alternatively , the ontology of the dominant is rarely if ever addressed .Implicitly , both suggest that those who were not born with power are not entitled to it .Failure to explore the values of domination and exploita- tion , which afforded the empowerment of the elite , facilitates the organic ex- planation .History and objective condition converge in the creation of the constructed reality called culture .Ontology , as indivisible from the individual as culture , is a precondition of both .Black women throughout the African diaspora are not identical ; though our conditions are similar in type , we each have our own peculiarities .But the same ontology informed the cultural matrix from which we all derive .Thus the African past must be the point of departure for under- standing an African American female ontology .The translation of the afore- mentioned African ontology into an African American cultural matrix facili- tated consistency in gender conventions .These conventions , however , are disparate from the Western logic of mainstream feminism that finds it difficult to process the simultaneity of egalitarianism and sex role stratification in precolonial Africa .In her seminal work The Black Woman Cross - Culturally , Filomina C. Steady identifies four major characteristics that differentiate the worldview of black women throughout the diaspora from that of white femi- nists .Since worldview derives from ontology , clarity on the African worldview regarding the role and significance of women will illuminate some fundamen- tal ontological assumptions about womanhood . \" The African ontology was reinterpreted by black women in the North Ameri- can chattel slave context .African ontological characteristics were antithetical to the planter class 's definition of womanhood but consistent with their need for strong procreators and laborers .Thus , although in an oppressive fashion , the North American chattel slave context reified the African ontology for black women and facilitated the transition to an African American female ontology .This inclusive , group - oriented interpretation of gender roles , even in an exclu- sive race- and gender - stratified context , affirms Steady 's definition of the Afri- can woman 's worldview .Female slaves in North America interpreted their power .in their unequivocal commitment to the survival of self and loved ones .Much in line with Mbiti 's analysis of the immutable relationship between religion and community , black female existence was inextricably linked to family and group survival .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.78783"}

{"text": "And in any case , it is elegant , insightful and , I think , right on the money .The piece is clearly not intended for those who have n't a clue about race relations in this country .It is , rather , written for those of us who have been wrestling with the demons of institutionalized oppression in the name of race for some time and have tried to -- and in some cases , may have succeeded in -- making some degree of headway .I , for one , will use it to keep me honest and on - task in the same way I always receive input from people of color in terms of teaching me what I need to know to be of use in this or any struggle for human agency .I received an annoying e - mail about white people and their struggle to do anti - racist work .I keep reading and hearing white people talk about their struggle to do anti - racist organizing , and frankly it gets on my nerves .So I am writing this open letter to white people who engage in any activist work that involves or affects non - whites .That said , I want to begin with what has become a realization for me through the help of different politically conscious friends .There is NO SUCH THING AS A WHITE ANTI - RACIST .The term itself , \" white anti- racist \" is an oxymoron .In the following , I will explain why .Then , I will begin to detail how this impacts non - white people in organizing work specifically , along with how it affects non - white people generally .First , one must realize that whiteness is a structure of domination .As such , there is nothing redeemable or reformable about whiteness .Intellectuals , scholars and activists , especially those who are non-white , have drawn our attention to this for years .Further , people such as Douglass and DuBois began to outline how whiteness is a social and political construct that emphasizes the domination , authority , and perceived humanity of those who are racialized as white .They , along with many other non - white writers and orators , have pointed to the fact that it was the bodies who were able to be racialized as \" white \" that were able to be viewed as rational , authoritative , and deserving .Further , and believe me , this is no small thing , white people are viewed as human .Furthermore , even when white people have been oppressed by various dimensions of classism , homophobia and heterosexism , they have been able to opt for what DuBois , in his monograph \" Black Reconstruction \" brilliantly called \" the psychological wage of whiteness .\" That is , whites that are marginalized could find comfort , even if psychological , in the fact that they were not non - white .They could revel in the fact that they could be taken as white in opposition to non - white groups .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.015152"}
{"text": "After the fuzzy glow of Election Night 2008 had morphed into the real business of practical politics -- the honeymoon now over -- we witnessed a predictable backlash .The loyal opposition had decided that President Obama was not moving fast enough and had betrayed the vocal Left .Obama is truly a \" bound man \" because the symbolic weight of his racial identity adds a burden , one both positive and negative .For the former , the symbolism of Obama as President is aspirational wherein African Americans and others expect more from Barack precisely because he stands on the shoulders of the Black Freedom Struggle .Given this mix of impulses in the American body politic , the meme that race relations are now made worst in the Age of Obama is a predictable one .There is always a backlash when a society experiences a system shock .To point : the election of Barack Obama most certainly shook the metaphorical bushes and encouraged the racially resentful , nativist , and bigoted vipers to come out of hiding .But this push - back against America 's first black president , to the degree that ideology is intermixed with racial hostility , also leaves some basic questions unasked .For example : .Is the election of Barack Obama merely correlated with a souring of race relations in this country ?( Question : what exactly does this vague measurement of \" race relations \" actually mean ?Does it mask and hide as much as it reveals ? )In much the way that my getting up in the morning has nothing to do with the sun rising , is the mere fact of President Obama simply coincidental to a decline in the American public 's hope about improved relationships across the colorline ?Alternatively , are the policy choices of President Obama ( to act or not ) on certain issues actually making race relations worse ?As a third option , did the election of Barack Obama along with changing demographics in a time of economic uncertainty stimulate a white racial backlash , an out - sized response that would inevitably overflow into the mass public ?HBO 's Boardwalk Empire is a lush television series .Do not be mistaken : Lushness does not necessarily mean a completeness of superficial physical beauty or the trap of ephemeral and pretty things .Lushness can also be depth .It can be intelligence .Lushness can be breadth and reward .As noted philosopher Slavoy Zizek said of the seminal dystopian film Children of Men , some artifacts of popular culture reward \" deep viewing .\" For those who study film , popular culture , or the semiotics of mass culture , this means viewing a film with obligatory seriousness , intensity , and broadness of field .For scholars of film , this understanding is a wink to the concept understood as \" Mis En Scene . \"Translated : Boardwalk Empire frames a shot in such a way as to encourage a careful attention to clothing , the positioning of the characters relative to one another , and of the scene at large .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.041145"}

'While perpetrating these abuses , the nightriders mocked , \" ' You think you are white , you think you are rich , you curse white folks .

{"text": "This chapter will explore the African American female ontology and its in- tellectual implications for the academy .The exploration must commence with an examination of the nature and quality of academe .The Structure of Academe The structure of academe , as constructed by a white Western male perspective , includes both theoretical and bureaucratic components .Both structural components have a primary commitment to exclusivity .This value is manifested theoretically in its ethnocentrism and bureaucratically in the demographics of the academy .The bureaucratic structure of the academy defines higher education as the major conduit .Thus , within such contexts , mimicry and memo- rization are valued over critical thought .Juxtapose this education with cultural values such as \" individualism \" and \" the end justifies the means , \" and then look at youth behavior .Benjamin R. Barber says , \" The illiteracy of the young turns out to be our own reflected back to us with embarrassing force .We honor am- bition , we reward greed , we celebrate materialism , we worship acquisitiveness , we cherish success , we commercialize the classroom - and then we bark at the young about the gentle arts of the spirit .\" 2 American students have been taught the ideal cultural values of inclusion and justice while observing the real cul- tural values of exclusion and ethnocentrism .America 's future is as paradoxical as its past .No entity , bureaucratic or theoretical , can develop a select few to lead many and define that development in a vacuum .A commitment to exclusivity con- structs a narrow and false reality known only to the select few .The Western academic model has designed a curriculum for failure , and it has been eminently successful .The superficiality of race and culture dis- course in a period when shifts in these areas abound is a testament to the pa- rameters hegemony imposes on itself .Case in point : In periods of constant and rapid social change , one would expect to find a multiplicity of new concepts , paradigms , and methodologies .It seems logical that new circumstances would yield new understandings , new ways of viewing the world , new ways of ascertaining information .Yet this is not always true .Certainly some historical and contemporary occurrences have yielded some changes in the disciplines most closely related to the phenom- enon .But in a review of the impact of social phenomena on academic dis- course , what seems to remain fairly consistent is the relationship between the trajectory of an event and its visibility in mainstream discourse .Specifically , it seems that when social behavior is bottom - up in motivation , there is less of a tendency for it to generate new sensibilities in the discourse .When motivation is top - down , however , it is more likely to appear as an issue explored within the various venues operative in the aforementioned academic parameters .For ex- ample , social science textbooks , journals , conferences , and funding will reflect the significance of the post - Soviet Union struggles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.496895"}

{"text": "Black women have historically resisted , individually and collectively , these imposed definitions and images of our racial and sexual being .Bell Hooks notes in Talking Back : Thinking Feminist , Thinking Black that \" oppressed people re- sist by identifying themselves as subjects , by defining their reality , shaping their new identity , naming their history , telling their story . \" In this section , Shelby F. Lewis 's \" Africana Feminism : An Alternative Paradigm for Women in the Acad- emy \" continues that redefinition of ourselves and our realities .She argues that the racist , classist patriarchy is the underlying foundation of a global hegemonic paradigm , which operates in the academy , as well as other arenas , to protect elite white male privilege .In the academy , white males control the production and dissemination of information .On the question of gender , Lewis writes that white women \" own the realm of theory , \" which excludes other voices .She pro- poses that black women academicians begin deconstructing the Eurocentric classist , racist patriarchy .She maintains we can start by embracing an Afrocentric perspective and \" naming ourselves African American .\" This redefinition , ac- .cording to Lewis , reinforces the African linkage , a necessary paradigm to shape a global liberation struggle against racism , sexism , and classism .John calls for an inclusion of this way of viewing the world in creating a more humane academy and world community .In the foreword to the 1983 book Feminist Theories , Dale Spender notes that central issues in theories for liberation are who controls the channels of com- munication and who decides what we know . 'She suggests that males own the realm of theory and that society legitimates male - oriented theories because males control information , are able to put forward their own version of facts , and can suppress alternative versions .While this analysis of male hegemony is insightful , Spender has neglected to acknowledge African American women 's knowledge and theories .This form of marginalization highlights the critical reality that on questions of gender , white women own the realm of theory .How racial hegemony was at- tained and how it is maintained are questions that should be addressed .It is also important to address the need for black women to deconstruct and over- come the basic assumptions underlying white hegemony .This chapter addresses the question of hegemony in the academy and ex- plores the premise that racist / capitalist patriarchy forms the pillars of a global paradigm of oppression .This paradigm operates in the academy to support and protect the interests and concerns of rich white males , except on questions of .gender , where white females constitute the dominant class .The Hegemonic Paradigm When the Handbook for Achieving Sex Equity Through Education was pub- lished in 1985,4 it devoted a sixty - nine - page section entitled \" Sex Equity Strate- gies for Specific Populations \" to the question of minority , handicapped , and other nonmainstream women .I was asked to do the chapter \" Achieving Sex Equity for Minority Women , \" which I elected to do because I felt that alterna- tive voices and perspectives were needed in the volume .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.959206"}

{"text": "I would like to know , for instance , whether or not you would be proposing similar legislation if you saw most murder trials as failures .If most murderers were set free under our system , would it be just to take away the presumption of innocence ?Your problem is that you do n't outline specific contributors to the failure of our system .We do n't fail to imprison rapists because we assume they are innocent , we fail because we lack evidence that can eliminate any reasonable doubt .It would be best to address the issue of scarce evidence , whereas your method is more of a blind attack on the system .Fixing outcomes and solving problems are completely different .I would also like to point out that the reason that only 6 % ( or whatever percentage it is ) of rape trials end in convictions is in part because of the severity of the sentence for rape .Your legislation only makes the punishment more severe , all the while making it near impossible to be acquitted ( imagine how difficult it is to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you are innocent of a crime ) .Your bias against and distrust for men is elucidated by your suggestion that male genitalia is a weapon that should be removed in the event of conviction .Reading your post I get a strong sense that you are very afraid of men and what they can do to women .Regardless , no human body part is legally a weapon .I do not deny that humans can cause one another great pain without the use of tools , but it is grossly unjust to treat humans , or parts of humans , as weapons .Your suggestion is akin to cutting out the tongue of an individual convicted of libel .Perhaps you do n't see the problem with this , but to call a human a weapon is to erase human qualities .All people , without exception , are endowed with inalienable human rights , and to take away someone 's humanness is to violate such a right .You 'll probably argue that rape violates human rights , which it does , but the difference between rape and castration as punishment is that the latter is an institutionalized violation of human rights .We can not control a free individual , but we can control a free government , and so it is our responsibility never to trade human rights for any desired result .Ultimately , I hope you see that your legislation , while letting fewer rapists walk , would only mark a disconnect from utopian ideals .To clarify my position , I agree our justice system is failing .Also , our prison system in it 's current form does nothing for society , so why not force criminals to pay back their debts with community service .Goat , sexual assault crimes are not taken seriously and the punishments for sexual assault are ridiculous .Sexual assault crimes need more extreme punishment , not less .A friend of mine was raped by a man one year ago .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.205772"}

{"text": "Much of this information is introduced through the new scholarship on women of color generally and African American women scholars in particular .Because a majority of the people in sociology are Euro - Americans , they do not necessarily construct whiteness as a racial category .Whiteness carries privi- .leges , and it is through this phenomenon that internalized domination is acted out .Thus getting sociologists to see whiteness as a racial construction is an important consideration , though these are uncomfortable ideas for many white faculty .Closely aligned with this reality is acquiring a natural attitude embed- ded in accepting conventional ways of knowing disciplinary perspectives as the norm .These are natural attitudes that need piercing and mystifications that need unearthing .Getting faculty to think historically and systemically is also key .The historic negative contact and power relationships between Europeans and people of color have been the source of a great deal of tension and conflict .Yet at the same time people of color have not just been victims .There is a rich cultural legacy of resistance and creativity that is not known , or at least not well known .Our sociological work must involve examining resistance as well as oppression , cultural creativity as well as exploitation .Changing Classroom Process Faculty also need to think and act on their teaching .Changing sociological content without changing process does not get us very far .Considerations about learning styles , student empowerment , and giving voice to historically silenced and marginalized groups - people of color of both genders , white women , dis- abled people , older students , gays , lesbians - are key issues to be addressed .The old top - down model of professor as sole authority must be looked at care- fully .Faculty should consider more active learning strategies , student respon- sibility for learning , journals , simulations , and so on .The major idea is that as we must rethink our content , we have to rethink our teaching .This must be an ongoing consideration for sociology faculty .In a corollary fashion , black women are also being challenged to become more than an authenticating presence in the classroom .Conclusions The difficult assessments that must occur in the field of sociology in particular and all disciplines generally must include reconceptualization of scholarship , training , faculty transformation , and pedagogical change .African American women scholars are increasingly taking on these intellectual challenges .It is important to center our analyses in the multiple articulations of agency and structure , gender , class , race , and culture .These changes are crucial to a deep- level curriculum transformation in higher education in the United States .Fred Powledge , Free at Last ?The Civil Rights Movement and the People Who Made It ( Boston : Beacon , 1991 ) .Bell Hooks , Yearning ( Boston : South End Press , 1990 ) .Gloria T.

{"text": "6 January 2014 post - script : I am thinking now of how any interruption in collective silence may serve to empower others to speak out as well .Breaking silence when abuse is happening in front of us , in other words , is often useful in and of itself .That may be so even if it is n't done using the most appropriate or useful language .This is to say , \" too little \" might be just enoug h for more to happen .Any individual 's action opposing and interrupting abuse in a social space can at least open that space to more challenges of that violence .I think part of the ' white / male hero ' phenomenon has to do with the alleged hero wanting all the credit for rescuing the abused person , ignoring how historically and inherently collectivist anti - oppression and anti - abuse work is .There 's never a lone hero in such work and any attempts to narratively manufacture or highlight one is usually done to mis- and over - represent the work of one or a few whites and men .4 comments : .I would just like to add something .First though I need to clearly state that in no way am I trying to justify a black man who abuses a woman or child or another man .As far as I am concerned when a black man abuses someone else the law must deal with him and he must face the consequences of his crime .However , with that in mind we must not forget that black men are living under white male supremacy .They have been emasculated by white males and their systems for far too long .These black men as the oppressed often become extremely frustrated with their lot in life .This can lead them to taking their frustrations out on black women and children as they know that these victims are in a weak position and often ca n't fight back .White women and white men who oppose white male supremacy should work towards the total destruction of this cancer .Racist , sexist and homophobic white males should be removed from potions of power and made to pay for their crimes .( Please note that my idea of making white males pay for their crimes is not about revenge but rather ensuring true justice . )This will both liberate black men which means they will no longer feel angry and frustrated and by seeing what happens to white males who oppress women and girls will make them realises that there are some serious consequences for trying to cause harm .If white male supremacy had been destroyed I think this scene may have played out a bit differently .There is a lot of anger and frustration amongst the oppressed black youth of today especially in countries completely dominated by WHM such as the US .We need to look at exploring ways where young black boys and black teenage boys can be trained at school level to focus their anger at white male supremacy and not at women and those in a weaker position then them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.619804"}

{"text": "Africa was robbed of its most precious resource - its people .Unlike wage workers , whose labor power was purchased as a commodity and whose product was taken , the entire physical existence of Africans was stolen and sold outright .Being African became , as a matter of law and custom , a mark of being a slave , an item for sale in toto as a commodity .The value of this commodity accrued completely to the slave master with nothing for the slave .In contrast , being white became the mark of being free , a vessel of labor power .Free white workers owned themselves and they could sell their labor power as a commodity or not , for their own benefit .Between Black and white was erected a spectrum of color in which one 's status as pariah could be determined by the darkness of one 's complexion .How did this happen ?Certainly in our creation there was no separation of human beings into categories of free and slave defined by skin color .White supremacy did not \" just happen \" naturally .It was the midwife of capitalism and all the brutality and violence that it brought into the world .The history of how the English colonial masters created and institutionalized white supremacy in their colonies in the Americas is brilliantly documented in detail in Theodore Allen 's two volume work , \" The Invention of the White Race .\" Starting in 1616 ( before the Pilgrims came to New England ) the English shipped thousands of English , Scotch , and Irish to the tobacco plantations of Virginia , where they were held to unpaid work in bondage under contracts typically lasting seven years .They were drawn from among the former peasants cast off the land in the British Isles in the 17 th century through the enclosure of the commons and the expropriation of their land .Cast onto the roads , driven into the cities these men and women were arrested en mass for vagrancy , which was made illegal .They were given a choice - prison or Virginia .Work in the tobacco plantations of Virginia was hard and conditions were harsh ; most did not live long enough to complete their bondage .Marriage was not permitted among them ; fornication was absolutely prohibited .Some Africans were also brought to Virginia as bonded or indentured workers on the tobacco plantations .They were a minority of such workers originally .The Virginia Company 's plantations were on land that had been taken from its original indigenous inhabitants through force , some of whom struck back .Colonial masters made certain that it was bonded workers , virtual slaves , who bore the brunt of these counter - attacks .In 1676 a frontier planter named Nathaniel Bacon demanded protection against Indian raids from the colonial administration .Failing to get it , he organized an armed force of bonded workers without regard for color or ethnicity , and stormed Jamestown , the seat of power , burning it down .It may seem ironic that it was a in a demand for more aggressive action against the peoples of the First Nations of the new world that Bacon 's Rebellion was born .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.02614"}

{"text": "Feminist scholarship growing out of the mainstream framework effectively marginalizes black female contributions to American feminist theory and prac- tice .Scholars who accord intellectual character to the contributions of \" other \" women are seen as voices for a subgroup for special populations .Only \" they \" speak for American women.1 In effect , white feminists universalize their theo- ries of gender and liberation while particularizing and thereby minimizing the theories of other women .However , a critical divergence exists between main- stream and revolutionary feminism .The search for alternative approaches to oppositional feminist struggle in American society is informed by the theoreti- cal paralysis resulting from the ascendancy of mainstream feminism .In response to white hegemony , black women have initiated a politics of identity that calls attention to the differences among women , especially differ- . ences in women 's forms of oppression and access to or denial of privileges .They attribute these differences to interlocking structures of domination , so- cially defined and constructed down through history in terms of race , class , and sexuality.12 Too few white feminists understand and acknowledge this dif- ference or the racist and nonrevolutionary nature of their feminism .Barbara Smith suggests that much of what white women call feminism is actually female self - aggrandizement , because inherent in the definition of femi- nism are a theory and practice to free all women .Anything less than this vision of total freedom is not feminism.13 American revolutionary feminism grows out of the activities and experiences of enslaved African women and creates alternative voices and strategies of struggle .Enslaved women became part of overt and covert movements to overthrow oppression .They wanted to destroy the system of slavery and the state that sanctioned it .Women like Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman are well known , but countless oth- ers provided support and fodder for revolts and radical forms of resistance to various types of oppression .This larger question of human rights , the basis of revolutionary feminism , was a part of their consciousness .This revolutionary consciousness was also manifested during the civil rights movement .Fannie Lou Hamer and other women like her , guided by the as- sumption that she was discriminated against because of race , gender , and class , concluded that the system of segregation and the state that supported it had to be transformed . \"Because Ms. Hamer and other black women have experi- enced multidimensional oppression , they have sought multidimensional and radical strategies to end that oppression - strategies that go beyond the reform- ist goals of the civil rights movement and the mainstream feminist movement .Development theory , state theory , and feminist theory all touch on aspects of women 's lives , but only when the three converge is there clarity about where . women of African descent stand in the world order .To lay the foundation for an alternative paradigm for women of African descent , it is necessary to exam- ine and compare global movements and theories that attempt to address the hegemonic model of racist / capitalist patriarchy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.74299"}

{"text": "The nature and effects of hate crime means that it is seen as particularly serious : Section 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 imposes a duty on courts to increase the sentence for any offence aggravated by hostility based on the victim 's sexual orientation or disability .Evidence of hostility based on disability , sexual orientation or presumed sexual orientation must be seen as something that makes the offence more serious .Similar provisions already exist in relation to race , resulting from The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry which also resulted in the imposition of minimum tariffs in relation to the sentencing of murderers motivated by hostility .Violence against women as hate crime ?Similarly , a recognition of the particularly serious nature of these crimes when it comes to sentencing would also seem appropriate and desirable .However , feminist campaigners have expressed reservations regarding the desirability of utilising a ' hate crime ' approach .Firstly , hate crime legislation is generally designed to deal with ' stranger ' or ' outsider ' violence : violence from a person outside of one 's personal and social circles .Whilst this would obviously apply in cases like Bellfield described above , it is less useful in dealing with the majority of incidents of violence against women , where the perpetrator is likely to be a partner , ex - partner , acquaintance or friend .Campaigners believe that women victims would be unlikely to perceive these acts of violence as motivated by hate or prejudice .McCollum also voices concern at what she sees as the inadequacies of current hate crime legislation in addressing issues of intersectionality , and the depoliticising tendencies of the term ' hate ' .Without a full consideration and integration of power relations , McCollum argues , ' hate crimes can be depoliticised as motivated by irrational prejudice , rather than domination , exclusion and control ' .Other feminist campaigners express concerns that if violence against women was included alongside other hate crime categories , recognition of its specificities , scale and prevalence could be lost , and funding might consequently be jeopardised .Hate crime ' : a useful concept ?The reservations of feminist campaigners with regard to hate crime approaches highlight important inadequacies in the way that such approaches frame acts of violence based on structural inequalities .However , I would argue that the concept of hate crime does at least bring considerations of discrimination and the generalised effects of violence into the picture .The notion of hate crime facilitates and supports a recognition that inequalities and discrimination experienced by certain groups exist on a spectrum that ranges from racist , homophobic and disablist language , through discrimination in employment , goods and services , and ultimately to acts of violence and murder .So whilst the term has its problems , it does at least serve to make links between cultural attitudes , discrimination and acts of violence .What is necessary is a further re - framing of the issue in order to recognise that power and control are key motivations for violence against women and girls , and that individual acts of violence are supported by a context of structural inequality and cultural misogyny .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.34221"}

{"text": "I ask my questions in the context of the sociological training of groups on the margin .Surely the multiple disjunctures that black women bring to the academy are potentially challenging to main- stream sociology .Moreover , dominance in the field by the top few departments continues .These departments are likely not to have either women 's studies or ethnic stud- ies in the curriculum or to include the new scholarship on race , ethnicity , class , and gender in interaction .Even today , much of graduate training in sociology is still heavily rooted in a positivist paradigm .Of course , not all black women sociologists contest positivism , but my point is that what is presumed to be unproblematic- training into sociology - is touched by the confluence of race , class , and gen- der in the academy and in black women scholars .Black Women Intellectuals , Countertendencies , and Knowledge Transformation in the Field of Sociology Since the 1960s there have been several major efforts to redefine the field .New Left perspectives reintroduced an open critique of capitalism into the field in the late 1960s and the 1970s .This coincided with the struggle to generate a black sociology relevant to the experiences of African Americans.24A feminist . sociology followed in the wake of the New Left and black sociology critiques .And most recently , a black feminist sociology , predicated on explicating the intersection of race , class , and gender , is emerging.25 Although some efforts to reconceptualize the field are going on , the enter- prise is fraught with difficulty and contradictions .Yet African American women are raising deeply rooted issues .A long - standing tradition of oppositional cul- tural representation is central to the resistance to historic and contemporary stereotypes of African American women .Today , as historically , black women are again being blamed for the demise of the black family .The culprits this time are the adolescent mother and the female - led black family.26 This is not too different from the matriarch ensconced in social science research thirty years ago.27 Black women scholars are making a different intellectual case for what is going on in African American communities .It is not surprising that the knowledge claims of African American women have been shaped by the modality of race .A number of the current generation of scholars grew up in segregated America .Restrictions and discrimination were largely played out through the color line .The making of the African American community as a rich fabric of life and culture can also be remembered .This transcends the pathology / problem paradigm that is so central to social science investigations of African Americans .This is captured in Joyce Ladner 's The Death ofWhite Sociology and the thinking about Afrocentricity by Molefi Asante , who states : .More damaging still has been the inability of European thinkers , particu- larly of the neopositivist or empiricist traditions , to see that human ac- tions can not be understood apart from the emotions , attitudes , and cul- tural definitions of a given context .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.455505"}

Shaw and Henry D. McKay suggested that disorganized communities characterized by poverty , population heterogeneity , and residential mobility weakened the effectiveness of social controls ( Kelly , 2000 ; Messner , Baumer , & Rosenfeld , 2004 ) .Weakened social controls led to the inability of communities to solve problems , which , in turn , led to crime .At that time , the city of Chicago was the perfect laboratory for social research as it was booming with industry and was the home to an increasingly diverse population .With this rapid growth and constant change , social problems ensued , allowing society to become somewhat disorganized .In light of the social problems plaguing Chicago and its suburbs , Shaw and McKay studied the prevalent local crime and delinquency .Building on \" an ecological theory of urban dynamics , \" social disorganization theory aimed to explain the larger ratio of delinquency that occurred in certain Chicago neighborhoods ( Cantillon , Davidson , & Schweitzer , 2003 , p. 322 ) .Further , their study revealed that high rates of crime occur in those communities that exhibit declining populations and physical deterioration ( Jensen , 2003 ) .At its core , social disorganization theory focuses on the effects of location and location - specific characteristics as they relate to crime ( Mustaine , Tewksbury , & Stengel , 2006 ) .Neighborhoods lacking organization lack the necessary social controls and are unable to provide essential services .This leads to an inability of the community to control its public , which is why \" one way to define social disorganization is to view such places as unable to maintain public order through informal means \" ( Mustaine et al . , 2006 ,p. 332 ) .The absence of public order coupled with the problematic characteristics of disorganized communities - namely , poverty , population heterogeneity , and residential mobility - are strong predictors of high crime rates .The question then becomes : How effective is social disorganization theory in explaining criminal behavior ?There are five criteria used in evaluating theories , which demonstrate whether the theory makes sense in the simplest way of explaining crime and whether the theory is able to be tested to deliver true and valid results .In greater detail , each of the five criteria is applied to social disorganization theory as follows : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.08907"}

{"text": "Discussion .Our study contributes to evidence that the burden of imprisonment is not evenly distributed across gender and race in the United States population .Males spend a greater proportion of their life in prison or jail than females .Considering either gender , African Americans spend much more of their life in prison or jail than Hispanics or Caucasians .The burden , if not the disparity , would be even larger if we considered people confined under the jurisdiction of local authorities and people that were on parole or probation , since the latter group is currently twice the size of those imprisoned [ 11 ] .Furthermore , the percentage of time spent in prison is conservative in our study because the estimate of life expectancy is from birth , even though most people who are imprisoned are between 18 and 44 years of age .Although data are limited , there is a growing concern that imprisonment can have serious negative health consequences [ 12 , 13 ] .Prison populations exhibit an elevated prevalence of communicable disease [ 14 ] .High levels of violence , including sexual violence , have been reported among imprisoned populations [ 15 , 16 ] .Consensual sex without condoms as well as drug injection and tattooing without sterile equipment are reported to occur at dangerous levels and to result in transmission of diseases , such as HIV [ 12 , 17 - 21 ] .Additionally , imprisonment may have life altering health consequences mediated by factors such as a decline in socio - economic status [ 22 ] .Our findings , and the growing literature on the negative health consequences of imprisonment , suggest that the extensive reliance on incarceration to control behavior in the United States has social costs that have not been fully recognized [ 22 ] .These social costs are not evenly distributed and may be contributing to population health disparities [ 23 ] .These health consequences may be reduced to some degree by making prisons more salubrious - by introducing better health , addiction treatment and mental health care , distributing condoms and needles , preventing violence and coordinating services as inmates move back into the community [ 12 ] .The most direct way to reduce these consequences would be to reduce the number of people who go to prison .One way to accomplish this would be by reducing the number of behaviors subject to imprisonment .Because laws criminalizing drug possession are the major driver of the imprisonment of the non - violent offenders in the United States , changes in these laws could be expected to have a significant impact .Other steps would include investing more in drug treatment , mental health care and other services that can forestall offending , reduce recidivism or serve as alternatives to imprisonment .The use of mid - year sample data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics to measure the number of persons imprisoned may represent a limitation in our analyses .These data are based on sample estimates and do not reflect a complete census of prisoners .We must also recognize that these data exclude persons confined in locally administered facilities who are under the jurisdiction of local authorities and those who are on parole or probation [ 4 ] .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.634346"}

{"text": "Like other immigrants , African - born populations face challenges and opportunities when they arrive in the US .Their success or failure to adapt to the new environment depends on their premigration cultural legacies , the selectivity of migration , and prevailing job market practices at the place of destination [ 1 ] .We discuss these three perspectives below in order to construct a theoretical framework that helps us understand African immigrants ' experiences in the American job market .Under the premigration cultural legacies , the observed differences in labor force conditions and earnings are said to reflect each group 's particular attitudes toward employment , schooling , family , kinship , and migration itself [ 25 , 26 ] .While the effects of some of the cultural legacy variables ( e.g. , education ) can be statistically controlled , others such as social norms and values that denote family priorities are difficult to measure using secondary data .The second explanation about the differences in labor force participation and earnings between African immigrants and other groups can be found in the selectivity of migration argument .The basic assumption is that people who migrate are usually among the most talented and ambitious [ 27 ] .As such , migrants are expected to have better labor market skills than nonmigrants [ 28 ] .The third type of explanation is based on the labor queue theory , which refers to the \" amount of discrimination or favoritism particular groups encounter \" [ 1 ] .According to this theory , employers are said to follow a preference ordering in selecting their workforce [ 29 - 31 ] . \" In a race - conscious society like the United States , employers rank entire groups of people in terms of their ethnic and racial characteristics \" [ 2 ] .Within the labor queue model , Whites are at the top of the queue , followed by Asians , Hispanics , and Blacks .Is the queuing explanation still valid today ?Does it hold for African immigrant men ?This study focuses on the labor queue theory , according to which Whites are advantaged in the United States labor market .Therefore , we expect white African immigrant men to have higher labor force participation rate and higher earnings than black African immigrant men , net of their other sociodemographic characteristics .Data and Methods .Two types of data are used in this study : ( 1 ) the decennial census data ( 1980 , 1990 , and 2000 ) , and ( 2 ) the 2008 American Community Survey data .These data were drawn from the five percent Integrated Public Use Microdata Series ( IPUMS ) .IPUMS is a collection of microdata , where each record is a person with all the characteristics numerically coded [ 32 ] .Using the IPUMS 's data extraction system , we selected the variables needed for this research .We use these data to show the trends and changing composition of the male population of African origin in the United States in the last three decades .Further analyses were conducted on the working age population to determine the importance of race through the labor queue theory , according to which white African immigrant men will have a better chance of employment and higher earnings than black African immigrant men .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.11917"}

Kellogg Foundation , the Mitchell Kapor Foundation and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation , and local and regional foundations are working to assist African - American males .Shawn Dove , campaign manager for the Campaign for Black Male Achievement sponsored by Open Society Foundations , recalls that media stories about the plight of black men in 2006 spurred discussion on how the foundation could engage .\" I thought , ' How can we , a foundation that supports open society values , and believes in a democratic society , as a foundation , not be at the forefront of these issues ? ' \" he says .\" When we launched , there was not an equivalent on a national level . \"The program began in June 2008 and was to be a three - year campaign .But 18 months in , Dove says , George Soros , chairman of Open Society Foundations , and its board were impressed by the work , expanded the budget and agreed to make it ongoing .Since 2008 , it has spent $ 29.6 million funding 94 organizations working on educational equity , strengthening family structures and increasing work opportunities .Grantees are in Chicago , Milwaukee , Baltimore , Philadelphia , New Orleans and Jackson , Miss. .\" We are responding to long - term systemic and structural barriers facing the African - American community , specifically black men and boys , \" Dove says . \"An adequate response is not a three - year or five - year commitment .An adequate response is generational commitment so that direct services and policy advocacy are bridged . \"Dove maintains that to adequately address challenges faced by African - American men , \" we need an endowed social corporation that can focus on these issues for the long haul . \"The W.K. Kellogg Foundation 's work in this regard dates to the early 1990s when it launched a Men and Boys of Color initiative that included grants and creation of opportunities for black males .For more than 20 years , Kellogg has been in the forefront in supporting initiatives such as Community Voices , which started the nation 's first health clinic for men in Baltimore , addressed flaws in local juvenile justice systems and assisted ex - convicts in re - entering communities in numerous cities .\" Both explicit and unconscious bias affects young men and boys of color in particular , denying them equal opportunities to succeed in their communities , says Dr. Gail C.

{"text": "Some weaker sauce from Wikipedia ... but still pretty powerful .On social disorganization theory : .Social disorganization theory pioneers Clifford R. Shaw and Henry D. McKay suggested that disorganized communities characterized by poverty , population heterogeneity , and residential mobility weakened the effectiveness of social controls ( Kelly , 2000 ; Messner , Baumer , & Rosenfeld , 2004 ) .Weakened social controls led to the inability of communities to solve problems , which , in turn , led to crime .At that time , the city of Chicago was the perfect laboratory for social research as it was booming with industry and was the home to an increasingly diverse population .With this rapid growth and constant change , social problems ensued , allowing society to become somewhat disorganized .In light of the social problems plaguing Chicago and its suburbs , Shaw and McKay studied the prevalent local crime and delinquency .Building on \" an ecological theory of urban dynamics , \" social disorganization theory aimed to explain the larger ratio of delinquency that occurred in certain Chicago neighborhoods ( Cantillon , Davidson , & Schweitzer , 2003 , p. 322 ) .Further , their study revealed that high rates of crime occur in those communities that exhibit declining populations and physical deterioration ( Jensen , 2003 ) .At its core , social disorganization theory focuses on the effects of location and location - specific characteristics as they relate to crime ( Mustaine , Tewksbury , & Stengel , 2006 ) .Neighborhoods lacking organization lack the necessary social controls and are unable to provide essential services .This leads to an inability of the community to control its public , which is why \" one way to define social disorganization is to view such places as unable to maintain public order through informal means \" ( Mustaine et al . , 2006 ,p. 332 ) .The absence of public order coupled with the problematic characteristics of disorganized communities - namely , poverty , population heterogeneity , and residential mobility - are strong predictors of high crime rates .The question then becomes : How effective is social disorganization theory in explaining criminal behavior ?There are five criteria used in evaluating theories , which demonstrate whether the theory makes sense in the simplest way of explaining crime and whether the theory is able to be tested to deliver true and valid results .In greater detail , each of the five criteria is applied to social disorganization theory as follows : .Logical consistency : Social disorganization theory makes sense ; its assumptions are logically consistent .Scope : While aiming to explain a broad range of phenomenon , the scope of social disorganization theory is an effective tool to be used in critical analysis of criminal behavior .Parsimony : Social disorganization theory is simple and easy to comprehend as demonstrated by the name of the theory itself .Testability : As seen with the early studies of Shaw and McKay as well as more recent efforts , it is clear that social disorganization theory is able to be tested and is not limited in its scientific value .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.55557"}

{"text": "How do these African immigrant men adapt into the US job market ?This question was examined through the analysis of the labor force participation and earnings .The guiding framework was the labor queue theory , which asserts that Whites have a net advantage in the American job market .The results show significant racial differences , but not completely in line with the labor queue assumptions .Throughout the four periods examined in this study , white African immigrant men were more likely to be in labor force than their black counterparts .However , in multivariate models , which controlled for the effects of other sociodemographic variables , the white advantage was only evident in 1980 .Black African immigrant men had a net labor force participation advantage over their white counterparts in subsequent periods ( 1990 - 2008 ) .What are the determinant factors of this change ?It is possible that the increase in the number of African immigrants in the United States has given the employers chance to become more acquainted with black African immigrants , thus reducing some racial and ethnic prejudices .However , without specific information on employers ' experiences with African immigrants , it is not possible to fully ascertain these changes in racial differences in labor force participation .While black African immigrant men are apparently gaining more access to the US labor market than their white counterparts , their human capital characteristics have not yet translated into fair earnings .Black African immigrant men continue to earn significantly less than their white counterparts with the same sociodemographic characteristics .The labor queue assumption of a white advantage is therefore confirmed in the case of earnings differences between black and white African immigrant men .Age , education , and English proficiency were positively and significantly associated with both the labor force participation and earnings .Such findings are consistent with previous research [ 47 , 48 ] and reveal the importance of work experience , skills , and linguistic knowledge as key factors of assimilation .Nonetheless , we uncovered a negative association between labor force participation and English ability in 2008 , suggesting less employment opportunities for immigrants with higher skills at the onset of the economic recession .As for marriage , this study showed that married men were more likely to be in the labor force and to earn higher income than unmarried ones , which is consistent with earlier results from socio - economic studies [ 43 , 49 ] .However , marriage has different mediating effects for white and black African immigrant men , when it comes to earnings .Marriage is associated with higher earnings for white African immigrant men , but lower earnings for black African immigrant men .This finding may explain the higher rate of dual - earning couples in black African immigrant families .The analysis of the interaction between school enrollment and race showed that enrollment was associated with negative employment and earnings for white African immigrant men , whereas it had positive effects on both variables for black African immigrant men .The positive effect of the school enrollment and race interaction terms suggests that black African immigrant men who were in school probably had to work to pay their tuitions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.85181"}

{"text": "Both scholars and policy makers approached the issue from a utilitarian perspective ; ethical issues and the rights of women were seldom ad- dressed .It is fortunate that research and debate during the United Nations Decade for Women focused on the question of equity for women in development , not simply participation by women in the development process .For women of Af- rican descent , this new focus helped solidify concerns about the relevance of many aspects of Western feminism .Official government delegates to the U.N. Decade Conference , who were interested in integration and participation of women within the nation - state , did not enter into dialogue , which suggested that subverting or undermining the patriarchal state was a legitimate goal of female victims of the state .Nonofficial delegates , however , wanted to examine all available options and to engage in discussions that would clarify their status and roles in the state and would prepare them to discuss revolutionary ideas .It is within this global context that the question of women within the hege- monic framework was discussed and the role of the nation - state in defining and maintaining cross - national oppression was addressed .The global feminist dia- logue that resulted aided the development of Africana feminism . '8 In this climate , feminist scholars of African descent began to collaborate and corroborate common themes and realities .They discovered that no matter where they were placed on the global battlefield , they were engaged in the same struggle and would likely benefit from combining their knowledge and resources .Out of this dialogue and common journey , the basic tenets of Africana feminism were formed .Those African American women representatives to the conference who were .from the academy were made aware by the dialogue that they should link Africana theory building to black studies and women 's studies programs .Rather than viewing black women as the common link between them , both groups saw them as appendages .Thus , in response to the failure of white women to confront their racism and the failure of black men to confront their sexism , black women 's studies was born .A decidedly nationalis- tic , middle - class bias characterized early black women 's studies programs .In fact , the failure of middle - class black women to confront their nationalist ori- entation and class biases led to the comparative and global approaches found in Africana women 's studies .The research , teaching , and discourse in this arena , along with African women 's experiences in the economic and political crisis of the 1980s , contributed significantly to Africana feminist theory building in America .The International Cross - Cultural Black Women 's Studies Summer Institute was among the groups that evolved during this period .Out of the research and discussion come resolutions that tran- scend regional and national boundaries .The women who participate in this work are formulating broad - based strate- gies to confront the global impact of racist / capitalist patriarchy .They are also suggesting that Africana feminism might be the concept under which a variety of global ideas and strategies may be subsumed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.41348"}

Wells to the women of the present , the refusal of black women to remain silent about sexualized violence was part of a long - standing tradition .Black women described and denounced their sexual misuse , deploying their voices as weapons in the wars against white supremacy .Indeed , their public protests often galvanized local , national , and even international outrage and sparked campaigns for racial justice and human dignity .When Betty Jean Owens spoke out against her assailants , and when the local black community mobilized in defense of her womanhood in 1959 , they joined in this tradition of testimony and protest .The arrest , trial , and conviction of Owens 's white rapists by an all - white jury marked a dramatic change in the relations between this tradition of testimony and a tradition of silence that Darlene Clark Hine has termed the \" culture of dissem - blance . \" 4 The verdict not only broke with southern tradition but fractured the philosophical and political foundations of white supremacy by challenging the relationship between sexual domination and racial inequality .For perhaps the first time since Reconstruction , southern black communities could imagine state power being deployed in defense of their respectability as men and women .As a result , the 1959 Tallahassee rape case was a watershed event that remains as revealing now as it was important then .The sexual exploitation of black women had its roots in slavery .Slave owners , overseers , and drivers took advantage of their positions of power and authority to rape slave women , sometimes in the presence of their husbands or families .White slave owners ' stolen access to black women 's bodies strengthened their political , social , and economic power , partly because colonial laws made the offspring of slave women the property of their masters .5 After the fall of slavery , when African Americans asserted their freedom during the interracial experiment in democracy that briefly characterized Reconstruction , former slaveholders and their sympathizers used violence and terror to reassert control over the social , political , and economic agency of freedpeople .At the heart of this violence , according to Gerda Lerner , rape became a \" weapon of terror \" to dominate the bodies and minds of African American men and women .\" Freedom , \" as Tera Hunter notes , \" was meaningless without ownership and control over one 's own body . \"During Reconstruction and Jim Crow , sexualized violence served as a \" ritualistic reenactment of the daily pattern of social dominance , \" and interracial rape became the battleground upon which black men and women fought for ownership of their own bodies .Many African American women who were raped or assaulted by white men fought back by speaking out .Four of the men raped Frances , while the other three choked and raped sixteen - year - old Lucy Smith and left her close to death .In 1871 , Harriet Simril testified in front of a congressional committee investigating Ku Klux Klan terror during Reconstruction that she was beaten and \" ravished \" by eight men in South Carolina who broke into her house to force her husband to \" join the democratic ticket . \" Essic Harris , appearing before the same committee , reported that \" the rape of black women was so frequent \" in the postbellum South that it had become \" an old saying by now .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.57857"}

' 'His daughter is named after the black woman who raised him and his brother , Mike .He is also currently President of City College in New York City .During his visit he stated that his decision to join the City College was influenced by its location , Harlem , and his affinity for the community .And when a white classmate asked how he identifies himself racially he stated , unequivocally , ' African American . 'Given everything Williams endures in ' Life On the Color Line ' it would seem antithetical that he would identify any other way .After reading the book the second time and hearing its author speak , what strikes me as crystal clear is that in spite of his father\u00bfs dysfunctional ways , and the trials and tribulations the author endured , his love for Buster was unconditional .Again , I have to disagree with A. D.

'The same type of education / age comparison used to measure the wage impact shows that a 10 percent increase in the size of a skill group reduced the fraction of native - born blacks in that group holding a job by 5.1 percentage points .Furthermore , these statistics reflect an economy that was not experiencing the persistent stagnation we are experiencing today .The country 's economic woes have disproportionately harmed African - Americans , especially those with little education .In 2011 , 24.6 percent of African - Americans without a high school diploma were unemployed , as were 15.5 percent of African - Americans with only a high school diploma .16 Two and half years into the economic recovery , African - Americans face particular difficulty obtaining employment .According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the seasonally adjusted January 2013 unemployment rate for all black Americans - not just those with few skills - was 13.8 percent , nearly twice the white unemployment rate of 7.0 percent .17 The economy has a glut of low - skilled workers , not a shortage .Not only do illegal immigrants compete for jobs with African - Americans , but that competition drives down wages for the jobs that are available .Harvard professor George Borjas writes : . 'Illegal immigration reduces the wages of native workers by an estimated $ 99 to $ 118 billion a year . . . .A theory - based framework predicts that the immigrants who entered the country from 1990 to 2010 reduced the average annual earnings of American workers by $ 1,396 in the short run .Because immigration ( legal and illegal ) increased the supply of workers unevenly , the impact varies across skill groups , with high school dropouts being the most negatively affected group .Immigration , both legal and illegal , resulted in a disproportionately large increase in the number of high school dropouts in the labor pool .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.35759"}

' 0 To suggest that \" chances \" for winning determined the level of support for the respective female candi- dates is actually an admission that feminist principles are conditional at best .While white feminists overwhelmingly supported Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas hearings , it is important to remember that her confronta- tion was with a black male , and the debate was framed as a gender - only issue .White women also used that situation to voice their outrage at their absence from the Senate .Subsequent to the hearings , white females focused on getting women elected .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.98547"}

'The same type of education / age comparison used to measure the wage impact shows that a 10 percent increase in the size of a skill group reduced the fraction of native - born blacks in that group holding a job by 5.1 percentage points .Furthermore , these statistics reflect an economy that was not experiencing the persistent stagnation we are experiencing today .The country 's economic woes have disproportionately harmed African - Americans , especially those with little education .In 2011 , 24.6 percent of African - Americans without a high school diploma were unemployed , as were 15.5 percent of African - Americans with only a high school diploma .16 Two and half years into the economic recovery , African - Americans face particular difficulty obtaining employment .According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the seasonally adjusted January 2013 unemployment rate for all black Americans - not just those with few skills - was 13.8 percent , nearly twice the white unemployment rate of 7.0 percent .17 The economy has a glut of low - skilled workers , not a shortage .Not only do illegal immigrants compete for jobs with African - Americans , but that competition drives down wages for the jobs that are available .Harvard professor George Borjas writes : .

African-and feminist - centered knowledge underpins a good deal of the current thinking in the field of black studies as well as black women 's studies .Asante and Asante point out that \" all . of the African people who participated in the mechanized interaction with Europe , and who colored the character of Europe while being shared them- selves , share a commonality . \"8 This commonality is referred to in the analyses of Rodgers - Rose and Collins.9 The conceptual core of Afrocentricity is an African - centered worldview .In matters of curricula , this means that African experience should be at the center of knowledge in the university .Black studies scholars locate the centrality of Africa in knowledge reconstruction .Closely related to knowledge reconstruction emerging out of black studies is that occurring in women 's studies .Minnich points out that the disciplinary canons in Western knowledge production systematically exclude women , who should be at its center . ' 0This parallels the argument in black studies , but both fields have tended to erase black women 's history . \"Black women intellectuals draw from both fields,12 given the double occlusion of Africanness and female- ness .Black Women Intellectuals , Research , and Knowledge in Sociology I would like to make the case for the transformation of knowledge and research in the academy by black women intellectuals through looking more closely at the field of sociology .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.434616"}

Fudge , Chair Congressional Black Caucus 2344 Rayburn House Office Building Washington , DC 20515 .Dear Chairman Fudge : .We write in our individual capacities as three members of the eight - member U.S. Commission on Civil Rights , and not on behalf of the Commission as a whole .In light of recent debates on comprehensive immigration reform , we are writing to address a rarely - discussed effect of granting legal status or effective amnesty to illegal immigrants .Such grant of legal status will likely disproportionately harm lower - skilled African - Americans by making it more difficult for them to obtain employment and depressing their wages when they do obtain employment .The increased employment difficulties will likely have negative consequences that extend far beyond economics .In 2008 , the Commission held a briefing regarding the impact of illegal immigration on the wages and employment opportunities of African - Americans . 1 The testimony at the briefing indicated that illegal immigration disproportionately impacts the wages and employment opportunities of African - American men .The briefing witnesses , well - regarded scholars from leading universities and independent groups , were ideologically diverse .All the witnesses acknowledged that illegal immigration has a negative impact on black employment , both in terms of employment opportunities and wages .The witnesses differed on the extent of that impact , but every witness agreed that illegal immigration has a discernible negative effect on black employment .For example , Professor Gordon Hanson 's research showed that \" Immigration . . .accounts for about 40 percent of the 18 percentage point decline [ from 1960 - 2000 ] in black employment rates . \" 4 Professor Gerald Jaynes 's research found that illegal immigrants had displaced U.S. citizens in industries that had traditionally employed large numbers of African - Americans , such as meatpacking .Illegal immigration has a disparate impact on African - American men because these men are disproportionately represented in the low - skilled labor force .The Census Bureau released a new report on educational attainment after the Commission issued its report .This report , released in February 2012 , found that 50.9 percent of native - born blacks had not continued their education beyond high school .6 The same report found that 75.5 percent of foreign - born Hispanics had not been educated beyond high school , although it does not disaggregate foreign - born Hispanics who are legal immigrants from those who are illegal immigrants . 7", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.936844"}

{"text": "For the period of 1980 - 2008 , the majority of white male African immigrants came from Egypt , South Africa , and Morocco , whereas most black male African immigrants came from Nigeria , Ethiopia , and Ghana .This increase in number of African immigrants has led to the insurgence of immigration studies in recent decades .Most studies based on the 1980 - 1990 census data revealed a significant racial effect on both employment opportunity and earnings .Analyzing the 1990 census data , Djamba [ 8 ] found that African immigrants ' chance of employment in the United States depends greatly on their racial fitness .Even when their human capital factors were taken into account , white African immigrant men had a significant labor market participation advantage over black African immigrant men , black immigrant men from South America , and African American men .This white African immigrants ' advantage was also found in a study on socioeconomic patterns of Africans in the United States .Using the 1990 US census data , Kollehlon and Eule found that white African men and men from English - speaking Africa had higher net hourly earnings than their nonwhite and non - English - speaking counterparts [ 9 ] .How much has changed since then ?Is the white advantage still relevant today ?Certainly , all new arrivals encounter difficulties in integrating into the new labor market , finding employment that is suitable to their professional qualifications , and attaining adequate economic returns [ 10 , 11 ] .These challenges are explained by restricted access to information [ 12 ] , limited acquaintance with the host society , including language proficiency [ 13 , 14 ] , lack of personal contact [ 15 ] , and racial bias .But , as these new immigrants stay longer in their host country , the economic cost of immigration and some of the obstacles outlined above are expected to diminish .Some studies have noted the variations among groups in terms of the economic cost of immigration [ 16 ] .Others have pointed to the country of origin as indicative of sociocultural resources and specific structural and ecological factors that may either hinder or enhance socioeconomic achievement in the host country [ 17 ] .Variations in economic outcomes among different foreign - born groups also derive from the treatment and sympathy the groups receive from the host country [ 18 ] .Further arguments have cited geographic areas into which the immigrants settle as playing an important role in affecting occupational and earning outcomes by exposing the immigrants to distinctive labor market conditions and opportunities [ 14 ] .This study extends previous research by examining the changing influence of race on the employment status and earnings of African immigrant men in the United States between 1980 and 2008 .Due to gender segregation , nature of employment , and earnings , we focus only on men in this study and examine the situation of women in a separate article .Theoretical Perspectives and Research Hypotheses .While the study of migration has become a major focus in social research , there have been only relatively few studies on African immigration to the United States .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.81269"}

Jeffries .Jeffries denied Johnson and other African American boxers a shot at his title and he retired undefeated in 1904 .Nevertheless , Johnson 's reputation as a skilled ring tactician continued to grow as he defeated both black and white boxers .Finally , in 1908 , Johnson fought a white champion Tommy Burns in Australia for $ 30,000 , then the highest purse in boxing history .Johnson knocked out Burns in the 14th round to become the first African American heavyweight champion of the world .Johnson 's capture of the title initiated a search among white promoters for a \" great white hope \" to defeat the black champion and reclaim the title for white America .They eventually lured Jim Jeffries out of retirement to face Johnson .On July 4 , 1910 , in what would be billed as the \" Battle of the Century , \" Johnson finally fought and beat Jeffries in Reno , Nevada to retain his title .Newspapers warned Johnson and his supporters against gloating over the victory .Nonetheless , scores of African Americans and some whites died as a result of the race rioting that broke out in cities across the nation in response to Johnson 's victory .In fear of more race riots , the Texas legislature banned all films showing the black fighter 's wins over any of his white opponents .Johnson also attracted considerable condemnation because of his unabashed sexual relationships with numerous white women .In 1913 , Johnson fled the United States because federal officials charged him with violating the Mann Act , which prohibited the transportation of women across state lines for prostitution , debauchery , or immoral acts .While in exile in Cuba , Johnson lost his title in 1914 to little known white boxer Jess Willard .Failing to get other matches abroad , Johnson returned to the U.S. in 1920 to surrender to Federal authorities .He was tried and convicted for violation of the Mann Act and sentenced to a year and a day in the Federal penitentiary at Leavenworth , Kansas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.89458"}

{"text": "This educational classification is preferred to that of level of schooling ( e.g. , primary , secondary , and higher ) because of differences in meaning across countries .We also included the school enrollment variable to control for the impact of the enrollment status on labor force participation and earnings .Although the IPUMS data do not include visa status information , the school enrollment variable can serve as a proxy to legal employment authorization if one assumes that many students - particularly foreign - born ones - may not be allowed to work in the United States .English proficiency is an important variable of employment and overall integration into the American society .Chiswick [ 37 ] and Borjas [ 38 ] both argue that command of English can represent a large difference in earnings .This variable has the following categories : speaks only English : very good , good , not good .Other important variables included in this study are sex and marital status .But due to sex differences in age of entry into labor force and other cultural meanings that may be associated with gender , we focus only on men in this study and will examine the women 's situation in a separate study .Also of interest are duration of immigration and place of residence in the United States .Duration of immigration was constructed to test the assumption that immigrants tend to complete their integration / assimilation process within 10 - 15 years [ 39 ] .Further , Chiswick [ 10 ] mentions that as time passes in the host country , immigrants acquire knowledge of customs and language relevant to jobs .This argument suggests that the longer an immigrant is in the United States , the greater the chances of participating in the labor force and earning a higher wage .The residence variable was used to control for possible geographic effects which may increase or otherwise decrease the likelihood of entering into the labor force and of earning an income as a result of available local market opportunities .Following the classification used in previous research [ 40 ] and the U.S. Census Bureau 's definition [ 41 ] , four regions are defined in this study : northeast , midwest , south , and west .Given the higher percentage of native black population in the South , it is expected that the majority of black African immigrant men will reside in that region .But , because of historical racial discrimination , black African immigrant men 's prospects for labor force participation and earnings may be lower in the south than elsewhere in the nation .Analytical Procedures .Two types of analyses were performed : descriptive and multivariate .In the descriptive section , we examined the changes in the size and composition of the African immigrant male population , and their sociodemographic characteristics during the four periods considered in this study .The bivariate differences in labor force participation and average earnings were also analyzed .The multivariate section focused on the racial differences in labor force participation and earnings , controlling for the effects of the sociodemographic variables .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.94256"}

{"text": "Education and age were positively and significantly associated with earnings .Clearly , education is a key positive factor of earnings .During all four periods examined here , more educated men earned substantially more than less educated ones .The positive association between age and earnings suggests that work experience translates into higher income .Marriage was also associated with higher earnings for African immigrant men in general .However , when interaction between race and marital status was included in the regression equation , we found that the positive effect of marriage is mostly for white African immigrant men .For black African immigrant men , being married actually meant having lower personal earnings .This explains probably why black African immigrant men earn significantly more than white African immigrant men [ 46 ] .School enrollment was negatively associated with earnings in general .Yet , the analysis of the interaction effect between race and school enrollment showed that black African immigrant men who were in school earned higher income than their white counterparts with the same school enrollment status .Unlike labor force participation , earning is negatively associated with the duration of immigration in the United States .In terms of language , the results in Table 4 show that men 's linguistic skills were positively associated with earnings during all the four periods considered here .The effect of region of residence shifted over time .In 1980 , there was no significant difference in earnings between those African immigrant men who resided in the west and those in the south ( reference category ) .In contrast , those immigrants who lived in the northeast and the midwest earned significantly more income than those in the south .In 1990 , the northeast and the west residents earned significantly more , while the midwest residents earned significantly less than the south residents .In 2000 , African immigrant men who lived in the south earned less than their counterparts who were living elsewhere in the country .The top earners during that year were those in the west followed by the midwest and then the northeast residents .The west region residents kept their earnings advantage even in 2008 .During that year , the residents in the northeast earned significantly more than both the midwest and the south residents , but less than the west residents .These results show that race remains a determinant factor of earnings for African immigrant men in the United States .Even after controlling for the impact of human capital variables such as education , age , marital status , duration of immigration , English proficiency , and region of residence , white African immigrant men earned significantly more than black African immigrant men .Conclusion .The study of race and migration is interesting as it offers an important way to look at the assimilation of foreign - born populations in the United States .This study highlights the changes in size and composition of the male African immigrant population in the United States during the periods of 1980 - 2008 , and differences in the labor force participation and earnings between black and white African immigrant men aged 16 - 64 years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.88179"}

Ferguson , 163 U.S. 537 ( 1896 ) .However , in the landmark case , Brown v. Board of Education , 347 U.S. 483 ( 1954 ) , the Supreme Court overruled Plessy and forbad state and local governments from practicing racial segregation .Despite this legal change , some public schools today are more racially segregated today than when Brown was decided in 1954 .School segregation even increased in the 1990s .( Jeffrey Rosen , \" The Lost Promise of School Integration \" , New York Times , April 2 , 2000 , A1 , 5 . )As the 2000 map of school segregation below illustrates , black / white segregation is highest in counties with high black populations .( Compare with the 2000 census map of the distribution of blacks in the United States . )Why has the law failed to undo the segregation that was originally caused by the law ?The most obvious reason is that racial segregation of neighborhoods remains the norm in the U.S. , as demonstrated in the city maps on this site .To the extent students attend neighborhood schools , they are likely to have few classmates of other races .But the courts , too , have played a role - initially by acquiescing in state resistance to desegregation , more recently by attacking the tools states use to achieve integration .A couple of months prior to the August 28th March on Washington , King spoke at a massive rally of hundreds of thousands in Detroit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.59206"}

Zeef , has made an in - depth study of this history -- which I shall only briefly synopsize here ... .For at least a thousand years , the dormant beast seems to have been kept in a hidden underground city in England -- whose strange inhabitants ultimately degenerated into cannibalism .From there , the beast was forcibly taken by a certain pre - Christian religious sect , which transported it to the USA -- carrying it underwater through the Atlantic with the aide of a peculiar , blob - like aquatic creature which I am personally unfamiliar with .The Jrumiglior came to reside in a small fishing town in Massachussets , where -- over generations -- the townsfolk have lost their humanity , due to interbreeding with a species distantly related to the Forg .The last definite location of the Jrumiglior was in New England .A renowned \" wizard \" stole the beast from the misceginated forg / humans , and concealed it beneath his farmhouse dwelling .Due to an unrelated tragedy , the estate burned down -- and during the fire the animal was temporarily reawakened .This is where the historical record ends .The Jrumiglior 's current location is uncertain -- but humankind has reason to be fearful .Recent re - interpretations of the Australian texts have shed new light on the creature 's distant origins -- and its possible future .References are made to an unknown species living outside of our solar system .Their name , roughly translated : \" The Contributors .\"Apparently Contributors use the Jrumiglior as a midwife to their own young .The beast is mechanically split open and thousands of fertilized eggs are implanted in its central body cavity .The Contributors telepathically imprint programming into the Jrumiglior 's nervous system , and then send it out through space to colonize other planets .When the programming is triggered , the animal deposits the Contributors ' eggs in their new habitat .Certain secretions from its body jump - start the maturation process , and soon the eggs begin to hatch .Thus , the Jrumiglior serves first as a protective vessel for Contributor eggs -- and then later , when the eggs are exposed and vulnerable , as a ferocious guardian .From what we can decipher , the trigger which causes the Jrumiglior to deposit the eggs is some sort of alignment of the stars .During the past year there have been rumors of the Jrumiglior being sighted awake and active near Mt. Etna -- an Italian volcano which is currently erupting .My contacts report that a large centipede - like creature has been spotted emerging from freshly hewn lava tubes ...And that it has been seen on the horizon against a sky of fire , looking up -- as if waiting expectantly for some sign .I for one am profoundly disturbed by the implications .If this creature is indeed the Jrumiglior and it finally enacts its intended purpose , then the extinction of native life on Earth may very soon come to pass .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.346725"}

'[ pdf ] looks at figures for ' intentional deaths ' throughout continental Europe and juxtaposes them with the U.S. to show that more gun control does not necessarily lead to lower death rates or violent crime . \"Because the findings so clearly demonstrate that more gun laws may in fact increase death rates , the study says that ' the mantra that more guns mean more deaths and that fewer guns , therefore , mean fewer deaths ' is wrong .For example , when the study shows numbers for Eastern European gun ownership and corresponding murder rates , it is readily apparent that less guns to do not mean less death .In Russia , where the rate of gun ownership is 4,000 per 100,000 inhabitants , the murder rate was 20.52 per 100,000 in 2002 .That same year in Finland , where the rater of gun ownership is exceedingly higher - 39,000 per 100,000 - the murder rate was almost nill , at 1.98 per 100,000 .... . \"And when the study focuses on intentional deaths by looking at the U.S. vs Continental Europe , the findings are no less revealing .The U.S. , which is so often labeled as the most violent nation in the world by gun control proponents , comes in 7th - behind Russia , Estonia , Lativa , Lithuania , Belarus , and the Ukraine - in murders .America also only ranks 22nd in suicides .The murder rate in Russia , where handguns are banned , is 30.6 ; the rate in the U.S. is 7.8 .... \" . oops .so , the official gun ownership rate in russia is low .could there be a large cache of illegal guns out there ? still - much higher homicide rates in eastern europe than in western .A second misconception about the relationship between firearms and violence attributes Europe 's generally low homicide rates to stringent gun control .For instance , virtually the only English gun control during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was the practice that police patrolled without guns .During this period gun control prevailed far less in England or Europe than in certain American states which nevertheless had - and continue to have - murder rates that were and are comparatively very high .... .Professor Malcolm 's study of English gun law and violent crime summarizes that nation 's nineteenth and twentieth century experience as follows : . \" ' The peacefulness England used to enjoy was not the result of strict gun laws .When it had no firearms restrictions [ nineteenth and early twentieth century ] England had little violent crime , while the present extraordinarily stringent gun controls have not stopped the increase in violence or even the increase in armed violence . \" ' Armed crime , never a problem in England , has now become one .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.37958"}
