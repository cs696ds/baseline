Bissell , the deputy director for plans in 1961 .The doctrine of \" plausible deniability \" is not supposed to lead to a situation where a president is kept unaware of the consequences of his decisions .Yet , on the basis of his interviews with Esterline and Hawkins , Bohning makes a convincing case that Bissell lied up and down the chain of command , as if only he needed to know .If Bohning ' s history has a flaw , it is in his larger depiction of certain events .He gives short shrift to the primary reason why the Soviet Union implanted missiles in Cuba .Nikita Khrushchev could have turned Cuba into an island bristling with conventional weaponry if his main impulse was to foil Operation MONGOOSE and/or prevent another invasion ( which Washington had no intention of mounting absent a good - size revolt ) .Instead , the Soviet premier sought to redress , in one swift and surreptitious deployment , a serious imbalance in the nuclear balance of terror .And since the subtext of Bohning ' s book is intelligence - agency blunders , why not point out that the missile deployment represented a monumental intelligence failure on Havana ' s part ( not to mention Moscow ' s ) ?Nothing before or since has put Castro ' s revolution at such risk .Bohning also shies away from some new interpretations he might have offered based on the evidence he presents .Since the mid-1970s , for example , it has been a cliche to speak of the Kennedys ' vendetta against Castro .But as new biographies and histories have shown , President Kennedy , while reckless in some aspects of his life , was anything but when it came to Cold War hot spots such as Berlin and Cuba .He consistently tried to defuse , if not avoid altogether , situations where the superpowers were pitted directly against one another .JFK can not be absolved of responsibility for what was undertaken during his administration , but fixations do not seem to have been his style .\" Europeans think we are slightly demented on the subject of Castro , \" he commented , in a typically detached remark during the missile crisis .The obsession with Castro that Bohning writes of radiated from Robert Kennedy , as one episode vividly illustrates .According to Bohning ' s interview with a Cuban exile prominent in the CIA ' s covert war , after the island had been quarantined , the attorney general personally advised the exile to provoke an incident that might spark a war .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.43974"}

Beschloss 's initial volume on the Johnson recordings .The first minutes of this telephone conversation between Johnson and his mentor , Senator Richard B.

{"text": "Cowriters , JFK Santa Monica , California .On March 1 , 1967 , New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison arrested a prominent local businessman named Clay Shaw and charged him with master - minding the crime of the century : the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy .It was a bizarre and groundless accusation by a supremely ambitious prosecutor , but Shaw was not its only victim .This terrible miscarriage of justice was to have immense , if largely unappreciated , consequences for the political culture of the United States .Of all the legacies of the 1960s , none has been more unambiguously negative than the American public 's corrosive cynicism toward the federal government .Although that attitude is commonly traced to the disillusioning experiences of Vietnam and Watergate , its genesis lies in the aftermath of JFK ' s assassination .Well before anti - war protests were common , lingering dissatisfaction with the official verdict that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone broadened into a widespread conviction that the federal government was incompetent or suppressing the truth or , in the worst case , covering up its own complicity in the assassination .Today , national polls consistently show that a vast majority of Americans ( upward of 75 percent ) do not accept that Oswald alone killed President Kennedy .Many also believe that a co - conspirator lurked in Washington , with the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) always the prime suspect .No individual was more responsible for fomenting these beliefs than Shaw ' s nemesis , Jim Garrison .His audacity and lack of scruple were breathtaking , though camouflaged by lean good looks that made Garrison appear like a prosecutor ordered up by central casting .Not since Senator Joseph McCarthy had America seen such a cunning demagogue .Initially , Garrison explained that , in indicting Shaw , he was only assuming an unsought , even unwanted , burden .The federal government ' s bungling of the case left an honest prosecutor no other choice , he asserted .Soon that rationale was replaced by a far darker fable .Within two months of Shaw ' s arrest , Garrison began articulating a truly radical critique that challenged not only the veracity of the Warren Report but the federal government ' s very legitimacy .Ultimately , he would claim that the people ' s elected leader had been removed in a CIA - led mutiny , and that the plotters had been allowed to walk away unscathed .As he wrote in his 1988 memoir , On the Trail of the Assassins , \" What happened at Dealey Plaza in Dallas on November 22 , 1963 , was a coup d ' \u00e9tat .I believe that it was instigated and planned long in advance by fanatical anticommunists in the United States intelligence community .\" The fact that a New Orleans jury delivered a resounding verdict of \" not guilty \" after Shaw ' s 1969 trial barely hindered Garrison ' s ability to market this myth of CIA complicity .He would argue that the \" validity \" of his investigation ought not to be judged on its technical , legal results .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.68507"}

{"text": "So I was faced with a dilemma that I have confronted numerous times in connection with my mother 's personal papers and correspondence .However , she also saved every scrap of paper that came her way - every birthday card or telegram , every letter from her parents , every date book and diary , every draft letter or memo she ever wrote .She knew that living in the White House was an enormous privilege and she was proud of the part she had played .Early on , when she discovered that one of her secretaries was throwing out notes and internal correspondence that chronicled both daily life and the official workings of the mansion , she wrote a steaming rebuke - directing everyone on her staff to save even the smallest scribbles .Her deep immersion in memoirs of the past informed her belief that she had an obligation to preserve everything that happened during her time in the White House .In the years since her death , I have asked myself the question , When does someone no longer belong to you , but belong to history ?Few people have been written about more than my mother , and I grew up feeling I needed to protect her - just as she had protected us .So at first I thought it best to leave these interviews sealed for another fifty years , rather than to expose her memory to one more round of gossip and speculation .But I also understand that the continuing interest in her life is a tribute to the immense admiration and goodwill she still commands , and I believe that open access to government is an important American value .Over the years , I have received multiple requests to publish my mother 's memos and correspondence .At times , it has been difficult to balance her wish for privacy against her public role and pay proper respect to both .Although I agonize over each request , I know that my mother trusted my judgment and felt that I understood her outlook on life .As the years pass , it has become less painful to share her with the world , and in fact , it is a privilege .As her child , it has sometimes been hard for me to reconcile that most people can identify my mother instantly , but they really do n't know her at all .They may have a sense of her style and her dignified persona , but they do n't always appreciate her intellectual curiosity , her sense of the ridiculous , her sense of adventure , or her unerring sense of what was right .These conversations are not in the same category as her personal writings , because they were recorded with the intention that they would be made accessible one day .So it was not a question of whether to publish but a question of when , and the decision was up to me .My experience with other requests informed my decision that the time was right .In reaching this conclusion , I found it helpful to remember the context in which the interviews were conducted , and the timing of when they occurred .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.7154"}

Martinez .Because of this appointment , New Jersey did not join in the lawsuits to overturn ObamaCare .Governor Christie appointed a radical \" sexologist \" to run the NJ Department of Children & Families .This appointee would later resign when it emerged that she had held the top job in an organization that had supported a study advocating the normalization of some forms of adult - child sex .His judicial appointments were also confusing .While claiming to oppose same - sex marriage , Governor Christie nominated an openly gay Republican to the state Supreme Court who supported it .Even Democrats would n't support this plainly unqualified appointment , and he never served .The Governor supported the advancement of a liberal Democrat to the job of Chief Justice , while refusing to support the re - appointment of a Republican and the Court 's most conservative member .He also appointed a controversial defense attorney who had defended a number of Islamic extremists who had violated immigration law .In 2013 , many of those in the Christian community opposed legislation that banned young people from receiving counseling and therapy to lead them away from homosexuality .As an ex - gay myself , I could have personally attested to the benefits of such counseling , much of which is no different than what is found in contemporary twelve - step programs .However , the Christian community opposing the ban was not afforded the opportunity to meet with the Governor .Only the homosexual community with its pro - ban agenda was given that benefit .I do n't blame the Governor for this , but I do blame his staff .As President Ronald Reagan said , \" personnel is policy , \" and Governor Christie 's choices in personnel have not advanced the policies he campaigned on , and often it was the direct opposite .New Jersey ended up being just the second state in the country that only allows young people to receive counseling that advocates homosexuality , but bans by law counseling that advocates heterosexuality .When he signed it into law , Governor Christie embraced the made - up \" science \" of the propagandists , when he cited un - specified \" research \" that \" sexual orientation is determined at birth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.17351"}

Peterson .Dr. Peterson is an English professor at the University of Maryland and the author of \" Black Gotham : A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth - Century New York City . \" a book now out in paperback from Yale University Press .What educational opportunities were available to children of the black members of the 19th - century middle class ?Did members of this group work to secure education opportunities for blacks who were not of the same socioeconomic standing ?-Sketco , Cleveland , OH . Q. .The article mentions black doctors and pharmacists in New York in the 1800s .Where did they receive their educations ?Were there any schools open to them or did they simply work in hospitals and watch what others were doing ?-Ed Schwab , Alexandria , VA . A. .In the 1790s the New York Manumission Society established several schools for black children .Its members maintained that education was a necessary component of freedom ( despite the fact that several of them were themselves slave owners ) .These schools were known as African Free Schools , the most famous of which was African Free School No . 2 located on Mulberry Street .This was the school that my great - great - grandfather attended along with several boys who later became prominent leaders of the city 's black community and also worked nationally with men like Frederick Douglass .Until the 1830s , when the city took over their management , these schools offered as good an education as that of other charity schools of the time , probably even better .Throughout this period , however , New York 's black leaders refused to stay on the sidelines when it came to educating their young .Since poor school attendance was a real problem ( how can you send your kids to school in the winter when they have no shoes or overcoats ? ) , black leaders visited homes to see how they could help out .They also established an educational society that set up its own schools , but few of them lasted due to lack of funds .Getting a higher education was equally difficult .James McCune Smith was denied entrance to U.S. medical schools , so he went to the University of Glasgow medical school ( graduating first in his class ! )My great - grandfather Philip Augustus White attended the College of Pharmacy of the City of New York , graduating in 1844 , even though professional certification in pharmacy was not required at the time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "139.87732"}
