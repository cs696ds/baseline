Chris Christie pressed him on his record and experience .It did n't take long for Rubio to become the target of Gov. Chris Christie .Rubio said that President Obama is taking drastic steps to change America for the worse , and that if elected ; he is going to re - embrace what makes this country great .It 's here that Gov. Christie said that he wakes up every morning thinking about ways to make New Jersey residents ' lives better , and that he 's held accountable for his actions .Se .Rubio , who he said he likes , does n't have that same level of accountability , being able to spin his way out of such standards through talking points .He also hit the freshman Florida senator over his absence in the Senate , especially concerning the Hezbollah sanctions act , calling it truancy not leadership .Rubio hit back by saying that Christie presides over a state whose credit rating has been downgraded nine times .Still , Rubio kept repeating most of his opening remarks ; the optics of which were not so good .When immigration was brought up , Sen. Cruz propose building a wall and tripling the amount of border patrol agents .He noted that once you 've secured the border , we could tackle our illegal immigration problem .On the wall Cruz added , \" I 've got someone in mind to build it , \" while looking at Trump .Rubio wants to expand the border patrol , have an entry / exit system to track the number of visa overstays , and have mandatory e - verify for businesses .Yet , the ghosts of the 2013 \" Gang of 8 \" bill reared its head , with Christie chiming in pushing the senator if he fought for his bill .Again , Christie noted that this is a difference between a governor and a legislator , touting his record in taking on the teachers unions - and winning the fight over tenure .The Democrats did n't shut down the government , and the tax increase was n't passed , because they knew , according to Christie , that he would fight for what he thinks is right for the state .Hot Air 's Mary Katharine Ham asked Donald Trump whether he was closer to Bernie Sanders than the conservative movement regarding health care policy , quoting the billionaire magnate for saying that everyone 's got to be covered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.7047"}

Chris Christie pressed him on his record and experience .It did n't take long for Rubio to become the target of Gov. Chris Christie .Rubio said that President Obama is taking drastic steps to change America for the worse , and that if elected ; he is going to re - embrace what makes this country great .It 's here that Gov. Christie said that he wakes up every morning thinking about ways to make New Jersey residents ' lives better , and that he 's held accountable for his actions .Se .Rubio , who he said he likes , does n't have that same level of accountability , being able to spin his way out of such standards through talking points .He also hit the freshman Florida senator over his absence in the Senate , especially concerning the Hezbollah sanctions act , calling it truancy not leadership .Rubio hit back by saying that Christie presides over a state whose credit rating has been downgraded nine times .Still , Rubio kept repeating most of his opening remarks ; the optics of which were not so good .When immigration was brought up , Sen. Cruz propose building a wall and tripling the amount of border patrol agents .He noted that once you 've secured the border , we could tackle our illegal immigration problem .On the wall Cruz added , \" I 've got someone in mind to build it , \" while looking at Trump .Rubio wants to expand the border patrol , have an entry / exit system to track the number of visa overstays , and have mandatory e - verify for businesses .Yet , the ghosts of the 2013 \" Gang of 8 \" bill reared its head , with Christie chiming in pushing the senator if he fought for his bill .Again , Christie noted that this is a difference between a governor and a legislator , touting his record in taking on the teachers unions - and winning the fight over tenure .The Democrats did n't shut down the government , and the tax increase was n't passed , because they knew , according to Christie , that he would fight for what he thinks is right for the state .Hot Air 's Mary Katharine Ham asked Donald Trump whether he was closer to Bernie Sanders than the conservative movement regarding health care policy , quoting the billionaire magnate for saying that everyone 's got to be covered .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.05986"}

McCain , Obama v.

{"text": "As had come to be expected in days prior , Mitt Romney took Florida easily last night over Newt Gingrich , who defiantly promised to press on for the forseeable future despite the struggling to win a state where he had a lead a week before the primary .Romney wins all of the state 's 50 delegates , which was cut by 50 % per Republican National Committee rules due to the Florida GOP holding its primary before March 6th ( Super Tuesday ) .Gingrich wins nothing and the momentum he had built after South Carolina has been squandered after a couple bad debate performances , particularly the one in Jacksonville last Thursday .So where is the race as it stands now ?It appears that Gingrich does n't have high hopes for the Nevada and Minnesota caucuses .You 'd have to expect Ron Paul to be a factor in both of those states , where his campaign directed its focus instead of competing Florida .However , Super Tuesday , which will include his home state of Georgia , may offer more to Gingrich .We 'll get a clearer picture of what to expect next month in the coming days as polling firms will no doubt provide us with plenty of numbers .Perhaps the most important number in the NBC - Marist poll was what happens when Santorum is removed from the race .Santorum 's vote splits off evenly if he 's removed , and Romney has an even WIDER lead over Gingrich , 49%-33 % .So , Gingrich ca n't make the argument that if conservatives were n't divided he would win .The numbers just do n't bear that out .What 's really interesting - Santorum probably could argue that if GINGRICH were n't in the race , he 'd have a better chance against Romney .Santorum 's image is as good as it 's been since the campaign began .That may be counterintuitive , but when you look at it , you 'd have to make a lot of assumptions about Santorum 's supporters .I suppose some of it makes sense , being that evangelical Christians make up a lot of Santorum 's support , voters that may have an issue with voting for a Mormon .And as much as I dislike diving into a candidate 's personal life , keep in mind that Gingrich 's has been married three times and has owned up to an affair .This is obviously going to be an issue to many religious - minded voters .We 'll see what happens after tonight , but Santorum can justify sticking around for the time being .Whether he 's able to gain traction before Super Tuesday is an entirely different story .I 'd never vote for the guy , but I think he may have another surge left in him before this is all said and done .While wondering around Facebook and Twitter yesterday , I saw quite a few of my conservative friends - proud members of the anti - Romney faction in the Republican Party - pointing to video from 2006 where then Massachusetts Gov.

Bush was elected on a platform for non interventionism and no nation building in 2000 .Cutting taxes , getting the government out of our hair , these were all things Bush campaigned on .Unfortunately , as we know , he did not follow through on these things ( nation building wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , massive stimulus spending , erosion of civil liberties through the patriot act ) .We got more of the same .Politicians telling us what they knew we wanted to hear : .The Liberty Movement began to take real form during the race for President in 2008 with the grassroots following that swelled up underneath Texas congressman Ron Paul .The grass roots tidal wave was so strong that his supporters ( not his official campaign ) organized mass donations in large collectives called money bombs .On Dec 16th 2007 Ron Paul 's campaign received an astounding $ 6 million and change ENTIRELY FROM THE GRASS ROOTS .To this day it is the largest single day haul from any campaign .They also rented a blimp that flew up and down the East coast , something that also had never been done in a presidential campaign , and something that was not organized by the campaign itself but by the grass roots supporters alone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "125.83421"}

{"text": "\"[ This case ] may affect the federal government 's defense of federal legislation and policies related to Puerto Rico across a broad range of substantive areas , including congressional representation , federal benefits , federal income taxes , bankruptcy , and defense . \"The Puerto Rican courts dismissed the charges , but local prosecutors successfully appealed to the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals on grounds that the federal and local charges were charged under distinct sovereigns and the two men should be prosecuted in both jurisdictions .The Puerto Rico Supreme Court agreed to hear the dispute in both cases and consolidated them .\" It is hard to overstate the legal , practical , and political implications of [ the Puerto Rico Supreme Court 's decision ] , \" the lawyers wrote .\" It strips Puerto Rico of the ability to enforce its own criminal laws without federal interference . \"Unlike states and Native American tribes - which have their own inherent sovereignty under the Constitution - Puerto Rico is a territory , as it has been since the United States seized it from Spain in 1898 .Some have argued that the island gained a level of sovereignty when it adopted its own constitution in 1952 , making it something between a state and a territory .Others contend that any powers Puerto Rico 's government has must come from the US Congress , and therefore it is not sovereign .This tension is at the heart of the statehood debate that has raged for decades in Puerto Rico , and the court 's decision will have a lasting impact in determining Puerto Rico 's actual political status .\" That 's one of the central political issues here . \"Rivera explains that the political divisions that drive Puerto Rican politics hinge on the island 's status .On one side , statehood advocates argue that only statehood will give Puerto Rico parity in the eyes of the US Congress .On the other side , those who favor a version of the status quo want to maintain the semi - autonomy that exists today .A small minority advocate full independence .If the court rules that Puerto Rico is not a sovereign entity , and that its power derives from the US Congress and not from the Puerto Rican people , then the argument in favor of the status quo will suffer a major blow , Rivera says .Arguments for maintaining the commonwealth status have already been undercut by the island 's current economic disaster and massive emigration problem , which stem in part from the inequities it suffers under its territorial status .Their argument that Puerto Rico enjoys privileges beyond those of a US territory would receive another big blow if the Supreme Court ruled against them , making statehood ( or full independence ) a more attractive option to bring the island a degree of stability . \" As a practical matter , any statement the Court makes suggesting something beyond territorial status for Puerto Rico ... is fraught with potential political ramifications .\" Rivera , the law professor at the University of Puerto Rico , says the court 's decision will be parsed in a million different ways by the island 's political class and manipulated in support of a variety of arguments related to statehood , independence , or status quo .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "150.84827"}
