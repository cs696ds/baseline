{"text": "Labour 's present support for cuts to public services and condemnation of public - sector workers who resist is just part of a longer story .Once elected , small radical parties can make a difference , as pressure from the Left shifts the political centre - indeed , some historians argue that this was a major reason for the creation of the welfare state in the post - war era .Similarly , radical MPs can use their position to speak out about human rights abuses against movement participants , highlight information about potentially damaging plans by government , and attempt to shame other parties into accepting progressive reforms or amendments - all roles that Caroline Lucas plays at present .A word of warning .But all of this comes with a warning : small leftwing parties often do n't last long in parliament .As movement activists become parliamentarians , the mass support can fall away as attention begins to centre around process and minutiae , meaning it is difficult to mobilize support for re - election .Worse still , one - time progressives can lose sight of the bigger picture and see fit to support unconscionable policies in return for minor concessions , as demonstrated by the Irish Green Party 's disastrous spell from 2007 - 11 as junior coalition partners to the rightwing Fianna F\u00e1il .On occasion , one - time radicals have found themselves condemning direct action , as Green Party London Assembly Member Jenny Jones did following the student occupation of Conservative Party headquarters in 2010 ( she later apologized ) .But worst of all , political parties - whether Labour , Green or otherwise - can serve to subvert radical movements once elected and steer them towards exclusively reformist ends .If an elected Green Party sees the role of a movement as being only to provide potential supporters for their work within the system , they will have a short political life .The best way of ensuring support at election time is to support the movements on the streets all year round .The Green Party has more than doubled its membership in the last 10 years , to 12,000 across England and Wales .Yet this is still less than the number of voters that would be needed to win a single constituency .Compare that to the 500,000 people who attended the last major march against cuts , or the millions being hurt by the current government 's policies , and the challenge becomes clear .If the Green Party focuses exclusively on electoral campaigning , as some branches would wish , it faces a pathway to oblivion .If it focuses entirely on broader movement work , the unique role that the party can play is lost .But if the Greens can provide a voice inside debating chambers for a growing movement outside , the party has a bright future indeed .Interesting stuff , especially about the ways in which minority radical politicians have influenced things in the past .You go a bit over the top when you suggests that the GP 's electoral success almost exclusively grows out of participation in broader movements .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.87112"}

{"text": "Focus on Gross Trade .I recently argued that the inexorable rebalancing of current large trade deficits is a lengthy , structural process ( not merely cyclical ) that requires global cooperation to put into place a credible fiscal and monetary plan to bring down deficits in an orderly fashion .The continuing absence of such a plan further hampers global economic growth .It has also prompted pressure from citizens for quick fixes - for instance , national protectionist policies .Why such a path is so troubling and must be vigorously avoided is my focus here .As we already know , the countries with a current account surplus ( Figure 1 ) must also be those with exports in excess of imports ( Figure 2 ) .Note how the range of imbalances among these nations has widened dramatically in recent decades , an obviously unsustainable path .Which of our select eight countries are the drivers of this widening path ?From Figure 2 , we can see that Switzerland , Germany , and China currently enjoy the largest net trade surpluses , while the United States , the United Kingdom , and Spain have the largest net deficits .The magnitude of trade deficits matters because , as we also know , a country with an ongoing trade deficit is , by definition , reducing its foreign assets or borrowing .Not so well understood is that global trade patterns are financed by gross asset flows , not net asset flows .Thus , a country must have sufficient gross foreign assets to finance any trade imbalance on an ongoing basis .Indeed , these gross asset financial flows grease the skids of global trade .Practically speaking , trade deficits must be paid for by either selling down gross assets or increasing gross liabilities by selling debt .To properly frame the importance of trade imbalances , let us now consider a somewhat different representation that adds exports and imports together instead of netting trade .As Figure 3 shows strikingly , the countries shown in Figure 2 with the largest cumulative current account surpluses ( Switzerland , Germany , and China ) also tend to depend mightily on total trade ( imports plus exports ) for their overall economy .Note that total trade in 2010 accounts for a stunning 100 % of GDP in both Germany and Switzerland and about 55 % of GDP in China .Total trade also now accounts for a large portion of the GDP of many deficit countries - for example , around two - thirds of GDP in the United Kingdom and Spain .Interestingly , total trade accounts for only about 25 % of GDP in the United States , a large debtor country .Viewed in the context of the weighty importance of total trade to their economic well - being , major trading partners will recognize that it is in their best interests to ensure that resource allocation flows relatively smoothly .Such a \" consenting adults \" relationship suggests that surplus countries provide funding to their trading partners to avoid risking an abrupt reversal or sudden stop in an economy and financial markets that propagates globally .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.62422"}

{"text": "To paraphrase Gary Young who put it so eloquently earlier this week in a Guardian piece , if you build a 10 foot fence and put food on one side , the hungry will build an eleven foot ladder .Nowhere in the immigration debate do we see proper recognition of the fact that it is economic inequality that drives the vast majority of migration - except from the Green Party .I want to debunk once and for all the myth that people can not access decent housing , for example , because of high levels of immigration .There is not enough high quality social housing because the govt has failed to invest sufficiently - and it is cowardly to use the immigration debate as a way of masking this fact .The same principle applies when it comes to jobs .This is not to deny the experiences of the many people living in Britain today without work or a decent home .But we fail them just as much as we fail the immigrant communities that contribute so much to our culture and our economy by refusing to face up to the underlying problems .The far right is taking advantage of the lack of a proper honest debate on immigration .By failing to live up to their promises on fairness , the big 3 political parties are letting it happen .The Greens want a very different approach - a system that is fair and consistent , does not break up families , upholds the right to sanctuary and judges each case on its merits .A system that does not detain children and protects the large numbers of people living in the UK whose status is not defined .And above all we want immigration policies that are set in a context of tackling the poverty and inequality that prompt people to take the huge and daunting step of leaving their homes and familes to come to Britain .Whoever wins this election , we can expect to see a continuation of the inhumane policies that trigged the hunger strike at Yarl 's Wood detention centre and led to the recent suicide of a family of three people in Glasgow .None of the mainstream political parties offer any genuine opposition to the extreme - right views of groups such as the BNP .It makes little sense to expect those who are carrying out horrific repression against immigrants right now , to meaningfully oppose the people who dream of being able to attack immigrants one day .Focusing on small , marginalised fascist groups like the BNP , however , does not address the issue as to how we challenge anti - immigrant prejudice widespread throughout the rest of British society .It would be counter - productive to write all these people off as Nazis .Many British workers fear immigrant labour to be a threat to their own living standards .They are also not going to be won over by abstract arguments concerning individuals ' rights or freedom of movement .Employers do frequently take advantage of the more temporary nature of jobs that migrant workers take on , migrant workers can also often be bullied into working in worse conditions than most British workers would accept and they can be threatened with deportation when they try to organise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.32996"}

{"text": "After the Postsecular .Call it a revival , of sorts .In recent years , anyone interested in contemporary European philosophy has noticed a tendency variously called the religious or theological \" turn \" ( adapting a formulation previously used to describe the \" linguistic turn \" of the 1960s and ' 70s ) .Thinkers have revisited scriptural texts , for example , or traced the logic of seemingly secular concepts , such as political sovereignty , back to their moorings in theology .The list of figures involved would include Emmanuel Levinas , Jacques Derrida , Gianni Vattimo , Alain Badiou , Giorgio Agamben , Slavoj \u00c5\u00bdi\u00c5\u00beek , and J\u00fcrgen Habermas -- to give a list no longer or more heterogenous than that .A sampling of recent work done in the wake of this turn can be found in After the Postsecular and the Postmodern : New Essays in Continental Philosophy of Religion , a collection just issued by Cambridge Scholars Publishing [ 2 ] .One of the editors , Anthony Paul Smith , is a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Nottingham and also a research fellow at the Institute for Nature and Culture at DePaul University .The other , Daniel Whistler , is a tutor at the University of Oxford , where he just submitted a dissertation on F.W.J. Schelling 's theology of language .I interviewed them about their book by e - mail .A transcript of the discussion follows .Q : Let 's start with one word in your title -- \" postsecular .\" What do you mean by this ?People used to spend an awful lot of energy trying to determine just when modernity ended and postmodernity began .Does \" postsecularity \" imply any periodization ?APS : In the book we talk about the postsecular event , an obvious nod to the philosophy of Alain Badiou .For a long time in Europe and through its colonial activities our frame of discourse , the way we understood the relationship of politics and religion , was determined by the notion that there is a split between public politics and private religion .This frame of reference broke down .We can locate that break , for the sake of simplicity , in the anti - colonial struggles of the latter half of the 20th century .The most famous example is , of course , the initial thrust of the Iranian Revolution .Their critique was simple : the secular is not neutral .Philosophy is intrinsically biased towards the secular .If you follow people like Asad and Tomoko Masuzawa , this means it is biased toward a Christian conception of the secular , and this hinders it from appreciating the thought structures at work in particular religions .So , the question is : What does philosophy of religion do now , after the postsecular critique ?DJW : There are two other reasons we speak of this volume being situated after the postsecular .First , in our \" Introduction \" we distinguish between a genuine postsecular critique of the kind Anthony mentions and a problematic theological appropriation of this critique .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.56731"}

{"text": "David , sorry for the long post : . 1 ) Your points about the economic activity of migrants having a net positive impact on overall wealth are similar to those used by the CBI .They are accurate in the sense that anyone who comes to the country to work rather than claim unemployment benefits \" contributes \" more than they \" take . \"A report from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee in 2007/8 found that \" immigration has had a small negative impact on the lowest - paid workers in the UK , and a small positive impact on the earnings of higher - paid workers . \" The report also points out people from ethnic minorities are part of the group affected negatively .I fully agree that measures to \" socialise \" immigrants such as trade union recruitment might mitigate some of the downward pressure on wages associated with immigration .However , I think wages and conditions will continue to be undermined for as long as there is significant immigration .After all , the main competitive advantage that newly arrived workers have over those resident here is their willingness to accept inferior pay and conditions .Immigrant workers in certain occupations are always likely to accept the minimum offer made by employers , leading to a race to the bottom and making it hard for other workers to demand anything higher .We can attribute that to low regulation , anti - union laws and other neoliberal measures .( Of course , neoliberals like Digby Jones tend to be in favour of high levels of immigration . ) 2 ) You are right that \" mildly social democratic reform \" could transform the lives of working people in the UK , but even this mild reform depends on the ability of an organised working class movement to push for it .The question is : how do we build a movement that can win these reforms ?The first step must be to convince working class people that we take their concerns seriously and can propose achievable solutions .If people see positive results on issues of immediate concern , they are more likely to put their faith in progressive solutions to \" bigger problems \" such as the distribution of resources , the running of public services etc .If we are seen to ignore or give insufficient attention to people 's immediate concerns , we should n't be surprised if they continue to regard us as irrelevant .At the moment , immigration comes out as one of the top three concerns expressed by voters .Prior to the recession , it occasionally came second or even first .As I wrote in my article , concerns about immigration are most often expressed in terms of social grievances .In your first response to my article , you suggested that the Left 's answer to these concerns was to propose wealth redistribution .You did n't flesh this out much in your next post , but again hinted at \" incremental \" and \" marginal \" reforms .Lets imagine that we are canvassing in a working class area on behalf of some newly formed Left group .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.70758"}

{"text": "It is quite normal to attend a keynote lecture at a Continental philosophy of religion conference and end up listening to a theology lecture !This is the reason that questions concerning the specificity of philosophy of religion ( what sets it structurally apart from theology ) dominate After the Postsecular and the Postmodern .Such questions are not meant solely as attacks on Radical Orthodoxy , but aim to interrogate the whole zeitgeist in which Radical Orthodoxy participates .Q : I 'm struck by how your book reflects a revival of interest in certain thinkers -- Schelling , Bergson , Rosenzweig .Or rather , perhaps , their transformation from the focus of more or less historical interest to inspiration for contemporary speculation .How much of this is a matter of following in the footsteps of Deleuze or \u00c5\u00bdi\u00c5\u00beek ?DJW : Deleuze and \u00c5\u00bdi\u00c5\u00beek are exemplary figures for many of the contributors to this volume .We philosophize in their shadow - and , you 're right , in particular it is their perverse readings of Bergson , Schelling etc which have taught us how to relate to the history of philosophy in new , heterodox ways . \" Experiment \" is one of the key words in After the Postsecular and the Postmodern : all of us who contributed wanted to see what new potential could be opened up within philosophy of religion by mutating its traditions and canons through the lens of contemporary speculation .Having said that , I think both terms of your distinction ( \" inspiration for contemporary speculation \" and \" historical interest \" ) are important at the present moment .Ignorance of the history of philosophy of religion is the academic norm , and our wager is that through straightforward history of philosophy one can excavate resources that have been neglected , so as to begin to see the discipline afresh .It is a matter of revitalizing our sense of what philosophy of religion can do .Therefore , while mutating the history of philosophy is crucial , so too is understanding what that history is .So little has been written about Bergson or Rosenzweig 's contributions in this regard that a relatively straight - laced understanding of them is one of the volume 's most pressing tasks .APS : In France at the time that Deleuze was studying and writing his first books , there was hegemony in the study of philosophy by the \" three H 's \" ( Hegel , Husserl , and Heidegger ) .He followed a different path in his own work , writing important studies on Hume , Bergson , and Nietzsche ( amongst others ) .With the rise in Deleuze 's popularity these choices in figures have taken on the character of a canon , but at the time it was considered quite heretical and bold .While the historical canon for mainstream Anglophone philosophy of religion tends to focuses on Locke , Hume , and Kant , we hope our volume helps to establish an alternative canon that draws on more speculative thinkers from the modern tradition , like Spinoza , Schelling , and Bergson .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.81367"}

{"text": "Recruiting Soldiers Against Radical Islam .Middle East scholar Daniel Pipes calls himself a \" soldier \" in the war against radical Islam .This description is in keeping with Pipes ' belief that the \" war 's center of gravity has shifted from force of arms to the hearts and minds of citizens . \"Because so many people in the West still do n't believe that they are at war , specialists like Pipes are performing an essential role by warning of the dangers of radical Islam .The most recent battlefield in the war of ideas is Sinai Temple in Los Angeles , where Pipes spoke about \" Radical Islam and the War on Terror \" on March 29 .Pipes , who is currently teaching a graduate seminar on \" Islam & Politics \" at Pepperdine University , began his talk by posing two questions that need to be answered before the West can even think about triumphing against the enemy it faces .Of course , to beat the enemy it is necessary to know the enemy , which is why the first question was : Who is the enemy ?The original answer to this question after September 11 was terrorism .Indeed , \" War on Terror \" became the standard way to refer to the greatest existential threat to face the West since the Cold War .But it must be remembered that terrorism is just a tactic .As Pipes made clear , we did not call World War II the \" war against surprise attacks \" in response to Pearl Harbor .Furthermore , if terrorism were the real enemy , non - Islamic terrorist groups such as the Shining Path in Peru would have to be mentioned by Western leaders more often than they are .Does this mean that Muslims are the enemy ?Pipes does n't think so .Such a view is ahistorical : Islam has never been at such a low point as it is today .Viewing Islam as the problem also turns all Muslims into enemies , when , in fact , the West has Muslim allies .Here , Pipes mentioned the Algerians , who have been victims of radical Islamists during the last decade .In order to have achievable war aims , Pipes stressed the importance of creating secular goals .After all , the United States is not engaged in a crusade against Islam .According to Pipes , the true enemy is not a religion but a political ideology called radical Islam .Radical Islamists believe that Islam is the answer to all the problems in the world .Put another way , radical Islam is the transformation of faith into a totalitarian ideology .Like fascism and communism before it , radical Islam seeks world hegemony .The rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan from 1996 - 2001 showed the nightmare that awaits the world if radical Islamists ever achieve their dream of applying Islamic law across the globe .A regime that banned the flying of kites and prevented women and girls from attending school is at odds with the principles of Western civilization .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.53552"}

Bush .There was little or no outcry over that behavior - certainly none from the Liberals or Blacks .Was Sean Delonas ' cartoon particularly funny ?No , I did n't think so .It was a cheap and overly contrived blending of two headlines stories , the recent chimpanzee attack and the Stimulus .It has become significant though because it highlights the lingering rage , bitterness , and insecurity of America 's Blacks , as well as the Liberals eagerness to paint any dissent from President Obama 's agenda as being racist .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.76799"}

{"text": "This resulted in a schism between \" peacock mods \" and skinheads , commonly known by that name by around 1968 .( Other early nicknames included \" lemons \" , \" peanuts \" and \" suits \" ) .Early followers were mainly interested in and influenced by Jamaican Reggae and Ska music ( aka , The Spirit of 69 ) , Jamaican Rude Boy culture and a dislike of those perceived as the ' ruling class ' .Fashions within both groups returned to their mod roots , reintroducing the common wearing of brogues or loafers , suits , and the slacks - and - sweater look .During the mid-1970s in the UK , the skinhead movement was reborn in an unexpected way .With the introduction of Punk Rock to the public , kids were looking for the next great shock - rockers .Skinheads with shorter hair , less emphasis on style , and a new sound grew in numbers and grabbed the attention of the media as a result of repeated incidents of hooliganism during Football matches , often to the point of rioting between rival groups of supporters .Skinheads gained a great deal of media attention after some of them were recruited by far right political parties like the National Front .The party 's position against blacks and Asians appealled to some working class skinheads who blamed immigrants for economic and social problems .The mainstream media focused on these particular skinheads ' racist stance and on their frequent use of violence .This led to the public 's common perception that skinheads are neo - Nazis .In an attempt to counter this negative stereotype , some anti - racist skinhead organizations were formed : Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice ( SHARP ) in 1987 , and Anti Racist Action ( ARA ) in 1988 .Other less political skinheads , such as the Glasgow Spy Kids in Scotland , and the publishers of the Hard As Nails zine in England also spoke out against the neo - Nazis and promoted traditional skinhead style and culure .The Skinhead culture has since spread around the world , and there are many different kinds of skinheads .Style .Skinheads who adopt traditional styles are highly visible in public to both allies and enemies .In terms of clothing : .Tops : .Men : Ben Sherman , Fred Perry , Lonsdale , Brutus , Jaytex or Arnold Palmer brands ; cardigan sweaters ; T - shirts ; button - ups worn with top unbuttoned , generally with no tie ; narrow blazers .Women : Same as men with addition of dress suits comprising a matching short skirt and \u00be length jacket with button - up .Coats : .Bottoms : . skins ; combat trousers , popular among Oi ! skins and scooter boys .Women : Same jeans and trousers as men , but also mini - skirts and fishnet stockings .Suits : .Traditional skinheads are known to wear tailored suits to events such as soul dances or ska concerts .Skinheads are particularly known to favour shark - skin suits , which are made of shiny material .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "130.93732"}
