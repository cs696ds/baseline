{"text": "As most gays have , I also pondered the definitions of the words used to define homosexuality in our modern time .I cringe when the term ' gay ' is used to define ancient men or women , and I realize that our concepts are rooted more in modern sexual theory and cultural practice than a strict interpretation of historical literature .Much of this is rooted in our religious past , but I think more of it has to do with our language and cultural desire to define subjects rather than allow them to simply be as other languages might .Take for example the word ' love ' , we have one word to describe every feeling of tenderness to each other .Other languages like greek have at a minimum 4 and the russians have dozens given their ability to add subtle emotional nuance to any action or word .This limiting of terms means that everyone most use the same word regardless of type of emotion .I love sushi , but I have no sexual desire for sushi , I love men , and their bodies , despite those being two separate things .The very concept of masculinity was force fed down the national throat by moralists and censors who often seemed to be over compensating themselves or plainly misguided .The backlash of behavior of soldiers when they returned home from the WW2 and the close sometimes sexual bonds they formed with their comrades , as well as the sexual freedom that came about with wider worldly experience made many of the puritan sort shudder in dread .So new rules were passed in the cinemas and television , Men did not cry , men did not feel emotion , men did not write poetry , men were stoic knights that led and never felt fear .All clearly at odds with both our history and mankinds history .But than came language , what were men who slept with men ? were all homos the pedophiles that were warned about , were all homos and lesbians locked in their sexuality ?To those who sought to define these things it was easier to say , all homos were ONLY attracted to men , therefore they were n't at risk as long as they were never attracted in the first place .For me it 's true , I 've only really been sexually attracted to men , I made out with girls and women but in comparison to even a kiss from a man my feelings were nonexistent .Do I think that men like me have always existed ?Yes , of course , but in times past when marriage was a parents decision or a matter or gain the option to refrain from women was nonexistent .So saying that because someone was married to a woman means that they were n't gay in the sense that we understand would be false .How many of us have been propositioned by married men ? or known men that left their wives for other men ?To me being gay is not the sexual act , being gay is the depth of feeling I feel for men who I am attracted to or love .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.70651"}

{"text": "Further , many stay silent about their rapes .The Center for Public Integrity found students often stay quite after a rape because they blame themselves , they did n't realize that what happened to them is a crime , or they fear revictimization .Due to all of these factors it is imperative that schools take the necessary steps to protect their students by implementing sexual assault prevention programs and polices and procedures that protect sexual assault survivors from crisis to recovery .Please note that some of the articles and information maybe be triggering .If you feel inspired to start looking at your own campus sexual assault policies and procedures take the SAFER Winter Break Challenge .They also have a wealth of resources and materials to help get you get started .Last spring I was hired by Drake University to provide recommendations about their campus sexual assault prevention and response policies .Today I face a moral dilemma .In August 2010 , Drake University student Anthony Bertolone was charged with third - degree felony sexual abuse for assaulting a Sigma Chi fraternity brother .According to police reports , the victim was not fully conscious during the assaults ( he claims he was drugged ) .Discovery of the sexual assault occurred only when the alleged victim came across stills and video on Bertolone 's own computer .Bertolone was kicked out of his frat but remained enrolled as a student until his recent suspension .I considered writing about the alleged assault in August but decided against it .I did n't want to jeopardize professional and personal relations with the Drake community .Nor did I want to detract from criminal and campus procedures by calling out what could have been done to prevent it and diverting attention from the actual crime .Now it looks like Bertolone may have sexually assaulted another victim .It 's no secret that sexual assault on campus is an epidemic , and that universities are doing little to protect women on their campuses .The suicide of Elizabeth \" Lizzy \" Seeberg this fall highlights just how low a priority sexual assault really is .Nineteen - year - old Lizzy Seeberg reported to the Notre Dame University police that she had been sexually assaulted by a Notre Dame football player on August 31 .According to the Chicago Tribune , she began to fear that \" people would dislike her for accusing a Notre Dame athlete of a sex crime and that she would wear the incident ' like a scarlet letter ' throughout her college career . \" To maintain normalcy , she participated in a tailgate ( reminds me of the cheerleader who had to cheer for her rapist ) .Nine days after the attack , Seeberg committed suicide by taking a lethal quantity of Effexor , an anti - depressant .Three months after the incident , Notre Dame is not publicly acknowledging the case or what actions the university has taken .Sexual violence has long been a major problem on college campuses across the U.S.It is now finally receiving the attention it so desperately deserves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.19472"}
