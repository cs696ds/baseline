{"text": "Now he is denying he sexually harassed anyone and says he would be exonerated if an impartial investigation were done .Some details of the allegations have been revealed : Filner is said to have forcibly kissed and then touched the breast of a campaign worker ; grabbed and kissed a constituent ; and made a sexually suggestive comment to a mayoral staffer about her panties while in an elevator .Gonzalez has also talked of a \" Filner headlock , \" in which the mayor puts his arm around a woman 's neck to pull her closer and suggest they speak alone .He also described the \" Filner dance , \" which women did to avoid being kissed by the mayor .If the women sue , as Gonzalez has said some will , here 's a look at how harassment cases work from the inside out , according to veteran litigators who bring the claims and those who defend them .On offense .Joshua Gruenberg is a veteran San Diego lawyer who has represented workers in cases against the city , county and other agencies , as well as private employees .His first step : try to resolve the situation short of filing a lawsuit .Maybe a new job assignment or a consultation with the human resources department to get the victim separated from the perpetrator .All of this is to avoid what Gruenberg does well : go to court .\" When a client hires a lawyer , typically you have to be prepared to go to battle , \" he said .Plaintiffs in harassment cases , as Kulka discovered , are put under a microscope by employers once the suit is underway .Gruenberg also does his homework before filing a suit .He investigates the harassment claims as much as possible , collecting statements from others if he can and fully vetting the client 's story .And once the suit is going he 'll investigate as much as he can about the defendant .Has the person been sued for harassment before ?He 'll talk to others who have worked for the defendant .Sometimes , Gruenberg 's clients have lost their jobs after making a complaint of harassment , leading to a second claim that they were retaliated against .In those situations , Gruenberg takes the deposition of the person with the most knowledge about why his client was fired , like the head of human resources .He 'll get specific reasons why the client was fired and then work to systematically discredit those reasons .Just as defense lawyers attack the credibility of accusers , Gruenberg goes after the credibility of the employer .Here 's how he said all of that came together in the case of Pamela Luna , a former administrator of a Riverside County community health program .She sued in 2011 claiming she lost her job after complaining that the county 's health officer at that time had sexually harassed her .Luna said she was the target of frequent ogling , verbal harassment and unwanted touching .She said she complained to supervisors numerous times , but no investigation ever happened .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.113495"}

Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University and author of the book Beyond Tolerance : Searching for Interfaith Understanding in America . Prof. Niebuhr will facilitate the closing session at the end of the afternoon of learning .This conference seeks to offer participants the opportunity to learn about religions other than their own and to meet and talk with people who practice those religions .The conference focuses on how and where the different religious traditions are alike and where they are different , with the intent that participants will come to value the differences between religious traditions rather than fear them .Often people think that interfaith dialogue is all about finding the least common denominator , or somehow , watering down the rich religious traditions of the world so that they are acceptable to all .At this conference , students will learn how to recognize , respect and celebrate the differences that exist between the world 's religions and to see those differences as sources of wisdom .They will also have the opportunity to meet people from other religious traditions with whom they might then make connections beyond this conference .If you are in the Rochester area come join us this Sunday afternoon for an exciting interfaith encounter !Scholars from all over the country and internationally will present papers on a broad variety of subjects with the focus on how the sacred texts of the three Abrahamic traditions have served to unite and to divide humankind throughout history and in the contemporary context .Prof. Elaine Pagels , of Princeton University is scheduled to be the keynote speaker at this conference .Many local colleges and universities are co - sponsoring this conference , including the Department of Religion and Classics here at the University of Rochester .Rochester has long been a center for interfaith encounter and dialogue , with a rich and vibrant interfaith community that is constantly engaged in dialogue and community action together on a variety of issues and topics .These two conferences are examples of the energy and the commitment to interfaith dialogue of the many faith communities that make up this city .As a community we know that we are stronger and better able to work together for the common good when we forge and maintain interfaith relationships .People in all of our diverse faith communities are privileged to be able to practice their particular religious tradition in the pluralistic context of this city where they can grow and deepen their own faith as they learn about the faiths of others .Interfaith dialogue is absolutely essential in the global community in which we all now live .The great religions of the world can be sources of wisdom and agents of peacemaking when their adherents take the time to learn about their own religious tradition and the other traditions that make up their community and neighborhood .I invite all of you in the Rochester area to take advantage of these unique opportunities for religious and spiritual growth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.14377"}

{"text": "In the second year , we developed a complementary model for working with female student - athletes , coaches , and administrators ; since the mid-1990s MVP has been a mixed - gender program .It should be noted , however , that whether we 're working with student - athletes , the general student population , coaches , teachers , or other professionals , the MVP model includes space for both single and mixed - gender sessions .It is also worth noting that in recent years a number of other bystander initiatives have been developed , each with their own philosophies and emphases .What follows focuses on the MVP model : what we have been doing -- and some of what we have learned -- in our work in college athletics for nearly two decades .Because the Penn State case underscores so emphatically the necessity of examining -- and transforming -- social norms within male - dominated institutions , for the purpose of this article I have chosen to highlight our work in the sub - culture of college male athletics .For at least the past generation , male sports culture has too often been the site of gender violence scandals .But MVP did not originate in organized athletics because of the problems in that sub - culture .If one of the long - term goals of the anti - rape movement is to transform rape - supportive attitudes in mainstream U.S. culture , who better to catalyze this transformation than men who -- more than most -- help to define the mainstream ?To put it another way , sexual violence prevention initiatives that fail to engage men in the sports culture and other areas of cultural hegemony are often ignored by mainstream populations , and can easily be marginalized .Why stay on the margins and not go right for the center ?As the Penn State debacle makes clear , sports culture provides an unparalleled platform from which to call attention to a range of societal problems --- and to catalyze efforts to change the social norms that often underlie them .Nonetheless , because the MVP program originated in sports culture , and continues to use sports terminology in some of its curricular materials , it is sometimes mistakenly seen as a program designed exclusively for athletics .But from the beginning , the strategic vision of MVP was to begin in athletics and then move into broader student and professional populations in colleges , high schools , middle schools and other institutions like the U.S. military - a process that continues to this day .We quickly realized that the \" bystander \" category offered a way to transcend the limitations of the perpetrator - victim binary , which up until that point had held sway in conventional gender violence prevention theory and practice .In many educational programs developed in the 1970s and 1980s , women were regarded primarily as victims , potential victims , or empowered survivors , and men as perpetrators or potential perpetrators .Among the many limitations of this narrow approach is that most men did not see themselves as potential perpetrators -- and as a result shut down in a way that precluded honest participation or critical dialogue .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.59842"}

{"text": "There has to be a shift in our culture where we stop saying that it is a survivors responsibility to not get raped , and in rape culture specifically it is not a woman 's responsibility .It is our population that has to change so that when we see instances where individuals could be in danger we are proactive and stop the perpetrator .That person who 's so drunk that they are being held up by an individual who continues to feed them drink .We should no longer be bystanders .We should Stand Up .Anti Rape Wear .I did another post which spoke to this concept in rape culture .While I feel individuals can choose whatever type of protection they want to safe guard I also feel that by promoting anti rape wear we are not solving the root of the issue .The fact is that we live in a culture where rape is so prevalent that we need to create these devices .I commend the creators because I do believe these efforts help prevented isolated incidences of rape which is an amazing accomplishment .However , it does speak to our culture that women in this case , as they have n't created mainstream anti - rape wear for men , are so fearful of rape that we have to make ourselves less attractive or resort to internal or external weapons for protection .This is the sad state of affairs our culture is in .False Rape Accusations .This is going to be my last topic of today since your mind is probably exploding with all the knowledge .This topic is one that I feel is most important as I am frequently asked about it when I discuss my work here at SHARPP .There is this lingering myth that most people carry regarding individuals who report sexual assault , that is the act of false reporting .While I will not deny that false accusations do occur across the country the number is remarkably low .When people ask me if I 've encountered individuals here who have filed false accusations I have to say no .Personally I have not .Most people enter our office to learn how to cope with an assault if anything .But the reason why I can say that false reporting is so rare is because filing a report is a lot harder than most people think .The first step is telling someone what happened to you .Which can be a friend , in most cases .Then after divulging that personal information you can call an crisis center , the police , or go to the hospital .The police and hospital then page an advocate form a call center if one has not already been called .Then you undergo a rape kit which is one of the most invasive procedures created .You are swabbed and ask questions about the event for evidence collection .You have to give up your clothes , undergarments , bed sheets , and are asked preferably to not even shower .Then you proceed to take pills and shots to prevent you from pregnancy ( for women ) , HIV / AIDS and other STIs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "133.0206"}

{"text": "I think he does .And I think we have to take very seriously what he has to tell us about \" repentance . \" \" Repent \" is one of those churchy words that has been so overused through the years that it has lost any real meaning for 21 st century Christians .We tend to think of repentance as some kind of pious feeling of remorse for our minor peccadilloes and misdeeds , quiet words of apology uttered under our breath to a God we 're not entirely sure is really listening .But the kind of repentance that John the Baptist was looking for was something entirely different .He wanted to see a complete change of direction , a radical shift in priorities .Moreover , his idea of repentance ( the Greek word is metanoia which means to turn around , to go a different direction ) is directed at an entire society , not just individuals .I think its time we 21 st century American people of faith listen up to this sharp tongued , fire and brimstone preacher because our very lives are at stake , never mind whatever eternal salvation we hope our religious faith will bring us .One thing John the Baptist appears to be very clear about is that the repentance he 's looking for has a lot to do with social responsibility and looking after the neighbor .Those who have two coats , share with those who have none .Those who have food , share with those who have none .And tax collectors be fair in business dealings and soldiers do not extort from others and be satisfied with the wages you 've got .And American citizens , stand up to the powerful gun lobbies in your midst and demand that assault weapons and the ammunition that goes with them be banned completely and access to them be absolutely unavailable to any civilian ever .No one , least of all ordinary citizens , needs such weapons for protection .The statistics are incontrovertible that countries that do not allow civilian access to guns have dramatically lower numbers of deaths by gun violence than we have in these United States .To quote from the folk song of the 60s , \" Blowin in the Wind \" , \" How many deaths will it take till he knows , that too many people have died ? \"Well , my friends , too many people have died and we all know it .And the only way to stop it is for every citizen of this country demand that our elected representatives stand up to the gun lobby and ban assault weapons immediately .I am well aware of the arguments about protecting the purchase of hunting rifles , but we all know that it is not hunting rifles that are being used to gun down innocent people in these mass shootings .It is quite possible to regulate assault weapons while protecting a hunter 's right to shoot a buck in the woods .And to those who might say to me that this is a political issue and not a religious one , I would respectfully beg to differ .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "136.81151"}
{"text": "In fact , as the consumption of violent video games in our society has skyrocketed , violent crimes , including those among youths , have plummeted to low levels not seen since the 1960s .We can be sure that violent video games are not sparking a youth violence epidemic because there is no youth violence epidemic .In my own research , I have found that family violence exposure as a child and the individual 's innate ( probably genetic ) personality are related to violent criminal behaviors , but that violent video game exposure is not .A recent Secret Service report found that school shooters , far from being soaked in violent video games , had relatively low interest in such games .For example , the recent Virginia Tech shooter was not a violent game player .Second , equating video games with pornography is a pointless comparison .It ignores that video games have evolved to include distinct artistic elements .GTA has itself been compared to \" The Sopranos \" in regard to its story line , quality and violent content .If you like ( or allow your kids to watch ) \" The Sopranos , \" you 'll probably be content with GTA ( likewise if you do n't like one , you may not like the other ) .For the record , however , pornography is no more linked to rape than violent games are to violent crimes .Researchers have long known that rape rates have gone down in the U.S. as pornography consumption has increased .Rapists typically consume less pornography and are exposed to it later than non - rapist men .Third , we need to give the current generation of youths more credit .Today 's youths are healthier in most respects than any other group of youths since the 1960s .Today 's youths are less likely to engage in violent crime , use drugs or alcohol , get pregnant , commit suicide or drop out of school than were youths of previous generations .The major health concern for today 's youths is obesity , which is on the rise ; otherwise , the youths of today are doing well .Last , the current hysteria over violent video games is merely part of a long historical pattern of society blaming media for problems real or imagined .Media , from novels to comic books , to music such as jazz , rock and rap , to television and movies to \" Harry Potter \" and \" Dungeons and Dragons \" have inflamed public turmoil over behavioral crises that never came to pass .Even translating the Bible into English set off waves of hysteria back in the 1500s .Such moral panics are popular as they deflect blame for our own behavior or the behavior of our children onto \" straw men \" that we can revile for providing the violent and sexual media that we crave .Ultimately , we have responsibility for ourselves and for our children .If things do n't go the way we want , let us look not to the media but inward , to ourselves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "137.90276"}
