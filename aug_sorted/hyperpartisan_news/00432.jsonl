{"text": "Free speech is essential to anyone who writes or creates art .This month , on January 24 , the U.S. Senate will meet to take a closer look at PIPA .There are plenty of senators who have already stated support for the bill , many of whom have received significant campaign funding from the very entities that are pushing bills like SOPA and PIPA .The Internet Goes on Strike .But the Internet is n't having it .Webmasters , bloggers , Tumblrs , Tweeters , and Redditors are banding together to fight against these bills .Ordinary citizens of the web are expressing opposition to censorship in creative ways : making art , censoring their avatars and websites , calling their senators and representatives , signing petitions , and organizing a coordinated strike .The big players are lining up too .WordPress and Creative Commons have recently issued official statements opposing these bills .Other opponents of the bills include Mozilla , Facebook , Ebay , Twitter , Tumblr , and Google .Tomorrow , on January 18 , the Internet will go on strike .Participating websites will essentially shut down and replace their content with information about these bills .The goal of the strike is to show opposition to the bills but more importantly to inform the public and encourage people to take action .On social media sites , especially Twitter , there is a constant stream of remarks on these issues with a good chunk of those tweets pleading with sites like Facebook , Twitter , and YouTube to participate in the strike in some way .Their participation could tip the scales .Lack of Media Coverage .One of the biggest problems with SOPA and PIPA is that most people are n't aware that the bills are being considered .Prime time television news coverage on SOPA and PIPA has been lacking ( which is n't surprising , considering many of those networks are owned by the very corporations that are trying to pass the bills ) .So , if everybody 's favorite websites simultaneously go dark and offer one common message and call to action , those senators will get a whole lot of phone calls and emails .Some say that by striking for mere minutes , Facebook alone could get the bill killed by sending a massive number of users to flood politicians with calls and emails .What You Can Do .There are some quick and easy steps you can take to actively oppose SOPA and PIPA : . Visit AmericanCensorship.org .The site has quick links that U.S. citizens can can use to call senators or email representatives .Let them know that you 're a voter and/or citizen who opposes SOPA and PIPA .The site also offers actions that non - U.S. citizens can take .Censorship and blacklisting in the U.S. will affect websites worldwide .Got a WordPress website ?Get the Stop SOPA Ribbon .Writing Forward is proudly displaying it in the upper right - hand corner .It took less than two minutes to install .There are several other anti - censorship plugins available .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.362457"}

'Assault ' rifles are not favored weapons for crimes ... they tend to be upper end rifles and are thus expensive .They are difficult to modify or conceal .This is not to say that ' assault ' rifles are never used in crime , they are .But sawed - off shotguns and cheap pistols are far more commonly used .The workings are similar or identical ( some technical detail differences ) to common hunting rifles .The ban is nothing more than a \" feel good \" thing that will not have any significant impact on crime .There is , IMO , no personal style weapon that should be banned from private ownership .There are some military grade weapons , including assault rifles , that I agree should be carefully monitored in the private world , and they already are so .This is a non - issue , and Obama and Biden are completely wrong on their position .But I consider it a non - issue that is not going to go anywhere .Nothing is more guaranteed to instantly create several million armed rebels right here in the US than to attempt much activity in this arena . guns are bad ! , and the politicians are spot on with what they say , why they HELL does ANYONE need an ak 47 lying about their house unless their actualy at war and in genuine danger of someone shooting at the , ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.53464"}
