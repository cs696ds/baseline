Barack Obama does not share their values , only seven percent cast their ballots in his favor .Basically , more people who do n't relate to Clinton are , for one reason or another , still voting for her .These are not likely to be loyal supporters .On a broader level , among the 17 percent of primary goers who said they would choose Sen. John McCain over Hillary Clinton in a hypothetical general election match - up , 41 percent of that group came from Clinton 's own camp .In essence , roughly seven percent of Clinton support in Indiana ( 40 percent of 17 percent ) said they would defect to the Republican should she end up the nominee .That would be a difficult punch to stomach in November .In 2004 , nearly 1 million Indianans voted for John Kerry .A seven percent defection rate would have meant 70,000 less votes .By contrast , if the general election is between Obama and McCain , 19 percent of the Indiana Democratic primary goers said they would support the Republican .But only 12 percent of that group ( 2.28 percent ) would come from Obama 's camp .Shellshocked House Republicans got warnings from leaders past and present Tuesday : Your party 's message is n't good enough to prevent disaster in November , and neither is the NRCC 's money .There is an attitude that , ' I better watch out for myself , because nobody else is going to do it , ' \" the member said .\" There are all these different factions out there , everyone is sniping at each other , and we have no real plan .We have a lot of people fighting to be the captain of the lifeboat instead of everybody pulling together .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.11315"}

{"text": "Four years after his narrow win over Humphrey , Nixon demolished George McGovern , winning 49 states and 60.1 % of the popular vote .While McGovern was a particularly weak candidate , Nixon 's 1972 election numbers largely mirrored what 1968 would have been if you added George Wallace 's vote totals to Richard Nixon 's , which would have given Nixon 56.9 % of the popular vote and a 44 state landslide .Against that backdrop , Donald Trump 's success this year should not be particularly surprising .This year 's revolt of less - educated , southern , rural and working class voters against the GOP establishment has been simmering for decades .The Republican Party establishment has long held tight control over its nomination process .As the saying goes , Democrats fall in love , Republicans fall in line .Yet along the way there has been a history of discord .In 1992 and 1996 , Nixon speechwriter and conservative herald Pat Buchanan led his Peasants with Pitchforks uprisings against the establishment candidates , winning 20 - 25 % of the primary vote against the incumbent George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole , respectively .Buchanan 's share of the vote mirrored exactly the share of the GOP electorate represented by the Wallace voters that Nixon brought into the party .The subsequent emergence of the Tea Party movement within the Republican Party demonstrated more than a decade after Buchanan 's last race that the anti - establishment , nativist wing of the GOP was alive and well .Over the past fifty years , the GOP has catered to the socially conservative views of the voters who migrated to the GOP in the wake of the Southern Strategy , but has been largely inimical to their economic interests .Pat Buchanan railed for years that the GOP was serving the interests of Republican corporate and Wall Street elites by supporting free trade and immigration policies that undermined the economic interests of working and middle class Americans .Donald Trump expanded on Buchanan 's attacks on the GOP establishment when he targeted the preferential tax treatment provided to hedge fund managers and the control of GOP candidates by mega - donors and special interests .Even as the GOP establishment is complaining about Donald Trump 's rhetoric , the rest of the Republican field has largely ignored evidence from his rise that the Republican base is mad as hell and is n't going to take it any more .As Mitt Romney famously observed four years ago , the bottom 40 % of Americans pay no federal income tax , while those in the middle quintile have an average income tax rate of only 1.3 % .In the wake of the most recent turmoil , leaders of the GOP still seem to be pinning their hopes on Trump voters falling in line , but history suggests that they wo n't .GOP efforts to shame Trump into submission -- and preferably into leaving the race -- are ill - conceived .As recent polling has suggested -- and as has been evident for months now -- Trump has his finger on the pulse of a broad swath of the GOP electorate , and those voters appear to be hunkering down in defense of their man .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.28583"}

Chris Christie , who spent $ 852 per vote and came in sixth place , and Sen. Marco Rubio ( R - Fla . ) , who spent $ 508 per vote and came in just behind Bush in fifth place .The tight grip of oligarchy upon the American political system slipped a little last night in New Hampshire .On the Democratic side , voters cast their ballots for one of the most implausible candidates in modern presidential history - less because his rhetoric was so mesmerizing or his program so inspiring than as a protest against an expected winner perceived as a lavishly compensated servitor of organized wealth .In her concession speech , Hillary Clinton boasted of her small donors .More than 70 percent had given less than $ 100 , she claimed : \" I know that does n't fit with the narrative . \"As Ken Vogel of Politico ... .For the establishment wing of the Republican Party , the picture just keeps getting bleaker .Far from winnowing the crowded field of mainstream GOP contenders and allowing it to unify around a standard - bearer , New Hampshire thrust it further into chaos .Marco Rubio , after taking steps last week to coalesce the backing of the party 's upper echelons , saw his momentum halted in the state , which punished him for delivering an overly scripted debate performance .Throughout the Republican presidential primary , and we still have a very long way to go , the Republican Establishment has revealed itself to be the nastiest , meanest , smallest group of smugs I have ever come across .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.630646"}

{"text": "The definition of being a conservative -- to say nothing of being a Republican -- has changed dramatically over the years .Richard Nixon walked away from the New England small government conservatives when he brought southern , rural and evangelical conservatives into the fold who were activists on social issues .Similarly , Ronald Reagan killed the fiscal conservative traditions of the party , while George W. Bush cast out the GOP traditions of conservative restraint in foreign policy in favor of neoconservative activism .Conservatism in Republican politics is not a static concept defined in the writing of Edmund Burke , or Ayn Rand for that matter , as Paul Ryan 's words suggest .It has been balanced over the years by the exigencies of what it takes to win .Paul Ryan 's protests notwithstanding , Donald Trump 's populist , nativist rhetoric -- as offensive as it may be -- is well within the American political tradition , and his campaign has its antecedents in the traditions of the GOP as well .GOP candidates have thrived over the years through their willingness to say the words necessary to motivate their base -- however offensive to others they might be -- and Trump is no different .The question is what comes next .Now that the GOP top brass -- from Speaker Paul Ryan to GOP Chairman Reince Priebus to its \u00e9minence grise Dick Cheney -- have heaped condemnation on Donald Trump , and many declared him unfit to serve , they have placed themselves between a rock and a hard place .Within hours of the shooting at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs , my friend , a long time reporter with years of covering the Department of Justice received a call from the editors of a major newspaper .They were struggling with how to describe the actions of Robert Lewis Dear : if it turned out the shooter had anti - abortion motives , would that meet the Department of Justice 's definition of domestic terrorism .The editors ' question was specific to how the Department of Justice would interpret Robert Lewis Dear 's assault and murders , but it mirrored the debate that springs up immediately after these events about what constitutes a terrorist act vs. other forms of violence .Terrorism is generally defined as a tactic using violence or the threat of violence to inspire fear in pursuit of a political goal .The question raised by the editors points to the difficulty -- and in their view the importance -- of how we label incidents like this .Because of the prominence of Planned Parenthood as a political issue raised by Republicans over the past several months , people quickly looked to see how the Republican presidential candidates would respond to the question the editors raised .Mike Huckabee , a candidate with impeccable anti - abortion credentials who won the Iowa caucuses in 2008 , held down the straightforward , call - a - spade - a - spade , end of the spectrum when he declared that Dear 's action was domestic terrorism .Carly Fiorina and Ted Cruz hunkered down at the other end of the spectrum .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.592155"}

{"text": "Hillary 's silence with respect to Russia was notable .It was over four years ago that Barack Obama declared that Bashar al - Assad must go , yet as America ramped up its verbal war on Assad , no consideration was given to whether Russia might come to the defense of its ally .Since that declaration by President Obama , however , Russia has seized the Crimea and sponsored a war in eastern Ukraine .That is to say , in the intervening years , Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared to the world -- and to the United States in particular -- that Russia is back from the dead , and can no longer be disregarded as a force in the world .Putin 's domestic approval ratings are now near 90 % , in large measure because of his reassertion of Russian interests on the global stage and his willingness to stand up to the United States .The Obama administration 's determination to overthrow Assad has grown in intensity as the civil war has worn on , as civilian deaths mounted , and as our embarrassment at Assad 's defiance of our demand that he step down has grown deeper .But the Assad regime has never been a strategic concern to American interests nor to our allies .Israel cautioned early on against American efforts to force Assad to step down , believing that what might come in their wake would very likely be worse .On the other hand , our relationship with Russia is one of critical national interest .For almost a quarter of a century , U.S. foreign policy has reflected a \" unipolar \" status wherein our military power allowed us to do what we wanted , when we wanted , wherever we wanted in the world .Russia 's entry into the Syria conflict signals a change in the world .Hillary 's strategy to defeat ISIS had an eerily familiar ring to it .Nation building in a land torn by tribal and religious conflict .Notions of democracy in a country lacking core institutions .But its biggest gap was not taking into account Russia 's determination to protect its ally and its interests .That may be a negative factor or it may be one that offers real opportunities , but one thing is for sure , it can not be ignored .The bodies were still warm on the streets of Paris , and the reprise of the Global War on Terror was ramping up back here at home .We can hear the old talking points being dusted off .In our new , real time , twitter world , it took barely a nanosecond for the attacks to start after the candidates at the Democratic presidential debate declined to call radical Islam by its name .How can you fight an enemy that you refuse to name , came the rebuke , in many splendored forms .We have been down this path before .In the last Republican presidential debate , Jeb Bush made a brief stab at taking the high ground in the immigration debate that was dominating the Republican contest before the Paris attacks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.38712"}

{"text": "If we are going to use the language of terrorism , we have to be careful to apply it consistently .We can not apply different standards because a person is Christian or because they are white , as some felt the New York Times did in its description of Robert Lewis Dear as \" a gentle loner who occasionally unleashed violent acts towards neighbors and women he knew .\" Given the current usage of the term , Dear should be labeled a terrorist if he did what he appears to have done .But we should not be surprised if doing so , in our current political landscape , turns out to be an unproductive step .What Robert Lewis Dear did was terrifying and barbaric , and it is becoming increasingly clear that his actions were inspired by the anti - abortion meme .But it is not useful to label any crazy person who does horrific things a terrorist , however much the old definitions might fit .We have to be cognizant in this debate that the global war on terror changed everything , particularly the language of terrorism .Terrorism is no longer simply a word used to describe a political tactic , but has become a moral absolute , a designation of evil .It may be that the word has lost its salience for the application to events of \" domestic terrorism \" that lack an organized , systematic framework , and to which the anti - terrorism tools and tactics do not apply .In his speech declaring the global war on terror , President George Bush assigned equal moral culpability to those who commit acts of terror and those who support them .Translated into our domestic landscape , this suggests that an acknowledgement by Carly Fiorina or Ted Cruz that their rhetoric may have inspired Dear 's actions could imply culpability for a terrorist act .Even if that is exactly what their political antagonists would love to see , it would only take us farther down a slippery slope in a year when political rhetoric has already begun to test the limits of what a democracy can tolerate .Speaking before the Council on Foreign Relations last week , Hillary Clinton established the objective that is commonly held among all presidential aspirants : ISIS must not be contained , it must be destroyed .Yet beyond that statement , despite all the fury generated on the campaign trail by the ISIS attacks and the failures of American strategy to date , there is little that any of the candidates have suggested that differs much from what we have been doing so far .Aerial bombardment , special ops and arming the Kurds , plus other stuff at the margin .Our engagement in Syria has a certain Alice in Wonderland quality to it .By all accounts , we are opposed to almost every side of that country 's civil war .Our attempts to \" train up \" our own moderate fighting force has been an expensive failure .The notion that we were going to train moderate Syrian Sunnis on Saudi soil to return to Syria to fight Sunni extremists , who were themselves weaned on Saudi - Wahhabi theology and funded by Qatari money , was from the beginning steeped in irony .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "151.6889"}
