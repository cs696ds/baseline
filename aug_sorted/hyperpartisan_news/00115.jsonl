Bush .Comey was general counsel to Connecticut - based hedge fund Bridgewater Associates from 2010 until earlier this year and now lectures at Columbia Law School .Comey would replace Robert Mueller , who has held the job since shortly before the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , which forced the FBI to transform itself into one of the nation 's chief weapons in the war on terror .Mueller 's last day on the job is Sept. 4 .The White House may hope that Comey 's Republican background will help him through Senate confirmation at a time when some of Obama 's nominees have been facing tough battles .But Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley , the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , indicated Comey 's confirmation hearing would raise questions about the Obama administration 's investigations of Wall Street .Grassley said in a statement late Wednesday he had not heard from the White House about Comey 's nomination but said Comey possessed a lot of important experience on national security issues .\" But , if he 's nominated , he would have to answer questions about his recent work in the hedge fund industry , \" Grassley said .\" The administration 's efforts to criminally prosecute Wall Street for its part in the economic downturn have been abysmal , and his agency would have to help build the case against some of his colleagues .\" Comey became a hero to Democrats for the central role he played in holding up Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program , one of the administration 's great controversies and an episode that focused attention on the administration 's controversial tactics in the war on terror .Comey said he refused to recertify the program because Ashcroft had reservations about its legality .Senior government officials had expressed concerns about whether the National Security Agency , which administered the warrantless eavesdropping program , had the proper oversight in place .Other concerns included whether any president possessed the legal and constitutional authority to authorize the program as it was carried out at the time .The White House , Comey said , recertified the program without the Justice Department 's signoff , allowing it to operate for about three weeks without concurrence on whether it was legal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.84074"}

Blanco , John C. Keeney , and Jason M. Weinstein .Breuer 's top deputies approved these wiretap applications to be used against individuals associated with the known drug cartels .As I understand it , the wire tap applications contain rich detail of the reckless operational tactics being employed by your agents in Phoenix .Although Breuer and his top deputies were informed of the operational details and tactics of Fast and Furious , they did nothing to stop the program .In fact , on a trip to Mexico Breuer trumpeted Fast and Furious as a promising investigation .Gary Grindler , the then - Deputy Attorney General and currently your Chief of Staff , received an extremely detailed briefing on Operation Fast and Furious on March 12 , 2010 .In this briefing , Grindler learned such minutiae as the number of times that Uriel Patino , a straw purchaser on food stamps who ultimately acquired 720 firearms , went in to a cooperating gun store and the amount of guns that he had bought .When former Acting ATF Director Ken Melson , a career federal prosecutor , learned similar information , he became sick to his stomach : .I had pulled out all Patino 's -- and ROIs is , I 'm sorry , report of investigation -- and you know , my stomach being in knots reading the number of times he went in and the amount of guns that he bought .Transcribed interview of Acting ATF Director Kenneth Melson at 42 .At the time of his briefing in March of last year , Grindler knew that Patino had purchased 313 weapons and paid for all of them in cash .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.44917"}
