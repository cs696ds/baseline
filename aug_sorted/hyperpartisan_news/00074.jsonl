Brigance , battling ALS since 2007 , was asked to present the Lamar Hunt Trophy to his team .Through his computer , Brigance typed with his eyes the message he wanted to express to the men of his organization : \" Congratulations to the Baltimore Ravens .Your resiliency has outlasted your adversity .You are the AFC Champions .You are my mighty men .With God , all things are possible .\" Brigance has been an inspiration to the Ravens and anyone who has seen his story .ESPN 's \" Sunday NFL Countdown \" aired the most memorable feature of this postseason on Brigance earlier this month .It is recommended watching as a primer on how Baltimore has been motivated and inspired and will be again in its matchup against San Francisco .Support was n't dropped : In another feature that ran on ESPN 's \" Sunday NFL Countdown , \" former Ravens wide receiver Lee Evans recounted the events after his dropped pass during last season 's AFC Championship Game in New England .What stood out to Evans , even to this day , was the way Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis and safety Ed Reed comforted him .\" They did n't look at it as blaming one person or one guy , \" Evans recalled last week in Baltimore .\" It was really a team thing for them , and I think that is what is so special about that team and that organization .They said it , and not only did they say it , but it was backed up by their actions .I knew from that moment on until now that [ Lewis ] would help drive that engine to get them right back here , like he said they will be . \"Asked specifically how Lewis comforted him , Evans provided a snapshot of why the Ravens linebacker has been so inspirational to each of his teammates .\" When he tells his story about what he 's going through , it kind of dwarfs everything that you know and can think about , \" said Evans , who still lives in Baltimore .\" At that moment when you 're feeling your lowest , he can tell you his story , his struggle , and you ca n't even compare .And when he tells you that was our journey , you know that he means it .You know that it 's real to him , and you have a sense that he wanted and needed to come back and they were going to do it again and be in that position again .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.603443"}

Col .Stanley Heath , an Army spokesman , explained in a telephone interview .The Army actually has two authorized flag patches , one to be worn on the left shoulder , with the canton facing left , and another \" reverse field \" patch worn on the right , with the canton facing right .The two different orientations are mandated because Army regulations call for the flag \" to be worn so that to observers , it looks as if the flag is flying against a breeze , \" Heath said .What does a stiff wind have to do with this custom ?In fact , the rule is a nod to the U.S. Army 's early history , when wars were fought as a series of carefully choreographed battles - two armies meeting on a field , clashing head - on until one side emerged victorious .In those battles , both mounted cavalry and infantry units would always designate one soldier as \" standard bearer , \" to carry the Colors into the fight .As the standard bearer charged , his rapid forward momentum would cause the flag to stream back .And since the Stars and Stripes is mounted with the canton closest to the pole , that section would always be forward .So if a soldier is charging into the battle , the flag would give the appearance of forward motion .For the right shoulder , the flag only appears \" backward . \"And that 's why soldiers wear the flag patches on the right shoulder \" backward . \"Because retreat in battle , as any soldier will tell you , is not the Army way .Answer : Army Regulation 670 - 1 , Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia , is the governing authority for the wear of Army uniforms .Paragraph 28 - 18 governs the wear of the United States Flag on Army Uniforms .The flag may only be worn on the utility and organizational uniforms ( such as the camouflage BDU ) .The flag may only be worn during joint - duty and multinational deployments .When the service member returns to home station , the flag must be removed .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.98915"}

{"text": "Although these organizations have the capacity and mandate to be an important force in confronting intertwined global challenges , many CSOs are recognizing that their current strategies may not be sufficient to address the structural and cultural drivers of today 's crises .A recent survey by the Action Town Project of CSO leaders suggests some core reasons .First , most large national and international CSOs tend to pragmatically focus on short - term solutions instead of tackling root causes .This is because of pressure from most funders to make a short - term impact and CSOs ' fear of losing credibility with their base if they demand more systemic shifts .As a consequence , many CSO visions remain based on the assumption that problems can be solved within the existing system .However , this approach often leads to tackling the symptoms in the short run without solving problems in the long run .Second , much CSO work focuses on national and international advocacy , within a business - as - usual political context that prevents far - reaching societal change .The failure of the Copenhagen summit on climate change in 2009 and the lack of progress at the Rio+20 Earth summit have demonstrated that rational scientific arguments will not be enough to move the global political system to take strong action .A Great Transition to a sustainable society will only succeed if it lends support to grassroots organizing efforts like 350 .org , which spearheaded the world 's most widespread day of political action in history on October 24 , 2009 .Third , most large national and international CSOs focus on single issues like climate change , marine protection , or poverty alleviation .This specialization undermines connections across issues and effective collaborations across organizations .With the planet hitting biophysical limits and economic growth failing to alleviate poverty , it has become clear that an issue - by - issue approach within conventional development values and institutional structures is not working .It is not leading us to the path of sustainable and equitable development that we so urgently need : a policy trajectory in which the environment is sustained for current and future generations and the benefits of economic activity are widely and equitably shared .Such a transition will require broad and deep change across many areas : technology , legislation , economic and governance institutions , social relations , culture , and values .Therefore , CSO strategies must emphasize that a focus on small incremental improvements will not be sufficient and , indeed , might even undermine the possibility of transformative change .Instead , CSOs need urgently to develop and put into practice strategies that embrace the cultural and systemic root causes behind the social and environmental crises of our times .Leveraging the Full Potential of CSOs .If a narrow policy approach has failed to galvanize enough public support to drive the political will for more radical government action , CSOs need to fundamentally redesign their strategies .This will require that CSOs abandon their current fragmentation and start working toward a common and coherent vision that addresses the root causes of our sustainability crisis , such as human values , lifestyles , and economic structures .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.22392"}

Lawrence Burkholder as quoted by James Brenneman .Based on the GC press release , the message seems to be , through the text and accompanying photos , that Brenneman hopes to take GC in the path inspired by ethicist and former GC president J.

Lawrence Burkholder .Burkholder 's vision flows out of a focus on the \" sea of moral ambiguity \" as Perry Bush describes it in his article \" The Political Education of Vietnam Christian Service , 1954 - 1975 \" .Bush references the story I often heard Burkholder tell of the time while working in China when he forced frantic refugees off a plane while the pilot held a gun to their heads so that the plane could take off .For Burkholder , this story was the starting point for an Anabaptist ethical framework based on political compromise and accomodation rather then sectarian idealism .I respect Burkholder 's critique of idealism and his recognition of the need to engage with moral ambiguity .Unfortunately , there seems to be a pattern of leaders of Mennonite institutions citing Burkholder 's work as they move their organizations towards the mainstream and away from distintive Anabaptist ways of being .For more on this see Peacewashing MMA .Brenneman 's distinctive take on the Burkholderian path is to compromise and accomodate while in the name of prophetic critique .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.796295"}

Phillip Randolph , who was a black Republican .President Kennedy , through his brother Atty .Gen. Robert Kennedy , had Dr. King wiretapped and investigated by the FBI on suspicion of being a Communist in order to undermine Dr. King .In March of 1968 , while referring to Dr. King 's leaving Memphis , Tenn. , after riots broke out where a teenager was killed , Democrat Sen. Robert Byrd ( W.Va . ) , a former member of the Ku Klux Klan , called Dr. King a \" trouble - maker \" who starts trouble , but runs like a coward after trouble is ignited .A few weeks later , Dr. King returned to Memphis and was assassinated on April 4 , 1968 .Given the circumstances of that era , it is understandable why Dr. King was a Republican .It was the Republicans who fought to free blacks from slavery and amended the Constitution to grant blacks freedom ( 13th Amendment ) , citizenship ( 14th Amendment ) and the right to vote ( 15th Amendment ) .Republicans passed the civil rights laws of the 1860s , including the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Reconstruction Act of 1867 that was designed to establish a new government system in the Democrat - controlled South , one that was fair to blacks .Republicans also started the NAACP and affirmative action with Republican President Richard Nixon 's 1969 Philadelphia Plan ( crafted by black Republican Art Fletcher ) that set the nation 's fist goals and timetables .Although affirmative action now has been turned by the Democrats into an unfair quota system , affirmative action was begun by Nixon to counter the harm caused to blacks when Democrat President Woodrow Wilson in 1912 kicked all of the blacks out of federal government jobs .Few black Americans know that it was Republicans who founded the Historically Black Colleges and Universities .Unknown also is the fact that Republican Sen. Everett Dirksen from Illinois was key to the passage of civil rights legislation in 1957 , 1960 , 1964 and 1965 .Not mentioned in recent media stories about extension of the 1965 Voting Rights Act is the fact that Dirksen wrote the language for the bill .Dirksen also crafted the language for the Civil Rights Act of 1968 which prohibited discrimination in housing .President Lyndon Johnson could not have achieved passage of civil rights legislation without the support of Republicans .Critics of Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater , who ran for President against Johnson in 1964 , ignore the fact that Goldwater wanted to force the Democrats in the South to stop passing discriminatory laws and thus end the need to continuously enact federal civil rights legislation .Those who wrongly criticize Goldwater also ignore the fact that Johnson , in his 4,500 State of the Union Address delivered on Jan. 4 , 1965 , mentioned scores of topics for federal action , but only 35 words were devoted to civil rights .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.924576"}
