{"text": "One of the more interesting things about the GOP debate was n't even what happened at the debate , but the meta - narrative of how it happened .It 's also interesting how weak and helpless the Republican Party appeared as events unfolded .First , the GOP was supposed to have its strongest field in decades .This should , in theory , have allowed for real contentions over major issues and a seesaw effect as governors and senators probed each other 's weaknesses and tested new ideas with the GOP primary electorate .But that has n't happened .Instead each of the major candidates has shrunk under the bright lights rather than grown .The field that appeared so strong on paper has turned out to look incredibly weak and slate .As the major candidates were unable to seize control , an increasing number of also - rans became tempted to join the fray , producing an overcrowded clown car effect .During all of this the national Republican Party was entirely powerless to stop them and clear the field .Then , of course , came Donald Trump .The Republican Party has never looked weaker than it has in dealing with the enormous black eye that is Donald Trump .Reince Priebus has looked variously baffled , snarky , pouty and kowtowing addressing the Trump problem .At every turn Donald Trump continues to thumb his nose at the establishment Republican Party , insulting its leaders and openly mocking any efforts it might make to reach out to women and minorities in order to solve its demographic problems .And then comes Fox News .Fox News is often described as the media arm of the GOP .But over the years it has seemed more like the GOP is the political arm of Fox News .It was Roger Ailes and Rupert Murdoch who decided which candidates would appear on stage .It was Fox News ' Megyn Kelly who determined the lines of attack each candidate would face , and which ones would face an easier road than others .It was Fox News that controlled the post - debate spin .In all of this , the actual Republican Party seems to be an utter bystander at its own event .Of course , there 's the spectacle the Koch Brothers and Shelden Adelson have made of their willingness to buy candidates outright and set up their own shadow field and campaign arms separate from the GOP .And now comes the RedState forum .Erick Erickson has taken it upon himself to disinvite Donald Trump from the RedState forum .At first glance this might seem to be a boon to the GOP : national leaders desperately want to see the Trump \" bubble \" burst , and want to take the spotlight away from him in any way possible .But it 's still remarkable that in an election year when national Democratic leaders and the Clinton campaign made a decision to keep frontrunner Hillary Clinton away from the liberal Netroots Nation convention , it is the RedState forum itself that is disinviting the current Republican frontrunner .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.791595"}

'Here ' the Wisdom of the Crowds ' is part of a shared vocabulary , the book is the social object , and that is used by the members of the network as Stephen suggests .In this sense , it is more than a shared vocabulary they are using ( although they need that too ) , but the social object ( the resources and the wiki article ) are the social objects which are igniting and focusing their discussion .Without a campfire all you have is a bunch of tents setup and people wandering around disconnectedly .The campfire provides a place for people to congregate and interact .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.7671"}

'I 'm not entirely sure where this leaves us regarding social objects .Part of these blog posts is to help me think it through in a social manner , as all the above comments demonstrate .Rather like terms that become popular in academic circles the debate is often about whether they really add anything .Affordances was another such term , which once it moved beyond the strict Gibsonian interpretation became too loose for many people to be comfortable with .I take a fairly pragmatic stance on the use of such terms - do n't get bogged down in an exact definition , if you have an intuitive take on what they mean and it helps stimulate thought , debate , development or research then that 's good enough .And that 's where I am with social objects at the moment .Staree to Make Money with Pictures and Social Networking .Staree is owned by IZEA , who is known best by their ground breaking development of paid blog posts , tweets , and check - ins .IZEA launched this new development called Staree in May 2012 .Staree is all about pictures , and making money off of those pictures through Social Networking .You upload your pictures and share them through Facebook and Twitter .Advertisers pay Staree to place their ads with relevant pictures , and every time someone views you picture , you get paid .Apparently tons of celebrities signed up during the Beta phase , and now it is open to everyone .How Much Can I Make ?Hmmm , well , that is up in the air at the moment .The Staree blog says up to $ 2500 per year easily .Here is the catch , it all depends on how big of a Facebook or Twitter following you have .Therefore , celebrities stand to make much more than this .Staree bases this amount on a random account with what they say is a non - celebrity level fair following .What can not be ignored , however , is the comment left by a user stating he was posting regularly , had a decent following , and had only made five cents in the couple of weeks since he joined .Another commenter noted that he had over 300 pictures posted , with captions , and had no way of seeing how many views the pictures were getting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.133095"}
