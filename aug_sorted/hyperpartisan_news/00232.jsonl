{"text": "Throughout the Task Force investigation , Main Justice and the FBI have sought to balance their competing obligations to provide intelligence information to policymakers and to protect the criminal investigation .Department officials described this as a delicate , deliberative process in which the Department struggled to address the needs of the congressional committees and NSC while avoiding doing anything to compromise the criminal case .Department officials were no doubt well - intentioned in this regard , and they did try to set up procedures for reviewing proposed congressional or NSC briefings that would ensure that the criminal investigation would be protected .There Is Lingering Disagreement Between the FBI and Main Justice Concerning the Briefing of the NSC .Throughout the Task Force investigation , the FBI and Main Justice have disagreed over whether to brief the NSC on matters related to the intelligence and Task Force investigations .The Department Abandoned Previous Standards for Briefing Congress and the NSC During the Task Force Investigation .Past Departmental practices and policies for briefing Congress and the NSC were either abandoned or severely amended in the context of the intelligence and Task Force investigations .The Department also departed from its bright - line standard of resisting requests to share information about pending criminal investigations .There appeared to have been some initial confusion within the Department regarding the standard for determining what intelligence information would be briefed to Congress , since the information that was briefed at different points during 1997 did not conform to a consistent standard .Department officials need to establish a clear policy regarding standards for briefing Congress and the NSC on intelligence information .The Department also needs to promulgate standards for determining when information relating to criminal investigations may be briefed to Congress or the NSC .If the Department deviates from a bright - line policy of not commenting on pending criminal investigations and does not promulgate guidelines concerning such comment , it creates perilous circumstances for officials who conduct congressional briefings .The Department Needs to Improve Its Record - keeping for Congressional and NSC Briefings .We found that in contravention of FBI regulations and directives , the FBI lacks any organized , complete record of its congressional briefings related to the intelligence and Task Force investigations or the materials used for these briefings .The records memorializing what was briefed by the FBI are inadequate and no records exist at all of questions asked and responses provided during briefings .Main Justice records were no better .Conclusion .We have concluded that no single individual or decision is responsible for the array of problems that we found .Unless changes are made to address the broad spectrum of problems that we found , the difficulty that the Department experienced handling the materials in the intelligence and Task Force investigations will persist .The OIG report includes recommendations that we believe will help prevent the reoccurrence of the problems we found .However , such recommendations will only prove effective in the future through the good - faith , cooperative efforts of the individuals and entities within Main Justice and the FBI .Indeed , such efforts could have prevented many of the problems that arose between the Task Force and NSD and between Main Justice and the FBI .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.7993"}

Thomas Here I will present my findings in the form of a list of questions and answers focusing on loose ends and other points of interest in the case .I will list the questions first so that individual readers may more easily scroll down to topics of interest .Questions .What did Valerie Wilson aka Valerie Plame do at CIA ?What was the relationship between Plame , WINPAC , and the CPD ?Was Plame covert ?What was the motive behind the Niger forgeries ?What role did Italian intelligence play in the Niger forgery scandal ?What role did French intelligence play in the Niger forgery scandal ?What role did British intelligence play in the Niger forgery scandal ?How did the Niger forgeries spread through US intelligence files ?What role did the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence play in triggering the Niger forgery investigation ?Who gave a copy of the Niger forgeries to the IAEA ?How much did Joseph Wilson know about the forgeries when he spoke on CNN in March 2003 ?Did the Bush administration target Plame in retaliation against Joseph Wilson ?Who was the friend of Joseph Wilson who approached Robert Novak on the street the afternoon Novak talked to Richard Armitage ?Who at the Department of Justice assigned Patrick Fitzgerald to the probe ?Who was leaking information from the grand jury to the media ?Answers .What did Valerie Wilson aka Valerie Plame do at CIA ?In 1989 she reportedly started working at the CIA station in Athens as a talent spotter and recruiter for the Agency .In this capacity they say she initially posed as a State Department officer , using an Official Cover ( OC , referring to a cover which involves another US government agency and thus provides diplomatic immunity ) .But others have called attention to a report by former FBI agent Sibel Edmonds indicating that a year earlier the FBI was already aware that Brewster - Jennings had been compromised during a conversation between Marc Grossman and Turkish lobbyists under Bureau surveillance in a corruption investigation .She met Joseph Wilson at the Turkish embassy in Washington in early 1997 , married him a year later , and had two children .I have so far been unable to find any sources independent of Isikoff and Corn which discuss the JTFI .If my guess is correct , I would also suspect that CIA support of such a Joint Task Force would be determined by functional , task - oriented considerations rather than governed by the neat on - paper divisions between the CPD and other CIA units .Again , this is only a guess on my part , based on the minimal information about JTFI currently available .According to Isikoff and Corn , 284n : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.35477"}

{"text": "449 ]Recently released files reveal that the third photographer identified by Chambers , [ 450 ] ex-GRU agent [ 451 ] William Edward Crane admitted to the FBI that he photographed documents from the Treasury and State Department for Chambers in Baltimore .[452 ] .Grand jury .The Truman administration demanded that HUAC turn over the film , but Nixon refused .He allowed Justice Department officials to view the film , and gave them copies , but would not surrender the film until Justice supplied HUAC with copies of the sequestered Baltimore documents .With no other option , Truman Justice finally called Chambers to testify before a hastily - reconvened grand jury on December 6-more than 16 months after it had originally convened .That day , Hiss 's attorney Edward McLean gave the defense 's documents examiner , J.
