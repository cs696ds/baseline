Gregory .The defendant was not claiming that the judge 's instruction was wrong as to the current state of the law in Washington ; the defendant conceded that the instruction did reflect the court 's holding in Camara .Gregory was seeking a reversal of the holding in Camara , but none was forthcoming : ' We decline to overrule Camara , and conclude that the jury instructions here complied with due process .

{"text": "Asking the police or a jury to sort out what happened afterwards based on a \" he said / she said \" account puts an impossible burden on our law enforcement and judicial apparatuses .Sometimes feelings of regret are translated into feelings of \" being used , \" and sometimes feelings of \" being used \" are misinterpreted or purposefully misconstrued as \" rape .\" Unfortunately , it is the politically correct thing to urge young women to party like the guys -- without bothering to tell them about the regret asymmetry that separates the genders .Older male , much younger female .A false rape claim is less plausible when it involves peers around the same age because the likelihood of a consensual relationship is greater among same - age partners .When a teen girl below the age of consent accuses a middle - aged man of rape , there is no possibility of legal consent , and actual consent seems less likely than if she was having sex with a same - age boy .Moreover , the older man / young girl allegation is generally viewed as so terribly loathsome that the mantra \" guilty until proven innocent \" is truly a reality for this one .Even when a young woman beyond the age of consent accuses a middle - aged man of rape , the initial inclination is to assume he 's a lecherous old man , and that she would have no desire to have consensual sex with someone like that .Teen boy , older woman .Sometimes women ( they are often teachers ) who statutorily rape teen boys will twice victimize them by falsely accusing them of rape .Such tactic has facial plausibility , given the male - as - predator stereotype and the exploding hormones of teen boys .It is especially disturbing that a woman would , as the cliche goes , throw her callow young lover under the bus in order to save herself .If you are male and are a school teacher , a police officer , an ambulance paramedic , or a cab driver , you need to be especially vigilant .Police officers are at risk because some women charged with crimes lie about rape out of revenge or to claim that the charges were trumped up .Ambulance paramedics and cab drivers are sometimes targeted by delusional women or women looking for an excuse for some indiscretion ( refusing to pay a cab fare is a big one ) .Teachers are forced to interact with many girls who are experiencing significant emotional and hormonal changes and whose immature judgment allows them to do things a more mature person would n't do .The ease with which a false claim can be made is a concern for male teachers , and that profession , more than the others , is attuned to these dangers .This is often impossible to spot , at least initially .We 've reported here on a woman who sent a man to prison for five years because she was bored .Another woman tried to destroy the life of a man she did n't even know with a rape lie because he would n't give her a beer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.44887"}

Rick Perry grants pardons or the Court of Criminal Appeals issues rulings .McGowan 's wrongful imprisonment began in 1985 when a woman happened upon a burglary in progress at her apartment .After tying her up , a man raped the woman at knifepoint and loaded his car with several items stolen from her apartment , according to court documents .The victim eventually picked McGowan from a photo array of seven men , telling police she \" thought \" he was the attacker .Police pressed her , saying she must be certain and not \" just think it was him .\" That 's when she decided he \" definitely \" was the attacker , the woman testified in court .McGowan and his attorneys have said he was a victim of eyewitness misidentification .Innocence Project Co - Director Barry Scheck said police initiated a \" forced - choice response \" from the rape victim .Here 's a disturbing news story ( set forth below ) .A 19-year - old female , upset over an unfounded rumor that her 20-year - old ex - fiance kissed another girl , dumped him and waited several months before making a false rape claim against him .She claimed that he forced his way into the home they once shared , pushed her down on the sofa and sexually assaulted her .The next day officers came into the pub where the young man worked as a bartender and arrested him .\" I was arrested at work in front of colleagues and customers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.03032"}
