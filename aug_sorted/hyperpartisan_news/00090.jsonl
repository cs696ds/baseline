{"text": "Distinguishing Types of American Exceptionalism .American exceptionalism has at least three separate elements .First , the United States signs on to international human rights and humanitarian law conventions and treaties and then exempts itself from their provisions by explicit reservation , nonratification , or noncompliance .Second , the United States maintains double standards : judging itself and its friends by more permissive criteria than it does its enemies .Third , the United States denies jurisdiction to human rights law within its own domestic law , insisting on the self - contained authority of its own domestic rights tradition .No other democratic state engages in all three of these practices to the same extent , and none combines these practices with claims to global leadership in the field of human rights .The first variant of exceptionalism is exemptionalism .America supports multilateral agreements and regimes , but only if they permit exemptions for American citizens or U.S. practices .In 1998 , the United States took part in the negotiations for the International Criminal Court but secured guarantees that its military , diplomats , and politicians would never come before that court .The Clinton administration signed the treaty before leaving office , only to have the incoming Bush administration unsign it .3 The Bush administration then went on to negotiate agreements with allied countries requiring them to guarantee that they would not hand over U.S. nationals to the ICC .4 Over the Land Mines Treaty , America took part in negotiations but sought exemption for American military production and deployment of land mines in the Korean Peninsula .Exemptionalism , of course , is not confined to the domains of human rights - related treaties .U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change fits into the same pattern .6 Exemptionalism has also been on display in the war on terror in the U.S. insistence that while conditions of detention at Guanta \u00b4 namo and elsewhere will comply with Geneva Convention standards , interrogation procedures and determination of status will be determined by executive order of the president .Exemptionalism is not the same as isolationism .The same administration that will have nothing to do with the ICC is heavily engaged in the defense and promotion of religious freedom abroad , the abolition of slavery , the funding of HIV / AIDS relief , and the protection of victims of ethnic and religious intolerance in Sudan . 8 Nor is exceptionalism a synonym for unilateralism .An administration that will not engage on the ICC is insistently engaged with the UN and other allies on the issue of HIV / AIDS .Exemptionalism also involves the practice of negotiating and signing human rights conventions but with reservations .Thus the United States ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) in 1991 while exempting itself from the provisions banning the infliction of the death penalty on juveniles .9 America is not the only country to insist on this type of exemption .Saudi Arabia , for example , insists that international human rights convention language relating to free marriage choice and freedom of belief remain without effect in their domestic law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.83673"}
{"text": "Explaining American Exceptionalism .Realism .A realist explanation of American exceptionalism would begin with America 's exceptional global power since 1945 .Exceptionally powerful countries get away with exemptions in their multilateral commitments simply because they can .Human rights and humanitarian law instruments are weakly enforced in any event .The United States can exempt itself from the ICC -- and try to block its operation -- because no other country or group of countries has the power to stop it .No other state has the capacity to sanction the United States if it ducks compliance with the Vienna Law of Treaties , ignores the derogation procedures of human rights conventions , and delays ratification of other treaties for decades .On a realist account , support for international law and willingness to submit to its constraints would be in inverse relation to a state 's power .The less powerful a state , the more reason it would have to support international norms that would constrain its more powerful neighbors .The more powerful a state , the more reluctant it would be to submit to multilateral constraint .Support for international law is bound to be strongest among middling powers like France , Germany , and Canada , democratic states that already comply with multilateral rights norms in their own domestic rights regimes , and that want to use international law to constrain the United States .As Joseph Nye , Jr. , has put it , \" multilateralism can be used as a strategy by smaller states to tie the United States down like Gulliver among the Lilliputians . \"29 Thus for middling powers the cost of their own compliance with human rights and humanitarian law instruments is offset by the advantages they believe they will derive from international law regimes that constrain larger powers .For the United States the calculus is reversed .Moreover , as a country with a substantive commitment to the rule of law , not to mention vigilant human rights NGOs , the United States has to take treaty obligations seriously .Faced with strong domestic NGO lobbies seeking actual compliance with human rights treaties , administrations of both parties have rational reasons to endeavor to minimize the sovereignty constraints introduced by international human rights agreements .Realist explanations of this sort do help to explain why the United States would want to minimize the constraints imposed on it by a multilateral human rights and humanitarian law regime .A realist would argue that the United States seeks to maintain its power in a global order of states at the lowest possible cost to its sovereignty .In this , it behaves just like other states .The problem with realist explanations is that the United States has wanted to do much more than this .It has promoted the very system of multilateral engagements -- human rights treaties , Geneva Conventions , UN Charter rules on the use of force and the resolution of disputes -- that abridge and constrain its sovereignty .Realism alone can not account for the paradox of American investment in a system that constrains its power .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.28778"}

{"text": "The first of the two issues , the Americas as a region , is closely related to what has come to be known as the \" Western Hemisphere Idea \" ( WHI ) .As early as 1813 , Thomas Jefferson wrote that the governments to be formed in the nascent states , . will be American governments , no longer to be involved in the never - ceasing broils of Europe .The European nations constitute a separate division of the globe ; their localities make them a part of a distinct system ...America has a hemisphere to itself .It must have a separate system of interest which must not be subordinated to those of Europe ( in Callcott , 1968 : 14 ; my italics ) .According to Arthur P. Whitaker , Jefferson 's statement was \" the first flowering \" of the WHI ( Whitaker , 1954 : 29 ) .By WHI Whitaker refers to \" the proposition that the peoples of this Hemisphere stand in a special relationship to one another which sets them apart from the rest of the world ( Ibid . : 1 ) .\" Interestingly , the perception of being \" apart from the rest of the world \" does not necessarily imply the existence of a community of interests among the states of the Americas .In effect , implicit in this \" special relationship \" is the interplay not only of the new world 's states , but also of its two main sub regions\u00ada relationship that most of the times has been a contentious one .It is important to note this because it is common to equate western hemispherism with regional co - operation .For instance , Javier Corrales and Richard Feinberg define \" Hemispherism \" as \" the active attempt by nations in the hemisphere to redirect their foreign policies in favor of a closer and coordinated cooperation with one another ( in Corrales and Feinberg , 1999 : 2 ) .\" The focus is then often shifted to what are defined as formal institutions of co - operation , such as the OAS or the Inter - American Development Bank .But as Whitaker himself made clear in his seminal text , \" the distinction between the idea and its various political expressions ... should be constantly kept in mind ( Whitaker , 1954 : 5 ) .\" The precision is significant because it makes clear that the \" idea \" refers to patterned interaction per se , not to co - operation .It is the \" Idea \" as a normative structure producing order in the sociological sense , more than as its institutional manifestations producing co - operation , that interests me ( Wendt , 1999 : 251 . )I thus take the WHI as normative structure to be the dialectical interplay of the Americas as a region , and of the two sharply contrasting regions within it .By producing and reproducing both the fundamental\u00adand often contradictory\u00advalues holding the region together , and a social order among the members of the hemisphere , the interplay gave rise to a distinctive idea of state sovereignty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.31749"}

{"text": "Increasing integration of economic and security policy across the North Atlantic does not necessarily produce convergence in political vision or rights policy .Finally , Paul Kahn is probably the most intransigent believer in the unchanging nature of American exceptionalism .In his analysis , exceptionalism will endure because it is so deeply tied to the American commitment to sovereignty as an ideal of republican self - rule born of a revolutionary act of national self - creation .Whether exceptionalism is an enduring or a passing phenomenon , it remains to determine whether it is a good or a bad thing .Here too the contributors divide sharply and so has academic debate .From the 1950s through the 1970s , the liberal academic consensus held American exceptionalism to be a very bad thing indeed .The liberal international lawyers , like Thomas Franck and Louis Henkin , who believed passionately in America 's role as a creator of international law , regarded American withdrawal from the international human rights drafting table from 1953 onward with unqualified dismay .43 They believed that international law could not develop without American leadership , and they believed that the international order should reflect American values .Yet this liberal consensus never went unchallenged .It always faced opposition from an influential strand of conservative and nationalist legal thinking , represented in the American Bar Association , some of whose chief members , suspicious of international law and of international organizations , led the opposition to the Genocide Convention and other international agreements .44 Beginning in the 1980s , a conservative legal counterattack gained ground , taking a strongly Americanist or nationalist view of international law .Academic lawyers like John Bolton , Jeremy Rabkin , and Jack Goldsmith questioned the liberal assumption that American rights conduct needed to measure up to international standards .For conservative nationalists , the most powerful state can not be tied down , like Gulliver , by international human rights norms .Its effectiveness as a world leader depends on being free of such constraints .Besides , its rights performance at home does not stand in need of lessons from abroad .The conservatives did more than defend American national pride and national interest .They raised a key argument of principle : why should a republic , based in the rule of law , be constrained by international agreements that do not have the same element of democratic legitimacy ?In addition to a \" nationalist \" justification for exceptionalism , conservatives offer a \" realist \" argument as well .Far from being a problem , exceptionalism might be a solution .46 Exceptionalism , therefore , achieves a balance : the United States remains within the framework of international human rights law , but on its own terms .Given its preponderant power -- and therefore its exceptional influence in the global order -- it can dictate these terms .The rest of the world can choose to concede these exceptional terms , or to see the United States stand aside and take either a unilateralist or an isolationist turn .Exceptionalism is the functional compromise , therefore , that enables America to be a multilateral partner in the human rights enterprise .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.98282"}

{"text": "This point can be illustrated by the most controversial issue at stake , discussed by Carol Steiker in her contribution , the death penalty statutes enforced in twenty - eight American states .The contrast between American and European practice on the death penalty may depend on the institutional power that American voters possess in defining the balance between individual rights and collective moral preferences .Capital punishment has been abolished in most European societies not because electoral majorities support abolition -- most polls across Europe indicate continuing support -- but because political elites , especially ministers of the interior or home affairs , do not want the moral burden of ordering executions .These moral scruples are in direct contradiction to the expressed preferences of their own citizens .If this is true , then the European human rights conventions that sustain the abolition of capital punishment are playing an antimajoritarian role in counterbalancing electoral preferences .It seems unlikely that international rights conventions or instruments could ever play such a role in the United States .Rights in America are the rules that a democratic polity constructs to define the scope of public authority .American exceptionalism may be anchored in a fundamental difference with other democratic states about the appropriate relation between rights and majority interests , and in turn the relation between rights and national identity .From an American perspective , rights can not be separated from the democratic community they serve ; they are enforced by that community , and their interpretation must therefore depend solely on the institutions of that community .America is not the only powerful state that has articulated its identity in terms of its rights and believed in a special mission to export its vision of government .From Napoleon onward , France sought to export its legal culture to neighbors and colonies as part of a civilizing mission .34 The British Empire was sustained by the conceit that the British had a special talent for government that entitled them to spread the rule of law to Kipling 's \" lesser breeds . \"35 In the twentieth century , the Soviet Union advanced missionary claims about the superiority of Soviet rule , backed by Marxist pseudoscience .Indeed the United States and the Soviet Union each battled for the allegiance of developing nations by advancing messianic claims about the universal validity of their own rights systems .The Soviets sought to convince newly independent countries in Africa and Asia of the superiority of Soviet social and economic guarantees , while the Americans insisted that civil and political rights , guaranteeing property and political participation , were the sine qua non of development .Viewed against this historical perspective , what is exceptional about American messianism is that it is the last imperial ideology left standing in the world , the sole survivor of imperial claims to universal significance .All the others -- the Soviet , the French , and the British -- have been consigned to the dustbin of history .This may help to explain why a messianic ideology , which many Americans take to be no more than a sincere desire to share the benefits of their own freedom , should be seen by so many other nations as a hegemonic claim to interference in their internal affairs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.89556"}

We ca n't \" go back to business as usual \" - a universally endorsed principle at all times .As Thomas Frank famously pointed out in his 2004 book \" What 's the Matter With Kansas ? \" conservatives thrived for many years by stoking the fires of popular resentment against ( usually unnamed ) elitists who sneer at religion , pursue bizarre sexual practices , join the ACLU but diss the Boy Scouts , burn the flag in their spare time and so on .Then these conservatives cry \" class war \" when liberals try , with little success , to redirect the populist rhetoric against its more traditional targets of bankers , Wall Street , and big business CEOs .But just lately - because of the financial crisis of 2008 , the scandals that went with it and growing income inequality - financial class - war arguments are gaining more traction and the cultural class war has almost disappeared .When you 've been laid off and your kids have moved back into your house after college because they ca n't find a job either , you start to lose interest in whether or not the National Endowment for the Arts is financing smutty pictures .My problem with his speech is that the president muddles together a variety of very different categories .There are out - and - out crooks and shysters .There are clever financiers who manipulated the rules and took advantage of loopholes - and ought to be thoroughly ashamed of themselves - but did nothing illegal .There are the very , very rich - the notorious 1 % , or 1 % of 1 % - who have benefited from changes in the economy that they may or may not have had any control over .Below these people in the Obama taxonomy is the great middle class , who just want to work hard and be rewarded with sufficient means to raise their families , own a house and send their kids to college .Below them , although not dwelt upon , are the genuinely poor : the homeless , single mothers on welfare , old folks with chronic diseases and so on .Off to the side and surprisingly unmentioned by the president are the holy men and women of American capitalism , small - business owners .They are deserving of every tax break and , by definition , can do no wrong .For every group Obama criticizes , he also has a \" to be sure \" passage in which he tries to make clear that he 's not talking about you .But if you listen to the music , not the words , you might well think otherwise .A wish to raise taxes on top - bracket taxpayers does not prove that you \" hate the rich \" or that you 're trying to stoke the fires of class warfare .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.21437"}

{"text": "Indeed , it is doubtful that the framework would exist at all if it did not allow latitude for countries to protect the specificity of their legal and national traditions .While European states also ratify with reservations and exceptions , they question whether a U.S. exemption on the right to life -- a core human rights principle -- can be justified .11 Allowing a state to pick and choose how it adheres to such a central principle threatens to empty international conventions of their universal status .Moreover , exemptionalism turns the United States into an outlier .The United States now stands outside an abolitionist consensus vis - \u00e0 - vis capital punishment that applies to all democratic states and most nondemocratic ones , with the exception of China .Even when the United States ratifies international rights conventions , it usually does so with a stipulation that the provisions can not supersede U.S. domestic law .13Thus , with a few exceptions , American ratification renders U.S. participation in international human rights symbolic , since adopting treaties does not actually improve the statutory rights protections of U.S. citizens in domestic law .Exemptionalism also takes the form of signing on to international rights conventions and then failing to abide by their requirements .The U.S. record of treaty compliance is no worse than that of other democracies , but because of the superpower 's exceptional political importance , U.S. forms of noncompliance have more impact than those of less powerful states .Examples of noncompliance include failing to inform UN human rights bodies when derogating from treaty standards ; failing to cooperate with UN human rights rapporteurs seeking access to U.S. facilities ; and refusing to order stays of execution in compliance with the Vienna Treaty on Consular Obligations .14 Both the Canadian and German governments have sought stays of execution for their nationals in U.S. courts , on the grounds that these nationals were convicted without prior access to their consular officials .Neither Virginia nor Texas paid any attention to these foreign requests , and these states allowed the executions to proceed .A third element of exemptionalism is the practice of negotiating treaties and then refusing to ratify them altogether or ratifying them only after extended delays .For example , the Senate refused to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child , leaving the United States the only nation besides Somalia not to do so .The United States took nearly forty years to ratify the Genocide Convention .16 Failure to ratify does n't mean that the United States fails to comply : no one has complained that the United States is currently guilty of genocide .Nor does failure to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child mean that standards of child protection in the United States are as poor as those of the other nonratifier , Somalia .17 Nonratification simply means that U.S. child advocates can not use international standards in domestic U.S. litigation .Likewise , U.S. refusal to ratify the Convention on Eliminating Discrimination against Women does not leave American women without protections and remedies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.06071"}

'The attorney explained to the guy why he was being charged for assault .The attorney told the defendant that he understood the other guy attacked him .He understood he knocked the other guy down in self - defense .It was when the defendant kicked the other guy while he was down that he 'd crossed the line from defending himself .That was when he had become the aggressor .That is why he was being charged with assault .Oh BTW , it did n't help that the defendant told the arresting officer that he ' wanted to get his licks in . 'Wanting to punish someone for daring to attack you is one of the fastest ways of crossing the line .In closing let us point a some VERY important points .In the eyes of the law , it is n't you vs. some dirt bag who does n't deserve to live .It 's two citizens in dispute .Two citizens with equal rights and protection under the law .And if you have left the square of self defense then you have transgressed against that other citizen 's rights .You will be prosecuted as the aggressor or for having participated in mutual conflict .Roughly 99 % of the time , when the cops arrive at a situation , it is the aggressor who is standing over loser .Very rarely does the aggressor say \" Yeah , I threw him a beating because he pissed me off , \" if the assault is n't out right denied , it is invariably justified as ' self - defense . 'You have a lot of work ahead of you to prove it was self - defense .Before you decide you know what is and what is n't self - defense get some training on use of force .At the very least , consult with an attorney .If you ever DO find yourself in a self - defense situation be prepared to go to court and spend thousands of dollars -- just to stay out of county jail or prison .And you 'd BETTER be able to explain both the police , attorneys , judge and jury why what you did WASN'T stepping out of the self - defense square .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.736435"}

Brian Dubie told Channel 3 News , \" When a person is sexually assaulted , a minor is sexually assaulted , it 's my opinion that they should go to jail for 25 years . \"He added , \" That 's very simple and that 's what Jessica 's Law calls for .\"Agreeing with Dubie , on July 10 , Gov. James Douglas said the state should pass stronger laws against sex offenders , including Jessica 's Law , civil commitment , strengthening the state 's sex offender registry , chemically castrating sex offenders and returning the death penalty to Vermont .However , the Democrats - who control the Legislature - only seem to be interested in investigating what went wrong with the judicial system 's handling of Jacques and not passing any new laws .Thus , Douglas is not planning on calling for a special session , as it would not accomplish much .Douglas spokesman Jason Gibbs said \" Sen. Shumlin and Speaker Symington have made it very clear that they oppose an immediate special session for the purposes of strengthening our sex offender laws .It would therefore be unproductive for the governor to call a special session without the support of the legislative leadership . \"Symington said a special session would be used to investigate why current laws \" are not being enforced by the Douglas administration , \" before the Legislature considers new laws .Symington , a candidate for governor , said if elected she would launch a \" thoughtful review \" of the state sex offender laws .In the end , as Bill O'Reilly notes , \" Vermont has become a secular progressive enclave - a state that believes in restorative justice , that is healing for the criminal as well as the victim . \" So far , the Democratic / Progressive Legislature seemingly cares more for the rights of the offender than the helpless children the molesters scar for life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "128.7265"}
