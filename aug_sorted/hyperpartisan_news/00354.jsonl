{"text": "Notice , by the way , that the statute allows deadly force only when \" immediately necessary \" to effect an arrest .If Michael Brown had his hands up and was clearly and obviously attempting to surrender , then deadly force would not be justified and the shooting would be second - degree murder .Notice further that the statute also provides a defense where the officer has a \" reasonable belief \" that certain facts exist - that would seem to provide a defense where the officer reasonably , but mistakenly , believed that he was facing a threat of serious physical harm .Missouri law also makes clear that the police officer has no \" duty to retreat \" when attempting to make an arrest .So , if justification exists ( and I set to one side the issue of who bears the burden of proof on the issue and by what standard ) , then even though an intentional killing has occurred , no crime has been committed .But what about an intermediate case , such as where an officer acts in what he thinks is a need for self - defense but misjudges the need to use deadly force ?In that situation , Missouri law ( like other states around the country ) recognizes a mitigation described as \" imperfect self - defense .\" This reduces a crime that would otherwise be murder down to involuntary manslaughter .See , e.g. , State v. Frost , 49 S.W.3d 212 , 220 - 21 ( Mo.Ct .App .In situations where the officer acted recklessly , the crime would be a Class C felony .In situations where the officer acted with criminal negligence , the crime would be a Class D felony .Also thrown into that mix , of course , will be the testimony of the eyewitnesses to the incident , and that 's one area where the prosecution could find itself with a problem .Even while the investigation of this case is still in its infancy , we have already been deluged with various reports of statements from purported eyewitnesses to the events of August 9th in the media .Nearly all of these accounts differ in some respect or another .Some say that Brown had has back turned at the time the shots were fired , others say that he was facing the officer .Still more of these reports say that Brown had his hands raised as if he was surrendering , while others dispute that .The closest thing we 've gotten so far to a statement from Officer Wilson same in the form of someone who claims to be a friend who said that Brown told her that final shots came when Brown started rushing at the officer with his head down .Some of these accounts can potentially be reconciled with what we know about the autopsy reports , some of them quite simply can not .Most important , though , is the fact that there seem to be enough contradictions in these stories that it would potentially create the reasonable doubt that would acquit Officer Wilson at trial .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.78292"}

{"text": "Introduction to differentiability in higher dimensions .Suggested background .Review of differentiability in one - variable calculus .You learned in one - variable calculus that a function $ f : \\R \\to \\R$ ( confused ? ) may or may not be differentiable .In fact , a function may be differentiable at some places but not in others .Consider the function $ r(i)$ that gives the output rate $ r$ of a neuron as a function of its input $ i$. A neuron communicates to other neurons by sending output pulses ( or \" spikes \" ) to other neurons .For simplicity , we only keep track of the rate $ r(i)$ of these spikes .Since a negative rate is n't meaningful , we know that $ r(i ) \\ge 0$. Only when the input exceeds some threshold $ I_0 $ does the neuron begin emitting output spikes .The output rate increases as $ i$ increases , as illustrated in this graph of $ r(i)$. ( The curve levels off for high values of $ i$ because there is a limit on how fast the neuron can emit output spikes .For example , the limit might be 200 spikes per second . )By differentiable , we mean that we can fit the graph of $ r(i)$ with a ( non - vertical ) tangent line .The graph of $ r$ has a kink there , so no matter what line we chose , it will fail to match the graph on either the left or the right side of $ I_0$. We can find a particular value of the slope $ m$ so that the line $ L(i)$ is a very good approximation for $ r(i)$ when $ i$ is close to $ a$. For this particular value of $ m$ , the line $ L(i)$ is called the the linear approximation to $ r(i)$ around $ a$. This line is , of course , the tangent line to $ r$. You 've learned other definitions of the derivative of a function , but you could just as well define it as the slope of this linear approximation .This is , in effect , how we will define the derivative in higher dimensions .Differentiability in two dimensions .The purpose that long - winded review of one - variable differentiability was to recast the derivative into the language we will use for multivariable differentiability .To illustrate , let 's modify our neuron example .In turns out many neurons have \" receptors \" built right into them that respond to nicotine .For these neurons , the presence of nicotine alters their behavior .( Needless to say , many in the medical community are interested in the nicotine receptors as nicotine is a common drug of addiction . )We can model the effects of nicotine by defining a new function $ r : \\R^2 \\to \\R$ that gives the neural response as a function of both input $ i$ and nicotine level $ s$.

{"text": "Applet loading .Neuron firing rate in response to input and nicotine levels .A fictitious representation of the firing rate $ r(i , s)$ of a neuron in response to an input $ i$ and nicotine level $ s$. The firing rate increases with input $ i$ , but it increases more slowly as $ s$ increases .The firing rate is zero below a threshold input that decreases with $ s$. This leads to a fold in the surface that describes the function $ r(i , s)$.One of the first things you may notice is that the surface $ r(i , s)$ is smooth except for a fold or crease along a line .This fold is compoosed of those points where , for a given nicotine level $ s$ , $ r(i , s)$ suddenly becomes nonzero as you increase the input $ i$. The fold is analogous to the kink at $ I_0 $ that we saw in the original curve , above .We want to define a notion of differentiability for our multivariable function $ r(i , s)$.As in the one - variable case , the function $ r(i , s)$ may be differentiable at some points and not at others .Our definition of differentiability should distinguish the fold in the surface from the smooth parts of the surface .To be consistent with the one - variable case , the function $ r(i , s)$ should fail to be differentiable along the fold .The definition of a tangent plane is analogous to the definition of a tangent line .On the other hand , if we tried to fit a plane at a point where the surface folds ( e.g. , the point shown by the red dot ) , we would never succeed .The plane will fail to match the graph on one side of the fold or the other .Hence the function $ r(i , s)$ is not differentiable at any point along the fold .Applet loading .Neuron firing rate function with tangent plane .A fictitious representation of the firing rate $ r(i , s)$ of a neuron in response to an input $ i$ and nicotine level $ s$. The graph of the function has a tangent plane at the location of the green point , so the function is differentiable there .By rotating the graph , you can see how the tangent plane touches the surface at the that point .You can move the green point anywhere on the surface ; as long as it is not along the fold of the graph ( where the red point in constrained to be ) , you can see the tangent plane showing that the function is differentiable .There is no tangent plane to the graph at any point along the fold of the graph ( you can move the red point to any point along this fold ) .The function $ r(i , s)$ is not differentiable at any point along the fold .As further evidence of this non - differentiability , the tangent plane jumps to a different angle when you move the green point across the fold .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "138.16124"}
