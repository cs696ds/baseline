{"text": "The transmogrification of Nimr into a sectarian / geopolitical football was inevitable .But the real question is , who was Nimr al - Nimr ?What did he really believe in and advocate ?Almost no one with an opinion about him today on Twitter or Facebook has any real idea .The answer is not to be found on mainstream news or social media .As it happens , there is a CIA telegram cable ( 08RIYADH1283_a ) detailing an interview of Nimr in 2008 by intelligence and diplomatic personnel .This cable is now public domain thanks to Wikileaks , and contains a detailed background on Nimr , the results of the interview , and analysis .The entire cable is absolutely a must - read , but I will excerpt two sections : the executive summary , and final commentary .Despite this more moderate tone , Al - Nimr reasserted his ardent opposition to what he described as the authoritarianism of the reactionary al - Saud regime , stating he would always support \" the people \" in any conflict with the government .He also continued to argue for the right of the Saudi Shi'a community to seek external assistance if it were to become embroiled in a conflict .The Sheikh was also cognizant of the increased profile that his strong language has earned him , saying that his fiery words continue to attract interest from an increasing percentage of the Shi'a community , particularly young people .END SUMMARY .Background on al - Nimr ( Sections 2 , 3 ) Al - Nimr on his Loyalties ( Section 4 ) Al - Nimr on Iran , the United States ( Sections 5 - 8 ) Al - Nimr on the Saudi Arabian Government ( SAG ) ( Sections 9 - 12 ) .Then , the final commentary : .On the sensitive topic of Iran , however , the Sheikh eagerly attempted to divorce himself from the image of being an Iranian agent .Likewise , the Sheikh was much more complimentary of the U.S. - perhaps even somewhat disarming in his recounting of U.S. foreign policy in World War II , the Cold War , and the Carter administration - than he has been previously portrayed .Though it is certainly possible that al - Nimr changed his tune on these issues for the company of a U.S. diplomat , the pace , passion and certainty with which he spoke seemed to reflect true belief , and not cold political calculation or manipulation .In any case , his ideas seem to be internally contradictory .It is perhaps this reality that leads some local analysts to believe that al - Nimr would not hesitate to join Iranian agents in a possible uprising .( S / NF )Also notable for the purpose of predicting al - Nimr 's future behavior was his recognition of his own growing popularity , an observation supported by many in the community .Post contacts have described al - Nimr as someone who in previous years was largely an apolitical religious figure , and is still a secondary player in local politics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.66568"}
{"text": "Alas , the terrorists were Arabs , not Afghans .In any event , very few Taliban leaders have been captured or killed .Neither the leader of the Taliban ( Mullah Omar ) nor Osama Bin Laden have been arrested .Saudi Arabia and the other sponsors of the Taliban and Al Qaeda have paid virtually no price for the September 11 attacks .We do not know what the prisoners held in Guantanamo are telling the USA .Not a single word has been revealed , other than generic warnings against possible terrorist attacks ( none of which ever occurred ) .Journalists have not been allowed to interview the prisoners ( journalists are usually the ones who find out important facts in the USA ) .This is raising the suspicion that the Bush administration has simply something to hide and does not want the world ( and particularly Americans ) to hear what these prisoners have to say .The main success in the war against terrorism has come on the financial front : the main sources of Al Qaeda 's funding ( almost all related to Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states ) have been disrupted .It is now official that the World Trade Center will not be rebuilt .Ever .The terrorists won this war , no matter what Bush or others claim ( they created the terror they wanted to create , they destroyed what they wanted to destroy , and they are even still at large ) .Bush has approached a number of foreign policy issues in an arrogant way , going as far as to defy the United Nations .This has squandered the capital of world sympathy that the USA gained on September 11 .The US makes no mystery that its next target is Iraq .While Iraq is not directly linked to the September 11 attacks , and does not support any terrorist organization , the US feels that Iraq is potentially the number one terrorist state .This is causing a major distraction to the war against terrorism , as if the Bush administration wanted to keep Americans from realizing the many failures of that war .( July 2002 )Who did it ?More and more evidence ( from both Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Britain and Germany ) seems to prove that Osama did not plan and did not direct the September 11 attack .He knew and blessed it , but probably had nothing to do with the plan itself .So , technically speaking , the Taliban were right in requesting to see the evidence before surrendering Osama to the USA .Any country would have done the same : a man is innocent until proven guilty .The US never produced that evidence .We now know why : the evidence against Osama did n't and does n't exist .George W Bush demanded the surrender of Osama regardless of the international law , and even destroyed the Taliban for not obeying his orders .This played well with the American public , thirsty for blood and revenge , but , ultimately , it may backfire against the USA .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.81453"}
