Ron Johnson , a conservative businessman who came out of the Tea Party movement .Johnson , who like McFadden had no political experience before running for Senate , defeated Democrat Russ Feingold for the seat in 2010 and has been a reliable party vote ever since .It 's a wide swath of support in two days for the Republican challenger to Democratic Sen. Al Franken , whom McFadden constantly blasts for voting with President Obama 97 percent of the time .The moves allow McFadden to appeal to independent voters in the middle while also cultivating the GOP base by aligning with a Republican who ousted a liberal icon on his first try .Straddling that divide between right and center could prove critical to McFadden 's chances . \"As an elected official from a neighboring state , Ron Johnson has a certain amount of credibility that he lends to McFadden . \"Standing next to Johnson on Tuesday , McFadden ditched his trademark campaign uniform of jeans and casual button - down for a crisp navy suit , looking every the part the senator .Johnson took questions for about six minutes before McFadden appeared .Asked whether more ground troops are needed in Iraq and Syria in the wake of news of a second American journalist 's beheading by terrorists , Johnson stopped short of giving a direct answer .\" We currently have boots on the ground , so I recognize the reality ; we need to understand that ISIS is a growing threat , \" Johnson said .\" It just highlights again what barbarians these people are . ...I do n't envy the president and his task in this .These are complex issues and a complex area of the world , and it 's been that way for decades .\" McFadden , asked separately , was more direct .\" I do n't support boots on the ground , not at this point , \" he said .\" I do support the continuation of strategic bombing in Iraq and potentially in Syria , if necessary .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.18306"}
