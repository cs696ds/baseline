Rick Perry announced a decision last week to deploy up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the Texas - Mexico border over the next month to combat what he said were criminals exploiting a surge of children pouring into the U.S. illegally .Asked about that , Brown said : \" I hesitate to comment on the thinking that goes into the sending of the Texas National Guard to the border .I would suspect that it would be of relatively short duration and that wiser minds will prevail in the next several months .\" Brown acknowledged the immigration surge has become politicized , and said \" my goal is to try as much as I can to frame the issue of the children as a humanitarian challenge .That should appeal to people of all political persuasions . \"California Attorney General Kamala Harris said Thursday she is helping secure lawyers to represent minors during immigration hearings .Meade , meanwhile , said few of the Central American migrants apply for asylum in Mexico because they are trying to join relatives in the United States .While many migrants , especially those from Honduras and El Salvador , say they are fleeing gang - related violence in their home countries , less than one in 60 of those caught in Mexico in 2013 asked for asylum in Mexico .The numbers for the first six months of 2014 show only a slight uptick , with about one of 50 requesting asylum .Of those applications , about 20 percent to 25 percent have been approved in recent years .\" The fundamental goal , in many cases , is ( family ) reunification .That means the migrant 's desire is really not to stay in Mexico , \" Meade said .\"That explains why there are so few ( asylum ) requests in Mexico . \" Brown later met privately with President Enrique Pena Nieto to discuss immigration and other topics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.82594"}

Bush twice deployed National Guard troops to the border to help augment the Border Patrol as it bolstered its ranks .The agency has more than doubled in size since then , with more than 21,000 agents .While troops were deployed , they were prohibited under federal law from performing law enforcement duties and instead conducted surveillance and helped with maintenance issues .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "51.267937"}

{"text": "Boehner and McConnell are jokes .Broder is one of the only \" journalists \" left , and he 's being called out by a four paragraph , embedded Democrat ranter because he is n't sufficiently partisan ?Apparently , to Sargent , there are good guys and bad guys in the Senate and the role of the media is to classify them properly , damn it !That task is easy to Sargent : Democrats , good - Republicans , bad .What a jerk you are Sargent .Could it have possibly passed your Democrat shill masquerading as journalist , pea - brain that Broder thinks there is plenty of blame to go around ?Sargent ... your problem is you think you 're ' really smart ' because some of your smarmy pseudo - journalist peers said you were smart in publications read only by smarmy jerks who think they 're smart .Your problem is obvious ... you're too young ... you have n't got a whole lot of experience ... your world still has too much black and white and not enough gray .I 'd say your charge ahead style is refreshing ...but you do n't really DO anything ... you just run your pie - hole a lot ... or should I say type a lot .Go run something that has real people involved .Make something ...BUILD something other than your own puerile ego .Get some perspective other than your own ' look at me ' sense of immediate self - gratification .I used to respect David Broder but he seems to have become an ossified , pale imitation of what he used to be ... predictable , stodgy , and not very enlightening or adding much to the dialogue or analysis .... he 's become irrelevant IMO .It 's probably the wrong question , Greg , because people 's attachment to the \" rightness \" of their cause runs pretty deep .Every journalist could stand up and call out the Republican party , but every self - identified republican out there will perform backflips to deny that alien idea .Self - identified democrats would do the same .Party politics , reinforced by the ease with which we can screen out contrary opinion and consume a steady diet of how right we are , has become more than just a set of policy prescriptions we believe in .It 's become who we are , and defines our own sense of identity .And it 's an amazingly skewed , distorted source of identity .Because the truth is , no matter how politically opposite I am from my neighbor , I will always have far more in common with him that I have differences .In our isolated cocoons , it 's very easy to forget that , but it 's the truth .When we inflate political ideology to the extent that we lose sight of our commonalities , we lose the ability to communicate .So sure , blame the republicans , blame the democrats , blame the media .Whether or not we see everything through the lens of ideology is a choice that each one of us makes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "120.54674"}
