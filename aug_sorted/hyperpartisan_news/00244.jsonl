Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) to help push potential first - timers past the finish line in 2006 .That year , Wasserman Schultz formed friendships with now Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D - N.Y. ) , who won a House seat in upstate New York , and with Rep. Gabrielle Giffords ( D - Ariz . ) , who won an Arizona seat .That helped Democrats gain the House that year and won Wasserman Schultz the chief deputy whip job in her second term , and the plum spot on the Appropriations Committee .It also led to close friendships and regular lunches for the three relatively young female lawmakers .When an assailant shot Giffords in the head in January , Wasserman Schultz and Gillibrand were among the first to fly to her bedside .Giffords ' chief of staff , Pia Carusone , says that for Wasserman Schultz and Giffords , exploring their shared Judaism was critical .\" There are not that many women in office , and not so many Jewish women , so it has been a nice friendship , \" Carusone said .Wasserman Schultz - who in 2006 helped lead the way in getting May established as Jewish American Heritage Month - is seen as a team player .She was a strident leader in the 2008 primary campaign for Hillary Rodham Clinton , and easily shifted to Team Obama when Clinton withdrew .Republicans deride her as a partisan .Hours after the announcement that she 'd be the next party chair , the Republican Jewish Coalition issued a statement citing her connection with J Street to question her bona fides . \"In blindly conferring legitimacy on fringe groups like J Street , she has raised serious questions about her own credibility and judgment , \" RJC Executive Director Matt Brooks said .Wasserman Schultz has praised J Street a handful of times , and she had addressed the organization at least once .Capitol Hill insiders dismissed the flap as RJC politicking - Brooks ' statement resulted in immediate praise for Wasserman Schultz from AIPAC and from the Jewish Federations of North America .Off the record , Jewish leaders say Wasserman Schultz will ratchet up the pressure on the Jewish establishment to back Democratic initiatives .Eric Golub , a Jewish blogger for the conservative Washington Times , calls her the Democrats ' \" Jew shrew \" because of her partisanship .Wasserman Schultz , who battled and defeated breast cancer , often can be seen walking around Capitol Hill , one of her three young children by her side .\" She 's a mother of young children , so she gets the balancing , \" said Carol Brick Turin , the director of the Miami - area Jewish Community Relations Council .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.90929"}

Cloud from the Wall Street Journal is the first to mention ( other than Novak ) the existence of the 2002 CIA memo that purports to show that Plame recommended Wilson for the Niger mission .An internal government memo addresses some of the mysteries at the center of the White House leak investigation and could help investigators in the search for who disclosed the identity of a Central Intelligence Agency operative , according to two people familiar with the memo .The memo , prepared by U.S. intelligence personnel , details a meeting in early 2002 where CIA officer Valerie Plame and other intelligence officials gathered to brainstorm about how to verify reports that Iraq had sought uranium yellowcake from Niger .Soon after , midlevel CIA officials decided to send him , say intelligence officials .Classified memos , like the one describing Ms. Plame 's role , have limited circulation and investigators are likely to question all those known to have received it .Intelligence officials have n't denied Ms. Plame was involved in the decision to send Mr. Wilson , but they have said she was not \" responsible \" for the decision .So Cloud is relying on \" two people \" who had seen the memo , but presumably not himself .And the intelligence officials he spoke with subsequently did not deny ( which also means would not go on the record to confirm ) she was involved , but would go on the record to say she was not responsible for the decision .Other officials with knowledge of the memo would n't say if it mentions Ms. Plame by name as the one who suggested Mr. Wilson , or if her identity is shielded but obvious because of what is known now about the mission .Operations officers like Ms. Plame are sometimes identified only by their first names even in interagency meetings .My interpretation of this is that Cloud was told of the memo by \" two people \" who had seen it and then tried to get confirmation from sources at the CIA who would not confirm that Plame was even mentioned by name in said memo .October 21 , 2003 - Associate Deputy Attorney General Christopher Wray testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he regularly briefs the Attorney General about the progress of the investigation .This includes the names of the people being interviewed , and enough detail \" for him to understand meaningfully what 's going on in the investigation . \"( Lichtblau , NYT , Oct. 22 , 2003 ) .October 22 , 2003 - The Associated Press reports that two former CIA officers are asking the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate the leak .Jim Marcinkowski , a case officer in the late 1980 's and Larry Johnson , former State Department Deputy Chief of Counterterrorism , are concerned with the appearance of impropriety .Mr. Johnson said , \" there 's a lot they can do without undermining the criminal investigation . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.248276"}

{"text": "After his Chevy Chase story was debunked , Tanis - a Secret Service official who was known to be personally close to Bush - withdrew it .A Mysterious Alibi .That left Bush 's supposed afternoon trip on Oct. 19 as his key alibi .But there were problems with that story as well .In 1992 , when allegations of Bush 's secret trip to Paris in 1980 were being investigated , Republicans suggested that Democrats were simply trying to embarrass the then - President because the afternoon trip might have involved a rendezvous with a woman .Since Bush 's reelection campaign was matching up against Democrat Bill Clinton , who was under fire for his own womanizing , the GOP complaint boiled down to that the Democrats were looking for dirt against Bush to counter the dirt against Clinton .However , that Republican argument also fell apart when Mrs. Bush 's Secret Service records showed her participating in the afternoon trip .Given Barbara Bush 's presence , the idea of a romantic tryst certainly did n't make much sense .So , either Mrs. Bush had gone together with her husband or a sympathetic Secret Service official had used Mrs. Bush 's visit to a family friend to create another false cover story for George H.W. Bush .While keeping these details from the public , Bush angrily insisted that he be cleared of the Paris allegations .Congressional investigators looking into the 1980 suspicions were eager to comply , but there remained this peculiar refusal of the Bush administration to supply a confirmable alibi .In June 1992 , a compromise of sorts was struck .A few senior congressional investigators were given the identity of Bush 's mysterious host but only under the condition that they would never interview the alibi witness nor disclose publicly who it was .The deal may have represented the first time in investigative history that a suspect provided authorities an alibi witness with the proviso that the alibi not be checked out - and the investigators agreed .Maybe only a member of the Bush Family could pull that off .Evidence of a Paris Trip .Contradicting the shaky Secret Service records were several accounts of a Bush trip to Paris on the night of Oct. 18 , 1980 , and into the day on Oct. 19 .For instance , I informed the congressional investigators in 1992 about contemporaneous knowledge of the Bush - to - Paris trip provided to me by Chicago Tribune reporter John Maclean , son of author Norman Maclean who wrote A River Runs Through It .John Maclean said a well - placed Republican source told him in mid - October 1980 about Bush taking a secret trip to Paris to meet with Iranians on the U.S. hostage issue .After hearing this news in 1980 , Maclean passed on the information to David Henderson , a State Department Foreign Service officer .Henderson recalled the date as Oct. 18 , 1980 , when the two met at Henderson 's Washington home to discuss another matter .For his part , Maclean never wrote about the Bush - to - Paris leak because , he told me later , a Reagan campaign spokesman officially denied it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.34366"}
