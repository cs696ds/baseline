{"text": "In fact , the only year Republicans held a notable edge since Gallup began tracking independents ' political leanings was in 1991 , the year Republican President George H.W. Bush 's approval ratings soared after the United States ' victory in the Persian Gulf War .Democrats ' high point came in 2008 , in the final year of George W. Bush 's administration and the year Barack Obama was first elected president .However , the three - point Democratic advantage for all of 2014 obscures the change that occurred during the year .On a quarterly basis , Democrats started out 2014 with a five - point edge , similar to their advantage in 2013 .That dipped to two points by the third quarter .In the fourth quarter , likely in response to Republicans ' success in the 2014 midterm elections , Republicans held a slight advantage of one point .Since 2008 , Americans have been increasingly reluctant to identify with either the Republican or Democratic Party , and now a record 43 % claimed political independence in 2014 .Given historical trends , 2015 could bring a new record , as the percentage identifying as independents typically increases in the year before a presidential election , averaging a 2.5-point increase in the last six such years .Although Democrats typically have an advantage in partisanship , that edge shrunk in 2014 and in the last months of the year the parties were essentially on equal footing .With each party controlling part of the federal government - Democrats the presidency and Republicans the Congress - they each will have a say in how the nation addresses its major challenges in the coming year .However , in recent years divided control of government has more often than not resulted in partisan gridlock , and Americans ' frustration with the frequent political stalemate is evident .Continued frustration with the government would likely encourage more Americans to identify as independents this year .Survey Methods .Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted January - December 2014 , with a combined random sample of 16,479 adults , aged 18 and older , living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia .For results based on the total sample of national adults , the margin of sampling error is \u00b11 percentage point at the 95 % confidence level .All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting .Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 50 % cellphone respondents and 50 % landline respondents , with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region .Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random - digit - dial methods .New Emails Reveal Obama White House Worked on Concocting Benghazi Lie DURING the Attacks .The still classified Obama State Department email , according to Issa , shows that the Obama White House rushed to settle on the false narrative of the anti - Islamic YouTube video instigating the attacks , which was completely at odds with the conclusions reached by reports from the ground .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.49404"}

Marco Rubio ( R - Fla . ) , who spent $ 508 per vote and came in just behind Bush in fifth place .The tight grip of oligarchy upon the American political system slipped a little last night in New Hampshire .On the Democratic side , voters cast their ballots for one of the most implausible candidates in modern presidential history - less because his rhetoric was so mesmerizing or his program so inspiring than as a protest against an expected winner perceived as a lavishly compensated servitor of organized wealth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.13934"}

{"text": "That the three - point Democratic edge was down from six points in 2013 , and among Democrats ' smaller advantages the past 25 years .Democrats usually hold an advantage in this combined measure of party affiliation .In fact , the only year Republicans held a notable edge since Gallup began tracking independents ' political leanings was in 1991 , the year Republican President George H.W. Bush 's approval ratings soared after the United States ' victory in the Persian Gulf War .Democrats ' high point came in 2008 , in the final year of George W. Bush 's administration and the year Barack Obama was first elected president .However , the three - point Democratic advantage for all of 2014 obscures the change that occurred during the year .On a quarterly basis , Democrats started out 2014 with a five - point edge , similar to their advantage in 2013 .That dipped to two points by the third quarter .In the fourth quarter , likely in response to Republicans ' success in the 2014 midterm elections , Republicans held a slight advantage of one point .Since 2008 , Americans have been increasingly reluctant to identify with either the Republican or Democratic Party , and now a record 43 % claimed political independence in 2014 .Given historical trends , 2015 could bring a new record , as the percentage identifying as independents typically increases in the year before a presidential election , averaging a 2.5-point increase in the last six such years .Although Democrats typically have an advantage in partisanship , that edge shrunk in 2014 and in the last months of the year the parties were essentially on equal footing .With each party controlling part of the federal government - Democrats the presidency and Republicans the Congress - they each will have a say in how the nation addresses its major challenges in the coming year .However , in recent years divided control of government has more often than not resulted in partisan gridlock , and Americans ' frustration with the frequent political stalemate is evident .Continued frustration with the government would likely encourage more Americans to identify as independents this year .Survey Methods .Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted January - December 2014 , with a combined random sample of 16,479 adults , aged 18 and older , living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia .For results based on the total sample of national adults , the margin of sampling error is \u00b11 percentage point at the 95 % confidence level .All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting .Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 50 % cellphone respondents and 50 % landline respondents , with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region .Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random - digit - dial methods .New Emails Reveal Obama White House Worked on Concocting Benghazi Lie DURING the Attacks .The still classified Obama State Department email , according to Issa , shows that the Obama White House rushed to settle on the false narrative of the anti - Islamic YouTube video instigating the attacks , which was completely at odds with the conclusions reached by reports from the ground .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.28056"}

{"text": "Unfortunately the Democratic front runner holds essentially the same views , even if Clinton uses different rhetoric in appealing to Democratic as opposed to Republican primary voters .Bernie Sanders represents our best hope to both have a president who has not made the errors which destabilized the region , and who can inspire voters to turn out to defeat the Republicans in a general election .The above electoral map prediction from Western Illinois University has received a lot of attention , especially among supporters of Bernie Sanders , for showing Sanders winning in a landslide .Some argue that we should take this seriously because the mock election model has been right in every election it was used in since 1975 .The catch is that it was only used three times since 1975 .They deserve some credit for correctly predicting victories for Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford before many people had heard of Carter , and for predicting the election of Obama when many were ( as with Sanders now ) claiming he was unelectable .While I would love for this to be true , it is also very hard to accept the results in specific states , such as Sanders winning Mississippi and Georgia but losing in Hawaii and Maryland .Of course the claims of being right are limited to the final results and not accuracy of state by state predictions .A victory for Sanders , even if closer and involving a different set of states , would still be welcome .It is easy to dismiss this prediction , and I could not blame either Clinton or the Republicans for denying any meaning to it beyond the enthusiasm of college students for Sanders .The bigger question this year is whether we can believe the conventional polls , especially when they are being used to determine who qualifies for the debates , which can potentially influence the outcome .Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie have been eliminated from Tuesday 's main debate , along with George Pataki and Lindsay Graham being excluded from the undercard debate .Even some pollsters have argued that the polls should not be used in this manner .One problem is that the Republican candidates are too close together to use the polls to separate them .Then there is the question of whether the polls are all that accurate in predicting a primary election well before the vote .I 've followed the Democratic primaries far more closely , and have noted many times how little predictive value the polls have .This polling report from December 2007 described how Clinton had a huge lead over Obama .In December 2003 , Howard Dean was pulling away in the polls .Eventual winner John Kerry was in sixth place with only 4 percent , even trailing Al Sharpton .Among the problems with these polls , many voters in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire do not decide until the last minute .People are far more likely to switch between relatively similar members of their own party than they are to switch from a liberal Democrat to a conservative Republican in a general election .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.57863"}

Bush ( 33.2 % ) were decidedly unpopular at the same point of their presidencies .Truman 's 27 th quarter average is the worst quarterly average for any president in Gallup 's polling history .Obama 's 27 th quarter average , along with Ronald Reagan 's , is between these two extremes .Reagan averaged 47.0 % approval , slightly better than Obama 's 45.9 % .After presidents have served nearly seven years in office , Americans ' opinions of them are pretty well - established and unlikely to change unless a major international or domestic crisis occurs .Clinton 's and Bush 's approval ratings did not change between their 27 th and 28 th quarters .Truman , Eisenhower and Reagan saw modest improvements of a few percentage points .Implications .Americans ' opinions of Obama have been steady this year , holding near 46 % .Obama 's relatively low approval ratings may be as much a function of the era in which he is governing as it is a reflection on his leadership , management and decision - making .There have been relatively few international crises that helped to boost his public support , as the 9/11 attacks and Iraq War did for Bush , and as similar crises have done for other presidents .Arguably the only \" rally event \" in Obama 's presidency was the capture of Osama bin Laden .Obama also took office during the Great Recession , and the economic recovery since it ended has been slow and uneven .But Obama is also governing in a time of extreme partisan polarization .In Congress , that has meant political gridlock since Democrats lost control of the U.S. House in the 2010 midterm elections .In the American public , it is evident in his historically low support from the opposition party .Obama 's average 13 % approval rating among Republicans is on pace to be the lowest job approval rating from the opposition party by a full 10 percentage points , behind Bush 's average 23 % approval rating among Democrats .By comparison , Clinton averaged 27 % approval among Republicans , and presidents before Clinton averaged 40 % approval from the opposition .Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted July 20-Oct .19 , 2015 , on the Gallup U.S. Daily survey , with a random sample of 45,663 adults , aged 18 and older , living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia .For results based on the total sample of national adults , the margin of sampling error is \u00b11 percentage point at the 95 % confidence level .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.8236"}
