McGinty , who has devoted a task force of prosecutors and investigators to revisiting the old rape cases , says the elusive serial rapists represent the worst of the criminal world .Prosecuting these men is n't just comeuppance , he says .It 's purging the streets of what McGinty calls \" one - man crime waves \" -- violent perpetrators , whose rap sheets feature burglaries , robberies , domestic violence , gun crimes and felonious assaults .They are the one percent of criminals responsible for 99 percent of violent crime , McGinty often quips .\" We have a tremendous opportunity with these rape kits , \" he said during a recent interview .\" We were sitting on a gold mine for law enforcement , and we did n't know it .We have a chance to get a thousand dangerous Clevelanders -- who have raped people and committed many crimes -- off the streets and into the penitentiary where they belong . ...A lot of guys out there should be sweatin ' like a pig in the oven , because we 're going to find them . ...These people thought they could get away with it in these zones .This is not a place to be a serial rapist anymore .\"Untested evidence helped serial rape cases proliferate .The rape kits were not DNA tested previously for myriad reasons .When the 1993 rapes occurred , DNA testing was in its infancy and not widely available because of its high cost .In some high - profile cases , DNA was sent to the FBI or private labs .The state crime lab did n't offer testing until 1998 , and it was quickly overwhelmed with requests .The lab eventually discouraged law enforcement agencies from sending too many kits .At the local level , Cleveland officials have said they did not test kits in cases that lacked investigative leads or in which victims recanted reports or did n't cooperate with detectives .Those restrictions , however , inadvertently left rape kits from some of the most brutal attacks by strangers gathering dust on evidence room shelves , while many of the now - accused attackers continued on crime sprees , including subsequent rapes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.86989"}

'\" The Court held that the Sixth Circuit went astray by resolving the matter in favor of the physiatrist 's testimony which was an act overstepping its authority .Harvey Brian Cochran was convicted of reckless homicide , a Class D felony .On appeal , he argued that the trial court erred by failing to follow the sentencing guidelines before denying him an alternative sentence .An alternative sentence is any sentence that does not involve complete confinement .The CCA determined that Cochran was a favorable candidate for alternative sentencing because he was convicted of a Class D felony .Under T.C.A. \u00a7 40 - 35 - 101(6)(A ) , the burden therefore fell to the State to present \" evidence to the contrary . \"In determining whether such evidence exists , the trial court should consider the factors set out in T.C.A. \u00a7 40 - 35 - 103(1)(A)(C ) : whether confinement is necessary to protect society , avoid depreciating the seriousness of the offense , or deter others .The trial court should also consider whether less restrictive sentences have been applied unsuccessfully to the defendant in the past .Here , the trial court explicitly found that these factors did not apply , and the CCA saw nothing in the record on appeal to refute this finding .Nonetheless , the trial court denied alternative sentencing on the basis of lack of remorse or truthfulness as it related to Cochran 's potential for rehabilitation under T.C.A. \u00a7 40 - 35 - 103(5 ) .As the CCA explained , a defendant 's potential for rehabilitation should only be considered when determining the type and length of the alternative sentence once the court has ruled that complete confinement is improper .The Knoxville case involving disgraced former judge Richard Baumgartner moved forward last week with news that his defense attorneys , Don Bosch and Ann Short , filed a motion before U.S. Magistrate Judge Clifford Shirley asking that he declare the case \" complex . \"Though the name may seem odd and beside the point , it 's important to a case 's timeline .If a case is declared \" complex \" it will give the defense more time to review discovery submitted by the prosecution , postponing the currently scheduled July 18 trial .Bosch and Short told Judge Shirley that they had only begun to scratch the surface of the voluminous discovery turned over by the government .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.1579"}

Burdick , 2001 ME 143 , \u00b6 13 , 782 A.2d 319 , 324 ( stating that we review a sentence for obvious error if a challenge raised on appeal was not preserved during the sentencing proceeding ) .[\u00b621 ] Regarding the absence of reference to section 1256(3)(B ) , it bears repeating that neither the State nor the defendant addressed the issue , notwithstanding the opportunity to do so during a lengthy sentencing hearing .[ 10 ] Moreover , the defendant himself , through counsel , suggested a consecutive sentence of \" ten years tacked on top of something like ten years . \" The sentencing court accepted the defendant 's approach , rejecting the State 's call for a 100-year sentence and imposed forty years tacked onto ten years .[\u00b622 ]We have never required the sentencing judge to address each of the factors set out at section 1256(3 ) and explicitly negate them , and we do not do so now .1994 ) ( upholding consecutive sentences when court made express finding that efforts to kill victim were separate from gross sexual assault ) .[11 ] Therefore , the sentencing judge 's lack of reference to section 1256(3)(B ) is neither unusual , nor fatal to the sentence imposed .Pineo , 2002 ME 93 , \u00b6 14 , 798 A.2d at 1099 .[\u00b623 ]Addressing , then , the second issue , we can not conclude that the court 's imposition of consecutive sentences constituted obvious error .To do so , we would have to determine that the only purpose of the extended , violent , and terrorizing kidnapping was to obtain forced oral sex .The court could well have concluded that restraining , terrifying , controlling , and humiliating his victim were other purposes of Commeau 's well - planned kidnapping of his latest victim .Moreover , the continued restraint that occurred after the forced oral sex could not have been executed solely for the purpose of that sexual assault .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.12955"}

{"text": "Complicated issue .Will discuss in future post .Not a complicated issue at all , in fact I 'll give my own answer to that right now : .The main objection to harsh punishments for false accusers is that it makes them unlikely to come forward .I , however , have come up with a simple system to punish false accusers effectively while also leaving them with a solid incentive to recant their accusations .Anyone who falsely accuses anyone of a crime ( not just rape ) can voluntarily come forward to confess their false accusation at any time between when they made it and when / if they are formally charged with making it .This gives the false accuser a strong incentive to recant their accusation sooner rather than later and avoid a long prison sentence , and this in turn also spares the falsely accused from a lot of anguish .On the other hand , if the false accuser never comes forward and later on the police figure out that he / she fabricated the whole thing , they can formally charge that person and it is then too late to confess except in the form of a guilty plea .If the false accuser pleads not guilty , then the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant KNOWINGLY made a false accusation .Proof needed !Point me to objective , credible evidence of just a single example ( let alone \" most \" ) in which someone was convicted of a rape charge in court , sentenced to jail , and yet was nevertheless released free .One example will satisfy me for now ...Just name a single case .One .Unless , of course , your feminist ideology produced that bogus figure -- in which case please just admit to that and eat some humble pie right here in the comments section of your own blog .Admit it , David .You made the assumption that there is an epidemic of unpunished rapes because feminists have done surveys in which the survey respondents claim to have been raped but never reported it , or did report it but the suspect was never convicted .These surveys do not prove guilt , nor do they prove that a rape even occurred in the first place .Even if evidence indicates that a rape occurred and formal criminal charges are filed , remember that the accused pleads not guilty .Why should the accuser 's word have any more weight than the word of the accused , if you believe in a just society ?In a just society , we do n't throw people in jail unless they have been determined to have violated the law after receiving due process .If rape is really just about power , why are most rapes of women in their child bearing / fertile age ?Please do n't give me some story about a man who raped an 80 year old , I am talking overall trends .Overall trends ?Like women being the majority of rape victims ?( eye rolls ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.826035"}

{"text": "The decision came complete with three separate dissenting opinions authored by Justices Roberts , Alito , and Thomas .These dissents demonstrate that there was strong disagreement among the Justices about this case .In particular , Justice Alito read his dissent from the bench , an unusual occurrence that seems to demonstrate extremely strong disagreement with the majority ruling .Chief Justice Roberts cited the fact that there are currently an estimated 2,500 juveniles serving such sentences and that a majority of states impose such mandatory sentences .Thus , part of his argument is that they are in no way \" unusual \" .In the end he concludes that although there may be moral arguments against mandatory life sentences , there are not good legal ones and hence it \" is not our decision to make .\" This argument for judicial restraint , which is echoed in all of the dissents , is interesting because it often is used inconsistently by members of the Court .After all , it was Chief Justice Roberts who wrote the majority opinion in Citizens United , explicitly overturning Supreme Court precedent from twenty years earlier .Also worth highlighting is the inaccuracy of much of the media coverage regarding the decision .Many of the headlines read that the Supreme Court had banned life sentences for juveniles ( examples here , here , and here ) .That was not what the Court ruled however , what they said was unconstitutional was the mandatory imposition of life without parole sentences .States are still free to sentences juveniles to these sentences but must take into account their age and circumstances before doing so .Many of the news accounts mention this in the body of the article which begs the question of why the inaccurate headlines ?It is just sloppy reporting or an attempt to oversimplify what happened ?It is important with the Supreme Court so prominent recently in public discourse that coverage of their decisions is accurate .As to the ruling itself , it makes good sense .Juveniles are different from adults , we all understand this .If a juvenile convicted of murder is mandatorily sentenced , it ensures that their age or mitigating circumstances are never taken into account during the process .Once prosecutors make the decision to try them as adults their individualized circumstances are not considered .Under this scheme , juries can not consider their age or mitigating circumstances , their focus is on guilt or innocence .All criminal punishment rests of a framework of moral reckoning , an understanding that we as a society are punishing an individual for their morally culpable behavior .Because of circumstances often beyond their control and which they can not escape , juveniles can be less morally culpable .When we sentence them , we should consider not only the terrible crimes they have committed but their entire story , to do less is dehumanizing .The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals recently rejected a petition from a man serving a life sentence for first - degree murder .The defendant , David Edward Niles , was convicted in January of 2010 for the death of Laura Parker .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.6986"}

{"text": "The Christian / Newsom case saw another development today as defense attorneys Tom Dillard and Stephen Ross Johnson responded to the prosecution 's motion to have Judge Blackwood removed due to supposed unethical conduct .The defense fired back with a motion of their own accusing district attorney Randy Nichols and his staff of hiding information about Judge Baumgartner 's misconduct while he was still presiding over the case .The defense counsel 's motion said that they agree that a motion to recuse was appropriate and should have been granted , however , the motion should not be against the current judge . \" A motion to recuse should have been filed years ago in this case concerning Judge Baumgartner .\" The current controversy involves the decision by Judge Blackwood to order new trials of the defendants in the Christian / Newsom murder case following news that Judge Baumgartner was addicted to narcotic pills and abused his position to win sexual favors from some of those that he presided over .An investigation by the TBI showed that many of the crimes were committed while Baumgartner was presiding over the Christian / Newsom murder trials .Previous releases of information have made clear that others were aware of Baumgartner 's misdeed .For instance , two prosecutors who were working on the Christian / Newsom case reported seeing Baumgartner swearing his way down I-40 following jury selection in Nashville for Vanessa Coleman 's trial .It was also revealed that District Attorney Nichols confronted Baumgartner about such behavior and that the judge admitted to drinking a bottle of wine every night to help him sleep .Not only did Nichols allegedly know this information , but he also kept it secret from the defense attorneys in the Christian / Newsom case .The defense said that there were many other cases before Judge Baumgartner at the time and that attorneys across the region with clients before the judge would have wanted to know about his conduct .The motion said that despite this \" extraordinary step of an ex parte direct inquiry of Judge Baumgartner about his problems ... \" nothing was ever disclosed by Nichols or his office .For his part , Nichols ' special counsel , John Gill , responded to the allegations saying that the District Attorney 's meeting with Baumgartner had nothing to do with any particular case and therefore was not ex parte contact .Ex parte communication refers to any contact between a judge and one party of the case without the presence of the other party .Such communication is frowned upon .The prosecution has hinted that the current judge , Blackwood , has engaged in such contact with unidentified people and has complained that it is objectionable .The defense denies any such one - sided communication with the judge , as has Blackwood .On Monday the Supreme Court issued a ruling on Miller v .Alabama , a case previous discussed here .The case involved two fourteen year old defendants who had been mandatorily sentenced to life without parole after they were convicted of murder .In a 5 - 4 decision , the Court ruled that the imposition of mandatory life without parole for juveniles violates the 8 th Amendment prohibition on \" cruel and unusual punishment \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.29963"}

{"text": "The evidence presented at trial consisted of testimony by officers that they observed a car where Wiggins was the passenger cruising a gas station in search of drugs .When the officers pulled the car over and ran the driver 's and passenger 's names against their database they discovered Wiggins had a warrant out for a sex offender registration violation .When he was arrested , Wiggins admitted to having some pain pills given to him by the driver of the car in exchange for gas money .On appeal Wiggins claimed that the state failed to show that he knowingly possessed a controlled substance , believing them to be \" pain pills \" and not a controlled narcotic .The Court pointed out that Wiggins did not dispute that he possessed the pills or that oxycodone is a controlled substance , he only claimed that he did not know what he was given was oxycodone .The Court disagreed , citing evidence of a prescription label found in the car Wiggins was arrested in and Wiggins ' own statements to officers concerning the pills he had in his pocket .Regarding Wiggins ' contention that the length of confinement was too severe , the Court noted that the trial court found him to be a Range III , career criminal and thus not a good candidate for alterative sentencing .The trial court considered the possibility of probation but rejected it in favor of the minimum prison sentence allowed for his crimes .The Court of Criminal Appeals noted that Wiggins does not admit to having a drug problem , making rehabilitation next to impossible .Given his status as a career criminal , the Court found Wiggins ' initial sentence proper .Joby Lee Teal , a pro se petitioner , sought declaratory judgment concerning the legality of his five 1988 convictions for drug offenses and resulting concurrent five - year sentences .He argues the sentences are void because he committed them while on bail and should have received consecutive sentences .The Criminal Court of Shelby County found that such relief was not available because the five concurrent sentences had expired and the Court of Criminal Appeals agreed .The plea deal was struck with deal in November of 1988 and his negotiated sentence expired in 1993 .It 'd odd then that so many years later , in 2011 , Teal filed a pro se petition attacking the five - year sentences he received back in the 80s .He claimed the original trial court did not have jurisdiction to enter concurrent sentences for felony offenses he committed while released on bail .The Court said that Tennessee law is clear that in order to maintain an action for declaratory judgment , a justiciable controversy must exist .The question before the court must be a real one , not simply a theoretical one .The Court says that even a simple review of the records shows that Teal 's claim is moot because it lost its \" character as a present , live controversy . \"Because Teal did not pursue this remedy during the time available to him and because he has long since completed the sentence about which he now complains , the Court can do nothing today .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.15048"}

{"text": "Texas does not officially use the term \" involuntary manslaughter \" or \" voluntary manslaughter \" which can sometimes be a little bit confusing .Many states do make the distinction between voluntary and involuntary manslaughter .Instead , Texas combines involuntary and voluntary manslaughter together and it is known as just \" manslaughter . \"To convict a defendant of manslaughter , prosecutors must be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant recklessly caused the death of another individual .There is no requirement of premeditation to this crime and no requirement for there to be intent or knowledge on the part of the defendant .The only requirement is that the defendant 's conduct was reckless .Although manslaughter is defined broadly in Texas , there are specific types of manslaughter that are treated separately .For example , intoxication manslaughter is one , and vehicular manslaughter is another .Intoxication manslaughter deals with the defendant recklessly causing the death of another while intoxicated .Cases involving driving while intoxicated would probably be prosecuted under TPC sec .49.08 , Intoxication Manslaughter ( see below ) , rather than under this section .Vehicular manslaughter deals with the defendant recklessly causing the death of another while driving a vehicle or vessel .Criminally Negligent Homicide .Criminally negligent homicide ( TPC sec . 19.05 ) is causing the death of an individual by criminal negligence .It is a state jail felony under which in general , a person can be confined in a state jail for not more than two years nor less than 180 days .In addition , a fine of not more than $ 10,000 may be assessed .Criminally Negligent Homicide differs from Manslaughter only in terms of the culpability or mens rea .Criminally negligent homicide involves criminal negligence .Manslaughter involves recklessness .Thus , Manslaughter involves conscious risk creation ( the actor is aware of the risk surrounding his conduct or the results thereof , but consciously disregards that awareness ) .Criminally negligent homicide involves inattentive risk creation .The actor ought to have been aware of the riskiness of his or her conduct but failed to perceive the risk .Recklessness and criminal negligence are more serious forms of culpability than the negligence that can result in civil liability .Unlike civil or ordinary negligence , recklessness requires somesubjective awareness of the risk .Ordinary negligence is a totally objective standard .Criminal negligence requires a \" gross \" deviation from the standard of care a reasonable or ordinary person would have exercised under the same circumstances .Criminal negligence is roughly equivalent to \" gross negligence \" which is a more serious form of culpability than ordinary negligence .Ordinary negligence can be made out by showing any deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise .Texas Penal Code Section 49.08 Intoxication Manslaughter .The final type of criminal homicide found in Texas Code is found in TPC ch .49 , \" Intoxication and Alcoholic Beverage Offenses . \"\" Intoxicated is defined as having a blood alcohol content of 0.08 or more or . \" not having the normal use of mental or physical faculties by reason of the introduction of alcohol , a controlled substance , a drug , a dangerous drug , a combination of two or more of those substances , or any other substance into the body . . . \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.847305"}
