George Wallace had remarked that Alabama needed a \" few first - class funerals \" to stop integration .After the bombing , Reverend King wired the governor , saying that \" the blood of four little children ... is on your hands . \"He added : \" Your irresponsible and misguided actions have created in Birmingham and Alabama the atmosphere that has induced continued violence and now murder .\" But Governor Wallace , who had been defeated at the schoolhouse door earlier that year , when federal marshals enforced integration at the University of Alabama , suffered another defeat in September .The bombing and the funerals they produced did not stop the integration of Birmingham schools .The year 2013 has been rich with commemorations .There were the 150th anniversaries of the Emancipation Proclamation and the Battle of Gettysburg , and in November arrives the sesquicentennial of the Gettysburg Address .All are tied by a common theme - freedom , which not incidentally was the theme that animated President Kennedy in that other struggle of the 1960s , the Cold War .All of 1863 and 1963 were consumed by debates and battles over freedom : the freedom of states to secede , the freedom of blacks to live outside of slavery , the freedom of the descendants of slaves to live in an integrated society .But \" of course \" does not describe the course of history , which has a path , but not a logic .\" We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor ; it must be demanded by the oppressed , \" Reverend King wrote earlier in 1963 , in his Letter from a Birmingham Jail .The battle at the lunch counter was not won at the Lincoln Memorial with Reverend King 's speech , nor even at the funeral bier for four little girls in Birmingham .Nor was it won by the time the centenary of the Gettysburg Address arrived two months later , nor even three days after that , when President Kennedy was killed and President Johnson dedicated himself to the civil rights bill .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.180122"}

{"text": "Some people are quick to say that ample means has been given to those who reside in poverty - stricken areas through government fundings such as Welfare and Food Stamps .This is clearly incorrect because a need for housing and nutrition are merely a requirement for basic survival .Instead we need to comprehend the fact that Crime is the enemy and Education is the solution .However ; without a decrease in Crime , Education can not be achieved .Generally speaking : Few people would take out a loan to open a Business or invest Real Estate in a high crime area because only a small number of customers could afford to patronize .Therefore ; a Business and/or Real Estate property opening in a lesser crime area receives more customers and income , allowing Business taxes to be paid .A proportion of those taxes then goes back into the local area Community toward covering expenses such as Police Officers and Education .The black community tend to dominate poverty - stricken areas only because without the necessary funds , crime increases / education decreases and the means to circumvent are diminished ; creating a vicious circle that is repeated from family to families .However ; numerous multicultural and illegal immigrants living in these already high - poverty areas also contribute greatly to the poverty levels , an increase in discrimination , turf wars , and other crimes .Some Cops tend to turn a blind eye to the majority of crimes because there is not enough funds to afford the number of Police Officers needed .Drug dealers have become the modern day slave owners .Regardless of your ethnicity ; if you are addicted to drugs , you have imprisoned your body .You owe the drug dealer and the drug dealers own you .If you ca n't pay for your habit and crime is n't paying enough , there 's always a pimp waiting somewhere to own you and put your body to work to feed your habit .It 's not as if drug dealers earn their money off the addiction of other human beings then move out of these poverty areas .Perhaps because most drug dealers are themselves slaves to the drug addiction .Nonetheless ; drug dealers are merely puppets , slaves also to the drug suppliers who live lavishly out of the far reaching arms of the law in some resort eating lobster claws .Meanwhile ; due to crime , these communities unable to get the funds needed to give a proper education to the children ; the schools have merely become a place for drugs to be bought and sold .However ; with an adequate education , children have a better chance of graduating , getting better jobs and/or attending college to better their income to move into a better community to create a better world for their children .Children who may grow up to become the next Martin Luther King Jr. to continue the non - violent fight of the discrimination and segregation that still lingers ' in the corners of American society ' today .5 Harlem BY LANGSTON HUGHES What happens to a dream deferred ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.69426"}

{"text": "Many talked today about a religious center near Ground Zero being a desecration .What do you call this ?Actually , the real desecration is what Matthews and his co - conspirators at MSNBC are doing to journalism .Offering opinions about political figures and competitors on rival networks is one thing , but this constant invective aimed at Republicans and Fox News personalities coming from Matthews and virtually all the on air talent at MSNBC is getting totally out of control .What Matthews did Friday evening is n't much different than what NewsBusters reported is now regularly being spewed by liberal radio talk show hosts .Does MSNBC really want its programming to be at the same level as the hatred being uttered by the likes of Mike Malloy , Stephanie Miller , Randi Rhodes , Ron Reagan , Jr. , and Montel Williams ?As Ed Schultz is now a part of MSNBC 's prime time lineup , and is a regular emitter of some of the most vile rhetoric on the radio today , maybe the answer is \" Yes .\" The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where truth and liberty flourish .The MRC is a research and education organization operating under Section 501(c)(3 ) of the Internal Revenue Code , and contributions to the MRC are tax - deductible .Copyright \u00a9 2005 - 2015 , Media Research Center .All Rights Reserved .Federal employees and military personnel can donate to the Media Research Center through the Combined Federal Campaign or CFC .To donate to the MRC , use CFC # 12489 .Visit the CFC website for more information about giving opportunities in your workplace .50 years ago , 4 girls helped pave way to racial justice .The year 2013 has been rich with commemorations ; all are tied by a common theme - freedom .Today brings a frightful anniversary of an act of terrorism that served as a sober and sad reminder , a half century ago , of the limits of good will in America 's long struggle to create a society worthy of its founding aspirations .It was 50 years ago that an explosion at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham , Ala. , killed four black girls - three of them 14 years old and one 11 .They were martyrs to a cause they helped to make America 's own .Wait , I can hear you wondering : Did n't we just mark an important 50th anniversary for the civil - rights movement , the poignant celebration surrounding the March on Washington and the Rev. Martin Luther King 's dream ?The answer , of course , is yes , we did .The meaning of this new commemoration is to remind us that even the most basic American dreams are n't fulfilled with lightning speed or in straight lines .It was not a figment of historical imagination when we concluded that Reverend King had moved an entire nation from the dark valley of segregation onto the sunlit path of racial justice .Nor is it a mirage of memory to recall that he pulled many Americans from the quicksands of racial injustice and pointed to their redemption on the solid rock of brotherhood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.296646"}
