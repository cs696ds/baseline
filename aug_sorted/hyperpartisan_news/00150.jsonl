California , 355 U.S. 225 ( 1957 ) ) .The Court distinguished Lambert on the ground that the defendant here had \" actual knowledge that he had a duty to register in Alabama .\" The defendant was admittedly given notice of his duty to register , but the notice was unclear as to whether he must register under state law or SORNA .The Court however noted that there were \" sufficient circumstances to prompt [ the defendant ] to have inquired upon his duty to register . \"Thus , the Court concluded that \" notice of a duty to register under state law is sufficient to satisfy the Due Process Clause .\" From WZTV : .A federal appeals court has upheld an aggressive federal program aimed at tracking and monitoring sex offenders .It stems from the case of William Eric Brown , who was appealing his 2008 conviction for failing to reregister as a sex offender after moving from North Carolina to Alabama .Brown had argued the new requirements were \" impossible \" to comply with because he never received notification about them .The three - judge panel 's ruling , however , concluded there was \" no due process violation .\"The charges against former Mobile County Circuit Judge Herman Thomas include kidnapping , sex abuse , extortion and multiple ethics violations .However , a lawyer for the ex - judge says Thomas himself is being victimized by a racist justice system , CNN reports .\" Did you ever think of the fact that this is the only black circuit judge we 've ever had in Mobile County and that the right - wing Republicans have gotten rid of him ? \" said attorney Robert Clark who described the case as a \" high - tech lynching \" at a Friday news conference .\" This is racism at its very finest .\" Thomas ' law license was suspended yesterday , reports the Press - Register , which has published multiple articles on the case .If convicted on the most serious charge , kidnapping , CNN reports , Thomas would face a potential prison term of between 10 and 99 years , according to Mobile County District Attorney John Tyson Jr. .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "42.558784"}

Louisiana .First , as Justice Kennedy noted in his opinion : . \" As to deterrence , the evidence suggests that the death penalty may not result in more effective enforcement , but may add to the risk of nonreporting of child rape out of fear of negative consequences for the perpetrator , especially if he is a family member .And , by in effect making the punishment for child rape and murder equivalent , a State may remove a strong incentive for the rapist not to kill his victim .\" The language that Justice Kennedy wrote in today 's opinion mirrors the testimony of so many of those experts who testified against this provision in the bill at House and Senate committee hearings .Lt .Gov Dewhurst had made the death penalty provision a centerpiece of his political platform ; it was his highest priority in the session .Texans would have been far better served by allowing the committee process to work as it 's designed to , without political interference .In the final analysis legislators discarded the testimony of experts from across the state in favor of a political accommodation .Editorial writers across Texas listened to the experts and urged legislators to drop the death penalty provision , but their voices were also lost on legislators .Second , it 's important to note some numbers .The Court gave great reliance upon our evolving standards of decency in today 's ruling , and the passage of state legislation is one measure the Court looks to in assessing that standard .While various versions of the Jessica 's Law proposal have passed in 34 states , only four passed a death penalty provision -- all states with active execution chambers .Texas was the last state to adopt the provision ; several states looked at the proposal in 2008 legislative sessions and all rejected it .As the Court noted , 45 jurisdictions do not allow execution for child rape of any kind .( The Louisiana and Montana laws predated the Jessica 's Law model .The original Jessica 's Law proposa l only called for a death penalty when the child - victim was killed .The other states that passed a non - homicidal death penalty were Georgia , Oklahoma , and South Carolina . )Finally , Justice Kennedy notes : .\" There are also relevant systemic concerns in prosecuting child rape , including the documented problem of unreliable , induced , and even imagined child testimony , which creates a ' special risk of wrongful execution ' in some cases . \" Given Texas ' past record of executions in highly questionable cases , as well as capital and non - capital exonerations , our state should be providing heightened screening to prevent wrongful convictions and executions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.264088"}

Mike Weinstein , R - Jacksonville , because he wants to keep the offenders behind bars as long as possible .\" They try to kill five people , and we ca n't seek a life sentence .They rape girls -- and they ca n't be given life , \" Weinstein said .\" But we want to be able to give them a life sentence , and in my mind , they deserve a life sentence .\" In most states , the Graham ruling means simply amending a life sentence to include the possibility of parole .But Florida is in a particular bind because lawmakers abolished parole in 1983 after too many inmates released early were committing high - profile crimes .The state 's Parole Commission now reviews only cases that pre - date 1983 .Statewide , there are more than 100 defendants who must be resentenced under the ruling , according to Barry University 's Juvenile Justice Center , which tracks the Graham cases .That means , for now , the onus falls on trial judges to resentence individual defendants .Judges who impose new but long terms would be violating the spirit of the Graham decision and simply spark more appeals , defense lawyers warn .... .Bill Cervone , president of the Florida Prosecuting Attorneys Association , worries that judges will impose wildly disparate sentences .\" We 're going to end up with a mish - mash of results all over the state , \" said Cervone , the Gainesville - based state attorney .In an effort to streamline the process , last month the prosecutors group filed the petition with the governor 's office , asking the clemency board to commute all Graham cases to sentences of life with the possibility of parole .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.086227"}

Sebelius signs ' Jessica 's Law ' .Harsher penalties to be imposed on sex offenders who prey on children .The law , which applies to crimes committed after July 1 , also imposes harsher penalties on repeat criminals , so third - time sex offenders will be sentenced to life without possibility of parole .The 25-year sentence for a first - offender contrasts with the maximum of 13 years and nine months for the rape of a child .Both Sebelius and Atty .Gen. Phill Kline have called for tougher punishments for sex offenders , arguing that Kansans overwhelmingly support them .But even as Sebelius and Kline celebrated the law 's enactment , at least a few legislators harbored doubts about the new law .The bill was modeled after a Florida law and named for a 9-year - old girl killed last year by a convicted sex offender .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.304832"}

Florida .The high court ruled that sentencing juveniles who did not commit murder to terms of life without the possibility of parole constituted cruel and unusual punishment and was a violation of Eighth Amendment rights .The decision has sparked appellate cases throughout the nation , and posed a significant problem in Iowa because current sentencing law does not provide minimum prison terms used to establish a timeline for parole .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.951195"}

High St. , asked council on March 11 if municipal officials could do something about a sex offender living in the apartment above his .A few weeks later , he presented a petition on the issue signed by city residents .Although Shaneyfelt provided no details about the offender , law enforcement records show that the 62-year - old offender is under the supervision of the adult parole authority .He was recently released from prison after serving a brief sentence on a charge of gross sexual imposition , a fourth - degree felony , involving an adult female .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.79827"}

{"text": "Wednesday , 09 April 2008 .House Finance Committee Co - Chairman Mike Chenault brought up the issue in committee Monday during discussion of a bill to require sex offenders to register their e - mail addresses with the state .He proposed an amendment to authorize capital punishment for certain crimes against children , then withdrew the amendment after a short debate .Chenault said he wanted to surprise the bill sponsor , freshman Democrat Bill Wielechowski of Anchorage .But he said he also intends to bring forward death penalty legislation next year , if he 's elected to a fifth term .And : .The last people executed in Alaska were two men who were convicted separately in the same crime .Austin Nelson and Eugene LaMoore were convicted of the December 1946 murder of Juneau shopkeeper Jim Ellen .Ellen 's store was also robbed .The two men were executed by hanging , Nelson on July 1 , 1947 , and LaMoore on March 1 , 1948 .Attorney Avril Lerman of Anchorage researched the history of the death penalty in Alaska in a report for the Judicial Center at the University of Alaska Anchorage .Lerman said questions were later raised about LaMoore 's conviction .She said the questions likely contributed to the abolition of the death penalty .\" It was an illustration of the extent to which human beings are human in too many ways to wield that sword , \" Lerman said .Tuesday , 08 April 2008 .Oral argument for Kennedy v. Louisiana is set for April 16 .Joan Biskupic has a preview in today 's USA Today .LINK .The Supreme Court will weigh the constitutionality of the death penalty for child rape next week , in the case of a Louisiana man convicted of raping his 8-year - old stepdaughter .The dispute , closely followed by state officials , social workers and defendants ' rights groups , marks the first time since 1977 that the justices will consider whether rape can be punished by death .The justices said no in the case three decades ago , involving a 16-year - old married woman whom the court referred to as an adult .Several states , including Missouri , have signaled that if the court permits the death penalty for child rape in Louisiana , they may try to enact such laws .Five states already plainly allow capital punishment for raping young children .Social workers warn that if the court sanctions the penalty for child rape , it could further discourage reporting of the crime because in the majority of child sexual assaults , the attacker is a relative or friend of the victim .The dispute the justices will hear next Wednesday arises as prosecutors nationwide are obtaining significantly fewer death sentences annually than a decade ago .A de facto moratorium on capital punishment is also in place while the Supreme Court considers a separate dispute over lethal injection .Louisiana argues that national outrage over sex crimes against children , along with efforts by some states to make rape a death penalty offense , should lead the court to uphold a Louisiana death sentence for Patrick Kennedy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.033356"}

{"text": "Notably , once a child turned 14 years old , he or she no longer benefitted from the presumption of incapacity to commit a capital , or any other , felony .Given the common law understanding that 14-year - olds were not immune from capital punishment , it is clear that Ninham can not establish that sentencing a 14-year - old to life imprisonment without parole was considered cruel and unusual at the time the Bill of Rights was adopted .I highlight this passage because I commonly hear this claim that because the Framing Era accepted the death penalty for young criminals , then the Framers must not have viewed an LWOP term as violating the Eighth Amendment 's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment .I understand that in modern times it is common ( and perhaps even logical ) to view an LWOP sentence as a categorically less severe punishment than the death penalty .But in the Framing era , when lots of folks died young and when nobody was subject to imprisonment for extremely long periods , I am not sure everyone would have embraced this modern view of relative punishment severity .After all , Patrick Henry famously said \" Give me liberty or give me death ! \" and the discouraging prospect of lives subject to a sovereign 's dominion fueled the American Revolution .Against this backdrop , I do not think it far - fetched to wonder if some ( many ? )Framing era thinkers would have viewed an LWOP sentence eliminating all personal liberty and any future chance of personal liberty for half a century or longer to be more akin to torture than to a death sentence .Perhaps someone knows of historical sources for exploring with rigor whether and how the Framers viewed punishments involving extreme liberty deprivations .Wednesday , May 25 , 2011 .Post-Graham advocacy that \" Every Child Deserves a Second Chance \" .The title of this post is drawn from the title of this new commentary now appearing at The Huffington Post .The piece is by Anthony Barkow , Executive Director of the Center on the Administration of Criminal Law at New York University School of Law , and here are excerpts : .Just one year ago in Graham v. Florida , the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that it is unconstitutional to sentence juveniles to life without the opportunity for parole for a non - homicide crime committed when they were under age 18 .The Court concluded that these offenders should have an opportunity to have their sentences reviewed , and the logic of the Court 's opinion extends to every young person convicted of a serious crime .I was a prosecutor for 12 years .During that time , I prosecuted a wide variety of crimes , ranging from international terrorism to securities fraud , from domestic violence and sexual abuse to homicide .I prosecuted cases in which offenders received very substantial sentences .I am proud of my work as a prosecutor and I have no doubt that criminal punishment is critical to keeping communities safe .... .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.34384"}
{"text": "Initially , the Court held 8 - 1 ( with a short dissent by Justice Charles Evans Whitaker ) in favor of the government , that full payment was required .The Court relied upon its understanding that there was no case in which a taxpayer attempted a refund suit without paying the full amount the government alleged to be due .It was wrong .Tax lawyers around the country soon came forward and reported that they had brought such refund cases .The taxpayer , Walter Flora , thereupon sought a rehearing .The Court granted the rehearing , and Justices Felix Frankfurter and John Marshall Harlan switched their votes , making the rehearing vote 5 - 4 .They , together with the newly - appointed Justice Potter Stewart , joined Justice Whitaker 's expanded dissent after the rehearing .While the court ultimately upheld its initial decision , Justice Frankfurter 's separate opinion has particular resonance with Kennedy v. Louisiana . \" \" He added , \" This involved many weeks of study during what is called the summer vacation .The five justices in the majority in Kennedy v.

Louisiana .In that case , the court ruled in late June that Louisiana could not execute someone convicted of violently raping a child .Dividing along familiar 5 - 4 lines , the court held , speaking through Justice Anthony Kennedy , that the death penalty must be reserved for killers and traitors .To apply it to others , including the most reprehensible violators of young children , would constitute a \" cruel and unusual punishment \" violating the Constitution 's Eighth Amendment .But there was a problem with the court 's understanding of the basic facts .Defenders of the court 's decision in Kennedy v. Louisiana would have it ignore that embarrassing wrinkle by treating the military as a parallel universe that simply does not intersect civilian justice on the plane of constitutional principle .But a court searching for universal principles of justice in the name of the Eighth Amendment would be hard pressed to accept that view of the military / civilian distinction .Particularly when the court 's division tracks the usual liberal / conservative divide , its credibility depends on both candor and correctness when it comes to the factual predicates of its rulings .Whatever one 's view of the death penalty -- and I have long expressed misgivings on both its wisdom and its constitutionality -- it 's important that the inequities and inequalities in its administration be minimized .Commitment to that principle , not a rush to the center , lay behind Barack Obama 's disagreement with the court 's ruling in this case even before the 2006 federal death penalty provision came to public attention .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.86638"}
