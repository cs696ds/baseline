'He added : ' None of these defendants had any concern for the victim .They were totally uninterested in her welfare and what damage they were causing her .The victim clearly demanded pity and understanding but their view of her was heartless and demeaning .They saw her as a pathetic figure who had no worth and who served no purpose than to be an object that they could sexually misuse and cast aside .They showed her no shred of decency or humanity when as a vulnerable child she so needed care and understanding . 'The court heard their victim now has post - traumatic stress disorder and clinical depression .Now , this crime is not like these fake rape accusations that you see on college campuses , where the alleged victim never goes to the police and never goes to the hospital .This crime really happened .And it was investigated by the police .And the facts were determined in a real criminal trial In my view , the offenders got off too lightly - they should all have received the death penalty .That would have sent a message to others not to do such things to children .Yes , a 13-year - old girl is a child , and she ought to be protected and nurtured , not abused and degraded .If a girl is fatherless and has no protector , that is all the more reason for good men to be more protective of her innocence and dignity - not less protective .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.54837"}
{"text": "And just for knowing : the Sufi philosophy that the New York Times is representing as Islam represents a \" tiny minority \" of \" fringe extremists \" .Most Muslims feel that Sufism is outside the sphere of Islam .But does the NY Times tell you that ?Uh , no .Sufiism has always claimed to be Muslim , but it has had a troubled relationship with Sunni and Shi'ite Islam .Sufi writings mention Christians , Gnostics , and Zoroastrians ( Magians ) .Various Sufi schools have apparently been influenced by these , as well as Indian influence .Some Sufis are monastic - like , perhaps showing Christian influence .( certainly does n't sound Islamic ) .Robert Spencer says : \" The Sufi order offers a mystical perspective on Islam .There are Sufis found all over the Islamic world .The widespread assumption that Sufis are peaceful and eschew jihad violence and Islamic supremacism , however , is false .Sufis from al - Ghazali to the present day have taught the necessity of jihad warfare , and have participated in that warfare -- notably in Chechnya since the 18th century .Hassan al - Banna , the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood , the parent organization of Hamas and Al - Qaeda , was strongly influenced by Sufism and prescribed Sufi spiritual exercises for the Brotherhood members .In January 2009 , Iraqi representatives of the Naqshabandi Sufi order met with Khaled Mashaal of Hamas , praised his jihad , donate d jewelry to him , and boast ed of their own jihad attacks against Americans in Iraq .\" There was no immediate sign of the fiery cataclysm that erupted overhead starting at 8:46 .But out of a baby - blue sky suddenly stained with smoke , a plane 's landing - gear assembly the size of a World War II torpedo crashed through the roof and down through two empty selling floors of the Burlington Coat Factory .The Sept. 11 , 2001 , attack killed 2,752 people downtown and doomed the five - story building at 45 Park Place , two blocks north of the World Trade Center .The store remained abandoned for the next eight years , one of the last undeveloped downtown properties damaged in the attack .The building , offering retail space for lease , has no sign that hints at its use as a Muslim prayer space , and the worshipers are out in an hour .But these modest beginnings point to a far grander vision : an Islamic cultural , educational and recreational center near the city 's most hallowed piece of land .It would stand as one of ground zero 's more unexpected and striking neighbors .But the location was precisely a key selling point for the group of Muslims who bought the building in July .A presence so close to the World Trade Center , \" where a piece of the wreckage fell , \" Imam Feisal added , \" sends the opposite statement to what happened on 9/11 .\" Parts of a landing gear from one of the planes that hit the World Trade Center on 9/11 broke through the roof and two floors .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.36276"}
