{"text": "Three scenarios can be envisaged for the UK .The first is that the UK leaves the EU and establishes a looser connection similar to those of Norway or Switzerland .A second would be for the UK to remain inside the EU , but to have a long - term agreement to stand apart from the deeper integration that others now appear to want .The third would be a much more positive engagement with the closer integration that is emerging .Of these , the third currently has no obvious source of political support .Quite simply , a political party that argued for more ' Brussels ' would be unappealing to voters .The few strongly pro - Europeans who occasionally advocate closer integration are very much in the minority and have no real influence on public debate .By contrast , the euro - sceptics who would be happier to see Britain out of the EU have a substantial political base in the Conservative party and the UK Independence Party ( UKIP ) .Indeed , the consensus is that a majority of the new Conservative MPs who entered Parliament for the first time in 2010 are euro - sceptical , as are several of the leading cabinet ministers .It follows that there is undoubted political support for a withdrawal scenario .What is less clear is what a UK divorce from Europe would mean .Britain would want to retain its access to the European market and to ensure that it was able to influence the development of the rules governing that market .But more sober commentators worry that leaving the Union entirely would leave Britain exposed to plots to slant the market against its interest .A similar worry arises in connection with the scenario of continuing , but incomplete membership .The skirmishes around the agreement of the fiscal compact and the proposals for banking union have shown that Britain already struggles to find compromises acceptable to its partners who are becoming increasingly reluctant to vary the geometry even more .Although all of this is consistent with the Lisbon treaty , it makes for an increasingly uncomfortable position .A working assumption has to be that the deepening of the eurozone is going to continue , with at least some form of banking and fiscal union being constructed , possibly including moves towards a separate eurozone budget and mutualisation of debt .It is inconceivable that the UK would participate .If so , the UK 's detachment may have reached the point at which the debate ceases to be about what further differentiation can be achieved .Instead , as the list of issues on which the UK seeks special terms lengthens , the debate may shift to be about whether the other Member States will tolerate a member that wants to be so different .In other words , the ' in but detached ' scenario may cease to be a choice for Britain ; instead others may lose patience and oblige the UK to state whether it wants to be much more comprehensively in or out .The obvious conclusion to draw is that the conjunction of growing euro - scepticism domestically and the perception elsewhere that the EU is being held back by the UK , must inexorably lead to the exit door .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.167015"}

{"text": "Civitas Meeting - The trouble with Europe 19 May 2014 .The sole speaker was Roger Bootle of the Daily Telegraph and Capital Economics .Bootle was promoting his book The trouble with Europe .The main thrusts of his argument were . - Europe is a declining political and economic power .-The growth rate within first the EEC and then the EU has been poor overall compared with economies outside the EU . -The EU has undermined European economic performance through promoting too generous welfare states .- That much of the regulation comes not from the EU but national governments within the EU .- That the EU has smothered competition between nation states and this has hindered innovation and enterprise .-That Europe 's period of greatest world dominance was a time of intense competition between European powers .-That EU countries have suffered a loss of identity through mass immigration and those with empires had a further blow to their national self - confidence through their loss .- That European elites have had their energies eaten up with trying to create uniformity within the EU to the detriment of such things as investment and productivity .- That the Euro is the biggest economic disaster the EU has suffered , dwarfing the Common Agricultural Policy .-The EU as it is presently constituted is obsolete .Bootle laid down his terms for Britain remaining within the EU : an end to ever closer union , a guarantee of no second class status for the UK if she remains a member , a reduced EU budget , repatriation of powers to EU member states .National governments to be empowered to reject EU legislation and restrictions on the free movement of labour .These conditions are so improbable that it is reasonable to conclude that Bootle in reality wants Britain out of the EU .If Britain does leave the EU , Bootle is in favour of what he called the WTONLY option if a good free trade agreement with the EU can not be arranged .The WTONLY option is to simply leave the EU and then rely on World Trade Organisation rules to give Britain access to EU markets .During questions it was heartening to see how many of the questioners were utterly hostile to the EU , despite the fact that many of those there came under the heading of the great and the good , the sort of people who would normally be considered unvarnished Europhiles .Most promisingly , voices were raised against the wholesale takeover by foreigners of British business and the ill effects of multinationals .I suggested to Bootle that Article 50 was a poisoned chalice which would enable British politicians to do just that .Rather surprisingly Bootle said that he did not think that the mechanics of leaving were important .I was not able to question him further because of the number of people wanting to ask questions .However , I have addressed the subject and others in the email I sent to Bootle after the meeting .If I receive a reply I will add it to this blog post .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.018524"}

'No ' voters were far more likely to believe that erosion of Irish neutrality , end of control over abortion and conscription to a European army were part of the Lisbon Treaty , revealing key cracks in the debate .Loss of Commissioner was also a common concern on the No side .When asked directly , respondents cited the issue of protection of workers ' rights as being \" very important \" more often than any other issue ( of a defined set of issues ) relating to Ireland and the EU .Retaining control over public services in the future was similarly cited .Concerns over specific aspects of the Treaty loom large , particularly perceptions of an erosion of neutrality , the Commissioner issue ( which many do not seem to properly understand ) , Corporate tax and to a lesser degree abortion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.49142"}
