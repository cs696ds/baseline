Roosevelt Park on Houston Street and 2nd Avenue , a group of protesters emerged in black hoodies and goggles .They barely made it to the street corner , when the first shoving match ensued , leading to several arrests .While the police were making their first collars , and a group of protesters tried to hold them back , the rest of the marchers snuck out the back entrance of the park and started running through Chinatown .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.42153"}
