{"text": "Arrested activists ca n't avoid the court system , but we ca n't allow it to dictate our struggle for our prisoners ' freedom , either .Political prisoners and allies go through the court system to expose its contradictions and injustices , but not to win their freedom .The key to beating the system , Pedro Rivero argues , is to make political prisoners \" uncomfortable \" for the government - too uncomfortable for it to continue to deny our compa\u00f1eros their freedom .Anarchists in Ireland have had amazing success in this endeavor .Since 2000 , activists from all over Ireland have come together in Rossport for a protest camp to oppose a Shell gas project that residents say would harm their environment and way of life .Five activists were arrested for their involvement in this stunningly successful camp .Anarchists from the Workers Solidarity Movement mobilized in their defense , planning protests and marches , covering buildings with \" Free the Rossport 5 \" graffiti , and blockading Shell Oil buildings and work sites .Activists in other countries protested at Irish embassies and consulates .Importantly , their protests always demanded the Rossport 5 's freedom and termination of the Shell gas project , and protests to free the Rossport 5 more often than not targeted Shell holdings even though the Irish government imprisoned the five activists .Activists used the Rossport 5 in their protests against Shell to raise awareness and righteous anger against the gas project .It became unbearably embarrassing to continue to hold the Rossport 5 as prisoners , so after 94 days in jail they were released at Shell 's request .Irish anarchists discovered at future protests against immigrant deportations that the police were under orders to not arrest any activists participating in the blockades , presumably to avoid further embarrassment over Ireland 's lack of democracy and political liberties .Despite street skirmishes between anarchists and police at deportation sites , there were no arrests during the blockades .In addition to taking the state off the offensive and putting it on the defensive , making political prisoners unbearably uncomfortable gives the movement a viable option for working outside of the government 's legal system .It offers hope for jailed activists like Leonard Peltier who have exhausted all legal options .These prisoners are effectively abandoned by the movement under the false assumption that there is nothing more that can be done to win their freedom .The fact is that the government 's laws were never meant to provide a \" fair trial \" for political prisoners .They were written to imprison them and repress movements for genuine justice , something that Peltier and indigenous peoples all over the world understand all too well .A national plan of action to free all political prisoners .Because the US lacks a culture of formalized , organized , consistent support for political prisoners and a struggle to free them , we have to start from where we are , and that means starting small .Rivero argues that the first step is to create a list of all the country 's political prisoners and make them part of our organizations ' work .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "124.90268"}
