{"text": "Is it about the Eurozone or the EU ?It is also telling that most commentators and politicians who enjoy talking about \" EU reform \" or the EU 's \" identity crisis \" fail to say what exactly needs to be changed .The underlying \" analysis \" often boils down to something like \" everyone knows it is not working at the moment so I do n't need to explain it \" .And instead of giving concrete examples of what is not working and how it can be fixed , all we hear - at least in the UK - is a series of superficial statements ( something about national power , immigration and repatriation ) .The reform debate is also a rhetorical trap .It is impossible to say \" I am against reform \" as this would imply that everything is just fine , so many just go along hoping that they can support one aspect of \" EU reform \" .Even if you agree with one specific reform idea , it is almost impossible to argue \" I am against EU reform but I would like to change X \" .David Cameron 's ' reform ' rhetoric is exactly designed to have this effect .We do n't really know what he means , nobody challenges him , his analysis is guided by the referendum pledge and based on what his backbenchers want to hear : ' strengthening national parliaments ' , ' stop immigration ' and remove ' ever closer union ' .He cleverly mixes policy and structural issues and does not make a difference between Europe , the EU and the national level .Simply put , Cameron 's EU reform is not about the EU .However , the danger is that slowly but surely the British version of \" EU reform \" is becoming a self fulfilling prophecy .But let 's have a look at three core claims that are often used to make the case for \" EU reform \" : .\" We need to reform the EU because the EU is not working \" .Rhetorically , the claim is often linked to declining trust in EU institutions , the missing European demos and an apparent malfunction in the system .I do n't want to argue that these things do n't exist , but I think we can only approach those rather complex issues by talking about concrete ideas - and not by using a term that is neither defined nor filled with any content .Another dimension of the claim ( especially in the UK ) is the idea that the EU is a ' one size fits all ' organisation that somehow bullies member states into projects they neither support nor want .But looking at institutional realities this is simply not true .We have enhanced cooperation and a series of agreements and treaties that do not include all EU member states .The Fiscal Compact , the ESM and the EFSF , the Schengen zone and the Euro .Of course one could argue that these constructions are not perfect and a lot of things can be improved - but it is simply not correct to argue that the EU should be more flexible to accommodate the wishes of certain member states .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.88823"}
