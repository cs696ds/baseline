Bush made positive statements about continuing the cooperative nuclear security agenda .In a November 1999 foreign policy address , he singled out the Nunn - Lugar program as a greater priority than START II ratification in Russia and applauded the security improvements that are being made at Russian nuclear facilities .He also stated that as president he would ask the Congress to substantially increase U.S. assistance to Russia to allow for the dismantlement of its nuclear weapons as rapidly as possible .On the other hand , the Bush campaign made a point of attacking the Clinton - Gore approach of active engagement with Russia .In his speech accepting the nomination as secretary of state , General Colin Powell stated that Russia is not an enemy of the United States , but not yet a strategic partner .The incoming national security adviser , Condoleezza Rice , has stated that the United States should consider withdrawing from its engagement in Russian domestic politics .6 However , dealing with Russia from arms length may not be conducive to cooperative security progress .For example , it is not apparent that U.S.-Russian non - proliferation cooperation can be divorced from Russian domestic realities .Russia 's proliferation problems are directly fueled by its financial difficulties .Eliminating U.S. support for domestic economic aid to Russia could plunge the nation back into financial crisis , especially if oil prices drop , which could in turn reverse the non - proliferation gains of the last decade .Perhaps more importantly , because of the economic dimension of the proliferation danger , a reduction in U.S. financing for nuclear security in Russia could lead to a greater reliance than currently exists on exporting dangerous technologies to third countries to generate cash .This would facilitate the spread of proliferation problems globally and further increase tensions between the United States and Russia .One possibility is that the Bush approach to Russia could mutate after he takes office , much as Clinton position on China changed .During the 1992 campaign , Clinton constantly attacked the Bush administration 's position on China .But once in office , he recognized the consequences of allowing China to drift away from U.S. influence and ultimately sought accommodation with Beijing .Congress may well welcome a harder line toward Russia .All of these issues affect the atmosphere in which the Congress considers the proliferation dangers that Russia poses .In general , however , despite reservations about Russia 's transition and its domestic and international activities , Congress has been willing to approve the funds necessary to implement existing programs . 7And while Congress has instituted new reporting requirements and fences on some expenditures , it has exempted these programs from the most onerous hurdles placed in front of economic aid to Russia .But it is important to note that , while most existing cooperative programs are supported , new proposed activities face significant scrutiny and opposition in some key quarters of Congress .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.614754"}

{"text": "Video : Personal Stories , Powerful Answers at GOP Debate .Monday , February 8 .By Guy Benson .One critical political metric on which Democrats often vastly outperform Republicans pertains to the question of caring about people .This so - called ' empathy gap ' is a major explanatory factor behind Barack Obama 's re - election victory over Mitt Romney , and it 's one of several reasons why Hillary Clinton is a risky bet for Democrats in 2016 , beyond the email scandal and ethical struggles .Maybe the GOP is finally starting to learn and adapt .At Saturday 's Republican debate , several candidates gave outstanding answers related to policy matters that were very personal in nature , and even emotionally moving .Connecting with voters requires making policy points while appealing to people 's hearts .Here are four examples of Republicans achieving this balance in front of millions of viewers : .( 1 ) Ted Cruz on drug addiction .Cruz , who is sometimes criticized for being too slick and calculating , opened up on a very personal level in his discussion of the impact of drug addiction on his family .He spoke about the tragic case of his half - sister , who died of an overdose , and tied her story into his signature issue of border control .I can tell you that you could hear a pin drop in the debate 's media filing center as Cruz relayed this heartbreaking story : .( 2 ) Rubio on his brother 's struggles with the VA .The Republican field as a whole offered a much more substantive and forward - looking discussion of the VA 's failures than the Democrats did on Thursday night .While Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders defended a failed status quo , lobbing disingenuous grenades at Republicans and attacking the Koch brothers ( ! ) in their responses , Republicans talked about the importance of solving problems and guaranteeing veterans strong options for care .Marco Rubio personalized the issue by raising an example about his brother , who has battled the VA for decades over simple dental care arising from an accident suffered while he was serving with the US Army 's special forces : .In spite of all the talk about Rubio 's repetition debacle during the Christie confrontation , Rubio citation of his brother 's situation was by far the most Googled event of the debate , from any candidate .Cruz 's story about his sister came in second : .The Washington Post writes that after Google released search trends in New Hampshire alone , \" Rubio dominated during the second half of the debate , where he performed much better .The media ( like me ) makes a lot out of fights like the one he had with Christie .But voters maybe are paying less attention to it . \"Team Marco undoubtedly hopes that 's the case .But look at that chart again .For all the buzzy media moments on Saturday night , the two events after which the most Americans opened up their browsers to seek more information about a candidate occurred when Rubio and Cruz spoke about their siblings , tying those anecdotes to serious national problems .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.163944"}

{"text": "Russia did suspend deliveries for a brief time in 1997 .This turned the US - Russian HEU agreement for the purchase of LEU into an agreement for the purchase of enrichment only .LEU deliveries resumed for a while , but in late 1998 , Russia suspended deliveries again , because it was still unable to sell the uranium that it got back and was not allowed to import it for its own use .At the time , the export of the natural uranium to Russia was prohibited , so the material was sitting , unused at USEC 's facilities .This second crisis for the HEU deal was resolved in March 1999 , when the US government paid Russia another $ 325 million for the uranium content of the 1997 and 1998 LEU deliveries under the agreement .In addition , three Western mining and fuel services companies ( owned primarily by non - US interests ) signed a long term contract with the Russian government giving them the option to purchase a substantial portion of future uranium deliveries under the HEU deal .Arrangements were also worked out for unsold uranium to be returned to Russia for its own use .The agreements of March 1999 appeared to resolve the longstanding problem of Russia not receiving payment for the uranium portion of LEU deliveries under the HEU agreement .However , Russia is still not earning what it originally expected from the uranium .Early on , the Russian government set a floor price of $ 29 per kg below which it would not sell this uranium .However , during the 1990s , world uranium prices fell considerably , in part because of the extra uranium supply created by the HEU deal .Therefore , Russia sold very little of the uranium from the agreement .The price of uranium has recently recovered to slightly above Russia 's $ 29 per kg floor price , and in November 2001 the Western parties to the 1999 agreement converted their options contracts to commitments to purchase a substantial portion of the Russian uranium from the HEU deal .However , Russia 's revenue from the uranium component of the LEU is still lower than it originally anticipated .Russia 's inability to receive an attractive return on the uranium content of the LEU continues to hamper the smooth operation of the HEU agreement .Meanwhile , difficulties also arose with the enrichment portion of the deal .As this report went to press , no deliveries of LEU under the agreement had occurred in 2002 or been scheduled , because of a dispute over pricing .The original HEU agreement called for annual negotiations between the US and Russian executive agents regarding the price for both the uranium and the enrichment content of the LEU .As discussed above , payment for the uranium content is no longer part of the deal .In 1997 , USEC and Tenex ( the Russian executive agent for the agreement ) signed a contract that set the enrichment price through the end of 2001 .Under that contract , the price that USEC paid for the enrichment increased with inflation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.12227"}

{"text": "From the beginning , the major hurdle that framers of the agreement strove to overcome was how to accommodate large quantities of Russian LEU into the market , without causing enormous disruptions to market prices or substantial layoffs in the domestic uranium and enrichment industries .Such concerns were the reason the rate of the blending and sale operation was set at 30 metric tons of HEU per year .Policymakers believed that amount of Russian LEU , equal to about 50 - 60 percent of the annual requirements of US nuclear power plants , was the maximum that could be absorbed .Since there were substantial excess supplies of natural uranium and a global overcapacity for uranium enrichment , sizable US production cutbacks were necessary , and continue to be necessary , to absorb that material into the market .When the HEU deal was first established , the US enrichment industry was entirely owned by the government .Until 1993 , it was part of the Department of Energy .In that year , a semi - independent , government - owned corporation , \" the US Enrichment Corporation ( USEC ) \" was established .USEC had to reduce production levels in its enrichment facilities to absorb the enrichment component ( see Box # 3 ) of the Russian LEU .This resulted in a hidden cost to the government , since its plants were less efficient when operated at the lower production level .The initial price paid to Russia under the deal was considerably less than the price at which the government was selling enrichment , so no actual federal appropriations were needed .Accommodating the enrichment portion of the HEU deal merely resulted in lower earnings for the government - owned USEC .Naturally occurring uranium must be enriched to produce LEU .Therefore , LEU can be thought of as consisting of a natural uranium component and an enrichment component .Historically , nuclear power plant operators have met their uranium and enrichment needs through separate purchases .LEU produced by downblending HEU intrin - sically contains both components , but the amounts of each can be established .While the two components are physically intertwined , trade in LEU is still usually based on separate sale of its contained uranium and enrichment .The situation was quite different for the uranium component of the LEU .There was no US government uranium producer , and most of the uranium used by nuclear power plants in the United States came from foreign producers .Furthermore , as a result of an earlier finding by the US International Trade Commission that the Soviet Union was guilty of dumping uranium in the United States at below the cost of production , US import and consumption of Russian uranium was severely restricted .The initial implementing contract for the HEU deal called for USEC to pay for the uranium content of the LEU it received from Russia only after USEC was able to resell it for use in nuclear fuel .It quickly became apparent , however , that it would be many years before the uranium was sold and Russia was paid .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.59653"}
