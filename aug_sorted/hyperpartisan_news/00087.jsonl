{"text": "( For a full legal history , see this report from the Congressional Research Service . )So what does it usually cover ?Various administrations have set their own policies as to when they can invoke the privilege .( The Washington Post has a handy timeline showing when presidents have used it . )Bill Clinton used them a lot , 14 times during his presidency .In 1998 , his attempt to keep White House aides from testifying about the Monica Lewinsky scandal was struck down , the first time since Nixon that executive privilege was overruled in court .George W. Bush invoked the privilege six times , not always successfully .Legal challenges have established two general categories of executive privilege : presidential communications and deliberative process .The presidential communications privilege applies to communications involving the president or his staff that immediately pertain to the president 's decision - making process .The idea , according to Mark Rozell , a professor at George Mason University , and author of a book on executive privilege , is that \" the president should have the right to candid advice without fear of public disclosure .\" Deliberative process involves a broader scope of executive branch activity : discussions involving White House staff or within other agencies on legal or policy decisions that do n't necessarily involve the president or his immediate advisers .Again , the argument is that government officials need to feel like they can talk honestly .The deliberative process privilege , Rozell says , is generally easier to challenge than a claim of presidential communications privilege .What is Obama 's view on executive privilege ?In 2007 , in an interview with CNN , then - Sen .Obama criticized \" a tendency on the part of [ the Bush ] administration to try to hide behind executive privilege every time there 's something a little shaky that 's taking place .\" During his presidential campaign , Obama said that executive privilege \" generally depends on the involvement of the president and the White House , \" referring , presumably , to the narrower , presidential communications privilege .Yesterday , the White House emphasized that this was the first time Obama has invoked the privilege .So what is Holder trying to keep secret ?Holder asked Obama to invoke executive privilege over documents having to do with \" the Department 's deliberative process concerning how to respond to congressional and related media inquiries into that operation . \"In other words , Holder is saying the documents do n't deal with the government 's actual response to Fast and Furious .The letter does n't explicitly mention presidential communications .So , contrary to a few Republican congressmen 's claims , the communications could be just between Justice Department officials and not include anybody at the White House itself .Holder could be voted in contempt of Congress by the Republican - controlled House .But if he is , it 's not clear Holder would be forced to do anything .Congress could file a lawsuit against him or try to arrest or fine him to force him to comply .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "45.584953"}

U.S. District Court , where the Supreme Court considered whether the VP 's conversations with energy industry leaders was protected by the privilege .Executive privilege is strongest when those three issues are on the table , but it 's broader than that .There are several factors court look to .The most important is whether the president was involved , since that determines which privilege ( presidential communications versus deliberative process ) is in play .Beyond that several factors weigh in favor of Congress and against Holder here .This was domestic policy ( not foreign ) , in an operation out of an agency ( not the White House ) , where crimes may have been committed , and none of the president 's constitutional prerogatives are implicated by the case .Factors favoring Obama are that this is not legislative policymaking , and it does have a diplomatic angle because of relations with Mexico .But surveying 200 years of court precedent shows that Congress has the better claim here .Executive privilege ca n't be used to hide wrongdoing such as perjury or another crime .Then they can be forced to tell a judge WHY this is n't what they 're doing , according to whistleblower J.

Wade overturned .They have pursued lawful means to obtain their ends .Extremists have pursued other means , willingly murdering and maiming in their crusade to crush women 's reproductive rights .Most law - abiding anti - choice Americans have condemned these extremists .But neither Sarah Palin nor John McCain will call them what they are .Palin is , in effect , giving these terrorists a wink and a nod .Pro - life , my ass .John McCain , who has harshly criticized the idea of sitting down with dictators without pre - conditions , appears to have done just that .In 1985 , McCain traveled to Chile for a friendly meeting with Chile 's military ruler , General Augusto Pinochet , one of the world 's most notorious violators of human rights credited with killing more than 3,000 civilians and jailing tens of thousands of others .The private meeting between McCain and dictator Pinochet has gone previously un - reported anywhere .According to a declassified U.S. Embassy cable about the meeting secured by The Huffington Post , McCain described the meeting with Pinochet \" as friendly and at times warm , but noted that Pinochet does seem obsessed with the threat of communism .The car bombing on Sheridan Circle in the U.S. capital was widely described at the time as the most egregious act of international terrorism perpetrated on U.S. soil by a foreign power .McCain 's visit with Pinochet took place at a moment when the Chilean strongman held virtually unrestricted dictatorial power and those involved in public , democratic opposition were exposed to great risk .Other U.S. congressional leaders who visited Chile made public statements against the dictatorship and in support of a return to democracy , at times becoming the target of violent pro - Pinochet demonstrations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.72841"}

Hinni , wrote in the records that he planned to do the extensive operation because of the size and location of Mr. McCain 's melanoma .In the teleconference in May 2008 , Dr. Hinni explained that because the melanoma was two centimeters across he had to make \" a 6-by-6-centimeter island of skin , a fairly sizable wound \" to remove it .If Mr. McCain 's 2000 left - temple melanoma was a metastasis , as the Armed Forces pathologists ' report suggested , it would be classified as Stage III .The reclassification would change his statistical odds for survival at 10 years from about 60 percent to 36 percent , according to a published study .The greatest risk of recurrence of melanoma is in the first few years after detection .His age , his sex and the presence of the melanoma on his face increase the risk .The fact that Mr. McCain has had no recurrence for eight years is in his favor .But cancer experts see the 10th anniversary as an important statistical benchmark , and that would not occur until 2010 .In May , his dermatologist at the Mayo Clinic , Dr. Suzanne M. Connolly , said in the teleconference that though there was no way to predict with certainty Mr. McCain 's chance of a recurrence , she judged it to be less than 10 percent .But melanoma is known to be quirkier than most cancers ; doctors cite occasional cases in which melanomas come back after 15 or 20 years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.24869"}

{"text": "Ripping the West in Two .Author and lecturer Nonie Darwish says the goal of radical Islamists is to impose Shariah law on the world , ripping Western law and liberty in two .She recently authored the book , Cruel and Usual Punishment : The Terrifying Global Implications of Islamic Law .Darwish was born in Cairo and spent her childhood in Egypt and Gaza before immigrating to America in 1978 , when she was eight years old .Her father died while leading covert attacks on Israel .He was a high - ranking Egyptian military officer stationed with his family in Gaza .When he died , he was considered a \" shahid , \" a martyr for jihad .His posthumous status earned Nonie and her family an elevated position in Muslim society .But Darwish developed a skeptical eye at an early age .She questioned her own Muslim culture and upbringing .She converted to Christianity after hearing a Christian preacher on television .In her latest book , Darwish warns about creeping sharia law - what it is , what it means , and how it is manifested in Islamic countries .For the West , she says radical Islamists are working to impose sharia on the world .If that happens , Western civilization will be destroyed .Westerners generally assume all religions encourage a respect for the dignity of each individual .Islamic law ( Sharia ) teaches that non - Muslims should be subjugated or killed in this world .Peace and prosperity for one 's children is not as important as assuring that Islamic law rules everywhere in the Middle East and eventually in the world .While Westerners tend to think that all religions encourage some form of the golden rule , Sharia teaches two systems of ethics - one for Muslims and another for non - Muslims .Building on tribal practices of the seventh century , Sharia encourages the side of humanity that wants to take from and subjugate others .While Westerners tend to think in terms of religious people developing a personal understanding of and relationship with God , Sharia advocates executing people who ask difficult questions that could be interpreted as criticism .It 's hard to imagine , that in this day and age , Islamic scholars agree that those who criticize Islam or choose to stop being Muslim should be executed .Sadly , while talk of an Islamic reformation is common and even assumed by many in the West , such murmurings in the Middle East are silenced through intimidation .While Westerners are accustomed to an increase in religious tolerance over time , Darwish explains how petro dollars are being used to grow an extremely intolerant form of political Islam in her native Egypt and elsewhere .( In twenty years there will be enough Muslim voters in the U.S. to elect the President by themselves !Rest assured they will do so ...You can look at how they have taken over several towns in the USA .Dearborn Mich. is one ... and there are others ... )I think everyone in the U.S. should be required to read this , but with the ACLU , there is no way this will be widely publicized , unless each of us sends it on !", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "120.59707"}
{"text": "It is , in short , a law that will take care of human needs and at the same time provide for the United States an economic structure of vastly greater soundness .Does that sound like something that lessened the force of possible future ANYTHING ?A protection to future administrations against the necessity of going deeply in debt ? ? ?Something that provides the United States with an economic structure of vastly greater soundness ? ? ?We 're doomed .Maybe you do n't care that this giant boondoggle is going to crash and burn your country , and that your children or grandchildren will literally die as a result of your greed and selfishness .But I do .They promised us a bogus Utopia , and that Utopia is about to collapse into the fiery pit of hell .During your working years , the people of America - you - will contribute through the social security program a small amount each payday for hospital insurance protection .For example , the average worker in 1966 will contribute about $ 1.50 per month .The employer will contribute a similar amount .And this will provide the funds to pay up to 90 days of hospital care for each illness , plus diagnostic care , and up to 100 home health visits after you are 65 .And beginning in 1967 , you will also be covered for up to 100 days of care in a skilled nursing home after a period of hospital care .And under a separate plan , when you are 65-that the Congress originated itself , in its own good judgment - you may be covered for medical and surgical fees whether you are in or out of the hospital .You will pay $ 3 per month after you are 65 and your Government will contribute an equal amount .Let me tell you how Medicare affects me : It affects me with a $ 57 trillion unfunded liability .It affects me with a bill of $ 500,000 for every single household in America .It affects me with an individual bill ( that every single man , woman , and child in this country owes ) of $ 230,000 .And that 's $ 230,ooo on top of the $ 184,000 I owe for Medicare .I owe $ 414,000 .And my household owns $ 900,000 .And great googly moogly , we do n't got it .We 're on a speeding train that is going to keep hurtling along until it flies off a cliff and crashes .And that \" 47 million \" clearly includes 17 million illegal immigrants .The Democrats ' incredibly cynical plan is to take health resources from you and from your children and grandchildren and give those resources to illegal immigrants so they can capture the Hispanic vote .The metaphor is a dozen people rushing into your house to eat your food and consume your resources while your own kids go hungry .No one would do this .But your government is doing it under Democrat Party tyranny .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "121.578545"}
