{"text": "The Christian Right has carved out these victories following decades of building its political and institutional power .To avoid fighting within its frame and definition of religious liberty , progressives and their allies must build their own long game .One of the ways to do this is to avoid dualisms that distort the issue and play to the Christian Right framing , such as suggesting that LGBTQ civil rights ( or reproductive rights ) and religious freedom are somehow mutually exclusive .While winning many victories , the Christian Right has lost some important battles in its campaign to redefine religious freedom .This is particularly so when other religious groups have taken the lead in opposing the Right .The United Church of Christ successfully sued to overturn a 2012 amendment to the North Carolina state constitution asserting not only that same - sex marriages were invalid , but effectively criminalizing same - sex marriage ceremonies .Coalitions involving religious groups have also thwarted the passage of state RFRAs that justify discrimination in Georgia and North Carolina .Elsewhere , workers and pension advocates took the lead .In December 2015 , a federal appeals court ruled that the St. Peter 's Catholic health system in New Jersey was not exempt on religious grounds from following federal law protecting pensioners and that it needed to fully fund its pension .Contrary to the vision of much of the Christian Right , religious freedom is for everyone .We need fresh perspectives and coalitions to meet these challenges .Other sectors of society , from moderate Republicans to civil rights and labor activists , to religious and nonreligious organizations , need to discover how to do this , even though they may not be accustomed to working together .This will certainly mean envisioning and acting on short - term and long - term strategies , both inside and outside of the courts .We need 21 st century coalitions and strategies to meet the challenges and opportunities of our time .Among our other recommendations , we must , .Reclaim religious freedom as a fundamental democratic value .This means embracing religious freedom as emphasizing the equality of all people , including everyone 's right to believe and to practice faith ( or not ) as we will , and to change our minds - free from the undue influence of powerful religious institutions and government .The right to believe differently from the rich and the powerful is a prerequisite for free speech and a free press , the other two elements of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution .Increase our capacity to respond to religious freedom - related issues .This would include but not be limited to resourcing a network of researchers , writers , political thinkers , and scholars to develop and inform strategy with respect to religious liberty and civil rights .Expand and refresh historic alliances that have extended civil and labor rights in the 20 th century more widely and deeply than at any other time in our history .Expand celebrations of Religious Freedom Day on January 16 th and other events to offer a clear , consistent , positive , and historically rooted alternative to the Christian Right 's redefinition of religious liberty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.175865"}

Nixon declared a War on Drugs .In 1982 , President Ronald Reagan expanded that war .But , as Michelle Alexander notes in her pivotal study of the hyper - incarceration of African Americans , The New Jim Crow , this expansion came at a time when neither media nor most members of the public were particularly concerned about drugs .Reagan 's administration launched a public relations campaign , focusing largely on crack , to build both public and legislative support for his drug war .The image of Black women continues to be fueled by the right - wing narrative of Black women as welfare frauds , liars , and cheats .In 1986 , Congress passed the Anti - Drug Abuse Act , mandating a five - year sentence for a five - gram sale of crack cocaine ; in contrast , the same sentence only took effect for 500 grams of powder cocaine .By 1990 , however , they made up more than 40 percent of those arrested for drugs and over 60 percent of those convicted .9 The Act also took its toll on women , particularly Black women .Under the Act , police and prosecutors were able to arrest and charge spouses and lovers with drug trafficking \" conspiracy \" for everyday actions such as taking a phone message or sharing finances .This is what happened to North Carolina mother Phyllis Hardy , whose ordeal I have described elsewhere . 10 In 1991 , Hardy 's husband was arrested for conspiracy to import and sell cocaine .He told me that prosecutors asked him if he had ever given money to his wife .\" She 's my wife .Of course I gave her money , \" he told them .Andrea Ritchie , co - author of the \" Say Her Name \" report speaks at the 2015 New York City # SayHerName vigil in remembrance of Black women and girls killed by the police .Photo by The All - Nite Images via Flickr .But , under the Anti - Drug Abuse Act , sharing money with a spouse - even for household expenses like groceries or the mortgage - ropes him or her into the conspiracy .Phyllis Hardy was arrested and charged with conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine as well as money laundering .Believing that justice would prevail , she went to trial .She lost and was sentenced to 30-and - a - half years in federal prison .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "121.83327"}
