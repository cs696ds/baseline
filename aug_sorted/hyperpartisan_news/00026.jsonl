{"text": "When you 're staying at a Disney Resort you 're also eligible for the Disney Dining Plan which , depending on how you and your family eat , can save a lot of money .As already mentioned at certain times of the year it 's included for free .Your second choice is to stay at one of the many non - Disney hotels in the area .They are everywhere and many advertise their current rates right out front .If you do n't care about immersing yourself in the \" Disney experience \" 24/7 you might want to stay at one of these .Many of the closest hotels to Disney include limited transportation to the parks so you will not have to pay for parking .If you 're looking at your room as just a place to sleep this might be the option for you .If you 're flying into Orlando you will want to rent a car but you will have the freedom to go anywhere in the area that you want to go , you wo n't be limited to only Disney .Many of the hotels in the area also offer a free breakfast so that is one less meal that you will need to pay for .The third choice works well if you have several people traveling with you .If you have a large family or are planning on vacationing with others you might want to consider renting a vacation home .There are plenty of them available only a few miles from Disney and they are more affordable than you might think .With a vacation home you will have plenty of room to spread out and you 'll enjoy all of the comforts of home .You will have a full kitchen ( another place to save money ) , several bedrooms and most likely a private pool .Having a car is a must at such a place , many are not on the bus line and there will be no transportation to the parks .Tickets are a tricky thing .They 're expensive so you 're going to want to save money on them .Do n't consider buying tickets from Craigslist or a place near Disney that sells used tickets .Disney tickets are n't transferable and you very well might lose your money .I 've seen people turned away because they bought bad tickets , save yourself and your family the heartache .That said , it is possible to save some on tickets .The discount is not going to be drastic but every little bit makes a difference .You need to look for an authorized Disney ticket reseller .Once again , there 's a logo for it , mouse ears with the words \" selected ticket seller \" at the bottom .There are a lot of scams out there with tickets so be careful .There are also ticket deals that are linked to high pressure timeshare presentations .Remember that if a deal seems too good to be true , you probably should n't trust it .The past couple of years ticket prices have gone up in the summer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.16016"}

{"text": "Restaurants have also seen name changes and remodeling .Coral Isle Caf\u00e9 was the predecessor to Kona Caf\u00e9 .This second story eatery offers breakfast , lunch and dinner and features American cuisine with accents of Asian flavors .The Kona Caf\u00e9 is also famous for its Tonga Toast .This huge slice of French toast is stuffed with bananas and encrusted in cinnamon sugar .This is an awesome breakfast , but you 'll probably want to skip lunch you 'll be so full .Near Kona Caf\u00e9 is Kona Island .During the morning , this walk - up facility is the perfect spot to buy a cup of coffee , espresso , cappuccino , mocha , and pastries .In the evening , this location is transformed into a sushi bar and offers a wonderful selection of this popular treat .No reservations are needed .On April 12 , 1995 ' Ohana opened , replacing the Papeete Bay Varandah . 'Ohana means \" family \" in the Hawaiian language and the meals here are served family - style .This is an extremely popular restaurant and advance reservations are an absolute necessity .I wrote a complete review of this restaurant in October 2009 .To read it , click here .Capt .Cook 's , located on the first floor , is the spot for a quick bite to eat .Open from 6 am to 11 pm , a wide variety of selections are available here .In addition , many of the items are cooked to order , insuring the food is fresh and hot .And to the delight of many , Dole Whips , a Magic Kingdom favorite , can be purchased here .While staying at the Poly on this most recent trip , I enjoyed two meals at Capt .Cook 's .For breakfast one day I had the Tonga Toast , the same treat that is served in the Kona Caf\u00e9 .Delicious !On another occasion I had the Aloha Pork Sandwich and my friend Donald had a freshly cooked 1/3 pound Angus Bacon Cheeseburger and fries .The burger was satisfactory - nothing outstanding , but no complaints either .However , the pork sandwich was definitely above average .The bun was crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle .In addition , a pineapple slaw topped the pork .The sandwich had a lot of flavor and the pineapple accents were perfect for the tropical surroundings .Comments ( 50 ) .hey jack I have never stayed at the polynesian resort before but i love the atmosphere that it brings .I hope i am able to stay there some time if i get the chance .ca n't wait for part 2 and as always keep up the great work .Where did you find all these old photo 's .I thought I was a real Disney fan but I never knew about the Surfing and the war boats .Fun to see the old photo 's you never really notice the changes over the years like the floor .Till you see these old photo 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.63971"}

{"text": "This design would complement the Contemporary 's height and its North and South Wings .However , the idea for a twelve story structure was eventually abandoned for the less imposing Great Ceremonial House .Many are aware that the Contemporary was built using modular construction , but are unaware that the original Poly longhouses were also erected in this same manner .For both hotels , the rooms were built at a manufacturing plant three miles away then trucked to the construction site and lifted into place by a crane .The rooms were designed so they could be stacked three high without additional support .This is why the longhouses at the Poly are three stories high .Contrary to popular belief , the rooms were never designed to be removed once they were set in place .This construction method was used for economic reasons , not so the rooms could be swapped out for remodeling purposes .The Polynesian Village , as it was known in 1971 , opened with eight longhouses featuring 492 rooms , a central swimming pool , a putting green , and the Great Ceremonial House which held most of the guest facilities .In 1978 , an additional longhouse was added along with a second pool and the Tangaroa Terrace Restaurant .A second expansion in 1985 added two more longhouses bringing the resort 's room total to 847 .In addition , the name \" Polynesian Village \" was changed to Disney 's Polynesian Resort .In the early years , a wave machine was installed and tested on Beachcomber Isle .The idea was to create artificial waves that guests could actually use to surf .Unfortunately , the waves eroded the beaches ( among other problems ) and the idea was eventually abandoned .For many years you could see the remains of the machine , but it has since been removed and now only a rock wall marks the spot of this failed attraction .Other Poly attractions that came and went in the early years were the 40 foot war canoes ( which required 8 guests to paddle ) and the bob - a - round boats ( which boasted their own stereo system ) .Both of these could be rented for a spin around Seven Seas Lagoon .The Eastern Winds was a 65-foot Chinese junk complete with cocktail lounges and a stateroom .This floating salon offered an exotic spot to relax and imbibe when docked and could also be rented for private excursions .On October 28 , 1999 , the longhouses were renamed .The new names are those of Polynesian islands .The longhouse positions roughly represent island locations in respect to one another if viewed on a map .A Polynesian stage show was created for the resort 's opening ceremonies ( October 26 , 1971 ) .As \" Bedknobs and Broomsticks \" would be premiering during the upcoming Christmas season , Disney wanted to promote the movie .To do this , they had King Leonidas kick off the ceremonies by arriving at Luau Cove via a barge .The tie - in was weak , but it could be argued that King Leonidas lived in a tropical paradise , the Isle of Naboombu .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "120.337395"}
