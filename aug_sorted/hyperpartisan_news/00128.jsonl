Barack Obama will actually emerge from the process having won more delegates from Texas than Clinton , which , after all , is the way nominees are chosen .At the very least , it appears that Clinton 's win in the popular vote was offset by the caucuses , making Texas effectively a wash for her in the all - important delegate race .The most recent still - incomplete count by the Associated Press had both Clinton and Obama winning 103 delegates from Texas , with 22 still unallocated .The Houston Chronicle yesterday had Obama ahead with 108 delegates to 107 for Clinton .If he holds his lead in the caucuses , he would pick up more of the still - unallocated delegates than she would .The same thing happened in January in Nevada , where Clinton won the most votes but Obama ultimately edged her in delegates .In some ways , that does not matter that much .Politics is often more about emotion and perception than math .Clinton 's victory in the Texas popular vote , along with her triumph in Ohio the same night , gave her a powerful political boost at a time when she had gone a month without any wins .It energized her campaign , reinvigorated her supporters , stopped the erosion of superdelegates and juiced fundraising .It let her keep going with an argument that she still has a plausible case for the nomination , particularly if she can win the Pennsylvania primary on April 22 and somehow either seat disqualified delegates from Florida and Michigan or secure revotes in those two states .Yet the slow - moving Texas results also highlight the fact that , at bottom , Clinton has not moved the needle when it comes to the delegate race .She picked up a net of nine delegates in Ohio and five in Rhode Island , according to the Associated Press count , while losing a net of three in Vermont , two in Wyoming and five in Mississippi .So if Texas is a wash , that means that after six more states voting in the past 10 days , Clinton has picked up only a net four pledged delegates .By some accounts , she spent something like $ 18 million in the March 4 primaries .Even if she has not spent a dime since then , it means each additional delegate cost her $ 4.5 million .Turning back to our favorite online delegate calculator on our sister site , Slate , Clinton would need to win 63 percent in all of the remaining 10 contests to catch Obama in pledged delegates , or those chosen by caucuses and primaries .There 's some cause to doubt her ability to do that , given that she has won that much so far in just a single state , her onetime adopted home of Arkansas .The latest polls show her winning Pennsylvania with 52 percent and losing North Carolina on May 6 .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.03459"}
