Boekhaus I am interested primarily in the theology and philosophy of the late 18th and early 19th century , with particular interest in Friedrich Schleiermacher , Early German Romanticism , and the philosophy of nature .My dissertation focuses on the historical context and development of Schleiermacher 's mature understanding of freedom , and how he appropriates organism as a more appropriate schema for understanding freedom in non - mechanistic and non - supernaturalistic terms .Prior to doctoral studies , I received a Th .M. from Emory University , an M.Div from Wake Forest University , and a B.B.A. from Mercer University .Sarah Bogue I am a doctoral candidate specializing in early and medieval church history .My research interests include hagiography , mystical theologians from the Islamic and Christian traditions , the articulation of theology in iconography and architecture , and Christian identity formation through literature .Although my interests encompass a fairly broad chronology , ranging from late antiquity to the high middle ages , my dissertation will focus on the hagiographic corpus of the tenth - century Saxon cannoness Hrotsvit of Gandersheim .Using the prologue to her \" legends \" as a hermeneutical key to interpreting their content , I will suggest that these works serve as pedagogical tools , presenting Hrotsvit 's case for the importance of education in the Christian life .Hrotsvit takes on the role of educator , using these dramatic and humorous stories to assist her audience in the quest to \" hammer \" their intellects into tools capable of properly \" singing \" the praise of the divine .If , as I am convinced , the Gandersheim nuns were at least one audience for the legends , then these works are also vital evidence of a female community 's attempt to articulate their particular Christian identity within the complex matrix of Ottonian society .Before coming to Emory , I earned a B.A. in Classical Languages from Davidson College in 2007 and a Masters of Divinity from Princeton Theological Seminary in 2010 .Drew Denton My dissertation examines the attempts made by Catholic publicists in the late antebellum period ( 1844 - 1861 ) to re - imagine the United States as a Catholic nation .This homegrown brand of Catholic nationalism I juxtapose with others arising throughout the nineteenth - century Atlantic World , particularly that promoted by the Catholic press of pre - Reforma Mexico .The comparative angle of my project signals a larger interest in nudging Latin America and the Caribbean more fully into the American religious historian 's purview .My academic endeavors have centered on the dual poles of historical theology and antebellum American culture since my undergraduate days at Lipscomb University and my M.Div . coursework here at Emory .In the best of all possible worlds my teaching load would include , in addition to more standard offerings in church history , courses on the films of John Ford , the Catholic dimensions of the Southern literary revival , and baseball as liturgy and ascesis .Brian Gronewoller My research interest lies in the political thought of Augustine of Hippo .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.82444"}

{"text": "I checked out the Methodist and Anglican church ( 2008 ) , but I did n't feel comfortable there .I 've gone to a Presbyterian ( Protestant ) church for two years ( since 2008 ) .After a lot of soul searching , I even became a member of that church ( congregation and denominational records ) .Now I 've become an ordained minister ( pastor ) in the Universal Life Church .Nonetheless I still go to the same Presbyterian church .At the end of the day , what am I ?At least , I know that I 'm a Christian .I 've been reading what it means to be an ordained minister and also about the various differences between Christian denominations and in some cases other religious systems all together ( traditions , rites , ideologies , etc .From all the religious material that I 've read in the past decade or so , coming to a non - denominational church website has helped me most to understand the different ideologies in Christianity .What does this all mean in my twisted mind ?Am I becoming a better person , a better Christian or a real ordained minister ?Does all this mean that I betrayed the church I go to ?Am I still Catholic ?Did I become Presbyterian ?Did I join the Universal Life Church unknowingly ?I do n't bloody know and I 'm so bloody confused right now with my beliefs .We all have rants that we do n't let go and return to again and again .My current involves my ordination and weather or not I 'm worthy of such .Before I start my long rant , I must emphasize that I 'm a minister of faith ( every Christian 's obligation to teach others about God ) as emphasized by the Presbyterian Church .Am I betraying or mocking PC(USA ) by accepting the ordination of ULC ?Said the latter , could asking for this ordination be a mistake a poor joke gone bitter or simply backfiring at me ?After all , I wanted to be ordained , but was it a good idea ?Maybe wanting to be ordained and being ordained is matter of choice regardless how impure one may be .In such case , my desire to be an ordained minister ( pastor ) could have been enough to be ordained and take on such responsibility .Nonetheless I still believe that a pastor must have a degree in theology and follow the correct procedure to be a real pastor ( seminary , church , ministry , etc ) .Nonetheless , I feel I 'm deceiving myself thinking I could be an ordained minister ( ULC ) .Nonetheless I look for cheap excuses to justify my actions .I 'm such a farce and this might all be a charade .Living in NYC , I 've noticed that pastors of small churches ( both small building and congregation ) have a common day job to cover their day - to - day expenses instead of getting some sort of stipend from the church income ( donations ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "114.97294"}
