{"text": "US forces had to replenish their allies with ordnance and help with drones and AWACS .On the media side , differences of opinion and the desire by some nations not to appear too involved have brought NATO and EU nations states to be inadequate in their communication towards public opinion .While exact details of course have to remain classified , neither general mission objectives ( Gaddafi is a target or not ?Why / why not ? ) nor general procedures ( what is a no - fly zone ?What does it entail ?How is each nation contributing ? ) were clearly explained to the public , leaving the media to answer these questions , often inappropriately or inaccurately and giving rise to misunderstandings that mined support at home .Lessons from Libya .p. 3 .POSITIVE RESULTS Nothing to be happy about then ?Actually , elements of success exist : NATO was able to intervene without sending ground troops , as many had feared , except for some special forces teams .It was possible to supply and help the insurgents , with support from above , to the conquest of Tripoli and , subsequently , until the death of Gaddafi , achieving most of the short - term strategic objectives .On the other hand , however , the Libyan experience has also led to other repercussions , which now dominate the local situation and raise doubts about achievement of long - term strategic objectives .This led to the delay in providing similar weapon support to Syrian insurgents , who present the same issues ; in their case , it is even more critical due to sectarian fragmentation the proved to be so dangerous in Iraq .Lessons from Libya .p. 4 .WHAT TO LEARN FROM LIBYA ?In particular , Member States must gradually give up their independence in foreign policy to allow the EU High Commissioner for Foreign Affairs ( currently the British Catherine Ashton ) to be much more than the current hollow figure .NATO without the United States does not have enough projection power to influence events and situations very far away from Europe - mainly because of the substantial budget cuts .Libya was near and this allowed the heavy use of bases on the mainland .This will become even worse in the future unless a really working , integrated European defense system is finally implemented , that can put remedy to the deficiencies of individual States with more efficient cross - border synergies .Arming insurgents against dictators is an efficient methodology to unseat them from power without becoming directly engaged in a potential ground quagmire - but also contributes to arming groups that could later turn against their benefactors , or otherwise prevent the recovery of security .This is all the more probable the more fragmented opposition is , and at least the outside knows about it .In order for the public to be fully aware of the military effort and , ultimately , support it , EU countries should spend more energy in explaining major operational , political and diplomatic issues .It has to be done in simple and comprehensive ways , because public audiences are generally non - specialist .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.070694"}

{"text": "Unsolved issues in the open - access publishing model .Many open - access publishers have been unable to come up with economically sustainable business models .They have not been able to use a business model that is efficient and profitable for the publisher and at the same time affordable for the authors and their funding sources .Most of the open - access journals are sustained by grants and endowments as well as subsidies from universities , foundations , government agencies , and professional societies or associations .A handful of large open - access publishers have sustained their operation without reaching profitability by continuing to raise the article processing fee which is their primary source of revenues .Critics have argued that the escalating processing fees of these open - access journals are becoming a barrier that may destroy what it originally wanted to foster .In very few disciplines ( other than medical and life sciences ) do scholars have sufficient funds from grants and other sources to pay such high article processing fees .In many fields , funding at the university , foundation , or government agency level is scattered , uncommon or rare .Even in medical and life sciences , many researchers and scholars in less funded institutions as well as independent researchers are unable to pay such high article processing fees .In fields such as Social Sciences and Humanities , many authors are engaged in significant research without grants , and therefore , may not have the funds to pay for the prohibitive article processing fees .One of the reasons why the major open - access journals have experienced difficulty in reaching profitability is that they maintain a very high cost structure of operation which carries extremely high overhead and administrative costs .These include a plethora of big - expense offices and a stable of high salaried professional editors , executives , programmers , and database administrators .For a major traditional journal , the average cost of producing an article is approximately $ 2750 .These expenses are split among editorial costs , electronic composition and production , journal information system , manuscript management system , electronic archiving , overhead expenses , and administrative costs .The publication fee or article processing fee must cover the costs of publishing the accepted article plus the cost of reviewing the number of articles the journal rejects for each accepted article .Since costs per accepted paper rise with the rejection rate of papers , the fee usually rises as the rejection rate goes up and acceptance rate goes down .Such high cost structure demands sizeable revenue streams to offset it .However , the major open - access journals have not explored all possible streams of revenues .Instead , they have relied heavily on article processing fees and institutional memberships that pay the processing fees for university faculty and researchers .However , as they continued to raise their fees , it has become unaffordable for many authors and institutions .There is also a serious problem with the fee structure of major open - access journals .Their article processing fee or institutional membership fee is not scalable .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.53049"}

{"text": "But , are we all equal shareholders ?Should we be equal shareholders ?Should the ( hopefully ) experts that are trained to educate have more influence than parents ?Should the parents who perceive a larger personal stake in the outcome have more influence ?I think that as a society we equate the ability to educate with the ability to parent - I have a child therefore I know about education .I do n't think that 's true .Educators are trained professionals with a specialized skill set like any other trained professional .Theoretically , the trained professionals should have better ideas on what 's good for education within a community ( better ideas - not only ideas , not best ideas , not perfect ideas ) .I guess that I 'm wondering how much influence well - connected individuals should have versus well - trained professionals .First off , I agree that STAKEholders is the wrong term for parents , educators , and community members .It IS too close to SHAREholders which deems education as purely an investment opportunity where by there are losers who go on to a life at the bottom .Education is more about developing and empowering a citizen to make the personal decisions ( making gobs of money , doing great social service work , etc ) .Having parents with multiple means of communication is a good thing .Schools have long been disconnected from the community due to various reasons , some of their own doing , but most from the social engineering of the last 30 years that promotes disconnection through individualism and severe competition .This begs the question of if and how teachers are to respond and adapt to a tidal wave of parental interest .Perhaps that should be one more notch in the belt that needs to be loosened so that an authentic community can exist whereby teachers are held to a true professionalism , not some further form of alienation and hierarchy .That model has failed in so many areas of our society and economy .Scott wrote : Be sure to also read about the New York City Department of Education ' truth squad , ' whose job it is to ' scour a group of 24 education Web logs , e - mail Listservs and Web sites in a hunt for factual errors and misinformation .You know , I like the idea of parents holding schools more accountable and using digital tools to do so - after all , we are funded by taxpayer dollars .The community SHOULD have the right to a larger voice .I wonder if some of the controversy would be removed if schools did a better job communicating on their own .I find in our district that the only time things get controversial and heated is when our district has n't been aggressive enough about making their thinking on key issues transparent .Misinformation and confrontation really only starts and spreads in a vacuum , after all .In the end , it seems like this is yet another example of a situation where proactive steps could help schools to stay out of situations where they have to spend time , energy and resources reacting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "125.608154"}
