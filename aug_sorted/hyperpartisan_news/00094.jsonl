Noor Ali Shooshtari , as well as a chief provincial Guard commander , Rajab Ali Mohammadzadeh .The others killed were Guard members or tribal leaders , it said .More than two dozen others were wounded , state radio reported .The commanders were entering a sports complex to meet tribal leaders to discuss Sunni - Shiite cooperation when the attacker detonated a belt fitted with explosives , IRNA said .Ahmadinejad - who counts on support from the Revolutionary Guard - vowed to strike back .\" The criminals will soon get the response for their inhuman crimes , \" IRNA quoted him as saying .But controlling the scrubland and arid hills along the southeastern borders is a huge challenge that has been out of Iran 's reach .Drug traffickers ferry opium and other narcotics through the cross - border badlands - a key source of income for the Taliban in Afghanistan and the ethnic Baluchi tribes that straddle the three - nation region and include members of Jundallah .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.149223"}

H. Religious minorities .The Special Rapporteur remains deeply concerned about the human rights situation facing religious minorities in Iran .Reports from and interviews with members of the Bahai , Christian , and Sunni Muslim communities continue to portray a situation in which adherents of recognised and unrecognised religions face discrimination in law and/or in practice .This includes various levels of intimidation , arrest and detention .A number of interviewees maintained that they were repeatedly interrogated about their religious beliefs , and a majority of interviewees reported being charged with national security crimes and/or propaganda against the State for religious activities .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.88338"}

Rokaya , general secretary of the National Council of Churches of Nepal .\" The Constituent Assembly we elected to give us a new constitution that would strengthen democracy and secularism has frittered away the time and opportunity given to it .\" The clamor for a Hindu state has been growing as the May 28 deadline for the new constitution draws near .When a Hindu preacher , Kalidas Dahal , held a nine - day prayer ritual in Kathmandu this month seeking reinstatement of Hinduism as the state religion , thousands of people flocked to him .The throng included three former prime ministers and top leaders of the ruling parties . \"The large turnout signals that Hinduism is enshrined in the hearts of the people and ca n't be abolished by the government , \" said Hridayesh Tripathi , a former minister and Constituent Assembly member whose Terai Madhes Loktantrik Party is the fifth - largest in the ruling alliance .\" It was a mistake to abolish Hinduism in a hurry . \"Another blow for a Hindu state was struck by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party - Nepal ( RPP - N ) , the only party that fought the 2008 election in support of monarchy and a Hindu state .It is now calling for a referendum .As a pressure tactic , it paralyzed the capital and its two neighboring cities in February by calling a general strike . \" The election gave the Constituent Assembly the mandate of writing a new constitution , not deciding issues of national importance , \" said Kamal Thapa , the RPP - N chief who also was home minister during the brief government headed by Gyanendra .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.0619"}
