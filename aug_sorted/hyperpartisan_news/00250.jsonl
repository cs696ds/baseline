Jeb Bush .Rick Perry at the Aug. 6 GOP debate in Cleveland ( Photo by Scott Olson / Getty Images ) .The former Texas governor never invoked Trump 's name but the target of his critique was n't even thinly veiled .Perry had been among the earliest and most outspoken GOP contenders to try to halt the Trump juggernaut this summer .It did n't avail him , and Perry left the race frustrated that his comeback bid fizzled so miserably while the reality TV star 's ambitions took off .\" We see in our politics today a lot of agitation , \" Perry said Friday , but \" I want to issue a word of caution .There is a difference between righteous indignation and unconstrained anger .We can not make the mistake the replacing a liberal divider - in - chief with a conservative divider - in - chief ... or to sacrifice our principles for the cult of personality .\" Perry also resurrected his critiques of Trump 's anti - immigrant views and rhetoric .The current front - runner asserted when he formally launched his campaign that Mexico has purposely sent murderers and rapists across the border .Perry noted that for 14 years , he was governor or the 12 th largest economy in the world , a state that shares a 1,200-mile border with Mexico .Securing the border and fixing the immigration system , he said , can and should be done \" without inflammatory rhetoric , without base appeals that divide us based on race and culture and creed .We can do that . \"\" Demeaning people of Hispanic heritage is not just ignorant ; it betrays the teachings of Christ , \" Perry said .\" It is time to elevate this debate . \"Trump spoke earlier , showing off his childhood Bible - inscribed by his mom with his name and address in case he ever lost it .He got a raucous reception - and resounding boos when he attacked Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida , calling him a \" clown \" for his support for comprehensive immigration reform .Rubio spoke to the Christian evangelical group on Friday morning and was well received .Trump was n't Perry 's only target .Like most other speakers at the summit , he blasted President Barack Obama .\" We have a president who consistently tests the limits of his powers , \" he said .\" There is no argument too silly or a sound bite too shrill for this president .But I want to remind you of something .We in America do n't elect kings ; we overthrow them . ...", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.49222"}
