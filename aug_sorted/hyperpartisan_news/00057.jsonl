Julian urged the appointment of John C. Fremont to a new command , saying it \" would stir the country as no other appointment could . \"President Lincoln replied : \" It would stir the country on one side , and stir it the other way , on the other .It would please Fremont 's friends , and displease the Conservatives ; and that is all I can see in the stirring argument .Dismissing generals presented a third problem General Ulysses S. Grant himself was anxious to dismiss or demote several generals - among them , New Orleans - based Banks .Henry Halleck responded to a critical note from Grant about Banks , by writing back : .General Banks is a personal friend of the President , and has strong political supporters in and out of Congress .There will undoubtedly be a very strong opposition to his being removed or superseded , and I think the President will hesitate to act unless he has a definite request from you to do so , as a military necessity , you designating his superior or superior in command .On receiving such a formal request ( not a mere suggestion )I believe , as I wrote you some days ago , he would act immediately .I have no authority for saying this , but give it simply as my own opinion , formed from the last two years ' experience , and the reason , I think is very obvious .To do an act which will give offense to a large number of his political friends the President will require some evidence in a positive form to show the military necessity of that act .In other words , he must have something in a definite shape to fall back upon as his justification .Political generals like former House Speaker Banks caused special problems - particularly when he rubbed West Point generals like Grant the wrong way .Moreover , what could be done with Banks ?He has many political friends who probably demand for him a command equal to the one he now has .Before submitting the matter to President , the Secretary of War wishes to have in definite form precisely the order you wish issued .President Lincoln also had problems with another Massachusetts general , Benjamin Butler , who preceded Banks as the military commander in New Orleans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.411476"}

'President Lincoln also had to worry about Grant 's military judgment on the way to Richmond in the spring of 1864 and the subsequent deadlock around Petersburg and Richmond .In the fall of 1864 , President Lincoln summoned General Grenville Dodge to the White House and interrogated him over lunch .Mr. Lincoln \" finally led up to the placed where he asked me the question of what I thought about Grant , and what I thought about his next campaign .Just as he asked the question , we got up from the table .He took my hand in both of his and very solemnly said , ' You do n't know how glad I am to hear you say that . 'Grant seldom visited the White House between the time he was appointed to head the Union armies in 1864 and the day President Lincoln was assassinated .He 's the quietest little fellow you ever saw , \" said the President .\" Why , he makes the least fuss of any man you ever knew .I believe two or three times he has been in this room a minute or so before I knew he was here .It 's about so all around .The only evidence you have that he 's in any place in that he makes things git !Where he is , things move ! \"Unlike other generals , the President told Stoddard , Grant did not look for excuses to avoid an advance .\" When Grant took hold I was waiting to see what his pet impossibility would be , and I reckoned it would be cavalry as a matter of course , for we had n't horses enough to mount even what men we had .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.77027"}

{"text": "Abstract : \" International comity is one of the principal foundations of U.S. foreign relations law .Yet international comity remains poorly understood .This Article provides the first comprehensive account of international comity in American law .Professor Elmendorf 's article ( with Douglas M. Spencer ) is Administering Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act After Shelby County .Abstract : \" Until the Supreme Court put an end to it in Shelby County v. Holder , section 5 of the Voting Rights Act was widely regarded as an effective , low - cost tool for blocking potentially discriminatory changes to election laws and administrative practices .The provision the Supreme Court left standing , section 2 , is generally seen as expensive , cumbersome , and almost wholly ineffective at blocking changes before they take effect .This Article argues that the courts , in partnership with the Department of Justice , could reform section 2 so that it fills much of the gap left by the Supreme Court 's evisceration of section 5 .Most section 2 cases currently turn on costly , case - specific estimates of voter preferences generated from precinct - level vote totals and demographic information .Judicial decisions provide little guidance about how future cases - each relying on data from a different set of elections - are likely to be resolved .By creating evidentiary presumptions whose application in any given case would be determined using national survey data and a common statistical model , the courts could greatly reduce the cost and uncertainty of section 2 litigation .This approach would also reduce the dependence of vote dilution claims on often - unreliable techniques of ecological inference and would make coalitional claims brought jointly by two or more minority groups much easier to litigate . \"Congratulations on these prestigious placements , Professors Dodge and Elmendorf !Donald Trump 's immigration proposals , if you can call them that , are short on details but long on controversy .The presidential candidate kicked off his campaign by labeling immigrants from Mexico as criminals who should be removed in a mass deportation campaign akin to the now - discredited \" Operation Wetback \" - the U.S. government 's official name for the campaign - in 1954 .Once again stirring the pot , Trump recently called for a blanket prohibition on all Muslim noncitizens from entering the United States .That would include temporary visitors , such as university students , as well as noncitizens seeking to become lawful permanent residents as spouses of U.S. citizens .From a legal standpoint , the constitutionality of the race- and religion - based prescriptions endorsed by Trump is uncertain .Some legal scholars , including Temple Peter Spiro in The New York Times , have suggested that there is a legal basis for Trump 's call for an end to Muslim immigration to the United States .The U.S. Supreme Court 's 1889 decision in The Chinese Exclusion Case created what is known as the \" plenary power \" doctrine , which immunizes from constitutional review the substantive immigration decisions of Congress and the executive branch .That doctrine allowed for the court to uphold the immigration law venomously known as the \" Chinese Exclusion Act , \" whose very name stands as a monument to one of our darkest chapters in immigration history .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.01535"}

{"text": "Donald Trump 's rise as a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination set off a flurry of articles labeling him a fascist .These pieces -- which have appeared on sites as varied as Newsweek , Common Dreams , and CounterPunch -- are misguided .Calling Trump a fascist promotes a distorted understanding of fascism and obscures the fact that Trump 's demagogic hate - mongering is deeply rooted in mainstream U.S. politics .I was planning to blog about this until Chip Berlet , my friend and former co - author , made a lot of the points I wanted to , in a piece entitled \" Corporate Press Fails to Trump Bigotry , \" for Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting .Chip 's article ( I 'll call it \" Trump Bigotry \" ) emphasizes the need for historical context and clear analysis , an approach that I strongly support .At the same time , I disagree with some of the specific ideas about the far right that the article presents .These ideas are drawn from recent scholarship about right - wing movements , but I think they make it harder for us to understand -- and effectively combat -- what many rightists are saying and doing today .This response to Chip 's article is offered in the spirit of friendly , constructive criticism and moving the discussion forward .Trump Bigotry \" debunks claims that Donald Trump is a fascist or that he represents \" a new force in American politics .\" The article rightly places him in right - wing populist traditions that go back to Andrew Jackson in the 1820s , traditions that blend scapegoating , repression , and mass violence with distorted anti - elitism .Chip 's article also outlines some of the historical dynamics of the past few decades -- ranging from the erosion of traditional social privileges to increased infusions of cash -- that have contributed to the rightist upsurge we see today .As Chip argues , there are dangerous synergies between Trump - style nativism and the fascism of , say , accused Charleston shooter Dylann Roof , but there are also vital differences between those rightists who work within the existing political system and those who seek to overthrow it .This delineation is n't just an intellectual exercise -- it 's about recognizing qualitatively different opponents so we can respond to them intelligently .As I wrote in the 2007 article \" Is the Bush administration fascist ? militaristic repression -- even full - scale dictatorship [ or racist populism , in Trump 's case ] -- does n't necessarily equal fascism , and the distinction matters .Some forms of right - wing authoritarianism grow out of established political institutions while others reject those institutions ; some are creatures of big business while others are independent of , or even hostile to , big business .Some just suppress liberatory movements while others use twisted versions of radical politics in a bid to ' take the game away from the left .

{"text": "4 ) Any groups that provide an active platform for Nazi , fascist , and related speakers should be treated in a similar fashion as those sympathetic to White separatism .This includes those who hold events for these speakers .For example , members of the Eugene , Oregon - based Pacifica Forum - which started as a progressive anti - war speaker series but later came to host antisemites and , eventually , outright neo - Nazis - should be treated as a Far Right organization .( Pacifica Forum members attended Occupy events in Eugene and Portland , Oregon , attempted to use a left - wing bookstore in Portland to host an antisemitic speaker , and one was a board member at an annual co - operative conference . )This question can be far trickier when it comes to periodicals , book presses , and online media .For example , many left - wing media have published antisemitic and crypto - antisemitic authors such as Alison Weir , Israel Shamir , and Gilad Atzmon ; a well - known left - wing press even published Atzmon 's book .22 However , to what extent it is feasible to hold these publications and presses accountable is up for debate .Renunciation and Reintegration .Antifascist activists sometimes have a \" search and destroy \" mentality about their opponents ; they want to document their target , locate and confront it , and create a situation where it will go away .But this , too , can turn into its own problem : people do n't disappear , and once politicized , they tend to remain so .Organized racist and fascist groups have long been involved in pagan , and in particular , Heathen , religious circles .This in turn has helped galvanize Heathen circles to consciously resist racist elements , and to analyze structural racism more generally .It is not infrequent for Far Right activists to become disenchanted with and wish to exit their political milieu , which can have negative social and professional effects on their lives .Sometimes , young people experiment with different identities and views without a serious commitment to them .Other times , progressive activists have been drawn into these Far Right groups and , once confronted , are willing to abandon them .Therefore , it is important to allow people to return to ( or enter ) progressive circles .If their Far Right affiliations are revealed , and they abandon these politics but are prevented from being allowed into non / anti - racist circles , there is a higher likelihood they will return to their prior beliefs - if for no other reason than simply because it will be a familiar social circle .Progressive groups should come up with their own criteria for people who want to move away from Far Right politics and toward progressive political communities .( The letter written by former White nationalist Derek Black , son of Stormfront founder Don Black , is exemplary .23 )If they want to become actively involved as progressive political organizers , they should also 5 ) be required to go through a debrief to provide information about their former Rightist group 's structures , membership , recruiting tactics , and beliefs .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.5734"}

{"text": "On a secondary level , I have to concede certain points to Reid Ross .He is right that fascist movements do n't necessarily involve an organized paramilitary force , and it was a mistake on my part to suggest that they do .Also , I overgeneralized when I wrote ( paraphrasing Neiwert ) that fascists are \" absolutists who demand ideological purity . \" As Reid Ross points out , in Italian Fascism 's early years Mussolini embraced ideological \" inconsistencies and contradictions .\" I would argue this was largely calculated bravado on Mussolini 's part as he worked to weld multiple factions into one movement , and that his ideology was already significantly more thought out and committed than Donald Trump 's .But it 's true that fascist movements do n't or ca n't always demand ideological purity from their followers .On the issue of fascist populism , Reid Ross misunderstands my argument that \" fascism seeks to actively and permanently mobilize large masses of people .\" I did n't mean that initiatives do n't qualify as fascist if they do n't succeed in building a mass movement .I meant fascists try to get people involved in active , ongoing activities ( not just call them out as occasional spectators at campaign rallies ) both to mobilize support and enforce control .This type of mobilization is n't unique to fascism , of course .If you want an example , look at the Christian right , which has painstakingly built an elaborate organizational web , based at the level of church congregations and living room prayer circles .Again , I see no efforts along these lines from the Trump campaign .I guess it depends what we mean by revolution .Fascism is revolutionary in the sense that it . \" implies an effort to bring about a fundamental , structural transformation of the political , cultural , economic , or social order .Fascism seeks , first of all , to overthrow established political elites and abolish established forms of political rule , whether liberal - pluralist or authoritarian .Fascism 's revolutionary vision invokes an idealized image of the past , but it does so in the service of creating a new order , not just restoring old traditions .Similarly , it 's not true that white nationalist far rightists in the U.S. \" have always upheld segregation and a racialized caste system as an ultimate ideal . \"Actually most of them moved beyond old - style segregationism decades ago , toward newer visions , such as creating a white separatist enclave through secession , dividing the entire U.S. into apartheid - style racial homelands , or exterminating Jews and people of color entirely .Compared with these ideas , Trump 's proposals to make ( white ) America great again represent a much more limited challenge to the established order .His most extreme structural proposal , abolishing birthright citizenship , would intensify racial and national oppression , but unfortunately this change is all too compatible with liberal \" democracy \" as practiced everywhere outside the Americas .It is true , as Reid Ross argues , that deporting 11 million people would involve a big expansion of the state 's repressive apparatus .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.306"}

{"text": "To give two concrete examples : few women may wish to attend concerts glorifying rape , and few Jews want to be entertained by bands playing neo - Nazi cover songs .Four Lines of Exclusion .In recent years , antifascist activists in different cities have confronted the problem of crypto - fascists and pro - White separatists by calling for these individuals and groups to be excluded from progressive political circles , including conferences , organizing and cultural spaces , music venues , book fairs , and demonstrations .10 Such calls have not always been well - received ; frequently other progressive activists , unfamiliar with these forms of Far Right politics , want to know how and where the line may be drawn against these groups .When bringing up exclusions , the question of \" free speech \" inevitably comes up .The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the protection of speech from interference by the government .To call for excluding a group , individual , or band is not to be mistaken for a call for the government to ban or otherwise violate the Constitutional rights of fascist and related groups .( Even from a realpolitik perspective , these kinds of restrictions often end up being used against progressives in rather short order . )But it is legal - and always has been under the First Amendment - for non - governmental political groups to decide who may attend private gatherings or be published in their media ; free speech does not guarantee your right to crash anyone 's party , join their organization , or attend their meetings .Likewise , media are under no obligation to publish articles representing everyone 's viewpoints .Freedom of speech means that the government can not suppress individuals from holding their own meetings or expressing political opinions publicly - it does not dictate that Far Right activists must be given open access to progressive events .In addition , when identifying whom to exclude , simplistic rhetorical disavowals can not be taken at face value ; today it is nearly impossible to find almost anyone who will accept the label \" racist \" or \" fascist .\"Even hooded Klan members will publicly declare that they are not \" racists \" and do not \" hate \" others .These following four points of exclusion have differing levels of complexity .The adoption of White separatism as consistent with a political program is the most concrete and clear - cut .While antisemitic and related narratives are relatively easy to identify even when coded , not everyone is familiar with them , and some activists unknowingly use them .The use of fascist symbolism and imagery is complicated and has to be judged on a case - by - case basis .And last , the question of dealing with left - wing media , which promote problematic writers and speakers , can be the most complicated question when deciding about taking action . 1 ) Anyone who actively promotes or endorses the idea of White separatism should be treated as a Far Right activist .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.988716"}

Johnson , who co - founded the Ohio Unorganized Militia and described militias as \" the civil rights movement of the 1990s .\" Johnson urged black people to join the Patriot movement and argued , \" If our ancestors would have been armed , they would not have been slaves ! \"Today , among the members profiled on the Oath Keepers website are several people of color , reflecting the group 's claim that \" Oath Keepers come in all colors , shapes , sizes , ages , and backgrounds ... \" .The emphasis on gun rights , which Oath Keepers shares with the rest of the Patriot movement , helps us understand the movement 's often muddled racial politics .In the United States there 's an organic connection between racism and guns , because an armed white male populace was historically one of the cornerstones of the whole system of racial oppression .Frontier settlers needed guns for conquering Indian and Mexican lands , and white men in the South needed to be armed to keep control over enslaved black people , who were not allowed to have guns .Armed , decentralized white power has generally served ruling elites but has also fueled right - wing populist upsurges that clashed with elite interests - such as the original Reconstruction - era Ku Klux Klan , which fought a guerrilla war against \" northern military despotism . \" And people of color and their allies , too , have invoked the right to bear arms - from anti - slavery activists to Chicano land rights defenders and the Black Panther Party .As a result , gun control has sometimes been used to enforce white rule , as when conservatives in the late 1960s advocated stricter gun laws because they were afraid of the Black Panthers .All of this history is in the mix when Patriot groups talk about the Second Amendment .And while the predominant thread of that history is about defending white privilege , other threads are sometimes visible .\" That 's why the Oath Keepers often talk about \" protecting life , liberty , and property , \" and why they initially went into Ferguson to guard businesses .Defending supposed property rights against federal government intrusion was what drove the Bundy ranch action in 2014 .For similar reasons , armed Oath Keepers and other Patriot activists have more recently protected disputed mining claims in Oregon and Montana against \" unlawful \" federal action .These Oath Keeper operations reflect a Patriot movement consensus .Capitalist individualism and racism are historically and culturally connected , but they 're not inseparable .In an era when overt racial bigotry is widely discredited , it should n't be a surprise when even hardline right - wingers want to move beyond the white supremacist legacy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.60033"}

{"text": "\" It 's going to make the region more unstable , \" he told the BBC on the first day of his Conservative Party 's annual conference in Manchester .Activists in Syria believe that the Assad 's regime is providing the Russians with a list of targets to be hit .So Assad selects the targets , and Putin 's air force carries out the bombing .This explains why ISIS is being spared .It is not therefore surprising to see Putin 's airstrikes are not attacking ISIS ( Daesh ) .ISIS has never been a real threat to Assad .The Assad regime committed unspeakable crimes against its own people , colluding with ISIS for over two years .Evidence shows the Assad regime never targeted ISIS but invariably attacked the Free Syrian Army , the only moderate rebel group in Syria fighting ISIS ( Daesh ) apart from the Kurdish Peshmerga in the north of Syria .When Daesh seized oil wells the regime was its first customer , providing funding and support .The relationship between the Assad and ISIS is complex and based on a mutuality of serving each other .It is a kind of a Faustian pact at best , and an outright collusion at worst .So , neither the Assad 's regime nor Moscow are in a hurry to get rid of Daesh .The dithering Obama administration has handed the initiative to Putin who seized it with relish .He is now calling the shots and is telling the world Assad must stay .Historical precedent is on Putin 's side , he seized Crimea in March 2014 and the West did nothing apart from imposing puny financial sanctions here and there .The gullible John Kerry , US Secretary of State , and Philip Hammond , UK Foreign Secretary have cautiously welcomed Putin 's intervention in Syria .Hammond told the media he hoped Moscow will use its leverage to force Assad to scale down barrel bomb attacks against Syrian civilians .The exact opposite happened .More and more barrel bombs are being dropped on people because Putin 's action has emboldened Assad to be more brutal .Kerry in the meantime is busy arranging meetings , holding meetings , and speaking about more meetings , and telling the media about his constructive talks in various meetings .Putin has forced the West to accept that Assad can stay during the transitional period which can be 3 months , 6 months , 2 years or 4 .Putin decides and the world complies .When I asked an American contact about Obama 's paralysis he replied - \" He is receiving advice from pro - Iranian advisors and from Tehran - funded lobbyists not to say or do anything that may alienate Iran and jeopardise the nuclear deal \" .This explains somewhat Obama self - imposed paralysis .So the conclusion is this ; no matter what Obama says or does , no one seems to take any notice .Republican Senator John McCain , a long - time critic of the current US administration , blames Obama 's inaction and lack of strategy for Syria .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.23842"}

Paxton , and Roger Griffin , and uses this to summarize Trump 's fascistic and non - fascistic aspects .On the other hand , Neiwert notes two key points that set Trump 's candidacy apart from fascism .First , although Trump has encouraged spontaneous violence against his critics and targets of his rhetoric , he 's made no moves to develop or ally with a political paramilitary force along the lines of the Italian Blackshirts or the Nazi Stormtroopers .Second , and more importantly , Trump \" lacks any kind of coherent , or even semi - coherent , ideology .\" While fascists are absolutists who demand ideological purity , \" Trump 's only real ideology is the Worship of the Donald . \"He is pushing a kind of gut - level hatred and paranoia , Neiwert argues , not because of his own belief system , but because it 's a way to win votes .I would extend this line of thought further , drawing particularly on Roger Griffin 's analysis of fascism .Point One : it 's true that Trump 's candidacy , like fascism , emphasizes a kind of populism , in that Trump has presented himself as an advocate of the common people against corrupt or sinister elites .But as Griffin argues , fascism is n't populist only in a rhetorical sense .Rather , both as a movement and a regime , fascism seeks to actively and permanently mobilize large masses of people through a network of top - down organizations , constant propaganda , and elaborate public rituals such as the Nazi Party 's Nuremberg rallies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.67654"}

{"text": "The National - Anarchists , for example , denounce the centralized state , capitalism , and globalization - but in its place they seek to establish a system of ethnically pure villages .In 1990 , Chip Berlet showed in Right Woos Left how the extreme Right in the United States has made numerous overtures to the Left . 1 More recently , the fascist Right has also tried to build alliances based on concern for the environment , hardline antizionism , and opposition to globalization .Fascism has become increasingly international in the post World War II period , particularly with the rise of the internet .One of the most obvious results of this internationalization is the continual flow of European ideas to the United States ; for example , the Nazi skinhead movement originated in Britain and quickly spread to the United States .In trade , Americans have exported the Ku Klux Klan to Europe and smuggled Holocaust denial and neo - Nazi literature into Germany .The National - Anarchist idea has spread around the world over the internet .The United States hosts only a few web sites , but the trend so far has been towards a steady increase .But it represents what many see as the potential new face of fascism .Simultaneously , National - Anarchists hope to draw members ( such as reactionary counter - culturalists and British National Party members ) away from traditional White Nationalist groups to their own blend of what they claim is \" neither left nor right . \"Despite this claim , National - Anarchist ideology is centered directly on what scholar Roger Griffin defines as the core of fascism : \" palingenetic populist ultranationalism . \" \" Palingenetic , \" he says , is a \" generic term for the vision of a radically new beginning which follows a period of destruction or perceived dissolution .\" Palingenetic ultranationalism therefore is \" one whose mobilizing vision is that of the national community rising phoenix like after a period of encroaching decadence which all but destroyed it .\" For the National - Anarchists , this \" ultranationalism \" is also their main ideological innovation : a desire to create a stateless ( and hence \" anarchist \" ) system of ethnically pure villages .Troy Southgate , their leading ideologue , says \" we just want to stress that National - Anarchism is an essential racialist phenomenon .That 's what makes it different .\" Why should we pay attention to such new forms of fascism ?There is no immediate threat of fascism taking power in the established western liberal democracies ; the rise to power of Mussolini and Hitler in the 1920s and 1930s occurred in a different era and under different social conditions than those that exist today .Nonetheless , much is at stake .These new permutations have the potential of playing havoc on social movements , drawing activists out from the Left into the Right .For example , when the Soviet Union collapsed , a number of non - Communist left - wing groups suddenly emerged in Russia offering the promise of a more egalitarian society sans dictatorship .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "122.203156"}
