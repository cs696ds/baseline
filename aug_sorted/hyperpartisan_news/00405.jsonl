H. R. Haldeman .[ Source : Southern Methodist University ] Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward runs into difficulty with his FBI source , W. Mark Felt , the infamous \" Deep Throat \" ( see May 31 , 2005 ) .Woodward wants information connecting Nixon 's chief of staff , H. R. Haldeman , to the Nixon campaign \" slush fund \" ( see Early 1970 ) , but Felt , apparently afraid of crossing Haldeman ( see October 19 , 1972 ) , refuses to provide anything specific .Origin of Error - Woodward and his colleague , Carl Bernstein , attempt to secure confirmation of Haldeman 's role in Watergate through the treasurer of the Nixon campaign 's secret fund ( see September 29 , 1972 ) , Hugh Sloan .The reporters misinterpret Sloan 's cautious statements as indirect confirmation that Sloan had testified to the FBI of Haldeman 's involvement .Additionally , they misinterpret guarded \" confirmations \" from two other sources .On October 25 , the Post publishes a story about Sloan 's supposed assertions . 'All Hell Broke Lose ' - Sloan 's attorney denies that his client ever made such an assertion in his testimony ( Sloan will later confirm that Haldeman was indeed in charge of the secret fund , but he never testified to that fact ) .As Woodward later writes , \" All hell broke loose .\" Woodward and his partner Carl Bernstein , both clearly upset , offer to resign from the Post , an offer that is refused .The White House celebrates the error , calling into question every story Bernstein and Woodward wrote for the Post ; Republican supporters such as Senator Bob Dole ( R - KS ) join in .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "54.47844"}

{"text": "The study examines the \" prejudice scores \" of the study participants , and finds \" higher prejudice predicted whites seeing Obama as less American , which , in turn , predicted lower evaluations of his performance .\"Blacks tended to rate Obama 's performance higher than Biden 's , but do not view their \" Americanism \" as significantly different .Hehman finds : \" Overall , the results support our hypothesis that negative evaluations of Obama by white participants may be racially motivated .Whites are guarded about openly endorsing the view that blacks are less American than whites , which may suppress overall mean differences in performance ratings and perceptions of Obama being un - American .However , bias in viewing blacks as less American than whites appeared to implicitly underlie whites ' negative evaluations of his performance .Also , consistent with previous research , blacks did not demonstrate such a relationship , nor did Americanism mediate the relationship between prejudice and performance evaluations when Vice President Biden acted as target for either whites or blacks .Whereas previous work has linked white prejudice with negative perceptions of Obama , the current work reveals a mechanism that may be largely responsible for this effect , Obama 's non - prototypicality ( largely in terms of his race ) and thus reduced perceptions of his Americanism . \"Hehman notes that media speculations that the \" birther \" controversy is fueled by racial prejudice are \" sadly the case .As the United States approaches important decisions regarding issues such as economic reform , health care , and overseas military interventions , the intrusion of racial attitudes in the evaluation of political leaders ' performance is ironically inconsistent with what many believe to be ' American . ' \" President Obama has consistently faced a number of controversies that are , frankly , not based on fact .We thought that his critics ' persistence in pursuing these fantasies , such as Obama 's birth in a foreign nation or being a Muslim , in the face of facts saying otherwise , might be indirectly rooted in racism .Our research investigated whether people who held racial prejudices might be more likely to see Obama as ' un - American , ' presumably because of his race .Indeed , this is what we found .Whites who were prejudiced against blacks were more likely to see Obama as un - American , and in turn , evaluated Obama as performing more poorly as president .Whites who were not prejudiced , and blacks in general , did not do so .Additionally and importantly , this relationship was only found with Obama , as prejudiced whites did not see Vice President Joe Biden as un - American , despite the fact that Obama and Biden share political party affiliation and agenda . \"He will conclude : \" The April 27 release of Obama 's long - form birth certificate is a situation where President Obama and the White House eventually had to exert effort to quell a controversy that should never have been an issue .Our research indicates that one reason it may have initially become an issue at all has more to do with his race than his place of birth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.314224"}
