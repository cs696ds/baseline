Knopf in 1926 .After graduating from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania , his first novel , Not Without Laughter , won the Harmon gold medal for literature in 1930 .He wrote about his travels to Cuba , Haiti , Russia , Soviet Central Asia , Japan , and Spain during its Civil War during the 1930s in his book I Wonder As I Wander .Langston Hughes was influenced by Paul Lawrence Dunbar , Carl Sandburg , and Walt Whitman writing novels , short stories , plays , and poetry about the life and struggles of African Americans during the early and middle of the twentieth century .Hughes wrote his most radical poems during the 1930s , as the suffering that he witnessed during the Great Depression pushed Hughes to embrace a radical socialist vision .Arnold Rampersad wrote in the introduction to the book The Collected Works of Langston Hughes Volume 1 The Poems 1921 - 1940 about his social vision in his poetry : .Another , no doubt more recognizable stream in Hughes 's poetry is that comprising poems that protest , directly or indirectly , against social injustice .All his life , so it often seems , Hughes wrote mainly in order to protest .He took seriously the tradition of political resistance to tyranny or injustice into which he had been born ...Hughes 's sense of social injustice was not limited by race .After 1940 , Hughes moved away from the radical politics of the Great Depression towards more progressive politics .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.505848"}

Simple that he created in the 1940 's for the Chicago Defender & New York Post .The humor and dialect of Jesse Simple disguised his common sense while depicting the everyday American experiences of Black citizens .Langston Hughes died in 1967 .Let America be America Again LANGSTON HUGHES 1938 Originally published in Esquire and in the International Worker Order pamphlet A New Song ( 1938 ) .Let America be America again .Let it be the dream it used to be .Let it be the pioneer on the plain Seeking a home where he himself is free .( America never was America to me . )Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed-- Let it be that great strong land of love Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme That any man be crushed by one above .( It never was America to me . )O , let my land be a land where Liberty Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath , But opportunity is real , and life is free , Equality is in the air we breathe .( There 's never been equality for me , Nor freedom in this \" homeland of the free . \" )Say , who are you that mumbles in the dark ?And who are you that draws your veil across the stars ?I am the poor white , fooled and pushed apart , I am the Negro bearing slavery 's scars .I am the red man driven from the land , I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek-- And finding only the same old stupid plan Of dog eat dog , of mighty crush the weak .I am the young man , full of strength and hope , Tangled in that ancient endless chain Of profit , power , gain , of grab the land !Of grab the gold !Of grab the ways of satisfying need !Of work the men !Of take the pay !Of owning everything for one 's own greed !I am the farmer , bondsman to the soil .I am the worker sold to the machine .I am the Negro , servant to you all .I am the people , humble , hungry , mean-- Hungry yet today despite the dream .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.160416"}

'Poets have always had a strong presence in social justice causes .In the 1800s , Lord Byron supported the Luddites and Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire and Percy Shelley was an advocate for nonviolence and social justice for the lower classes .W.S. Merton and Robinson Jeffers were strong advocates for environmental causes .Lanston Hughes , Amiri Baraka , Gwendolyn Brooks , and Robert Hayden were strong supporters of the civil rights movement .Muriel Rukeyser , Grace Paley , and June Jordan participated in the antiwar movement , the civil rights movement and the feminist movement .With this history of social activism by poets , it comes as no surprise that many poets are participating in the Occupy Wall Street protests that are around the country .A Facebook page called Poetry@OccupyWallStreet has been created to information to poets on ways in which they can participate in the Occupy Wall Street protests .Through this page , poets can organize readings , and post poems to be read .Every Friday night in the New York site , at around 9:30pm , poets of all walks of life and ages come in and read or perform their poetry .The Occupy Wall Street Library has just published an Occupy Wall Street Poetry Anthology .Right now the anthology is available only at the Occupy Wall Street Library , but there are plans to have it available online .Famous poets like Anne Waldman , Adrienne Rich , and Michael McClure have contributed their poetry , as well as regular people and even children .Melissa Tuckey is the assistant festival director for the Split This Rock Poetry Festival which celebrates the many ways that poetry can act as an agent for change .In March of 2012 , the Split This Rock Poetry Festival will take place in Washington , DC , for four days and more than 40 events - readings , workshops , panel discussions , youth programs , open mics , and activism .The 2012 Festival will be dedicated to the life and work of June Jordan .Below are poems from favorite poets who deal with social justice issues .Let America be America again .Let it be the dream it used to be .Let it be the pioneer on the plain Seeking a home where he himself is free .( America never was America to me . )Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed- Let it be that great strong land of love Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme That any man be crushed by one above .( It never was America to me . )O , let my land be a land where Liberty Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath , But opportunity is real , and life is free , Equality is in the air we breathe .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.78626"}
{"text": "\" You get scared , \" Solomon said .\" I never know , but maybe next time they could be a target .\" The neighborhood sees a high turnover of residents , which makes it more difficult to feel safe when you do not know your neighbors , he said .\" It 's hard to know your neighbors here with all the going in and out , \" Solomon said .When Elaine Wingert and her husband , Ron , moved into a home near Seventh Street and Van Eps Avenue about 45 years ago , the area was filled with middle - class working families .Those families owned their homes and a tightly knit , safe community developed over the years , she said .\" I had no problem with letting my kids run around out there , \" Wingert said .About 20 years ago , as the homeowners aged or died and children moved away , the neighborhood began to change , she said .Though it was n't an outright decline , drugs and other crimes began to creep into the area , and fewer families moved back in , Wingert said .\" As people got older and they sold their homes , there got to be lots of rental property and people were n't taking care of things like they should , \" she said .Though Wingert said she still feels safe in her neighborhood , the concentration of sex offenders could signal another , less positive change in the quality of life in the area .\" The good people are going to move out , and your property values are going to go down , \" she said .The number of sex offenders was a surprise to Brandie Haraldson , who moved into a home near Fourth Street and Wayland Avenue in December .With a 2-year - old son and an 11-year - old daughter , she said she is much more vigilant about her children 's activities outside .\" My daughter ca n't walk alone anywhere , \" she said .\" I do n't leave them alone outside .Where we used to live , they used to go to the park by themselves all the time . \"Haraldson said she found out about the number of sex offenders in her ZIP code after she checked the online sex offender registry shortly after moving in .But like Wingert and Ferrie , she feels there are more pressing crime concerns than sex offenders .The need for few enticements .Sex offenders , like any other convicts intent on recovery and rehabilitation , are best served with fewer enticements and negative influences , said Scott Pribyl , a Sioux Falls psychologist who treats sex offenders .He said there has not been enough research to conclusively link recidivism in sex offenders to their living around other sex offenders .\" I think they need to be more on guard if they 're surrounded by more risks , \" Pribyl said .A February 2007 report published by the U.S. Department of Justice 's Center for Sex Offender Management suggests attempts to keep them out of neighborhoods can even make matters worse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.297134"}
