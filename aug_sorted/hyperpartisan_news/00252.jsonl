Abrams Star Trek movie .I 'll share all the details eventually but for the moment let 's break a piece of exclusive info : that writer / director Tyler Perry has a role in the new Star Trek movie .If you want to know who Perry is playing and how his character impacts the lives of young Kirk and Spock , beware of spoilers and click on through to read about it .And I mean that : SPOILERS ARE AHEAD !It looks like Perry is playing the head of Starfleet Academy .Before you go asking if the character is going to be a human being or one of those funky aliens with a dozen more nostrils , it looks like Perry 's character is a plain old fashioned human .Here 's some background on the dude : Tyler Perry is one of the bigger breakthrough success stories that Hollywood has had recently .He began his career and won acclaim as a playwright before moving into film .He 's directed and written the screen stories for Madea 's Family Reunion , Diary of a Mad Black Woman , Daddy 's Little Girls and his latest hit which came out earlier in the year , Why Did I Get Married ?If the man 's a Trekkie he 's kept it quiet or maybe J.J. is just a fan of Madea .My informant tells me about a big scene that was filmed a couple of weeks back that involved Perry , Chris Pine ( the young James T. Kirk ) , Zachary Quinto ( young Spock ) and dozens of other extras .Now really , if you 're here then you already decided that you wanted to be spoiled , but here comes the bigger spoilers ... . ...Tyler 's character is overseeing some kind of Starfleet courtroom / assembly event where young Kirk is facing expulsion from Starfleet .It turns out that the Starfleet prez did n't look too favorably on Cadet Kirk for \" cheating \" on one of his critical tests .And all you Trekkies out there know exactly what it is Kirk did : he rigged the Kobayashi Maru test so he could win it .( For those that do n't know their Tribbles from Andorians , the Kobayashi Maru is a piece of Trek lore introduced in Star Trek II .Starfleet cadets are placed inside a starship simulator and given a no - win scenario : either try and rescue the survivors of a stranded space freighter trapped behind the Klingon Neutral Zone and thus in enemy space or listen to them die when they are found by the Klingons .The test is designed that there is no possible outcome where you save the Maru survivors and beat the Klingons ; it 's supposed to give cadets a taste of what it 's like to be working under pressure as you face probably death .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.222336"}

Board of Education decision ending school segregation .Much is made of Democrat President Harry Truman 's issuing an Executive Order in 1948 to desegregate the military .Not mentioned is the fact that it was Eisenhower who actually took action to effectively end segregation in the military .Democrat President John F.

{"text": "When I approached the pastor at my new parish , my decision to leave the marriage was affirmed by his acceptance of my story and by his statement , \" This is not the life that God intended for you .\" These were the words that I had longed to hear from my Church -- words that enabled me to let go of the sense of guilt and responsibility to stay in the marriage at all costs .Besides being supportive during a very volatile and difficult divorce , my pastor and other members of the faith community helped ensure my safety and the safety of my children .I 'll always remember the pastoral team members who watched my children so I could go to my divorce hearing without fearing that my abuser would successfully carry out his threat to kidnap them .Further affirmation from the Church was received from the diocesan tribunal that granted my annulment petition .The support of the Church was a critical turning point in my healing process .I had finally broken the code of silence and I had not been ridiculed or criticized because I had told my story .To receive the recognition that the terror I had experienced did not constitute a \" sacramental \" marriage was profoundly life - giving .Since the divorce and annulment , I continued to be harassed and threatened by my abuser but I have learned how to protect myself and my children from the abuse .I have not been afraid to use the legal system and other community resources as needed to work through the after - effects of the abuse .However , one of the most important and life - giving resources for me has been the continued support of other pastors and parishioners .The truth of my story has never been questioned -- listening and believing is one of the most powerful things that you can do to help a woman move from being a victim to being a survivor .Not questioning or judging our decisions is another way of affirming us as we reconstruct our lives .Being patient during the slow healing process is another way to support us since our healing does not necessarily follow your timetable .My life has been blessed by the presence of individuals who have been gracious enough to continue to walk this journey with me at my own pace and under my terms .Finally and perhaps most importantly for my continued growth , I 've been able to explore faith issues with several pastors over the years .I was very fortunate to never experience pastoral care that used Scripture to justify the battering so that was not one of my faith issues .In my case specifically , I have had to deal with my anger towards my abuser , something that may never fully fade away .Although I never became angry with God because of the abuse , I had to become reacquainted with a loving , merciful God who loved me unconditionally and loved me as I truly am .In process , my relationship with God has grown much deeper and richer .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.37369"}

{"text": "Before the other precipitating factors mentioned , I think that it is also important to attend to the way that guns feature within understandings of masculinity , especially within America .That guns are the primary chosen weapon in many cases probably is n't accidental .Returning to my first point , about recognizing that masculinity typically has certain needs and drives and that , while these can be channelled , they wo n't go away .As a sex , men typically have a profound existential need for status and recognition of their agency , and the effects of this can be seen across many societies .The effects of this need can be revealed throughout a vast range of male behaviours and interactions .There are obviously exceptions , but I really do n't believe that this is going to go away any time soon .Too much gender theory dreams that we could create a society where this particularly masculine urge and its unwelcome effects could largely be extinguished .I believe that we would be much better off being realistic about the situation .Even were this urge in no sense inescapably part of male psychology , we are n't going to get rid of it any time soon .Too many of the suggestions tend to depend upon the removal or general absence of this urge .I would suggest that far more important are the provision of healthy means of satisfying it and addressing of the dysfunctional ways in which our society frustrates or misdirects this urge .It is very easy for relatively economically and socially privileged men to speak about some sort of progressive masculinity , largely because society affirms their agency in many and various ways .However , when you are a male below the poverty line , there are no jobs , and you ca n't hold down a relationship , masculinity becomes a much more complicated affair .Progressive masculinity is typically a masculinity of privilege , which is protected from the sorts of stresses that masculinity is exposed to at the margins .Real progress for masculinity will only be made when all men have means of making their agency recognized and valued in healthy ways .Issues such as social inequity are an important part of the picture here as societies that vastly overvalue some men 's agency over others will prove frustrating and degrading and will lead to anti - social forms of masculinity .Most of the suggestions in this piece address the lightning rods along which the rage of frustrated masculinity will pass .However , they largely fail to address the underlying needs of that masculinity , leaving it frustrated .It is like trying to plug all of the escape valves in a boiler that contains too much pressure , rather than recognizing and addressing the pressure itself .Thanks , Lisa .Highlighting the stress that threats to masculinity can cause a male is a welcome perspective that I feel that we in the west have lost .During my time in warrior based cultures in Africa where they have a strong tradition of male initiation by a community of elders , I learned that manhood is a much more delicate thing than womanhood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.509026"}

{"text": "Notions of responsibility can translate on the ground into moralistic directives that intrude into clinic spaces and have unintended effects .Interactions with health care workers may accentuate existing feelings of guilt and undermine necessary strategies that women have employed to negotiate HIV infection in their day - to - day lives .Even in contexts like South Africa , where rights have been prominent in HIV programming , these framings of ' responsibilities ' can in fact encourage practices on the part of health care workers that diverge from an approach respecting individual rights , such as the right to choice .This might occur , for example , when options regarding pregnancy are not presented to HIV - positive women or supported by their health professionals .Pressure to disclose status can inhibit rights that have meaning for women , such as a right to silence .This situation is compounded by the reality that antenatal testing has contributed to a gendered profile with respect to the uptake of testing and treatment in South Africa .It has been argued that anthropological analyses of human rights contribute to critical approaches \" ... insofar as they stress human sociality as opposed to the foundation for human rights found in conventional liberal accounts \" ( [ 50 ] . p7 ) .This point is borne out in Ross ' account [ 34 ] of women who applied to testify in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa .She contends that the legal language attendant upon universal human rights discourses can ignore the complexity of shifting webs of social relations within which discussions of rights necessarily come to be embedded .This is especially so given that the gendered nature of testing uptake contributes to conceptualisations of women as especially responsible for reducing transmission .Of further salience is the fact that a situation persists where gender inequality contributes to a high HIV prevalence and where customary laws , that can further reinforce women 's unequal position , occupy an uneasy position alongside universal concepts of human rights .List of abbreviations used .Competing interests .The authors declare that they have no competing interests .Authors ' contributions .HM wrote the first draft of the paper and coordinated revisions .Both authors contributed to the analysis , subsequent drafts and conclusions .Acknowledgements .Thank you to Nondusimo Hlwele for her invaluable assistance with the data collection .This project was supported through the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology , University of Cambridge .This article has been published as part of BMC International Health and Human Rights Volume 11 Supplement 3 , 2011 :Contextualising rights : the lived experience of sexual and reproductive health rights .Publication of this supplement has been supported by funding from the UK Department for International Development ( DFID ) for the Research Programme Consortium on Realising Rights : Improving Sexual and Reproductive Health in Poor and Vulnerable Populations .References .Cooper D , Morroni C , Orner P , Moodley J , Harries J , Cullingworth L , Hoffman M.

{"text": "These difficulties become most salient in the dilemmas expressed with respect to disclosure .It is apparent that the women cherished desires for fulfilling sexual relationships , but these were hard to achieve in the face of the considerable personal risks associated with revealing HIV status .The clinic directive to practise safe sex with condoms to prevent infecting others ( and indeed re - infection of yourself ) was understood to be an ideal .It inferred a responsibility to protect a sexual partner .However , in practice it had to be reworked , as these women most often lacked the power in intimate relationships to insist on the use of condoms .They felt unable at times to pursue a policy of upfront disclosure of their status due to fear of stigma , abandonment , loss of financial support and even violence .To the existing inequality in gender relations would be added the factor of their positive status in a seemingly discordant relationship .Some women thus resorted to a compromise in the non - verbal : the offer of a condom was still referred to as ' disclosure ' .The twist on the responsibility discourse of the clinic that enabled justification of this compromise , erased responsibility for the other by implying that each person bears responsibility largely to protect him / herself .Such a justification might be rationalised into an extension of the emphasis at the clinic on individuals becoming responsible for their own health .Thus it is also a man 's responsibility to protect himself and indeed to find out his own status .In many ways it is understandable how women in such settings might feel that with respect to their sexual encounters , they can only be responsible for themselves .Even if they do feel some responsibility for the sexual partner , as Busisiwe did , they are often either limited in the extent they feel able to act on that sense , or doing so carries the risk of personal repercussions .Not disclosing and at times having unsafe sex is then justified with the assertion that men must also take responsibility for their health and sexual safety and use condoms and testing services .Of course there are risks of a new HIV or other infection for the women if the man turns down the offer of the condom , but perhaps at times these risks appear less significant than others immediately in their life path .Women living in these circumstances have to negotiate the extent to which they can take responsibility for others and they justify the instances where this is not possible .The right that they found most salient in such intimate encounters appears to be a right to keep their status confidential , to maintain silence .The women 's concerns around disclosure point to a complex field [ 33 ] in which socio - economically underprivileged women negotiate their relationships , with medicine , health professionals and with their partners .Consideration of the South African example adds a further dimension to debates about contextualising rights by illustrating very real political tensions between universal notions of human rights and more relativist positions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.065704"}

{"text": "Yet , in February of this year , the Washington Post blog \" Fact Checker \" by Michael Dobbs was dutifully reporting the Obama - Ayers connection in the following terms : .The only hard facts that have come out so far are the $ 200 contribution by Ayers to the Obama re - election fund , and their joint membership of the eight - person Woods Fund Board .Ayers did not respond to e - mails and telephone calls requesting clarification of the relationship .Obama spokesman Bill Burton noted in a statement that Ayers was a professor of education at the University of Illinois and a former aide to Mayor Richard M. Daley , and continued : .Senator Obama strongly condemns the violent actions of the Weathermen group , as he does all acts of violence .But he was an eight - year - old child when Ayers and the Weathermen were active , and any attempt to connect Obama with events of almost forty years ago is ridiculous .But the Obama - Ayers link is a tenuous one ....Whatever his past , Ayers is now a respected member of the Chicago intelligentsia , and still a member of the Woods Fund Board .The president of the Woods Fund , Deborah Harrington , said he had been selected for the board because of his solid academic credentials and \" passion for social justice .This whole connection is a stretch , \" Harrington told me .\" Barack was very well known in Chicago , and a highly respected legislator .It would be difficult to find people round here who never volunteered or contributed money to one of his campaigns .This might have remained the accepted version had it not been for reporting done over the last few months by Steve Diamond at his blog Global Labor and Politics .He has seen some of the CAC documents that Kurtz is trying to obtain ( some of which I quote here ) , and has them posted at his site .It would take much more time than I have right now to go through all Diamond 's reporting on this subject , but I think it can be synthesized down to a few bullet points and some conclusions and suppositions about that which is not yet known .First , Ayers remains a radical left Marxist / Maoist just as he was in his days in the Weather Underground , and before that the Students for Democratic Society .Second , Ayers now preaches revolution through propaganda and indoctrination which is to be taught in the form of primary and secondary school education .That 's what the CAC was all about , and that 's what the Obama campaign is so desperate to hide .The mission of the Collaborative was to save a pet project of Ayers in the Chicago school system called the \" Local School Councils .\" This was the battleground for a fight for control of the Chicago school system in the late 1980s and early 1990s .Ayers favored decentralizing control of the school system through the creation of elected \" Local School Councils \" to oversee the bureaucracy of individual schools or groups of schools .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.989716"}

{"text": "By the time of the follow - up interviews in 2008 , only one of the women , Nonkosi , remained in full - time employment in a new but still HIV - related job .Responding to a diagnosis of HIV .In their accounts in the book , the women reflected upon how they might have contracted HIV .Busisiwe recounted her relationship history in terms that emphasised a paucity of options .As a child in the rural Transkei she was shunted between the home of her stepfather and her grandmother , fending off the sexual advances of the former .When she entered high school she started seeing a boyfriend .Consequently her stepfather discontinued payment of her school fees .Her boyfriend gave her the money as he was working , and after a while she moved in with him .As her relationship with her stepfather had deteriorated , she felt she had no choice ; there was nowhere else to go .This partner openly maintained concurrent sexual partners and thus they fought frequently .She finally left him and met her husband ; by the age of twenty she was pregnant and then diagnosed with HIV .It is clear from her account that she assumed her husband to be negative at this time .She knew that her first boyfriend had become very thin and she linked his behaviour to her own infection .She had known of HIV but had not thought that there were people in South Africa with the condition .Thokosizwe 's account focused heavily upon her abduction and rape by a group of men at the age of twenty .She was unsure as to whether she had contracted HIV from that encounter or from her most recent boyfriend .Nandipha remembered that she could not comprehend at the antenatal clinic how she could be HIV - positive , as she only had one boyfriend at a given time .The other women were also unmarried and linked their HIV infection back to a particular partner .In their assessments the predominant sense is of themselves as victims , let down by men to whom they had been faithful .Nonkosi alone reflected upon her own agency in contracting the virus .The man she suspected had passed on the virus was now very ill .She was unsure if he had infected her purposefully but felt she could not blame him , as she had not used a condom .What is striking in these accounts in the book is the difficulty that these women experienced with disclosure upon learning of their status .Nandipha did not tell the father of her unborn child as she was concerned that he would leave her , even though she believed he ' gave ' her the virus .Thokosizwe 's partner seemed to respond supportively to her news and agreed to go for testing himself ; but she did not hear from him again and only saw him once more , when he was dying of AIDS in hospital .Busisiwe approached the issue by suggesting that both she and her husband should go for testing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.64083"}

{"text": "And after he became President , Kennedy was opposed to the 1963 March on Washington by Dr. King that was organized by A. Phillip Randolph , who was a black Republican .President Kennedy , through his brother Atty .Gen. Robert Kennedy , had Dr. King wiretapped and investigated by the FBI on suspicion of being a Communist in order to undermine Dr. King .In March of 1968 , while referring to Dr. King 's leaving Memphis , Tenn. , after riots broke out where a teenager was killed , Democrat Sen. Robert Byrd ( W.Va . ) , a former member of the Ku Klux Klan , called Dr. King a \" trouble - maker \" who starts trouble , but runs like a coward after trouble is ignited .A few weeks later , Dr. King returned to Memphis and was assassinated on April 4 , 1968 .Given the circumstances of that era , it is understandable why Dr. King was a Republican .It was the Republicans who fought to free blacks from slavery and amended the Constitution to grant blacks freedom ( 13th Amendment ) , citizenship ( 14th Amendment ) and the right to vote ( 15th Amendment ) .Republicans passed the civil rights laws of the 1860s , including the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Reconstruction Act of 1867 that was designed to establish a new government system in the Democrat - controlled South , one that was fair to blacks .Republicans also started the NAACP and affirmative action with Republican President Richard Nixon 's 1969 Philadelphia Plan ( crafted by black Republican Art Fletcher ) that set the nation 's fist goals and timetables .Although affirmative action now has been turned by the Democrats into an unfair quota system , affirmative action was begun by Nixon to counter the harm caused to blacks when Democrat President Woodrow Wilson in 1912 kicked all of the blacks out of federal government jobs .Few black Americans know that it was Republicans who founded the Historically Black Colleges and Universities .Unknown also is the fact that Republican Sen. Everett Dirksen from Illinois was key to the passage of civil rights legislation in 1957 , 1960 , 1964 and 1965 .Not mentioned in recent media stories about extension of the 1965 Voting Rights Act is the fact that Dirksen wrote the language for the bill .Dirksen also crafted the language for the Civil Rights Act of 1968 which prohibited discrimination in housing .President Lyndon Johnson could not have achieved passage of civil rights legislation without the support of Republicans .Critics of Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater , who ran for President against Johnson in 1964 , ignore the fact that Goldwater wanted to force the Democrats in the South to stop passing discriminatory laws and thus end the need to continuously enact federal civil rights legislation .Those who wrongly criticize Goldwater also ignore the fact that Johnson , in his 4,500 State of the Union Address delivered on Jan. 4 , 1965 , mentioned scores of topics for federal action , but only 35 words were devoted to civil rights .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "115.89363"}

'It seemed to me the double - haul was just adding some pulls both ways to normal casting .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.71239"}
{"text": "So when the next Titanic goes down the feminists can sing along with the musicians as it sinks this time .The pinnacle of chivalry is when a gentleman lays down his life , but hopefully it will not be necessary from our point of view anymore .Ahh ... Chivalary .It should be natural and it should not be just from men but from woman too .To open a door , or to help carry something will depend on the situation you are in .If a man is carrying heavy things and he needs a little help woman can help too provided she is able to .She should nt be standing there and watching .Also a woman should n't let a man carry all her shopping bags while she walks freely .It is in sharing these that we become more loving and kind to each other .A man will in fact respect woman more when she chips in to help .Some men spoil their girlfriends by doing everything by themselves .And the girlfriend will behave like a princess .Love is not one way but both ways .Doing things for each other will make both men & woman to respect , love , care and trust each other more .Woman need not do those difficult things for a man .but to be there and to do little things is good enough .It is in these little things that we become a better person .Chivalry ... good manners ...Christian charity ... niceness ... kindness . civility ... strength of character ... virtuous ... 'no , sir ' and ' yes , ma'am' ... such pleasant , generous words and gestures that do n't cost a thing , but have tangible and intangible results and benefits .Pat , you 're raising a christian , polite little gentleman .Good for yoy ; we need more of them .Just for the record , I open or hold the door for men also .It is called christianity & kindness .I 've found many young men who are true christians & gentlemen .I live in the south , where we were taught to say yes M'am if Bo , Sir , by my New Jersey born father .It ' all in how you 're raised & obey .It makes \" good \" men feel proud & pleased with themselves when \" ladies \" appreciate their chivalry & often smile when I comment \" chivalry till lives \" .Again , I repeat , I do hold doors open for men if I 'm ahead of them .\" Love your neighbor as you love yourself \" .I think the death of chivalry , and other such things , comes from the blurring of differences between the sexes , as well as disintegration of gender roles .From a more economic perspective , what is man 's incentive in modern times to be chivalrous ?Why should a man put women on a pedestal ?What does he get out of it ?In prior times , the relation between the sexes was more defined .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.73245"}

{"text": "If indeed there is no god then where does our conception of morality come from ?To me , it seems that being at least agnostic would make more sense .Everything in the Universe is derived as a result of of another action .So if you take every action back all the way to the beginning there seems to have to be an ultimate cause .This was brought up by Aquinas .A second possible argument is the clockmaker .What are the chances that if you took apart all the pieces of a clock and dropped them together that they would fit in to place exactly , causing the clock to function as it would without some external intervention .This probablity is soo immensely low .Likewise think of the human race as a clock .what is the possibity that the chain of events that has occured up to this point forming both the human body and consciousness .I 'll agree this one has holes in it , but does bring up a point .The clockmaker argument does n't hold up because a God with the ability / materials to create a complex universe is a more complex thing than just a universe ; the simpler something is , the greater the chance of it coming into existence \" by accident \" .A Godless universe is simpler than one that 's designed , so one that 's designed is less likely to exist .To me , there is a difference between my religion and what I believe in .I love being Jewish- the ties to the community are enormous .But I pretty much have made up something of my own- outside of what humans before me have written in the Torah - which is why I am not an athiest .The most important thing is to think- and think a lot-but I 'm not sure thinking ' logically , ' so to speak , is the best way .For instance , roughly quoting Slaughterhouse-5 , many people think time falls like beads on a string , one after another in chronological order- but I do n't think this is the true .Because of feelings like this , which I can not shake , I can not believe in something out of logic .But , I am positive that to others , it is the opposite .My point is ( I was going to expose my ideas of god , but I think that is too raw to me to just type out , ) you should n't be an automaton , believing in something just to imitate the actions of people around you .I think we should never stop thinking about our beliefs , even if we are athiests , or otherwise .There is no right or wrong answer , except one that you accept blindly .It seems as if the only logical answer to religion is to be Agnostic .Currently , the existence of God is something that we can not completely prove or disprove ; therefore , it is ignorant to choose either side .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "117.272156"}

{"text": "( There are certain situations where choice is taken from us , where our bodies are compelled to engage in something contrary to our will and spirit , in this it is what response we do have that is key to our identity .False imprisonment or rape are good examples of this : the victim suffers hurt and does not have choice in the physical situation , and bears no responsibility for the event whatsoever , legal or moral .What such victims are responsible for is how they deal with the aftermath , their own choices following the crime . )With self - control we must have respect : for ourselves , and for others .Respect is a measure of the value we place on ourselves and others .Just as we ought to act consistently with our own morals , so we should not compel others to act against theirs .We are created interdependent , but this is a relationship of give and take among equals , not taking from the lesser by the greater .Self - control , responsibility , and respect are how we ought to teach each and every boy and girl from their youngest years to view each other .The problem is , this is n't what we have been teaching people , and we are reaping the consequences .Does this problem give you pause ?It certainly should .This is not the place to deal with Gothard or Phillips .They have been upended elsewhere .However , their failures should be taken seriously as illumating their beliefs , and their teachings should be examined intently for evidence of the roots or outcomes of their sins .These and others in the Patriarchy movement , and really , throughout modern evangelicalism , have misunderstood a few key words in scripture , and around these misapprehensions they have constructed systems of teaching and belief that are entirely false and destructive .Among these misunderstood words are the ideas of lust and modesty .Lust and Modesty Misunderstood .Lust , in a clinical sense , has little to do with sexual titillation and nothing to do with the responsibility of the person or object being lusted over .To lust and covet are one and the same .Both mean desiring something that is not ours to have .Lust connotes a more physical sort of desiring , and that is the extent of the difference .Every time lust or covetousness is mentioned in scripture it is either a command not to do it , or a condemnation of the one doing it .So , you say , we agree there .But do we really ?We 're lying to ourselves .Our mouths are saying one thing , but our actions are shouting something else entirely : that we hold women responsible for the lustful and covetous thoughts of infantile men .Job did n't say he would n't look at a young woman , a pretty woman , or any woman .In Job 31:1 he says that the covenant he 'd made with his eyes was that he would n't covet ( lust after , attend to , fix his regard upon ) a woman , even if she was young and attractive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "117.93909"}

{"text": "None of the women attended support groups any longer ; they were \" living their own lives , with their own HIV \" , as Nonkosi put it .The women expressed a strong sense of personal responsibility to remember the pills , to live healthily , to attend appointments and collect medication .The interviews indicate that they were now inclined to interpret their bodily states in terms of biological markers , so central to managing HIV as a chronic illness .Indeed it was these markers that enabled clinic staff to check if they were conforming .The descriptions of interactions in the clinic indicate a concern not to end up in a situation of being \" punished \" for non - adherence , by having to endure more frequent appointments and home visits .In addition , the women emphasised a personal commitment to heeding the warnings of health professionals not to end up on second - line therapy , or contract drug - resistant infections .As the language of rights was so central to the book , the language of personal responsibility had become prominent in their lives .Behaving responsibly was seen by them as key to staying well , and their memories of illness easily summoned a motivating fear .Thus the women could also judge those not conforming to the rules of the regime , as much as they were still defining for themselves where the boundaries of personal responsibility lay in their own private lives .Discussion .The HIV positive women whose perspectives on their sexual and reproductive lives are described above have personally experienced the benefit of gaining access to ART through advocacy efforts asserting their individual rights to health .Apart from a role as activists campaigning for rights , they have been ' experts ' educating others about living with HIV , and are themselves also patients subject to the surveillance of treatment regimes .The majority of them are Christians who consider the support of their churches central to coping with chronic illness .Furthermore , they are part of communities where strong social discourses prevail regarding HIV , childbearing and gender hierarchies .Clearly all these experiences will have influenced their understandings of their rights as women and as citizens , and also their notions of responsibilities .It is evident from the follow - up study , however , that they faced several constraints in fully actualising their SRH rights and some rights had greater relevance to their circumstances than others .The impression gained from the descriptions of their lives in 2008 is that several SRH rights remained an ideal as opposed to a reality .Having lost certain income benefits that came in the early years of having HIV , most of them were again struggling to maintain a basic level of economic survival , alongside other realities that compromised their broader wellbeing .It is thus understandable that HIV activist organisations have expanded their emphasis also to advocating for broader socio - economic rights .It is evident from the follow - up interviews that the women 's experience of living with HIV had also become more private and focused on responsibilities , reflected particularly in a sense of responsibility personally to remain healthy and adhere to medication , as espoused in treatment programmes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "119.20999"}

{"text": "I just have a problem with people not respecting others .Personally , I find that atheists tend to be very intelligent .In fact , they 're usually so intelligent that they feel they do n't need God , or at least do n't want to need Him .Intelligent people tend to be very good at rationalizing things to justify their own ends .I also used to wonder if people were religious out of fear , but after years of pondering the question , came to the conclusion that it is a much more frightful proposition to consider that there might be a hell and eternal damnation .Takes a lot of courage to admit that possibility .The saying goes , if you 're religious and live life based on that , but in the end there is no God or eternity , then it does n't really matter how you lived your life .But if you 're an atheist and live your life based on that and discover in the end that there really is a God , then it REALLY matters .So why take a chance ?But of course , that 's way too simple - minded for most atheists .Attacking Christianity gets repetative , so here are other reasons for my atheism : . \"After posting the religion thread , I feel inclined to post an argument against atheism .I have two examples .First , atheism requires no intelligence .Fish and mice are probably atheists .Second , atheism did n't help the Soviet Union very much . \" Breathing requires little to no intelligence .Therefore , all who breathe are idiots .Christianity did n't help the Roman Empire very much either .The reason why I am an atheist is precisely because I have spent so much time thinking about the Judeo - Christian worldview , that I am no longer able to see it in a different way from any other ( equally unlikely ) belief system .There are simply so many reasons why I find Judeo - Christian theism to be improbable and/or impossible , that I find it difficult to relate to people who believe in it .I am not trying to offend anyone , but that is my perception of mainstream western religious belief , and that is the reason why I can not follow it , regardless of any consequences .The problem with Pascal 's wager is that I can not choose to believe .Personally , i have huge respect for atheists .As JustPerfect mentioned , many people stay in a religion because of fear of rejection by parents .Atheists are able to overcome this .Also , Atheists who criticize religion are very beneficial becuase that criticism allows us to take a second look at what we believe .It also seems that many of the smartest people are atheists , yet that could lead to the same thing as with parental rearing ... someone says they are atheist in order to seem smarter .Nevertheless , there are some aspects of atheism that i can not agree with and which i would like answers to .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "127.77837"}

{"text": "To me , my Papa was a hardworking man , a little rough around the edges , but he was always friendly and loving .We did n't get to see him a lot , I have a feeling my mom did n't want us to see him drunk .He would occasionally show up at holidays or family functions .I remember being excited several times because I thought he was coming to see us , and even as a child my heart broke when he could n't make it .I did n't understand why he was always \" sick \" and could n't spend time with us .A few times my Papa got so \" sick \" that his body just would n't hold up to the abuse .He would come over and stay with us for a while to sober up , and help his body get better .He was never there for very long , but I remember loving it when he would come to stay .On Christmas Eve one year when I was in elementary school , my Papa was expected as usual , but unsurprisingly he did n't call or show up .The Christmas Eve festivities went on as usual , and no one really thought anything of it .Later that night my mom tried to get ahold of him , to wish him a merry Christmas , but got no answer .I am not sure who found him or how , but my grandfather was found on Christmas morning , behind his trailer .He had passed away .My parents explained to us that our Papa was gone , and we did the best we could to grieve , and continue on with our lives .After that , I did n't put much thought into my grandfather 's passing , I knew he was gone and it was left at that .My mother sat me down one day , and told me that she needed to tell me the truth about Papa .I was very confused about what she was talking about .She told me that my Papa had gotten very drunk on Christmas Eve before he died , and he had taken himself out behind his trailer and committed suicide .My whole world spun a little , and I did n't know what to say .She made the situation much worse with her reasons for finally telling me the truth .Apparently she was afraid my older brother ( the one who ran away ) , was going to tell me the real reason my Papa was gone , to turn me against my parents , and decided to beat him to the punch .So in one happy afternoon , I not only learned that my grandpa shot himself , but I learned that my mom liked to one - up my brother ... classy .I can honestly say that I was very bitter at my parents for hiding something like this from me .I was even more upset that my mom somehow thought my jail - bird brother would be able to get the message to me , and that I would believe him .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "142.15468"}

{"text": "Perhaps the biggest accessibility issue with font is the size .Pesonanlly I 'm most comfortable reading text at 14px , but that may not be the case with everyone .Your best bet is to use a relative measurement like 'em ' when specifying the size of your font .Using a relative measurement will allow your visitors to more easily adjust the size to whatever works best for them .If you think 12px is a great size then use the equivalent em size .I can increase the font to see it at my preferred 14px ( 0.9em ) or similar if I choose .As we get older we typically have a harder time reading small text .Know your audience and if your audience is aging you probably want to use a larger default size .You may like that 12px font , but if your audience ca n't read anything below 16px ( 1.0em ) make sure your default size is 16px or above .But remember to use the relative measurement instead of px .Relative measurements can play havoc with your design , if you 're not careful .You will need to code your site to account for the possibility of your font size being displayed at sizes other than the default you set .Most of the time this is n't too difficult to deal with , but it may be important for your font to remain the same size for your layout .Your navigation might be a good example where using a fixed size might work better for your design .I will sometimes use absolute measurements for the font size of my navigation , but remember if you do to set it at a size that 's larger enough for people to read .If it 's too small , your visitors may never find your other pages .Contrast , I Need Contrast .Have you ever visited a site where the color of the text was so close to the color of the background behind it that you could n't read the words no matter what size of font family was being used ?I know I have .It 's an example of poor contrast .You want to use as much contrast as possible between the color of your text and the color of the background .Black text on a white background will be the easiest to read , followed by white text on a balck background .You can use other color combinations , but provide as much contrast as you can .Remember too that just because you can read the text not everyone else will .Not everyone can discern your light blue text on your medium blue background .Make it as easy as possible for your visitors .No matter how great it looks if no one can read your text they 're going to leave pretty fast and they probably wo n't be coming back .Even when the colors contrast well the choice still may not be idea .Red text will usually stand out well against a green background .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "142.70142"}
