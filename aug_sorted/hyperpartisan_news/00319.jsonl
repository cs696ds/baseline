'It has a perceived social value , rather than a true market value , ' says Harden .In other words : it is fashionable .The bottled water industry has put a lot of money and effort into cultivating an image that their product is pristine , pure and safe , ' she adds . 'They have sold the public on the idea that bottled water is healthier and safer than tap water . 'In fact , bottled water is no safer , and in all likelihood less safe , than tap water .While municipal water supplies in Western countries may be checked 300 times a month bottled water plants may be inspected only once every three years .The US Food and Drug Administration only checks bottled water sold in the same state in which it is bottled ( about 30 to 40 per cent of sales ) - and then only once a year .Potential carcinogens .Contamination and product recalls are not uncommon , including the potential carcinogens bromate in Dasani in 2004 and naphthalene in Volvic in 2005 .In the US , a 1999 survey by the Natural Resources Defense Council found that a third of bottled water brands violated state or industry standards in at least one sample , for such appetizing contaminants as faecal coliform bacteria , E coli and arsenic .The popularity of bottled water could have consequences far wider than just the fleecing of unwitting consumers .Bottled water undermines public trust in our tap water , ' says Wenonah Hauter .Safe drinking water is a public good and one that we should expect our governments to provide .If people are accustomed to forking out for expensive bottles there is little incentive for governments to invest in maintaining public water supplies .Food and Water Watch estimates that every year the US Government falls short by $ 20 billion on the amount needed to maintain municipal water supplies ( compare this to the $ 15 billion Americans spend every year on bottled water ) .Leaks , burst mains and boil advisories are becoming ever more common .Meanwhile , new buildings such as schools frequently lack drinking fountains . 'An entire generation of children is growing up thinking that tap water is \" yucky \" .They will not have the same commitment to safe drinking water that their parents may have had , ' says Hauter .All of which is setting a dangerous precedent .

{"text": "However , the NRDC argues that the FDA provides no specific requirements - such as proximity to industrial facilities , underground storage tanks or dumps - for bottled water sources .That 's looser monitoring than occurs at the EPA , which requires more specific assessments of tap water sources .Olson says one brand of \" spring water , \" which had a graphic of mountains and a lake on the label , was actually taken from a well in Massachusetts in the parking lot of an industrial facility .The well , which is no longer used for bottled water , was near hazardous waste and had experienced contamination by industrial chemicals .According to Olson , the FDA has no official procedure for rejecting bottled water sources once they become contaminated .He also says a 1990 government audit revealed that 25 percent of water bottlers had no record of source approval .Further , in contrast to the EPA , which employs hundreds of staffers to protect the nation 's tap water systems , the FDA does n't have even one full - time regulator in charge of bottled water .Unlike utilities , which must publish their lab results in a public record , bottlers do n't have to notify anyone of their findings , including consumers who inquire .The FDA has the authority to ask for a company 's data , although test results can be destroyed after two years .Olson adds , \" Unlike tap water violations , which are directly enforceable , if a company exceeds bottled water standards , it is not necessarily a violation - they can just say so on the label , and may be insulated from enforcement . \"Further , while EPA rules specify that no confirmed E. coli or fecal coliform ( bacteria that indicate possible contamination by fecal matter ) contamination is allowed in tap water , the FDA merely set a minimum level for E. coli and fecal coliform presence in bottled water .Tap water from a surface source must be tested for cryptosporidium , giardia and viruses , unlike bottled water , and must also be disinfected , unlike bottled water .Hoober also notes that food products such as \" carbonated water , \" \" soda water \" and \" seltzer water\"-in addition to most flavored waters - are held to even looser standards than \" true \" bottled water .The EPA concludes , \" Some bottled water is treated more than tap water , while some is treated less or not at all . \"Henry Kim , consumer safety officer for the FDA , asserts , \" We want bottled water to have a comparable quality to that of tap water\"-which , of course , runs counter to the widely held public belief that bottled water is better .The situation is similar in the European Union and in Canada , where there are more regulations on tap than bottled water .That New York restroom attendant would be surprised to learn that her city 's tap water was tested some 560,000 times in 2002 .Environmentalists also point out that if a brand of bottled water is wholly packaged and sold within the same state , it is technically not regulated by the FDA , and is therefore only legally subject to state standards , which tend to vary widely in scope and vigor .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.53595"}

{"text": "The scientists concluded that although all of the water they tested was safe to drink , \" use of bottled water on the assumption of purity can be misguided . \"Another area of potential concern is the fact that no agency calls for testing of bottled water after it leaves its initial packaging plant , leaving some to wonder what happens during months of storage and transport .To begin to examine this question , the Kansas Department of Health and Environment tested 80 samples of bottled water from retail stores and manufacturers .All 80 of the samples had detectable levels of chlorine , fluoride and sodium .Seventy - eight of the 80 contained some nitrate ( which can cause methemoglobinemia , or blue - baby syndrome , in higher doses ) , 12 had nitrite , 53 had chloroform , 33 contained bromodichloro - methane , 25 had arsenic and 15 tested positive for lead .Forty - six of the samples contained traces of some form of the carcinogen ( and hormone disrupter ) phthalate , while 12 of those exceeded federal safety levels for that chemical .According to Olson , phthalates may leach out of some plastic bottles into water .\" Phthalates are not legally regulated in bottled water because of intense industry pressure , \" says Olson .Although Co- op America concludes that there is little evidence of a link between phthalate exposure from bottled water and any health problems , the group suggests using glass over plastic bottles as a precaution .Similarly , if your office cooler is made of polycarbonate , it may be releasing small amounts of the potential hormone disrupter bisphenol A into the water .Idaho 's Pure Health Solutions , a water purification company , also conducted its own study that concluded certain bacteria grow significantly in bottled water over a 12-day period .Bacteria will normally grow in tap water within a few days if it is kept bottled up at room temperature .Most municipal water managers leave a residual amount of chlorine in tap water after treatment specifically to inhibit the growth of bacteria as the water runs through pipes and sits in tanks .The IBWA argues that the presence of benign bacteria in bottled water has no bearing on public health , since the treatment processes used by manufacturers ensure the death of any potentially harmful organisms .The group 's website claims that there have been no confirmed cases of illness in the U.S. as a result of bottled water .The IBWA does mention an instance in 1994 in the Northern Mariana Islands , in which bottled well water was linked to a disease outbreak .The NRDC argues that no U.S. government agency actively searches for incidents of illness from bottled water .On the Internet , one can find testimonials and news reports about people who claim to have gotten sick from tainted bottled water .One man writes that he and his fianc\u00e9e became ill after drinking bottled water in the Dominican Republic .The Allegheny County Health Department in Pennsylvania reports discovering high levels of coliform in bottled water samples that were taken \" after a man reported that he became sick from drinking the water . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.45932"}
