Rush Limbaugh even said that if women wanted to be left alone , they should don burkas .But all of this chatter about whether women take sexual bawdiness too seriously obscures a critical point about the nature of sexual harassment : It 's not about sex .It 's about power .The original Politico story about Cain 's past made clear that if the allegations were true , Cain was n't just some rich horny guy looking to get laid or a charismatic extrovert with a misunderstood sense of humor .He was someone who had seriously abused his authority , a much more serious problem for someone seeking the nation 's highest office .If he were simply randy , Cain could have found casual , extramarital sex anywhere , and not just from the prostitutes who , in the mid-1990s , were a regular feature on the DC streets just a few blocks from the National Restaurant Association .But if the allegations are true , what Cain was doing was something different .He was allegedly showering subordinates and an unemployed job - seeker with unwelcome sexual advances that they were n't in a very good position to decline .( It 's notable that none of the women who have complained about Cain seem to have outranked him . )Being harassed at work by a boss or other superior is not the same thing as being on the receiving end of catcalls by construction workers or getting groped in a bar , however unpleasant those things may be .Sexual harassment is illegal because it 's a form of discrimination , a way of preventing women from advancing in the workplace .If you do n't believe me , just look at what happened to the women Cain allegedly harassed .Sure , they may have gotten some small settlements , but they also had to leave their jobs .Cain , on the other hand , got to stick around , at least for a while , and he has thrived professionally ever since .If you 're a woman , getting sexually harassed at work can ruin your life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.38325"}

John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) beat Obama in half of th 12 polled districts , sometimes by a fairly wide margin .In Maryland 's 1st district , for example , where Rep. Frank Kratovil ( D ) trails Andy Harris by three percentage points , McCain routed Obama two years ago , winning by 19 points .Kratovil 's ability to hang in the race despite the political winds and makeup of his district is attributable to his strong support among independents .Kratovil is one of just two Democrats in the 12 districts who leads among independents - 38 percent to 35 over Harris .In New Mexico 's 2nd District , Rep. Harry Teague ( D ) holds a two - point edge among independents over Republican Steve Pearce .Teague , Kratovil and Rep.

{"text": "First Read points out a major problem in passing health care reform : .One of the bigger , but more under - reported , sea changes in American politics is how any kind of tax increase - whether in war or peace , good economic times or bad ones - has become absolutely unacceptable .After all , Ronald Reagan raised taxes .So did every modern American president involved in war , until George W. Bush .But not anymore .Indeed , as one of us pointed out on Nightly News last night , only 29 % ( or 157 ) of the 535 and House members and senators serving in Congress were around the last time - 1993 ! - the federal government raised taxes , and that was on gasoline .Think about that for a moment : Congress has n't really had a TOUGH vote in 16 years , if one defines a \" TOUGH \" vote as the government asking for a financial sacrifice from the American people .This is the political climate that President Obama faces in trying to pay for health reform .Republicans and some Democrats are opposed to a tax on the wealthy , and unions and Obama 's political strategists are against taxing health benefits .While I am generally not a fan of big government programs and opposed HillaryCare , the situation with health care coverage has deteriorated to the point where government action is necessary .This is also something which costs money despite the claims of the Obama administration that health care reform can largely pay for itself .It costs money to provide coverage to those who can not afford it , increase the delivery of preventive care , and improve health care information technology .We will not see the savings from improved preventive care and information technology for many years .As I 've noted before , reforming health care coverage is something which benefits everyone , not only the near one hundred million who are currently uninsured or under - insured .Having a society in which nearly everyone has health care coverage and nobody has to fear losing coverage due to developing a serious illness , losing a job , or desiring to change jobs is worthwhile but we must be willing to pay for it .Unfortunatley this probably is not politically feasible as there would be protest over a tax increase on the middle class , even if it would be largely offset over time by both lower insurance premiums and ultimately lower costs from a more efficient health care system .Earlier in the year polls did show that voters were willing to accept a tax increase to pay for health care reform .We are not seeing as many support this now .Some of this is for unavoidable reasons , such as belt tightening during a time of economic crisis and due to the scare tactics of the right wing .This is also due to a missed opportunity by Barack Obama to show true leadership .If Obama had proposed a health reform plan and honestly discussed both the costs and benefits , he might have received support for the taxes needed to pay for this .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.24758"}

{"text": "Advocates of Pentagon reform have criticized President Obama for his timid approach to reducing military spending .Despite current Pentagon budgets that have hovered at the highest levels since World War II and thirteen years of steady growth , the administration 's latest plans would only reduce spending at the Department of Defense by 1.6 percent in inflation - adjusted dollars over the next five years .Still , compared to his main Republican opponents , Obama is a T. rex of budget slashers .After all , despite their stated commitment to reducing the deficit ( while cutting taxes on the rich yet more ) , the Republican contenders are intent on raising Pentagon spending dramatically .Mitt Romney has staked out the \" high ground \" in the latest round of Republican math with a proposal to set Pentagon spending at 4 percent of the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .That would , in fact add up to an astonishing $ 8.3 trillion dollars over the next decade , one - third more than current , already bloated Pentagon plans .Nathan Hodge of the Wall Street Journal engaged in polite understatement when he described the Romney plan as \" the most optimistic forecast US defense manufacturers have heard in months .\" In fact , Romney 's proposal implies that the Pentagon is essentially an entitlement program that should receive a set share of our total economic resources regardless of what 's happening here at home or elsewhere on the planet .In Romney World , the Pentagon 's only role would be to engorge itself .If the GDP were to drop , it 's unlikely that , as president , he would reduce Pentagon spending accordingly .Rick Santorum has spent far less time describing his military spending plans , but a remark at a Republican presidential debate in Arizona suggests that he is at least on the same page with Romney .In 1958 , the year he was born , Santorum pointed out , Pentagon spending was 60 percent of the federal budget , and now it 's \" only \" 17 percent .In other words , why cut military spending when it 's so comparatively low ?Of course , in a field of innumerates , Santorum 's claim undoubtedly falls into the category of rhetorical flourish .It 's unlikely that even he was suggesting we more than triple Pentagon spending - the only way to return it to the share of the budget it consumed in the halcyon days of his youth .( Keep in mind that profligate Pentagon spending in that era ultimately prompted President Dwight D. Eisenhower to coin the term \" military - industrial complex . \" )Still , Santorum clearly believes that there 's plenty of room to hike military spending , if we just slash genuine entitlement programs deeply enough .He would undoubtedly support a Pentagon budget at Romney - esque levels , as would Newt Gingrich based on his absurd claim that the Obama administration 's modest adjustments to the Pentagon 's record budgets would result in a \" hollowing out \" of the US military .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.965195"}
