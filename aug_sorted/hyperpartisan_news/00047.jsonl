{"text": "Corey Taylor has had it .Had it with the vagaries of human behavior and life in this postmodern digital blanked - out waiting room that passes for a world .\" You 're Making Me Hate You \" is a blisteringly funny diatribe that skewers the worst aspects of human behavior with a knowing eye for every excruciating detail , told in the vivid way that only Corey Taylor can .Like his previous bestselling forays , \" You 're Making Me Hate You \" is an unflinching glimpse into the mind of Corey Taylor , who spares no one from his seething gaze .Make no mistake : this is not the Corey Taylor you run into at meet - and - greets or in line at the coffee shop .This is not the kind and cuddly guy who kisses babies and takes pictures with your mom while leaving a voicemail for that distant cousin in college .This is not the loveable scamp who can poke just as much fun at himself as he does at the various rubes around him , though to be fair he does save one chapter for a brutal and lacerating self - analysis .This is Corey Motherfucking Taylor .This is the Great Big Mouth .This is that bastard you wonder about when you listen to Slipknot and Stone Sour .ABOUT RANDY BLYTHE .Randy Blythe was born in Alabama and studied at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the University of Alabama .He edited Aura from 1986 to 1988 , co - founded Birmingham Poetry Review and co - edited that publication from 1988 to 1998 , and assistant - edited Birmingham Poetry Review from 1998 to 2008 .He lives in Birmingham and continues to teach composition , literature , and creative writing .He has published poems in numerous little magazines , among them The Laurel Review , Tar River Poetry , South Carolina Review , Chicago Quarterly Review , and Black Warrior Review .This is his first full - length collection .ABOUT DARK DAYS .On June 27 , 2012 , the long - running , hard - touring , and world - renowned metal band lamb of god landed in Prague for their first concert there in two years .Vocalist D. Randall \" Randy \" Blythe was looking forward to a few hours off a rare break from the touring grind in which to explore the elegant , old city .Two years prior , a 19-year - old fan died of injuries suffered at a lamb of god show in Prague , allegedly after being pushed off stage by Blythe , who had no vivid recollection of the incident .At the time of his arrest Blythe had been sober for nearly two years , having finally gained the upper hand over the alcoholism that nearly killed him .But here he faced a new kind of challenge : jailed in a foreign land and facing a prison sentence of up to ten years .Worst of all , a young man was dead , and Blythe was devastated for him and his family , even as the reality of his own situation began to close in behind Pankraacutec Prison 's glowering walls of crumbling concrete and razor wire .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.044495"}

'Snuff ' had a presence similar to ' Vermillion Pt.2 ' in Vol3 .Personally , ' Snuff ' did n't sound as emotional / dark as Vermillion Pt.2 and compared to the whole ' impression ' of the album , Snuff did n't really fit in to the picture .It is wierd .It is experimental in melodic sense .But it just simply ' doesnt't fit ' .On the ' experimental ' side , ( well , all the songs do tend to exploit both sides ) we have ' Butchers Hook ' .I sensed a bit of metalcore influence in this song .Dark , swinging riffs accompanied by Corey 's newly - enforced darker screams and of course , Joey Jordison full - on spine - breaking drumming .One of the best aspect of this new album was that many songs now featured solos ; it seems like a compensation for Mick and Jim being accused of lacking ' talent ' .Well , there you go doubters , you have extreme mind - boggling , yet , melodically fit ( which is to say , ear - pleasing ) solos that will rip your doubts to ribbons .In overview , the sound Slipknot have created on this new album is simply amazing .They have finally proven their capabillity to the full in my opinion .They now show us their talents more than ever , yet keeping the songs ear - pleasing and just purely enjoyable to listen to .Guitars , drums , vocals , turntables and keyboards were , in my opinion , to the full extent to virtualise the possibility of Slipnot 's limit to their limitless sound .Lyrics : Lyrics are usual stuffs .Indeed , they are dark .But Slipknot is nt really a band that require complex and metaphoric lyrics .All they needed was effect and the pure message conveyed in them .Although they need effects - only lyrics ( such as ' if you 're 555 then I 'm 666 or SICCCCC SICCC SICCCC ) , they still bring forth the absurdity and often what we 'd call ' insanity ' into the lyrics .Most notable would be lyrics in ' Psychosocial ' .You can read it and just realise how insane the lyrics actually feel .Reciting such lyrics casually as if you are saying it would cause a stir , would n't it ?Besides that , as I said , Slipknot blends in lyrics into a right rythm , maximising the effect of them , without them needing to be overly metaphoric .Corey Taylor has develped a darker way of screaming and his representation of his change in vocal style is consistent throughout the album .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.97211"}

{"text": "After that the two best songs of the album are coming ' Psychosocial ' and ' Dead Memories ' . 'Psychosocial ' was the first single of the album and just the ' the limit of the dead ' break stops the whole power in this song a bit . 'Dead Memories ' is a big opposite to the first songs , the guitar riff reminds me a bit on ' wait and bleed'and it 's more like a metal ballad .Song 6 and 7 are typical power songs of Slipknot and two of the ' not so special ' songs , but they are still good . 'Gehenna ' is one of the psychedelic metal songs with a low speed and a cool guitar solo .Song 9 and 10 are simply hard fast metal songs with very clever guitar riffs and a very good corey on the vocals .As the musical way of Slipknot forecasted us there is finnaly a accoustic ballad with touching lyrics and a sad sound . 'Snuff ' is a very good song that is now often played in memory of Paul Gray(R.I.P ) .The last song of the album is the title song . 'All hope is gone ' is again one of the fast songs with a great double base of Joey and the hard fast gutar riff plus the sampling and a heavy chorus .There are 3 bonus songs on the special edition ' Child of burning time ' , ' Vermillion pt.2(Bloodstone Remix ) ' and ' Till'we die ' .All good songs which fitted into the attitude of All hope is gone .\" All Hope Is Gone \" has got very much good sites and just a few bad ones .The Sound quality is very good and is pretty awesome with 5.1 sound system .Lyrics : Like on the previous Cd 's Slipknot or mainly Corey Taylor are doing a great lyrics and singer job .As alyays most of the lyrics got an hidden sense and this time Corey sings with his growling and his melodic voice .Just some bad things are destroying the very good work .Example : All hope is gone ( the Song )In the chorus corey losts his voice a few time and you can hear his breathing too loud .Not a big thing but I 'm sure that he could have done it better during the first albums .Also in the song is the very short part when they are screaming ALL HOPE IS GONE .That really blew me away becouse of it 's power .What I liked , too .Are the lyrics of ' Snuff ' : So save your breath I will not hear I think I made it very clear You could n't hate enough to love Is that supposed to be enough ?He just gort a few lows , and he is still one of my favourite singers .Overall Impression : Finally an awesome album of an awesome band .Some people are saying that it is the worst album of Slipknot , and maybe it is , but it is still very good and powerfull .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.648674"}

'This Cold Black ' the ninth track is one of the best songs they 've done in a while .It has a very angry feel and gets right to the point . 'Wherein Lies Continue ' and ' Snuff ' are both good and then the album ends with another high note with ' All Hope Is Gone ' .Lyrics : Lyricly a few songs stand out .Another standout lyrically for me was ' Snuff ' while it 's mostly sung it doesnt't remind the listener of StoneSour , it retains it 's Slipknot sound . 'You would think that the lyrical content of this song would be weird for a band like this but they have proven again they can make it work .Corey 's vocal talent is present throughout showing his range from singing to outright growls and screams but the vocal low point is ' Gehenna ' .It would n't have been so bad except when tries to hit the high note at the middle of the chorus .\" Free my severed heart .Give me you \" when he sings \" you \" he changes pitch and it is not something he should do .Overall Impression : Like I 've said 8 of the 12 tracks are really good and 4 are not to my liking at all .most of the time I do n't like it when an artist releases a short CD but I would have been happier if they only put those 8 on the disk .I really enjoy it overall but if you could nt tell I really do n't like StoneSour .If you really like both bands you will be pleased with this album .However if your on the fence and only like Slipknot 's heavier stuff Download ' Gemetria ( The Killing Name ) ' , ' Psychosocial ' , ' This Cold Black ' , and ' All Hope Is Gone ' .These are the standout tracks and definetly worth your time .All Hope Is Gone Reviewed by : SabbathFlames88 , on august 27 , 2008 1 of 3 people found this review helpful .Sound : Many are going to say this album is just another Vol . 3 , but those people probably only listened to a few songs and labeled SlipKnot as sellouts .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.484"}
