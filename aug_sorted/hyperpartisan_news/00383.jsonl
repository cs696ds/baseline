{"text": "This is why the importance of the Trump candidacy extends far beyond the question of who becomes the next president of the United States of America .Donald Trump has been saying things that for a very long time we have all been told that nobody could say publicly without sinking his political career .So far , however , his political career has remained afloat .Moreover , he has come under heavy attack by the major media networks , by the Democrat party and by the leadership of his own Republican party , but none of these have succeeded in derailing him .His popularity continues to soar , not in spite of the things he has been saying , but because of them .I am not suggesting that because what Donald Trump has been saying is popular it is therefore also right .Truth and justice are not matters that are decided by majority vote and , indeed , it is quite apparent that under ordinary circumstances , the majority is more likely to be wrong than right .Trump has been speaking on issues such as immigration which have a strong impact on the everyday lives of ordinary people and about which they can therefore be expected to be well informed .Furthermore , most of what he has been saying about these issues is self - evidently true .For a long time now the United States has had a problem with mass illegal immigration across its southern border .Donald Trump has been accused of demagoguery for his populist rhetoric on this matter , but that mass migration poses an existential threat to the United States , even such a critic of populism as historian John Lukacs would agree with .Almost twenty years ago he wrote : .Two hundred years later the United States faces the danger of an enormous and uncontrolled flood of people coming largely from the south .Lukacs concluded the essay from which I just quoted by suggesting that migration - not just illegal immigration - from the Third World posed a greater long term threat to the United States than the USSR and nuclear weapons .The progressive leadership of the Democrats and the neoconservative leadership of the Republicans , to the extent that they acknowledge a problem here at all , insist that it is only illegal immigration that is a problem and that the solution to this problem is amnesty .One does not have to have a Ph.D. to realize that to offer amnesty to illegal aliens within your country 's borders , without first sealing those borders , is to increase the problem by inviting further illegal immigration in the future .It is also quite obvious that a country that gives up control of its borders will not remain a country for very long .Donald Trump 's proposed solution to the problem of illegal immigration - deporting the illegal aliens already in the United States and building a wall on the border over which they are sneaking - unlike amnesty , would actually deal with the problem rather than make it worse .The same can be said for Trump 's proposed response to the early December mass shooting in San Bernardino , California .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.635254"}

Circuit nominees they filibustered .After the vote , Obama told reporters at the White House that Republicans had turned nomination fights into a \" reckless and relentless tool \" to grind the gears of government to a halt and noted that \" neither party has been blameless for these tactics . \"However , he said , \" today 's pattern of obstruction . . .just is n't normal ; it 's not what our founders envisioned . \"Republicans countered that they had confirmed 99 percent of Obama 's judicial selections .McConnell accused Democrats of eyeing the D.C.

Huntsman supported continued human rights discussions with the Chinese , criticizing our current approach as too \" on - again - off - again . \"Instead he advocated for a regularized and systematic forum where issues such as freedom of religion , freedom of speech , rule of law , and access to information can continuously be discussed .While some might argue that this was mere political posturing to secure votes from Congress , Gov. Huntsman 's statement is a noted departure from Secretary Clinton 's recent announcement that human rights can not interfere with our handling of other crises .Such a departure provides credibility that Gov. Huntsman sincerely wants to make human rights issues a regular part of his dialogue with the Chinese .Also , his experience in Taiwan and Singapore provide him with the alternative perspective that economic development in a culturally - Chinese society does not necessarily require the authoritarian regime that currently exists on the mainland .Although Gov. Huntsman 's approach to human rights is slightly different from the Administration 's , he whole - heartedly supports the Administration 's focus on climate change in U.S.-China relations , deviating from many of his Republican colleagues .In discussing caps on greenhouse gases , Gov. Huntsman maintained that the U.S. should support an agreement on climate change with China , viewing any agreement as an economic , exporting opportunity .The U.S. will become a leader in clean air and energy efficiency industries , industries that he argued would likely dominate the global economy for the next 20 to 40 years .Unfortunately , Gov. Huntsman did not address the intellectual property concerns of exporting U.S. clean energy technology to China , a thorny issue that will certainly prove tricky in any discussions on climate change .The nomination of Gov. Huntsman is a telling signal that the Obama Administration perhaps grasps the realities of the new China .The China today is not the China that existed 30 years ago when the U.S. first normalized relations .In only the past few years , China has quickly emerged as a global leader with a strong economy , large militarily and significant influence on other countries .Today , the U.S. negotiates with a power that in many ways is its equal ; one that can easily walk away from the negotiating table .Gov. Huntsman , with his knowledge of Chinese culture , language skills , and his courage to buck his own party and accept the nomination , could likely be the best person for the job .Like this : .It 's 2015 .The immediate danger of climate change is apparent ; rising sea levels in some countries , drought in others ; countries on the brink of war due to shortage of food ; governments that have existed for more than five centuries are toppling .In this scenario , how would leaders in the United States , India and China respond ?This is no longer a theoretical question .Similar to war game simulations that countries ' militaries periodically organize , CNAS set up a dire climate change simulation to see how these countries would respond .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.983536"}

{"text": "This is the same criticism lodged against the tariff provisions in the U.S. House of Representatives ' Climate Change Bill .There is a real risk that these economists are right ; China will begin to feel bullied and , for its domestic audience 's consumption , walk away from an international climate change agreement .Although the Chinese government enjoys one - party rule in an authoritarian state , it is still susceptible to domestic public opinion , especially given the fact that nationalism runs very high .But at least our European allies realize that any international agreement is a give and take ; there are carrots and sticks .A key issue for China in its lead up to Copenhagen has been financial and technological assistance from developed countries in implementing carbon emission caps or clean technology .China has repeatedly stated that they will not be able to meet the requirements of an international treaty unless there is assistance from developed countries .The E.U. 's pledge is the carrot in this situation .It is agreeing to a term that China has said is necessary for it to consent to any international climate change treaty .So even in light of Sarkozy 's call for carbon tariffs , the Chinese government can turn to its people and show that it was not bullied .Instead , China received the one element that it considered indispensible .The U.S. unfortunately has only been providing sticks .There is evidence that the tariff provisions provide some leverage against a country like China , but without providing some sort of bargaining chip , China will likely not respond positively to the U.S. ' hard - line tariff provisions .Instead , the U.S. should learn for the E.U. and look to see where it can find common ground with China .Without this common ground , it starts to look a lot like bullying .An Expert Weighs In .On Monday , we ran a piece on the international trade implications of the border adjustment measures of the House 's climate change bill .The article ends with a section questioning the legality of the tariff provision under WTO rules .China Law & Policy was fortunate to have Henry Gao , Associate Professor of Law at the Singapore Management .University and expert on WTO law comment on our analysis .In his comments below , he questions whether the provisions would in fact violate WTO rules .If I understand it correctly , this means that the carbon tariff provision is in violation of the national treatment obligation under the WTO .However , this seems to be rather unlikely .The national treatment obligation only applies with regard to domestic taxes and other regulations .The carbon tariff , by definition , is not a domestic tax .Instead , it is a tariff that will be applied before the goods enter the border .Also , legally speaking , while the US will surely have to fight hard to defend its case if the issue is really referred to the WTO , it 's less than certain that the US will win .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.611404"}

{"text": "President Hu Jintao speaking to the U.N General Assembly on Tuesday , Sept 22 , 2009 .promise to tackle climate change and surprisingly mentioned China 's \" mandatory national targets for reducing energy intensity and discharge of major pollutants ... \" .India also seems to be moving in the direction of targets .In an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday , India 's environment minister , Jairam Ramesh discussed the possibility that India could adopt legislation increasing its energy efficiency and thus having \" implicit targets .\" While it is true that this is a step forward for the Chinese - never before have they used the word \" target \" in reference to climate change on the world stage - in no way is this a \" carbon emissions target .\" In fact , China has been using \" energy efficiency targets \" domestically since 2005 .As John Romankiewicz explained on the Green Leap Forward , in China 's 11 th Five Year Plan passed in 2005 , the Chinese government established a 20 % reduction target in energy intensity from 2006 to 2010 .While this is a laudable goal , it still allows China to increase its carbon emissions since there is no cap - the calculation is relative to the percentage growth of GDP .China 's goal is to cut energy intensity as a percentage of its GDP .If GDP rises , a rise in energy use , as long as it is lower than the previous year , can still show a reduction in energy efficiency .Additionally , a focus on energy intensity only marginally impacts carbon emissions , a fact not lost on President Hu in his speech on Tuesday .China has certainly taken a step forward on approaching some form of targets .Furthermore , by even mentioning targets , China implicitly commits to making those targets measurable and verifiable as Julian L. Wong from the Center for American Progress noted , something that China in the past was not willing to do .So there has been progress which China should be rightly commended for .But at this stage , to limit global warming to the U.N. target of 2\u00ba Celsius , the world community needs to push China to agree to carbon emissions targets .Obama Adverse to China Being Defined as a Developing Nation ?Central to the requirement of carbon targets is the definition of \" developing nation \" and this was perhaps the greatest divide between the U.S. and China , and could possibly stall progress in Copenhagen .For purposes of climate change negotiations , China has repeatedly portrayed itself as a developing country .In his speech on Tuesday , President Hu dedicated around two - thirds of it to discussing the special circumstances of developing countries , implying that China is one such nation .Under the previous international climate change treaty , the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 , China was defined as a developing nation .China is keen to keep this definition in Copenhagen for two reasons : ( 1 ) emission targets are not applicable to developing nations , and ( 2 ) developing nations can avail themselves of financial and technical aid provided by developed nations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.48207"}

{"text": "In October 2009 , Congress enacted the FY2010 Agriculture appropriations bill ( P.L. 111 - 80 ) , which contains language that seeks to address this issue .Instead of continuing this prohibition , the FY2010 Agriculture appropriations bill allows USDA to use appropriated funds to implement the FSIS rule permitting U.S. imports of certain processed poultry and poultry products from China , if specified preconditions are met .The appropriations language is intended not only to ensure the safety of Chinese poultry imports but also to address trade concerns .The Chinese government has strongly criticized the ban on implementation of the rule as a violation of trade rules and , on April 17 , 2009 , formally requested World Trade Organization ( WTO ) consultations on the issue .The consultation period , which has expired , is considered the first step toward referral to a dispute settlement panel .Many food safety advocates have supported the ban on the poultry rule , arguing that China - the third leading foreign supplier of food and agricultural imports into the United States - lacks effective food safety protections .They have noted that China has experienced outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza , and have argued that USDA 's determination that Chinese - processed poultry was appropriately regulated was flawed .A coalition of U.S. animal product exporters has opposed the appropriations language banning the China poultry rule .This group has argued that continuation of the ban has fueled trade retaliation by China , where a rising quantity of U.S. poultry products are now being marketed and where U.S. beef exporters are seeking re - entry for their products .U.S. meat and poultry exporters believe that such trade disputes threaten an estimated $ 1.5 billion in livestock and poultry exports to China annually , including $ 774 million in poultry product sales .China has reported that over 70 % of its poultry imports are from the United States .U.S.-Thailand relations are of interest to Congress because of Thailand 's status as a long - time military ally and a significant trade and economic partner .However , ties have been complicated by deep political and economic instability in the wake of the September 2006 coup that displaced Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra .After December 2007 parliamentary elections returned many of Thaksin 's supporters to power , the U.S. government lifted the restrictions on aid imposed after the coup and worked to restore bilateral ties .Meanwhile , street demonstrations rocked Bangkok and two prime ministers were forced to step down because of court decisions .A new coalition headed by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva that assumed power in December 2008 has proven surprisingly durable , but anti - government forces remain active and organized .Many questions remain on how relations will fare as Bangkok seeks political stability .With Thai nationalism apparently on the rise , some analysts see a risk of drift in the U.S.-Thai relationship , although no major shift in overall cooperation .Despite differences on Burma policy and human rights issues , shared economic and security interests have long provided the basis for U.S.-Thai cooperation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.47553"}
{"text": "Because Colombia is a large market that imposes a high level of border protection on agricultural imports , the Colombia FTA has the potential to significantly increase U.S. agricultural exports .Though Panama represents a relatively small market , U.S. exporters would have numerous opportunities for additional sales .Conversely , each pending FTA partner would have additional access to the U.S. market for those agricultural commodities that are now protected by restrictive U.S. import quotas .Of these , the U.S. sugar sector would face some competition from increased imports of sugar from Colombia and Panama .The small increase in additional imports from South Korea would likely be in the form of primarily ethnic foods .Also , because these three countries consume most of the beef and dairy products that they produce , any additional export sales to the United States would likely be accommodated by the large U.S. market with little effect .The Obama Administration has signaled its intent to address outstanding issues of concern to some Members of Congress before submitting these FTAs to Congress for consideration .Officials during 2009 stated their intent to work with Members of Congress to develop \" benchmarks \" to use to determine when these agreements might be sent to Capitol Hill for debate , but little apparent movement occurred .With the White House pursuing health care and financial sector reforms ( among other issues ) as its legislative priorities , indications are that these FTAs might not be submitted to Congress until after the 2010 fall elections or sometime during 2011 .Determining the country of origin of a product is important for properly assessing tariffs , enforcing trade remedies ( such as antidumping and countervailing duties ) or quantitative restrictions ( tariff quotas ) , and statistical purposes .Other commercial trade policies are also linked with origin determinations , such as country of origin labeling and government procurement regulations .Rules of origin ( ROO ) can be very simple , noncontroversial tools of international trade as long as all of the parts of a product are manufactured and assembled primarily in one country .However , when a finished product 's component parts originate in many countries - as is often the case in today 's global trading environment - determining origin can be a very complex , sometimes subjective , and time - consuming process .U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) is the agency responsible for determining country of origin using various ROO schemes .Non - preferential rules of origin are used to determine the origin of goods imported from countries with which the United States has most - favored - nation ( MFN ) status .Preferential rules are used to determine the eligibility of imported goods from certain U.S. free trade agreement ( FTA ) partners and certain developing country beneficiaries to receive duty - free or reduced tariff benefits under bilateral or regional FTAs and trade preference programs .Preferential rules of origin are generally specific to each FTA , or preference , meaning that they vary from agreement to agreement and preference to preference .CBP has periodically proposed implementing a more uniform system of ROO as an alternative to the \" substantial transformation \" rule that currently in place .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.082825"}

{"text": "Arguably , if the goal is to prevent carbon leakage , the U.S. has a better chance of influencing a Chinese company 's behavior than an entire sector in China .Thus , the trade provisions should establish a secondary track where certain companies , if they are able to show that they are compliant with U.S. standards , are exempted from the border provisions applied to their country and sector .Finally , the question remains - how do you measure the carbon footprint of an imported product ?These provisions rely heavily upon the assumptions that monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from the country of origin is ( a ) an easy task and ( b ) accurate .While these assumptions might hold true in countries like Canada or Japan , for China , where implementation and enforcement on the local level is a perpetual struggle , any form of data collection is a challenge and results are often less than reliable .Thus , in a world where carbon measurement is problematic , the actual ability to implement the trade provisions remains questionable .Competitiveness As mentioned above , imports from China in the energy - intensive , trade - sensitive industries are very small ( 14 % of cement , 7 % of steel , 3 % of aluminum , 4 % of paper , and less than 1 % of chemicals ) .These five industries also make up a small portion of the U.S. economy , accounting for 3 % of economic output and less than 2 % of U.S. employment .While these industries will inevitability be negatively affected by the Climate Change Bill , the impact on the greater U.S. economy is relatively small .Additionally , over - protection of these industries loses sight of the broader U.S. economy and the other goal of the Climate Change Bill : to shift production and jobs to energy - efficient or renewable energy industries .Furthermore , while the border adjustment measures protect these raw material industries , it potentially could hurt those industries that use the raw materials for production of \" downstream \" products .For example , the border adjustment measures are only applicable to the importation of sheet steel , and not to products that are made out of steel , like cars or appliances ( WRI report , p. 52 ) .U.S. car makers will still have to compete against foreign car manufacturers whose products could contain steel from countries without carbon regulations .Without the benefit of border adjustment measures on cars , U.S. car makers would become less competitive .Similarly , U.S. chemical manufacturing companies are fairly competitive globally .These companies refine the carbon - intensive , raw material chemicals to make downstream , specialty concoctions ( WRI report , p. 52 ) .However , by imposing a border adjustment measure on the raw material chemicals , any of these chemical manufacturing companies who import raw materials , would experience an increase in the cost of production , making their products less competitive abroad .While the border adjustment measures will protect the five energy - intensive , trade - sensitive industries ' profits , they could likely hinder the competitiveness of industries that use these raw materials to manufacture downstream products .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.3472"}

{"text": "Well , all right then , what good did he do ?He is credited , in the popular imagination and in many a classroom , with having almost single - handedly slain the dragon of de jure racial segregation in the southern United States .Temporarily setting aside the question of the inherent goodness of integration and badness of segregation , let us look first at the matter of whether MLK Jr. actually deserves this credit .De jure segregation in the southern United States began when the former Confederate States regained control of their domestic affairs after the post-1865 military occupation known as Reconstruction .SCUSA , in its ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson , upheld the constitutionality and legality of \" separate but equal \" in a 7 to 1 vote .This decision stood until the matter was revisited in 1954 in the case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka , Kansas , in which SCUSA reversed its earlier ruling and declared segregation to be unconstitutional and illegal .In the story of the fall of Jim Crow , however , it is Brown v. Board which fills the role of the Ark of the Covenant and MLK Jr. that of Indiana Jones .In Brown v. Board , SCUSA had already declared de jure segregation unconstitutional the year prior to that in which MLK Jr. was launched into celebrity and notoriety for the first time during the Montgomery Bus Boycott .Segregation had already been dealt its death blow before MLK Jr. 's career in the media spotlight had even begun .Laws which require the separation of the races were widely perceived to be unjust for a number of reasons .From a classical liberal or libertarian point of view they would be considered an unjust infringement upon the freedom of association .This , however , is also true of the imposed integration of the US Civil Rights Act for this bill forbade private acts of discrimination and true freedom of association includes the freedom not to associate .It further , seems quite self - evident that forcing ethnic groups with a mutual distrust of each other into each other 's company is hardly conducive to promoting the kind of harmony between groups within a society that is necessary for a peaceful civil order .That imposed integration did not prove to be satisfactory to those it was supposed to help is evident in the way blacks and other racial minorities , or at least progressives purporting to speak on their behalf , have been calling for the return of segregation in recent years .They do not call it segregation , of course , they prefer politically correct euphemisms like \" safe spaces \" , but the concept is essentially that of racial segregation , albeit designed to benefit racial minorities rather than whites .Perhaps our American neighbours ought to reconsider keeping the third Monday in January in remembrance of this man every year .On a later visit to Germany , what he brought back with him , was a negative impression of the city of Cologne .In July of 1828 he wrote the following lines which were published a few years later : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.83676"}

{"text": "Theocracies fare badly economically in the modern world .Islamic theocracies are also fundamentally hostile to any true concept of democracy .The reason for this is that Islam as a religion is still trapped in the 14th century .Sharia law is viewed as supreme over any secular thinking .And the idea that an illiterate 7th century Prophet can determine institutions required for a modern global world economy is simply ludicrous .It is equivalent to believing that the pre - Reformation Spanish Inquisition could provide good economic governance for the West .The die , it would appear , has now been cast .Egypt will remain a seriously economically undeveloped , repressive nation for many years to come .The military has chosen England 's 1660 Restoration over its 1689 Bill of Rights .Some 30 years of the equivalent of the Stuart doom will surely follow .A revolution against Stuart tyranny erupted in England in 1642 .Following a violent civil war , King Charles 1 was executed by Parliament in 1649 on the instructions of Oliver Cromwell .Cromwell 's Model Army then instituted a newly - empowered parliament .That parliament quickly fell under the dictatorship of Lord Protector Cromwell .When Cromwell died in 1658 , and his son Richard ( Tumbledown Dick ) assumed the position of Lord Protector , the English army , split and its leading generals rebelled against parliament .In 1660 , a repentant parliament , acting under military orders , restored Charles II to the throne .Charles II , followed by his brother James , ruled England as Divine Right autocrats until James was deposed in a bloodless revolution in 1688 .An outside army from Holland then re - established order and introduced a new constitutional order .Thus far a parallel with Egypt is clear , though the Egyptian time line is dramatically shorter .President Mubarak played the role of Charles I of England , and was deposed by popular revolution , aided by the Egyptian army .The army played a transitional role in arranging for a president and a parliament to be elected .As with England in 1649 , the Egyptian electorate proved to be insufficiently mature to support a pluralistic democracy .As with Tumbledown Dick in 1660 England , the Egyptian army once again intervened to depose the utterly incompetent , religious bigot , President Morsi .In tomorrow 's column , I shall briefly outline the error made by England in the 1660 restoration , an error that resulted in 28 further years of autocracy before England eventually resolved its political quandary .I shall then outline hoe the Egyptian army might usefully proceed to shorten the time - horizon for evolution to effective governance .The coup occurred two years after President Obama bribed the Egyptian military to stand down and allow U.S. ally President Hosni Mubarak to be removed by a popular revolution .I wonder how President Obama and his three witches - Hillary Clinton , Susan Rice and Samantha Powers - Sunstein - are reacting to this welcome news .After all they were so besotted by the Muslim Brotherhood and its extremist version of Sharia Law that they allowed a loyal ally of Israel to be displaced in favor of an an overtly anti - Semitic government in the most important country in the Middle East .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "126.11203"}

{"text": "Ye Nymphs that reign o'er sewers and sinks , The river Rhine , it is well known , Doth wash your city of Cologne ; But tell me , Nymphs , what power divine Shall henceforth wash the river Rhine ?One of the things that stands out about this poem today is the irony of this malodorous accusation being leveled against the city whose name has become synonymous with that of perfumes bottled for and marketed to men .The irony may be intentional - the original Eau de Cologne had been around for almost a century by the time the future Lake Poet visited Germany - although it was the city 's extremely poor sewage drainage system that the poet was directly talking about .This may go a long way towards explaining why Johann Maria Farina felt the need to create the famous scent in the first place .Farina , as you may have surmised from his name , was not German born .An immigrant from Italy , he created the perfume which bolstered the reputation of his adopted city in the very year in which he made Cologne his home .That was 1709 .It is in the city 's central square , located between the railway station and the aforementioned Cathedral , that the inhabitants of Cologne customarily gather together to ring in the New Year .Among those assembled this time around , were large numbers of young , drunken , hooligans , described by their victims as being recent immigrants who were \" Arab or North African \" in appearance and origin .These threw firecrackers into the crowd to create confusion and then , in the midst of that confusion , isolated young women , surrounded them in large numbers , and groped , robbed , and , in some cases , raped them .The number of victims who have come forward with complaints is now in the hundreds .Similar happenings , it should be noted , took place in other German cities such as D\u00fcsseldorf , Frankfurt , Stuttgart and Hamburg and in other northern European countries such as Austria and Finland .If the stench of these crimes was not bad enough in itself , to it must be added that of the response on the part of the German civil authorities and the establishment media .I do not mean merely the failure of the Cologne police on the night in question to contain the incidents , capture the perpetrators , protect the public and restore order .These attacks were well organized and the police were overwhelmed .A civil war has been underway in Syria since the so - called \" Arab Spring \" of 2011 , in which rebel forces , with heavy foreign support , have sought to overthrow the government of Bashar al - Assad .Since the war began a large number of Syrians have fled , whether from ISIS , Assad , or just the destruction of the war itself , to such neighboring countries as Jordan , Lebanon , and Turkey .A little over a year ago another phenomenon began to attract attention as thousands of people had begun pouring into Europe through Turkey claiming to be refugees from the Syrian conflict .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "143.16098"}
