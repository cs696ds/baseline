Steinberg , the deputy secretary of state , visited Beijing with a delegation of American officials , seeking ideas from China about sanctions , including financial pressure , that might force North Korea to change direction .Mrs. Clinton seemed to reflect this concern in the interview on Sunday .While Mrs. Clinton also said the State Department was examining whether North Korea should be placed back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism , she acknowledged that there was a legal process for it .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "39.258175"}

{"text": "Unfortunately , early signs are that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is falling prey to such logic and downplaying the significance of Pyongyang 's nuclear program .It may well be that the Obama administration wants to emphasize domestic economic issues and limit foreign affairs priorities to the Arab - Israeli conflict .But neglecting North Korea is a dangerous gamble with very high stakes .Most troubling is Mrs. Clinton 's unwillingness to acknowledge North Korea 's uranium - enrichment efforts .In her confirmation hearing , she said these efforts were \" never quite verified . \" Although we know precious little about the North 's progress , including how much weapons - grade uranium may have been produced , Mrs. Clinton cast doubt on whether uranium enrichment was a serious subject at all .Pressed on this point on Jan. 23 at State 's daily briefing , the department spokesman said \" we do n't know \" whether such a program exists .Of course , the easiest way to solve a difficult problem is to conclude there really is n't one .( This was John Kennedy 's technique for eliminating the U.S. \" missile gap \" with the Soviet Union , which he had deployed so effectively against Richard Nixon . )For years , State 's permanent bureaucracy has been trying to wish away North Korea 's uranium - enrichment program .If President Barack Obama 's State Department takes this strategy , Pyongyang will once again have occasion to contemplate the profound wisdom of the ancient North Korean riddle : Why negotiate with the Americans when we do so well by letting them negotiate with themselves ?Equally tempting -- and equally dangerous -- is the notion that North Korea is not a truly pressing problem .After all , the argument goes , the North already has nuclear weapons , so unlike Iran there is no line to prevent it from crossing .Accordingly , there is no urgency to reconvene the six - party talks with the Koreas , Russia , China and Japan to end the North 's nuclear program , and certainly not to take any concrete measures to apply meaningful pressure to Kim Jong Il 's regime .The special envoy for Afghanistan - Pakistan is gearing up rapidly .And there 's now even a special envoy for climate change .But so far , there is no special envoy for North Korea .Mrs. Clinton 's first press conference last Tuesday provided another opportunity to announce the position and name the envoy , but she passed , even though she was asked specifically about the six - party talks .There are persuasive arguments against reviving the unhappy Clinton administration practice of unleashing numerous Big Beast envoys in the State Department .But make no mistake : In such an ecosystem , if your issue does not have a Big Beast , then it is not a Big Issue .The belief that North Korea is not an imminent danger is closely related to the fallacy that it is \" merely \" a threat to peace and security in Northeast Asia , a longstanding State Department fixation .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.095284"}

{"text": "South Korea , moreover , has rejected the \" absorption \" scenario , not only because of the high danger of war , but also because it seeks to facilitate a more humane and stable basis for inter - Korean reconciliation .Washington 's own behavior in recent years also undercuts the arguments that sanctions are the appropriate response after repeated failures to achieve a negotiated settlement to the current crisis .For the last six years at least , Washington has refused to pursue the most obvious and likely productive option - sustained direct negotiations with Pyongyang .Furthermore , Washington 's insistence on maintaining the \" first - strike \" option and developing new nuclear weapons , in particular , has not only undercut its moral standing but also given Pyongyang an additional rationale for its own nuclear program .And , perhaps most critically , because of the increased risk of war in and around the Korean peninsula , the sanctions are not only a blunt instrument but possibly a very dangerous one as well .However deplorable North Korea 's human rights record , a war on the Korean peninsula , which would result in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Koreans in the first months of conflict , would be a disaster of far greater magnitude .A final consideration is the efficacy of the sanctions .Here , too , sanctions fail the test .North Korea now has its own indigenous capacity to produce nuclear weapons and missiles , so cordoning off the country will not necessarily eliminate these programs .Moreover , with China refusing to buy - in to sanctions , it is impossible to effectively cordon North Korea .Nor is South Korea willing to interdict North Korean ships .The United States has claimed that the October UN sanctions applied to all alleged activities that finance WMD production , including money - laundering , counterfeiting , and drug trafficking .But this is neither consistent with the language of the resolution nor universally accepted by the signatories .Equally problematic is the fact that the sanctions are all - or - nothing .They offer North Korea no incentives to commit to the negotiating process or comply with the requirements set out by the resolutions .As sanctions expert David Cortright writes , \" Sanctions are most effective when combined with incentives , as part of a carrot - and - stick diplomacy designed to resolve conflict and bring about a negotiated solution . \" In short , sanctions are unlikely to succeed in either forcing North Korea to accept an agreement it opposes or destroying a regime that has lived with rigorous sanctions and embargoes for much of the last half - century .In fact , in the case of North Korea , economist Ruediger Frank concludes that economic sanctions are not only costly for the participants , they also challenge the very processes of economic reform and democratization that the sanctioning countries presumably want to encourage .Although they enjoy some measure of support from the international community , the sanctions levied against North Korea only add fuel to the fire .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.06914"}

{"text": "First , they clearly indicate a stable interventionist consensus that includes both obvious advocates ( Republicans ) and less obvious advocates ( Democrats and even Independents ) .Such a consensus is somewhat surprising considering all evidence from the past 14 years of intervention makes clear just how poorly such tactics have worked and because the public has repeatedly come to oppose the interventions they previously favored after they prove ineffective .On the other hand , the presence of this consensus is understandable given the interventionist agendas of the Bush and Obama administrations and the vocal support from both Republican and Democratic leaders for more intervention of various kinds .Second , the consensus illustrates the degree to which the threat of terrorism has come to dominate the U.S. conversation about national security .The 2015 CCGA study finds no increase in support for the use of military force to aid Taiwan , or Israel , or South Korea .But terrorism , even 14 years after 9/11 , remains a lighting rod capable of inducing overheated rhetoric and overheated fears .Finally , these figures indicate that interventionist cries from the candidates will find a receptive audience as we approach the 2016 elections .All of the Republican candidates ( Rand Paul aside ) as well as Hillary Clinton have staked out positions arguing for more intervention .There is thus every reason to believe that the United States will find itself further entangled in the Middle East in the near future .We had our second debate of the primary season on Wednesday , a grueling five hour affair pitting fifteen Republican hopefuls against each other in two debate sessions .When CNN 's hosts were n't asking inane questions - i.e. , whether candidates had considered their Secret Service nickname or whether they would trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes - they did find some time to focus on foreign policy issues .I have a piece over at the National Interest discussing the debate , and highlighting some of the misleading narratives underlying much of the GOP debate .Though there were some factual errors , the bigger problem was the reliance of most candidates on fundamental ideas which are effectively untrue , like the idea that the U.S. military is weak or small compared to that of other nations : .Ben Carson noted that \" our Air Force is incapable of doing the same things that it did a few years ago .Carly Fiorina argued that \" we need the strongest military on the face of the planet , \" while Marco Rubio noted that \" ... we are eviscerating our military .\" Such claims are entirely false : the U.S. military is among the world 's largest , spending more than the next 13 countries combined in 2013 ( including China and Russia ) !Today , the United States makes up 38.4 % of all global military spending , and spends substantially more on the military than it did on average during the Cold War .Many candidates also expressed support for the idea that it is U.S. absence from conflicts which creates problems , rather than U.S. intervention itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.659805"}

Bush announced his opposition to the Agreed Framework .In 2001 , upon assuming the presidency , he publicly criticized Kim Dae - Jung for his efforts at reconciliation and declared his determination to topple the DPRK government .In his January 2002 State of the Union address , Bush declared North Korea a member of an \" axis of evil . \"In October 2002 , ratcheting up its regime - change strategy , Washington accused the North of pursuing nuclear weapons using a secret highly enriched uranium ( HEU ) program in violation of the Agreed Framework .The North has denied this accusation , and the United States has yet to produce evidence that satisfies other governments in the region .Nevertheless , the HEU charge served as the excuse for the Bush administration to formally end its participation in the Agreed Framework that it deemed was helping sustain the North 's regime .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.76419"}

Bush helped to create this arc with his wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .Although President Obama has undertaken military disengagement in both countries , he has widened covert action throughout the area as the Pentagon and the CIA conduct assassination programs against insurgents and terrorists .These drones have been used against targets in Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya , Pakistan , Yemen , and Somalia , according to State Department cables obtained by WikiLeaks , an anti - secrecy group .In addition to drone bases , U.S. secret facilities support special operations against dozens of countries from South America to Central Asia .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.652634"}

{"text": "Daadler and O'Hanlon ( 2000 ) justify Clinton 's decision to intervene in Haiti due to its close proximity as a Caribbean island .Support for this hypothesis exists if we find a disproportionate number of United States military operations in the Western Hemisphere .Military Policy Hypotheses An additional set of hypotheses concerns how the United States wages its military action .Specifically , does United States choose to intervene with minimal amounts of force after 1990 ?Or do American policymakers go in with maximal firepower ?Once involved in a military action , do American generals choose to escalate the conflict , or do they keep the operation force levels to a minimum ?Overwhelming Force Hypothesis : The origins of this argument occurred in the wake of the Korean War , where Alexander George ( 1992 ) found that policymakers became reluctant to fight inconclusive wars with limited measures .Either the United States should use overwhelming force , or remain uninvolved in a crisis .President George W. Bush 's Secretary of State Colin Powell concurred .Citing examples from the Vietnam War , Powell ( 1992 ) stressed the need to apply \" overwhelming force \" and belittled experts who called for surgical strikes or incremental attacks .Reagan 's Defense Secretary Weinberger ( 1984 ) also noted that if troops were to engage in combat , they should do so \" wholeheartedly . \"Haass ( 1999 ) criticizes the use of limited operations that rely only on air power and are unwilling to provide ground support .Support for the overwhelming force hypothesis exists if the operations involve ground troops in combination with other elements of firepower , such as air and naval resources .Incrementalism Hypothesis : This argument suggests that the United States used relatively low levels of force in the post - Cold War era .Such policies have had the support of President Reagan 's Secretary of State George Shultz , who insisted that American diplomacy would be hamstrung by the military 's reluctance to become involved in \" limited \" wars ( Mokhiber and Young , 1999 ) .Former President George Bush ( 1993 ) also trumpeted the successful application of incremental uses of force .Lake ( 1996 ) also supported the selective use of force over its massive application in most circumstances .Peceny ( 2000 ) also finds that policymakers in the post - Cold War era were reluctant to commit wholeheartedly to the use of combat troops , and tended to shy from paying \" high costs \" to achieve their goals .Therefore , support exists for this hypothesis if American interventions tend to be limited in scope and escalations do not involve significant numbers of ground troops during the operation .Target Politics Hypotheses Other hypotheses tested include characteristics of the target state .These include the domestic political regime of the country receiving the United States military operation , as well as its support for the deployment of American troops within its borders .Protect or Promote Democracy Hypothesis : A significant number of scholars have analyzed the connection between American military actions abroad and the desire to maintain or spread liberalism in the international system .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.68746"}

{"text": "Myth Six : Protects U.S. Interests .A sixth myth is that the war was vital to United States interests .For example , concerns over access to oil came up quite a bit in the months leading up to the war .Yet only a small percentage of oil consumed by Americans comes from the Middle East .The Europeans and Japanese are far more dependent on Persian Gulf exports , but they were far less eager to go to war over Kuwait .Actually , Americans need not be dependent on Middle Eastern oil at all .There are safe , renewable energy alternatives , such as solar , wind , geothermal , tidal , and biomass options ; the technology is available .These options may not be as profitable for certain energy conglomerates , but they are readily accessible .The U.S. could choose to go in that direction .What 's lacking is not more research but more political will .Government subsidies may be required to make these alternative sources more cost - effective , but no more than the subsidies Washington currently grants the nuclear energy industry and the oil - based economy .Perhaps it is no accident that the first president to get the U.S. into a major Middle Eastern war was also a former oil company executive .Meanwhile , government support for public transportation was ( and remains ) the lowest in the industrialized world , and there has been virtually no support for conservation .Contrast that with Japan , which for years has stressed public transportation , conservation , and decentralized solar technology .Japan 's investment in a high - speed rail system has paid for itself many times over , as have conservation methods in industry .Rather than dumping billions of dollars into dubious synfuels projects , subsidizing oil - based transportation by building more superhighways , or leaving energy matters to profit - motivated market forces , the Japanese have ended up saving these expenses .Japan now uses far less energy per unit of GNP than does the United States .Meanwhile , U.S. taxpayers are spending millions of dollars every day to maintain American troops in order to protect oil supplies that would not be needed if alternative energy sources were utilized .Indeed , in the past thirty years , more than $ 500 billion has been spent on military forces designed largely to protect Middle Eastern oil fields .If these costs were factored in to what Americans pay for gasoline at the pump , this \" real \" price might encourage conservation .Another issue involving vital U.S. interests is the broader question of security .Despite the Gulf War , the postwar sanctions , the ongoing U.S. military presence in the Middle East , and the support of Israel and autocratic Arab regimes , individual Americans and U.S. interests as a whole are more threatened in the Middle East than ever before .This raises the ironic dilemma : in the quest for greater American security in the Middle East , has the United States not made itself more insecure ?In America 's eagerness to show its military prowess and to support repressive regimes in the region , the U.S. has made many Arab enemies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.87735"}

{"text": "In the days immediately following Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait , Arab leaders were very close to convincing Iraq to withdraw .No other member of the Arab League supported the invasion .But the sudden onrush of American forces into the region caused Saddam Hussein to harden his attitude .There were several possibilities for a negotiated settlement between the U.S. and Iraq .One meeting at the foreign ministry level a week before hostilities broke out does not constitute exhausting the possibilities .Unilateral demands are not negotiations .American specialists on the negotiation process felt that the United States wanted a war , given that Washington gave the Iraqis no opportunity to save face .One needs to declare some kind of victory , if only a 2 % victory .There were a number of ways the United States could have negotiated an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait and met other legitimate security concerns short of declaring war .Minor boundary adjustments or an internationally supervised referendum on the future of the Kuwaiti monarchy could have been proposed and pursued , but were not .In the middle of the war , in late February , the Iraqis agreed to withdraw from Kuwait prior to the launching of the ground war , accepting the Soviet peace proposal in full .The possibility of a peaceful solution was so feared in Washington that possible Iraqi acceptance of the Soviet plan was referred to as the \" nightmare scenario .\"The U.S. continued its attack , even as Iraqi forces were withdrawing .Thousands of retreating soldiers and civilian refugees were slaughtered as they fled northward hundreds of miles into Iraq .There was no escape ; they were herded and steered , usually not even given a chance to surrender .American pilots referred to it as a \" turkey shoot .\" The one - sided victory in the ground war was not exclusively the result of U.S. military prowess .Instead , it appears that the Iraqis were evacuating - or had already evacuated - their positions when U.S. ground forces arrived .For example , the Washington Post confirmed that tens of thousands of Iraqi troops had withdrawn a full 36 hours before the first allied forces reached Kuwait City .These troops , too , were pursued by the American attackers .Another alternative to military force was the UN sanctions , which were working .The CIA estimated that UN sanctions blocked 90 % of Iraqi imports and 97 % of Iraqi exports ; no country can survive very long under those conditions .Such a rate of compliance vastly exceeds that of the postwar sanctions regime .In Iraq prior to the outbreak of the war , there were long gas lines , though the country is normally a major exporter of oil .There were also chronic shortages of basic foodstuffs , such as rice , bread , and sugar , which are staples in the Iraqi diet .Breakdowns , from lavatories to automobiles , were common due to a lack of spare parts .There was hyperinflation , though Iraq had a largely planned economy and had never experienced such havoc .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.10888"}

S. military involvement in the post - Cold War world .He and his research assistants provide detailed data on when and where these deployments have taken place , and against whom .Abstract Many prior analyses of United States military actions abroad have either focused upon Cold War data ( Hermann and Kegley , 1998 ) or qualitative case studies to describe events after 1991 ( Peceny , 2000 ) .My research differs from other approaches by conducting a rigorous statistical analysis of United States military operations from 1991 through 2002 .Evidence from the 176 cases shows that Americans have augmented the number of troop deployments since the fall of the Soviet Union .This increased use of the military occurred under Democratic and Republican administrations .Such cases were more likely to take place during election years .In these situations , the United States often sought permission for the military actions , either from the target state or from an international organization .Though the majority of these cases began with little or no shooting , a handful did escalate significantly shortly thereafter .Introduction As this study was written , news broke that an American Green Beret , Sergeant First Class Mark Wayne Jackson , was killed by a nail bomb while serving in the Philippines , the suspected handiwork of Abu Sayyaf .This article is dedicated to him and other Americans who have perished since the end of the Cold War in the service of their country .The end of the Cold War may have led to expectations that America would reduce the size of its forces and their commitments worldwide , given the absence of the Soviet threat .Yet a decade after the collapse of the Berlin Wall , Haass ( 1999 ) writes that military intervention remains a key component of United States foreign policy .Yet little is known about these American military interventions in the post - Cold War era .Earlier studies ( Yoon , 1997 ) revealed that Communism and the presence of the Soviet Union were key determinants of America 's decision to send troops to a country .Dalby ( 1990 ) claims that if the Soviets and communists were major drivers of United States troop deployments in the Cold War , we have few clues to explain American military interventions in subsequent decades .It is therefore clear that we need an analysis of American military interventions in the years following the end of the Soviet Union that encompasses the motives and rationale for using force abroad .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.935524"}
{"text": "This plea was rejected by the United States .Unlike Israel and Pakistan , Iraq had signed the Nuclear Non - Proliferation Treaty and had opened its nuclear sites to international inspection teams .Like most other governments , Baghdad found it hypocritical that Washington - which had blocked strengthening international nuclear nonproliferation regimes , had almost single - handedly quashed a worldwide nuclear test ban the previous year , and was continuing to develop its own nuclear arsenal - should find the Iraqi nuclear program so objectionable .The International Atomic Energy Agency and other United Nations inspectors have since overseen the total dismantling of Iraq 's nuclear apparatus .There are indications that Iraq 's nuclear potential in 1990 was more advanced than earlier conservative estimates , but not nearly as imminent as the United States had insisted .In any case , the procurement of a few small nuclear devices does not mean that these weapons would ever have been used .Indeed , the United States and its allies survived for decades in the face of thousands of Soviet and Chinese nuclear warheads .Any use of such weapons would have been suicidal .To assert that Iraq would suddenly start threatening its neighbors with nuclear weapons was simply a scare tactic .To believe otherwise would be an admission that deterrence - the cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy for decades - is a lie .Even when pummeled by the heaviest attacks any country has faced in world history , Iraq never used its chemical weapons .That Baghdad would unilaterally launch a nuclear attack defies logic .Even though Baghdad agreed to eliminate Iraq 's chemical weapons arsenal as part of the establishment of a nuclear - free zone in the region , Washington still refused to back the plan .The United States was , in effect , saying , \" it 's okay for us to have nuclear and chemical weapons , it 's okay for our allies in the region to have chemical and nuclear weapons , but you can not have chemical and nuclear weapons . \"As horrifying as Iraq 's potential use of chemical and nuclear weapons may have been , Washington 's double - standards played better at home than in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world .Not only did such hypocrisy hurt U.S. credibility , it also raised questions about whether the U.S. had really exhausted all of the nonmilitary means of challenging Saddam Hussein 's military appetite .Myth Four : Ending Saddam Hussein 's Power .The fourth myth is that the war was fought to get rid of a dictator - Saddam Hussein .More than 100,000 Iraqis died during the war , and hundreds of thousands more have perished from the effects of postwar sanctions , yet Saddam is still in power .President Bush urged the people of Iraq to rise up against their dictator , yet the U.S. did nothing to support the postwar rebellion and stood by while thousands of Iraqi Kurds , Shiites , and others were slaughtered .In the cease - fire agreement at the end of the war , the U.S. made a conscious decision to exclude helicopter gunships from the ban on Iraqi military air traffic , even though these were the very weapons that proved so decisive in crushing the rebellions .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.043037"}

{"text": "The likelihood of a sustained regime and , therefore , stability is greater now than had Kim Jong - il died after suffering a massive stroke in August 2008 .At that time , the North Korean constitution lacked a provision for leadership transition , and succession plans had not been announced - a scenario that presented tremendous potential for a contested power grab .During the intervening three years between Jong - il 's 2008 stroke and his death , however , North Korea implemented a leadership succession plan to anoint Jong - un .Yet sudden leadership change , with its attendant stability risks , remains a real possibility .The North Korean ship of state has never had such an inexperienced hand on the tiller - a daunting prospect as it attempts to sail through the treacherous waters of economic failure and international isolation .Even an initially efficacious succession could deteriorate into a power struggle , with fissures among the senior leadership arising over time .Credible reports of coup and assassination attempts during Kim Jong - il 's reign demonstrate the strong possibility that an explosive event could blast Pyongyang off course , plunging North Korea , as well as the U.S. and the Asia - Pacific region , into treacherous , uncharted waters .Persistent Uncertainty .Although Jong - un 's ascent appears to be proceeding as planned , the seeds for a coup or collapse may even now be present .Given the nature of the informational black hole that is North Korea , little is known of what political wrangling might be occurring behind the curtain .The absence of an independent domestic or foreign media presence in North Korea prevents timely identification of potential coup indicators such as anti - regime unrest .It is likely that even the United States intelligence community will have difficulty predicting or identifying rapid leadership change .Washington - in conjunction with its allies - must therefore establish contingency plans to facilitate rapid and effective responses to sudden change in North Korea .The North Korean regime has shown remarkable resilience over the past 15 years and once again could belie repeated predictions of its imminent demise .Indeed , there is a possibility that North Korea 's neighbors , fearful of the consequences of collapse , could alter their policies to reduce pressure on a faltering regime - a scenario that , once again , would allow the hard - line regime to survive .Continuity of leadership , however , does not guarantee regional stability .For instance , despite Jong - un 's apparently effective succession , North Korea 's pledge to launch a long - range missile in mid - April would violate U.N. Security Council resolutions while exacerbating tensions on the Peninsula .While North Korean instability poses a threat to U.S. national interests , such instability is hardly the only challenge Pyongyang presents to Washington .Belligerent behavior , whether by Kim Jong - un or another ruler , also jeopardizes America 's interests , and such behavior should be expected , as Pyongyang has routinely used threats , provocations , and military attacks to gain its objectives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.294685"}

{"text": "The United States and its allies are now preoccupied by what Kim might do with the trump card in his arsenal - his stockpile of plutonium for nuclear bombs .\"The real danger is that the North Koreans could sell their plutonium to another rogue state - read Iran - or to terrorists , \" said a western diplomat who has served in Pyongyang .American officials fear Iran is negotiating to buy plutonium from North Korea in a move that would confound the international effort to stop Tehran 's nuclear weapons programme .The prospect of such a sale is \" the next big thing \" , said a western diplomat involved with the issue .The White House commissioned an intelligence study on the risk last December but drew no firm conclusions .Plutonium was the element used in the atomic bomb that destroyed Nagasaki in 1945 .It would give Iran a rapid route to the bomb as an alternative to the conspicuous process of enriching uranium which is the focus of international concern .American nuclear scientists estimate North Korea is \" highly likely \" to have about 43 kg and perhaps as much as 53 kg of the material .Between 7 kg and 9 kg are needed for a weapon .Siegfried Hecker , former head of the US Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory , has warned that North Korea 's plutonium would fit into a few suitcases and would be impossible to detect if it were sold .For the first time since the crisis over its nuclear ambitions began in 1994 , North Korea has made enough plutonium to sell a quantity to its ally while keeping sufficient for its own use .North Korea is known to have sold 1.7 tons of uranium to Libya .It has sold ballistic missiles to Iran since the 1980s .American officials have said Iran is already exchanging missile test data for nuclear technology from Pyongyang .The exchanges probably involve flight monitoring for Scud - type rockets and techniques of uranium centrifuge operation .Relations deepened between the two surviving regimes in Bush 's \" axis of evil \" after the fall of Saddam Hussein .Under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's military and scientific links with North Korea have grown rapidly .Last November western intelligence sources told the German magazine Der Spiegel that a high - ranking Iranian official had travelled to Pyongyang to offer oil and natural gas in exchange for more co - operation on nuclear technology and ballistic missiles .Iran 's foreign ministry denied the report but diplomats in Beijing and Pyongyang believe it was accurate .At the same time evidence emerged through Iranian dissidents in exile that North Korean experts were helping Iran build nuclear - capable missiles in a vast tunnel complex under the Khojir and Bar Jamali mountains near Tehran .So while one nation , North Korea , boasts of its nuclear weapons and the other , Iran , denies wanting them at all , the world is on edge .If the stakes are high in the nuclear terror game , they are equally high for the balance of power in Asia and thus for global prosperity .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.76909"}

{"text": "From day one in the White House , Obama set out to create a new order : a club of nations that would work together to stabilize the Middle East .Central to that vision was Putin .When Obama responded to Putin 's aggressive conduct by imposing sanctions on Russia , commentators were led to pronounce the reset a complete failure .Yet the president , for his part , seems never to have skipped a beat .In his thinking , the reset was always intimately bound up with what he considered to be his greatest strategic challenge : namely , ending old wars and avoiding new ones .In the Middle East , the old balance of power , resting as it did on the primacy of American military might , seemed to Obama like an invitation to never - ending conflict .Needed instead was a new regional order - one that , beyond enabling a president to pull American troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan , would preclude the necessity of ever having to send them back in .From day one in the White House , therefore , Obama aimed to create that new order .His idea was a concert system : a club of nations that , united in their enmity to Sunni Islamic radicalism , would work together to stabilize the region by self - consciously maintaining a balance of power among themselves .The Russian reset had been Obama 's way of inviting Putin to join the new Middle East concert as a founding member .To unlock the benefits of shared interest , America would take a step back and encourage Russia to take a step forward .Whatever obstacles Russian behavior might present along the way , the fundamental soundness of the strategy was not in question .There were others to bring in as well - most notably , the Islamic Republic of Iran .Of course , in the midst of the controversy over Tehran 's nuclear program , it was impossible simply to issue an Iranian \" reset .\" But , the president 's thinking went , perhaps that controversy could be moved to one side or , rather , be made a means to a larger end .Attaining an agreement on Iran 's nuclear ambitions - the prerequisite for any American opening to the regime in Tehran - would thus also become an avenue toward the prospect of Iran 's joining the envisioned concert system .The Russian reset and the Iranian nuclear negotiations were thus two bright crimson threads in a single tapestry , and so they remain today .For obvious reasons , the president has never described this vision in full ; the American public , and America 's traditional allies in the Middle East , deeply distrust both Russia and Iran .Instead , he has proceeded step by step , justifying each new step as an ad - hoc response to immediate developments while keeping his eye firmly fixed on the final goal ..... .That 's where Syria comes in , and where the threads begin to merge .A country of vital importance to both Russia and Iran ( and of limited importance to America ) , Syria offered opportunities for showcasing Obama 's respect for Russian and Iranian interests .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.949673"}

Lovett professor of history at Yale , traces the history of the conflict that dominated world politics from the end of World War II to the early 1990s .How long ago it all seems .Gaddis , America 's most distinguished cold war historian , has been writing about the subject for more than 30 years .( I co - edited a book on nuclear diplomacy with Gaddis and two other scholars in 1999 . )But unlike several of his previous books , which were intended for scholars , this one is aimed at a broader audience - for those who want to understand how the cold war began , how it unfolded , and why it ended when it did .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.4926"}

Gates , making no effort to question the strategic and geopolitical implications of a wider war in Southwest Asia .The budget of the Department of Defense , exceeding levels reached during the worst days of the Cold War , needs to be significantly constrained .The United States devotes little attention to one of the greatest losses in wartime , the civilian casualties that have taken place in Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya , and Pakistan over the past decade .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.53706"}

McRaven , the commander of the Special Operations Command ( SOCOM ) , is pressing for a larger role for his elite units and more personal autonomy to position his forces in troubled areas .McRaven , who oversaw the operation that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011 , wants to deploy 12,000 special forces around the world at all times to strike terrorist targets and rescue hostages .The Command has doubled in size since 2001 , currently at a level of 66,000 military and civilian personnel , and its budget has more than doubled , from $ 4.2 billion to $ 10.5 billion .Greater authority for SOCOM would reduce the influence of the State Department in dealing with difficult political situations as well as the authority of the Pentagon 's regional commanders .The heightened secrecy would complicate the problem of congressional oversight .Exaggeration of the threat has been a critical component in the militarization of national security policy .Such exaggeration fostered the huge strategic buildup during the Cold War , the unprecedented peacetime buildup by the Reagan administration , and massive increases in defense spending during the Bush II administration .In an effort to assure their own self - preservation , according to Harvard professor Daniel Yergin , nations often \" push the subjective boundaries of security outward to more and more areas , to encompass more and more geography and more and more problems .\" This often leads to a paradox - an expanded perception of threat rather than a greater sense of security .The United States has created such an environment .We now view each example of terrorist activity as an existential threat , and we are in the process of exaggerating the threat of China .The global war on terror is the latest example of the use of unilateral and hegemonic power , described by British theorist Edmund Burke in the eighteenth century .Burke was concerned with the British exercise of such power .The sovereign state came fully into its own in the seventeenth century , signaled by the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 , which ended Europe 's religious wars and saw the final breakup of a universally Catholic Europe .No longer were territories ruled by multiple jurisdictions of empire , nationality , fiefdom , church , and holy orders , united by common language and common religion .A new system was established , consisting of separate and exclusive sovereignties .Each nation had its own economy , society , laws , established borders , national church , bureaucracy - and the armed forces to protect them .At the end of the eighteenth century , however , England , whose navy \" ruled \" the seas , could dream of establishing English hegemony , a Pax Britannica of English law and English economics for Indian , Hottentot , and Irishman alike .It could look to a future of English economics and an English language spoken around the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.11375"}

{"text": "Washington 's positive response , as well as rumors that the United States is even considering normalized relations with North Korea -- or at least a liaison office in Pyongyang -- is adding to China 's sense of isolation .For China , this is more than just the short - term issue of using North Korea 's latest crisis as a lever in U.S.-Chinese relations ; North Korean nuclear crises come and go .Rather , there is a deeper concern in Beijing regarding a true U.S.-North Korean rapprochement .North Korea is a critical component of China 's buffer strategy .China has significant land borders and so has created a system of buffers to protect the heartland around the Yellow , Yangtze and Pearl rivers .This buffer zone was created over the course of China 's history and includes Manchuria , Inner Mongolia , Xinjiang and Tibet , among other parts of China .It offers strategic depth and supplements China 's defense forces with natural barriers .Historically , China viewed Korea as part of this buffer zone , even if it was not formally part of the Chinese nation .During the Korean War , the fear of losing North Korea as a strategic buffer to U.S. forces triggered Chinese intervention .And while Washington is currently not threatening to march up to the Yalu , China 's need for North Korea as a strategic buffer remains strong .A saying used by the Chinese during the Korean War maintains that relations between China and North Korea are as close as lips and teeth : When the lips are gone , the teeth get cold .When North Korea ceases to be a friendly buffer state , China accordingly gets nervous and feels vulnerable .For Beijing , helping the inter - Korean reconciliation process was not much of a concern .For geographic and economic reasons , a unified Korea would more than likely shift toward China -- but a U.S.-friendly North Korea is a different story .And even if it is unlikely that Washington and Pyongyang will make immediate friends and become close allies , Beijing is worried that it is losing control of the process , and thus its ability to shape its own strategic environment .Beijing is now looking for a way to reclaim its influence over the U.S.-North Korean relationship .One method will be to press for four - party talks on shaping a peace accord .These talks would include China , the United States and the two Koreas , drawing on Seoul 's similar concern that it is being left out of the U.S.-North Korean process .This would also help keep Russia out in the cold as far as influence over the six - party talks is concerned .Another means by which Beijing could address this issue would be to offer support for South Korean attempts to resurrect the North Korean economy by tying existing economic activities on the China - North Korea border to those on the inter - Korean border ( such as the inter - Korean Kaesong industrial complex ) .However remote , the threat Beijing perceives from any sign of a U.S.-North Korean rapprochement is very real .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.67288"}

{"text": "But does that mean that adult men are expendable ?Most of Saddam Hussein 's forces were conscripts ; many were even his opponents .In fact , Saddam deliberately placed on the front lines a disproportionate number of Kurds , Assyrian Christians , Shiites , and other groups traditionally opposed to his leadership , hoping that they would bear the brunt of the casualties .The United States military obliged , killing tens of thousands of them , even as they retreated .The result is that more opponents of the Iraqi government were slaughtered in six weeks of U.S. attacks than during the previous twenty years of Saddam Hussein 's repression .There are many documented stories of how desperately Iraqi soldiers tried to surrender ; the vast majority were never given the chance .With so much emphasis on the relatively small number of American casualties , neither the large number of Iraqi fatalities , the immense environmental damage , nor the enormous political and economic consequences of the war have been adequately considered .It is as if Americans believe that since the U.S. was successful , the war was therefore moral and unavoidable .Until Americans are willing to seriously address the ethical issues , they can not understand the real implications of the Gulf War .Whatever the crimes of Saddam Hussein 's regime - and there certainly are many - it is still people who die in wars .This is the nature of warfare .And this is why even those religious denominations that have historically backed \" just wars \" now question whether the criterion of proportionality can ever be met , given the destructive firepower available to armed forces in this modern era .In a world of increasing economic interdependence , with nonmilitary options more available , it is also questionable whether the criterion of war as a last result can be met either .The United Nations mandate to use force only referred to the liberation of Kuwait .Yet the United States bombed virtually all of Iraq , including targets unrelated to the occupation .The U.S. did not just attack military facilities but zapped the country 's entire infrastructure : roads , bridges , factories , power stations , and government offices .For decades , long before Saddam Hussein came to power , the Iraqis had painstakingly progressed from their backwater Ottoman legacy to become one of the most impressive and developed states in the third world .Decades of construction efforts , much of it supported by international development agencies , was systematically destroyed .Once again , it is the people who are suffering : millions of Iraqis , for the first time in decades , find themselves without clean water , electricity , or any reliable means for transporting food and medicines .A United Nations report notes that the bombing sent Iraq back to \" a pre - industrial age .\" Throughout the third world , the United States is now seen as a country willing to slash its financial support for development programs , but willing to spend billions of dollars to destroy one of the few third world societies that had brought itself up from abject poverty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.211655"}

Wells to Karl Marx , foreign observers have long fingered America 's lack of socialism as a key characteristic distinguishing it from Europe .But Sanders is a democratic socialist ; he does n't run from the term .And neither do his backers .In a January poll of likely caucusgoers in Iowa , The Washington Post reported that more Democrats called themselves \" socialists \" than \" capitalists .\" Sanders 's socialism is especially popular among the young .A 2011Pew Research Survey found that while Americans 65 and older favored capitalism over socialism by 39 points , Americans under 30 favored socialism .Once it was because they were n't as well educated .What 's holding them back now ?Though headway has been made in bringing women 's wages more in line with men 's in the past several decades , that convergence seems to have stalled in more recent years .To help determine why , Francine D. Blau and Lawrence M. Kahn , the authors of a new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research parse data on wages and occupations from 1980 to 2010 .They find that as more women attended and graduated college and headed into the working world , education and professional experience levels stopped playing a significant role in the the difference between men and women 's wages .Whatever remains of the discrepancy ca n't be explained by women not having basic skills and credentials .So what does explain it ?When four American women were murdered during El Salvador 's dirty war , a young U.S. official and his unlikely partner risked their lives to solve the case .On December 1 , 1980 , two American Catholic churchwomen - an Ursuline nun and a lay missionary - sat down to dinner with Robert White , the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador .They worked in rural areas ministering to El Salvador 's desperately impoverished peasants , and White admired their commitment and courage .The talk turned to the government 's brutal tactics for fighting the country 's left - wing guerrillas , in a dirty war waged by death squads that dumped bodies in the streets and an army that massacred civilians .The women were alarmed by the incoming Reagan administration 's plans for a closer relationship with the military - led government .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.50273"}

Bush were in the Oval Office .But it is important to note that Clinton controlled the presidency for 66 percent of the years , so the numbers roughly correspond to the number of interventions conducted by each party .The number of interventions during Democratic presidencies are not significantly different from the number of United States military operations during Republican administrations .This provides some support for Eland 's ( 2002 ) assertions that Clinton is not the only factor responsible for an overworked military .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.55083"}

{"text": "Indeed , many Arabs are bemused by the irony that the United States - which was founded in a war for freedom against monarchy - so eagerly went to war in defense of monarchy and continues to support other corrupt and autocratic monarchies in the region .Myth Two : Hussein as Hitler .The second myth is the frequent accusation that Saddam Hussein was another Hitler , ready to take over the Middle East and the world .Although the nefarious nature of Saddam Hussein can not be denied , it is wrong to exaggerate his potential for evil or to ignore the history of U.S. support for Saddam Hussein .For much of the decade prior to Iraq 's takeover of Kuwait , the United States was giving Saddam Hussein both direct economic aid and indirect military aid and encouraging trade , including that of sensitive , military - related technologies .Prominent American political figures courted Saddam Hussein up until months prior to the invasion of Kuwait .The Reagan administration even sent in the United States Navy to protect Iraqi shipping during the Iran - Iraq war .( It was referred to as \" Kuwaiti \" shipping , but in fact much of the shipping was bound for Iraq in support of its war effort . )There were widespread calls for international sanctions against Saddam Hussein when he invaded Iran in 1980 .Yet the United States was actually supportive of his effort , because the Ayatollah Khomeini was seen as the major U.S. enemy at the time .Similarly , when Iraq violated international prohibitions against the use of chemical weapons , killing thousands of Iranian soldiers and Kurdish civilians , widespread calls for immediate international sanctions against Saddam Hussein 's regime fell on deaf ears in Washington .This raises a serious question : If Saddam Hussein was really that much of a threat , why did n't the U.S. respond earlier ?Like Noriega , when his usefulness lapsed , Washington portrayed Hussein as some kind of monster , and the American public was told that the only way to stop him was to use military force .Following its seizure of Kuwait , Washington was never able to produce any evidence to support its contention that Iraq was preparing an imminent invasion of Saudi Arabia .The St. Petersburg Times got hold of satellite footage of the area from that critical period soon after the Iraqis seized Kuwait , and , contrary to U.S. government statements , there was no evidence of Iraqi troops massing on the border with Saudi Arabia .Indeed , Iraq dramatically increased its number of troops in Kuwait only after allied forces arrived .When the Pentagon was asked by the newspaper to present evidence that would support its contention that Iraq was preparing to invade Saudi Arabia , officials refused .The Hitler \" bogeyman \" has been used repeatedly to justify attacks by Western nations against the third world .The British and French insisted that the late Egyptian leader Gamal Abdul - Nasser was \" another Hitler .\" The United States insisted that without a major war in Vietnam , the communists - like the Nazis - would then try to take over the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.06064"}

Stead advanced in Britain in the 1880s .The most dramatic and celebrated manifestation of the \" journalism of action \" was the jailbreak in Havana in 1897 that freed a 19-year - old Cuban political prisoner named Evangelina Cisneros .A reporter for Hearst 's Journal organized the escape of Cisneros , who was smuggled aboard a passenger steamer to New York , where Hearst organized a rapturous reception for her in midtown Manhattan .Hearst shook up New York City journalism , and his foes chafed at his aggressive brand of journalism .Some of them openly hoped that the young publisher would spend himself into bankruptcy .In early 1897 , one of the rivals came up with \" yellow journalism \" as a jeering rejection of what Hearst was then calling \" the new journalism .\" The sneer \" yellow journalism \" stuck ; even Hearst 's Journal came to embrace the term .But by no means did \" yellow journalism \" cause , foment , or otherwise bring about the war in 1898 , a brief conflict that confirmed America as a global power .\"The conflict was , rather , the result of a convergence of forces far beyond the control or direct influence of even \" Hearst 's Journal .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.2167"}

{"text": "Although the exact location of the border between the countries may have been arbitrary and unfair to Iraq , Kuwait has manifested its own unique tribal and cultural identity for at least two and a half centuries .The repression accompanying the Iraqi invasion was only slightly exaggerated by Western media - it really was quite brutal ; the inhumanity shown by the Iraqi occupation forces was extreme .Yet it is important to point out that Iraq was not the only country in the world at that time that was illegally occupying neighboring countries and brutally repressing their populations in violation of United Nations resolutions .For example , just fifteen years earlier , Morocco invaded Western Sahara - as in the Gulf crisis , a powerful , autocratic Arab country invading a small , resource - rich Arab neighbor .The Moroccans forced most Western Saharans out of their country , into exile in the desert , with horrific human consequences .In Southeast Asia that same year , Indonesia invaded the tiny island nation of East Timor .More than one - third of the population - over 200,000 people - perished in the repression that followed .The United Nations took immediate action , condemning these invasions and calling for an immediate withdrawal of foreign forces , just as they did in the case of Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait .No decisive action was taken by the international community , however , due to U.S. objections .Daniel Patrick Moynihan , then - United States ambassador to the United Nations , reveals in his autobiography that : \" The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook .The task was given to me , and I carried it forward with no inconsiderable success .\" Morocco and Indonesia were major allies of the United States ; the U.S. did not deem it appropriate to interfere with their policies .Similarly , Turkey has continued its illegal occupation of the northern third of Cyprus .More than 2,000 civilians have been killed ( including some American citizens ) , the entire ethnic Greek majority was forcibly expelled in 1974 , and the island remains divided .And Israel continues to occupy much of the West Bank , the Gaza Strip , and the Golan Heights , all in violation of United Nations resolutions .During most of the Gulf War , Palestinians in the occupied territories were placed under 24-hour curfew , and were allowed only an hour or so every few days to purchase food and other scarce provisions .Thousands of Palestinians , including moderate intellectuals , were imprisoned without charge .In the three years before Iraq 's invasion of Kuwait , Israeli occupation forces killed more than 1,000 Palestinians , including scores of children , hundreds of homes were demolished , orchards and other croplands were uprooted , and scores of activists were forced into exile .All of these actions were illegal under international law .All four aggressors - Morocco , Indonesia , Turkey , and Israel - at that time were collectively receiving billions of dollars annually in unrestricted military and economic aid from the United States government .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.33575"}

{"text": "Hitler initiated a false flag event and burned down the Reichstag to gain control over the German government .Could the same happen here in the United States ?My initial response to that question is , does it really matter ?The pattern of societal collapse and subsequent governmental enslavement of the American people will be largely the same whether the precipitating incident is a false flag attack or a currency collapse .For the purpose of simplicity , let us call the precursor event to all - out martial law , a currency collapse .The Federal Reserve Is the Enemy of Humanity .The Federal Reserve has been bleeding this country to death for a century .What the dollar bought 100 years ago , can only buy three cents of product today .This means that 97 % of the value of our currency has gone into the pockets of the Federal Reserve investors for the past 100 years .I am amazed at the abject ignorance of the American people and that they think the Federal Reserve is actually part of the federal government .As we like to stay in the alternative media , the Federal Reserve is no more federal than Federal Express .For the record , the Federal Reserve is a privately held corporation which sells stock to preferred insiders .In 1913 , a small majority of Congress commissioned the Federal Reserve to control banking in the United States .Without a doubt , this was the worst decision ever made by an act of Congress .The Dollar Is Diving .The world is running from the dollar , or should I more accurately state the Petrodollar .Until recently , our dollar was used as the currency of international trading .Further , the dollar was also the reserve currency for oil .All foreign countries wishing to purchase oil from the Middle East , first had to purchase dollars from the Federal Reserve .The major cause of the present economic calamity is fractional reserve banking .When the government goes to the private Federal Reserve and asks for one trillion dollars , the federal reserve gets to print one trillion for the government , at interest , and $ 10 trillion dollars for themselves and to lend out at high interest rates .This inflationary practice erodes the value of your dollar while enriching our Federal Reserve investors .Ultimately , the currency upon which we depend on will be destroyed and life as we know it will be changed forever .The practice of fractional reserve banking should be wholly illegal because it creates a state of permanent inflation for the benefit of a few and sets up economic demise for the many .A Changing of the Financial Guard .The nations presently running from our petrodollar are India , China , Iran , Japan , South Africa and Australia have signed their own trade agreements and their currency of choice is no longer the dollar !When the collapse of the dollar occurs , it will literally and figuratively come like a thief in the night , and I do mean overnight !", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.08147"}
