'British military historian Edward Spiers , in his History of Chemical and Biological Weapons , quotes a 1914 diary entry of German officer Rudolph Binding : ' I am not pleased with the idea of poisoning men .Of course , the entire world will rage about it at first and then imitate us . 'Sure enough , allied press and propaganda railed against this new weapon , calling it an atrocity , before allied troops retaliated in kind with gas attacks of their own .The allies ' propaganda against the German use of poison gas was aimed , Spiers argues , at influencing opinion in the then - neutral US , and although both sides used poison gas , after the war only Germany was arraigned for doing so .I am not pleased with the idea of poisoning men .Of course , the entire world will rage about it at first and then imitate us ' .Is the existential horror of chemical weapons because of whom they have been used against ?Chemical weapons are most dangerous to people who lack protection against them : civilians .Selassie told the League : ' In order to kill off systematically all living creatures , in order to more surely to poison waters and pastures , the Italian command made its aircraft pass over and over again . 'In 1988 , Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons to massacre Kurds in the town of Halabja .In 1998 , South Africa 's Truth and Reconciliation Committee discovered that the apartheid regime had developed a range of chemical weapons for use against ANC leaders .The force multiplier .Is the existential horror of chemical weapons about the scale of the damage that they can wreak ?They are a force multiplier ; if there are two armies and one is larger , the way the smaller one gets the advantage is with a non - conventional weapon .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.36015"}

{"text": "But a more salient question is why the United States has never been held accountable for when it has intervened - in support of the oppressors .In recent decades , the U.S. government provided military , economic , and diplomatic support of Indonesia 's slaughter of hundreds of thousands of East Timorese , and of Guatemala 's slaughter of many tens of thousands of its indigenous people .Yet the Clinton administration , with bipartisan congressional support , continued to arm the Turkish military and defended its repression .Such questions necessarily raise uncharitable speculation about what might have actually motivated the United States to lead such a military action .For some advocates of U.S. military intervention , there was no doubt some genuine humanitarian concern , which - unlike many other cases around the world - support for those being oppressed did n't conflict with overriding U.S. strategic or economic prerogatives .There may have been other forces at work , however , which saw the use of force as advantageous for other reasons than a sincere , if misplaced , hope of assuaging a humanitarian crisis .The war also benefitted influential weapons manufacturers , leading to an increase in U.S. military spending by more than $ 13 billion , largely for weapons systems that most strategic analysts and even the Pentagon said were n't needed .Whatever its actual motivations , why would the United States lead NATO into a long , drawn - out war with no guarantee of fulfilling its objectives , given the real political risks involved ?Much of the problem may have been that of arrogance .There 's a fair amount of evidence to suggest that the Clinton administration falsely assumed the threat of bombing would lead to a last - minute capitulation by Milosevic , but , having made the threat , felt obligated to follow through .Even after the bombing began and Finnish and Russian mediators began working on a ceasefire agreement , greater U.S. flexibility regarding Serbian concerns could have brought the war to an end much sooner .What a number of NATO members suggested , but the Clinton administration refused to consider , was to agree that the postwar peacekeeping force in Kosovo be placed under the control of the UN or the OSCE .Instead , the United States insisted that peacekeeping should be a NATO operation .This effectively would have forced the nationalistic Serbs into accepting demands that a part of their country effectively be placed under occupation by the same military alliance that attacked them .As a result , despite suffering ongoing death and destruction , the Serbs continued fighting .The Clinton administration , meanwhile , seemed more intent on dominating the postwar order politically and militarily than agreeing to a ceasefire which could have prevented further bloodshed and allowed refugees to return sooner .Eventually , a compromise was reached whereby the peacekeeping troops sent into Kosovo following a Serb withdrawal would primarily consist of NATO forces , but under UN command .Perhaps the greatest myth of the war was that the Serbs surrendered and NATO won .In reality , not only was there a compromise on the makeup of postwar peacekeeping forces , but the final peace agreement also omitted the most objectionable sections of the Rambouillet proposal and more closely resembled the counter - proposal put forward by the Serbian parliament prior to the bombing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "103.77597"}

Bush ranted on that \" we must confront threats before it 's too late \" .Apparently , he forgot that the new reports indicated that there never was any threat .The British Foreign Office also continued its long slog through the swamps of denial , insisting that \" The hunt for WMD will continue under whatever authority is in charge , right now the Iraqi interim government .\" Of course , years later now , we know what the hunt for WMDs in Iraq has turned up since that time .Absolutely nothing .That 's what the war in Iraq has been for : Absolutely nothing .( Source : CNN , January 12 , 2005 ) .In January of 2005 , it was announced that the American military dropped a 500 pound bomb on the wrong house in Iraq , killing the family inside .What caught my attention was the half - apology that came out of the mouth of the military 's spokesman du jour : He said that the United States \" deeply regrets the loss of possibly innocent lives \" .Possibly innocent lives ?Here was a family in their own home , minding its own business when a foreign army came along and drops a 500 pound bomb on them .The best that the American military can do is say that these people were possibly innocent ?Here within the borders of the Homeland , we assume that if people are in their own home , and there 's no evidence against them , they are innocent - period .If their homes are attacked , we do n't call their innocence into question .The implicit suggestion in the American statement was , of course , that the family in that house was possibly guilty .Guilty of what ?14 people total were killed by that 500 pound American bomb , and 7 of them were children .What does the American military suggest that those 7 children were guilty of ?The only possible way that those 7 children could have been possibly guilty is if we accept that it is now a crime simply to be an Iraqi .A liberal like myself gets easily confused when the American government starts implying the guilt of children in wartime .Silly me .So , let me take this opportunity ask a simple question : Who are we liberating the Iraqis from now ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.11977"}

{"text": "We have always advocated peaceful reunification on the principle of \" one China , two systems .\" Even after the tremendous changes last year in Taiwan , we still advocate this principle , and hope to try our best to seek a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question .This is our basic principle and it has remained unchanged .It is just because we want to solve the Taiwan question peacefully that we can not give up the use of force .If we give up the use of force , that will only make a peaceful solution impossible .For instance , if the Taiwan separatists declare Taiwan independent , then how do we react ?Furthermore , it 's entirely China 's own internal affair if we deploy military equipment on our own soil .The purpose of such action is to safeguard China 's security , to defend its territorial integrity and uphold the country 's peace and stability .This is quite understandable .However , U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are quite another matter .They totally violate the promises made by the United States .We know that under the August 17 communiqu\u00e9 , there are clear provisions in this regard , in which the U.S. undertakes that it does not seek a long - term policy of arms sales to Taiwan .The U.S. government also undertook not to increase its arms sales to Taiwan , either in quantity or in quality , based on the levels of recent years since the establishment of diplomatic relations .That should lead to a gradual reduction in sales over a period of time , which would eventually solve the problem entirely .However , what the U.S. did in reality was not what it said .In recent years , U.S. arms sales to Taiwan have increased both in quality and in quantity .So this shows who is really to blame here .What the United States has done is interfered in China 's internal affairs , undermined China 's sovereignty , and most importantly , added further to serious tensions across the Taiwan Strait .At the same time , they have further increased the difficulty of achieving a peaceful resolution in Taiwan .In doing so , the United States has n't only damaged China 's interests ; they have damaged their own interests , too .Therefore , we hope that the United States will come to a better understanding of the sensitivity of the Taiwan issue , and the damage done by their arms sales .They should change their course , stop selling arms to Taiwan , and seek a proper solution to this issue .This will improve the chances of a peaceful resolution in Taiwan , and improve long - term Sino - U.S. relations .But there is , in Taiwan , a strong movement towards independence .They have fought for democracy .If they do declare independence , what will China 's response be ?Just to clarify that , it 's true that there is a movement for independence on Taiwan island , but its not at all a strong trend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.52782"}

{"text": "The U.S. justified the air strikes on the grounds that they would prevent future Libyan - sponsored terrorism - an ironic justification , given the subsequent event .Moreover , international law only recognizes the legitimacy of the use of force for self - defense , not for retaliation .The numerous civilian casualties from the air strikes and the serious damage caused to the French embassy and other diplomatic facilities provoked outrage throughout the world and bolstered Qaddafi 's standing both at home and abroad .Although the UN sanctions against Libya never inflicted the serious humanitarian consequences that have plagued Iraq , they did retard Libya 's economic development and isolated the country internationally , discouraging liberalizing influences .The ongoing unilateral U.S. sanctions have had a similar effect .Even Qaddafi 's Libyan opponents have opposed the sanctions on the grounds that this tactic has played into the hands of the Libyan dictator .What made the Libyans particularly reluctant to accede to initial demands to extradite the bombing suspects was the realization that the U.S. would oppose the lifting of UN sanctions even if they complied , since Washington 's target was not really the indicted men but rather the Qaddafi regime .Indeed , even though UN sanctions have been suspended against Libya , the U.S. has blocked efforts to have them completely lifted .A particularly problematic manifestation of U.S. sanctions has been the 1996 D'Amato Act , the motivation for which may go beyond simply curbing terrorism to exerting U.S. pressure on weaker countries .The law says that the president can \" determine \" that a person , company , or government is in violation of the act , and the aggrieved party has no recourse to challenge the president 's determination in court or anywhere else .With such wide latitude of interpretation , a president can impose sanctions or other punitive measures based more on political considerations than on any objective criteria , thus honing the mechanisms by which the U.S. can force foreign countries to cooperate with its strategic and economic agendas .The bill provides for an array of sanctions , including banning the sale of products of culpable firms in the United States .As with similar extraterritorial efforts regarding Cuba , even America 's strongest allies have raised vehement objections to the law , which apparently violates World Trade Organization rules .Ironically , this is the same sort of secondary boycott that the U.S. has vehemently opposed when applied by Middle Eastern states to U.S. companies doing business in Israel .If the U.S. secondary boycott is maintained , other countries are likely to take over lost American business .Thus , it will not be the targeted regime that will be hurt by U.S. policy - it will be American businesses and American credibility .The crimes committed over the years by Qaddafi 's Libya , though frequently exaggerated and not always unique , are still very real .Similarly , double - standards are commonplace both in U.S. diplomatic history and in the foreign policies of every great power .Yet in many respects , just as Qaddafi has gained political mileage in portraying himself as a victim of a vengeful and hypocritical U.S. , there are those in the U.S. who also benefit from maintaining a hostile relationship with this leader whom Americans love to hate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "105.53717"}

Colin Powell 's endorsement of Barack Obama for president , in effect ending Powell 's brief interlude as a Republican , was the least surprising and most predictable event of an unusually unpredictable election cycle .The interaction between Powell and the Republican Party was never a marriage made in heaven .Accordingly , it is hard to remember that as recently as 1992 , influential Washington Republican power - brokers were seriously promoting Powell as their party 's nominee for president .Regarding Powell as \" our Eisenhower , \" they considered him the solution to a bleak landscape of possible candidates in that year 's election .Fortunately for all concerned , Powell declined their overtures and , at the advice of his wife , Alma , decided to stay out of any kind of elective politics .But Powell was enticed into becoming a Republican , even though he had no connection with or affection for the Republican Party .Unlike Eisenhower , who carried no ideology into politics , Powell is much more of a liberal in his ideology .Powell 's debut as a Republican at the 1996 GOP convention in San Diego was not an auspicious success , particularly after the general delivered a speech that seemed suspiciously Democratic to the assembled delegates .When President George W. Bush named Powell as secretary of state , it was no cause for celebration among Republicans , particularly neocons , who blamed Powell for dissuading President George H.W. Bush from sending U.S. troops all the way to Baghdad during the Persian Gulf War .After the first Gulf War , Powell appealed to politicians on both sides of the aisle .Nevertheless , many Democrats who were ready to nominate Powell for president in 1992 cooled in their ardor after his Feb. 5 , 2003 , speech to the U.N. Security Council .His presentation citing Bush administration intelligence data as the reason for invading Iraq led many Democratic members of Congress to favor authorization of an attack .Powell 's friend and political adviser Kenneth Duberstein , a Washington Republican operative and lobbyist , has tried hard to facilitate Powell 's entrance into the GOP .But as astute as Duberstein is , the general and the GOP simply never trusted each other .The popular general resisted efforts to enlist him as a party fund - raiser , and Powell was clearly not comfortable as a Republican .The endorsement of Obama was an event waiting to happen .So michaelW01 blames Powell \" for the lives and the cost for having to go back to Iraq today . \" Big New Flash !We did n't have to go back to Iraq ! ! !Going back to Iraq was the decision without any justification by GWB .If you want to blame someone , I suggest pin this one on Bush , Cheney , and Wolfowitz .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.44907"}

'We tend to think of chemical weapons as being ' Weapons of Mass Destruction ' , or ' WMDs ' .But political scientist John Mueller recently argued that although the concept of a WMD may have once referred to nuclear weapons and weapons of comparable force , the contemporary legal definition is ' muddled ' and could also include weapons like potato guns .This confused perception about the threat that WMDs pose may have been politically useful in securing public support for the invasion of Iraq over chemical weapons .Acid violence in domestic abuse does not seem to excite the same public or legal condemnation as large - scale use of other chemical weapons .Is the horror of chemical weapons about the kind of damage that chemical weapons can do ?Vitriol , our word for a certain unpleasant emotion , is the sulphate with a 200-year history of being used in acid attacks motivated by vengeance or spite : the emotion gets its name from the chemical .Acid violence - usually on women - is the most common form of chemical weapon and can cause the sorts of physical and psychological damage to a human as military chemical weapons .But acid violence in domestic abuse does not seem to excite the same public or legal condemnation as large - scale use of other chemical weapons .Science and society .Perhaps the essence of the horror about chemical weapons comes from a widespread moral intuition about the role of science and scientists in our lives and what we think chemistry ' should ' be for .As the effects of Agent Orange became known , there was mass public protest against its use by the US in Vietnam .

Bush contends that he has the right to keep such secrets if he wants to .It is impossible to say what exactly information about the death of Pat Tillman the White House is keeping secret .In the short term , the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will be holding a hearing on August 1 , 2007 , exploring the continuing Bush White House coverup of the truth about Pat Tillman 's death .In the long term , we need a new , progressive President who will not use the power of government to perpetuate lies about American soldiers , or keep the American people from knowing the truth about what the military is doing in their names .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "117.96269"}

{"text": "So , given that there are recent hopeful , positive signs about the Iranians making their nuclear energy program transparent to the outside world , why would Mitt Romney say that right now is the time to make sanctions against Iran more strict and punitive ?Would n't the positive move by Iran make this the time to avoid such escalation ?It seems that Mitt Romney either does n't know that Iran is softening its position on its nuclear energy program , or he does n't care .If the first possibility is true , Mitt Romney is too ignorant to be made President .If the other possibility is true , then Mitt Romney is lacking in the wisdom and responsibility to be a good President .( Source : Reuters , September 1 , 2007 ) .Dennis Kucinich is right on the issue of nuclear weapons .Appearing on television last month , Dennis Kucinich criticized presidential candidates like Mitt Romney and Hillary Clinton , who refuse to rule out using nuclear weapons against cities in other nations .Dennis Kucinich takes the only sane position : That the United States of America needs to work toward ridding itself of its massive arsenal of nuclear weapons .He said , \" I think we have to get rid of nuclear weapons .Holding nuclear weapons as a threat against the civilians of other nations is a terrorist tactic of the worst kind .If the United States maintains power above the rest of the world through such a terrorist threat , it is a power American citizens ought to be ashamed of .Whether Kucinich is the right candidate to lead our nation into nuclear disarmament is a fair question .However , Kucinich is right to say that the next American President ought to lead the United States into a program of complete nuclear disarmament .A nation that needs nuclear weapons to be great can not truthfully be called great at all .\" We 're kicking ass . \"George W.
