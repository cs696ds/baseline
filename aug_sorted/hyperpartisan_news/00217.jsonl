Bush Presidential Center at Southern Methodist University in Dallas , views of his presidency among all Americans are starting to improve .\" It 's likely that time will only improve his standing in the public 's eye , \" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland . \"Although a majority of Americans still call him a failed president , the number who believe that 43rd president was a failure has dropped significantly since he left office .\" Fifty - five percent of those questioned say Bush 's presidency was a failure , down 13 percentage points since a CNN poll conducted in January , 2009 , during his final days in office .Forty - two percent now say Bush 's presidency was a success , up 11 points from when he left the White House .When it comes to Bush , Democrats and Republicans still do n't see eye to eye .Eight in ten Republicans now say that Bush 's eight years in office were a success , but that number drops to 43 % among independents .Only 13 % of Democrats agree , with nearly nine in ten Democrats saying the Bush presidency was a failure .\" There is a big generation gap as well , with most senior citizens giving Bush 's years in office positive reviews , but two - thirds of younger Americans say he was a failed president , \" adds Holland .The survey also points to a geographical divide , with those living in urban areas giving Bush a thumbs down , and suburbanites and rural Americans divided .The George W.

{"text": "His selfless acts of heroism during these years are documented by Chuck Norris in the hit series Walker , Texas Ranger .On November 8 , 1994 , President Bush was elected as the final Governor of Texas .President Bush is married to Laura Welch Bush , a former teacher and librarian who was the inspiration for June Cleaver on the popular television show \" Leave It To Beaver \" .They have twin daughters , Barbara and Jenna .The Bush family also includes two dogs , Barney and Miss Beazley , and a cat , Willie .Bush 's National Guard service was often slandered during the 2004 campaign .Perhaps some even accused him of faking this photo .Since becoming President of the United States in 2001 , President Bush has worked with the Congress to create an ownership society and build a future of security , prosperity , and opportunity for all Americans .Sympathetic to the tax burden on the common man , he signed into law tax relief that helps workers keep more of their hard - earned money , especially Enron CEOs .In a series of three separate tax cuts , Bush helped end economically disastrous taxation policies and move America to a more free - market economy , leading to a resounding surge in stock market prices across his presidency .After the terrorist attacks in 2001 , Bush introduced and later signed the USA Patriot Act .This patriotic act keeps America free .As of 2006 , several unpatriotic members of congress have decided to oppose freedom and try to get parts of the act repealed .However , thanks to Bush 's decisive leadership , it still protects America .God hand - picks George W. Bush for President in 2000 when Florida is unable to make up its mind .( Dramatization ) .He additionally drafted and signed the most comprehensive education reform in a generation , the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 .President Bush has also tirelessly worked to improve healthcare and modernize Medicare , providing the first - ever prescription drug benefit for seniors .Numerous TV news spots have touted the benefits of this bipartisan bill .If you have not yet had a chance to see them , please contact Karen Ryan at Home Front Communications co / PR Desk for your own copies .Additional achievements of the president include increasing homeownership , especially among minorities , including special , first - of - its - kind protection for the white , middle class male minority ; conserving our environment ( fiscal and otherwise ) ; and increasing military strength , pay , and benefits .Because President Bush believes the strength of America lies in the hearts , souls , and wallets of our citizens , he has supported programs that encourage individuals to help their neighbors in need .The TIPS program reaffirms America 's selflessness and trust of its fellow citizens , allowing everyone from the meter maid to the postman to help out in keeping each other safe from terrorists , who we are reminded could look just like everyone else .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.74702"}

{"text": "Four Lines of Exclusion .In recent years , antifascist activists in different cities have confronted the problem of crypto - fascists and pro - White separatists by calling for these individuals and groups to be excluded from progressive political circles , including conferences , organizing and cultural spaces , music venues , book fairs , and demonstrations .10 Such calls have not always been well - received ; frequently other progressive activists , unfamiliar with these forms of Far Right politics , want to know how and where the line may be drawn against these groups .When bringing up exclusions , the question of \" free speech \" inevitably comes up .The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the protection of speech from interference by the government .To call for excluding a group , individual , or band is not to be mistaken for a call for the government to ban or otherwise violate the Constitutional rights of fascist and related groups .( Even from a realpolitik perspective , these kinds of restrictions often end up being used against progressives in rather short order . )But it is legal - and always has been under the First Amendment - for non - governmental political groups to decide who may attend private gatherings or be published in their media ; free speech does not guarantee your right to crash anyone 's party , join their organization , or attend their meetings .Likewise , media are under no obligation to publish articles representing everyone 's viewpoints .Freedom of speech means that the government can not suppress individuals from holding their own meetings or expressing political opinions publicly - it does not dictate that Far Right activists must be given open access to progressive events .In addition , when identifying whom to exclude , simplistic rhetorical disavowals can not be taken at face value ; today it is nearly impossible to find almost anyone who will accept the label \" racist \" or \" fascist .\"Even hooded Klan members will publicly declare that they are not \" racists \" and do not \" hate \" others .These following four points of exclusion have differing levels of complexity .The adoption of White separatism as consistent with a political program is the most concrete and clear - cut .While antisemitic and related narratives are relatively easy to identify even when coded , not everyone is familiar with them , and some activists unknowingly use them .The use of fascist symbolism and imagery is complicated and has to be judged on a case - by - case basis .And last , the question of dealing with left - wing media , which promote problematic writers and speakers , can be the most complicated question when deciding about taking action . 1 ) Anyone who actively promotes or endorses the idea of White separatism should be treated as a Far Right activist .This includes those who accept the promotion of White separatism as a stance compatible with their political worldview .Today , neo - Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan are no longer the only groups that endorse White separatism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.520645"}
