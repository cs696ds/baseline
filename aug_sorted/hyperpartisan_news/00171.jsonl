{"text": "The new evidence is only coming to light after the victim 's family relentlessly pressed the NYPD to disclose information related to the crash .NYPD records , as summarized by Vaccaro , show that in October police thought they had all the video evidence available .They had one video that did not capture the moment of impact , but showed Lefevre 's body being \" ejected \" by the truck , Vaccaro said .In early December , NYPD told the Lefevres that the video evidence was inconclusive .Only after a rally at NYPD headquarters and the Lefevres ' much - reported search for information did police obtain the video showing the initial impact , collected from a Morgan Avenue shopkeeper on December 18 .Vaccaro did his own canvassing and found several other businesses that had video .The day after the shopkeeper on Morgan Avenue provided his tape to NYPD , he told Vaccaro 's firm that he 'd watched the video and found it disturbing .The substantial time lag before NYPD obtained crucial video evidence is one misstep in a general pattern of carelessness on the part of police investigators .According to the NYPD file , police did not have functioning cameras to record critical blood evidence at the scene of the crash .A document from the NYPD investigative file indicates that the camera used to record blood evidence at the scene of Mathieu Lefevre 's death was not working properly .While a detective told the Lefevre family 's lawyer that blood was found on the truck 's front bumper , the investigative file does not include such specific information about blood evidence .The description is chilling - not least because it 's proof positive that people can simply say a biker ran a light and that 's it , case closed .How many more case - closed , we - wash - our - hands - of - it police investigations of traffic \" accidents \" would be blown to pieces if they were subject to this much pressure ?And let 's not forget - this really is n't much pressure at all .It is obvious now that the NYPD does not have any sort of moral standard that compels them to clear cases like this .They are pretty much like the DMV .The presence of scattered detectives who behave better than this ( and I 'm sure they exist ) really is no excuse for the organization as a whole .That said , I do n't think the general public cares enough to act .The general public has an expectation for safety that is unending ( ex : we childproof everything ) but somehow this does n't apply to daily vehicle use , a consistently significant ( and unnecessary ) source of injury and death .This was certainly NOT the case at the dawn of the age of the automobile .There are archive articles from the early 20th century that detail outrage about vehicular pedestrian deaths ( caused by car , truck , bus , trolley , or freight train ) .Whatever is at the root of this change is what needs to be directly attacked before we can gather the support for meaningful reform .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.43239"}

Foster and Gerald Nathaniel Jackson -- will likely face prison sentences ranging from four to nine years .Following a string of arrests beginning with a December prostitution sting , King County prosecutors charged six men and alleged that at least 13 young women and girls had been drawn into the prostitution ring .In charging documents , prosecutors asserted that the men used violence and coercion to force seven women and girls to prostitute themselves .Nearly all of the prostitutes ' earnings went to the pimps , five of whom were members or associates of the Westside Street Mobb gang , prosecutors allege .Speaking outside the courtroom Thursday , several of the young women associated with the case defended Foster and the others charged in the case , accusing prosecutors of bullying the men into pleading guilty .Though some admitted to earning money for the men through prostitution -- and allowed that Foster did attack the mother of his children -- they denied prosecutors allegations that the men forced them to sell sex .Since charges were filed , prosecutors alleged Shawn Clark and his mother , Glenda Ann Thomas , had pressured several young women not to testify in the case .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.35341"}

Daley 's notorious Red Squad snooped on such groups as the League of Women Voters and the American Jewish Congress , and kept files on 200,000 Chicagoans .The unit was officially disbanded in 1981 , but in 2002 , the police infiltrated five antiglobalization protest groups and then undertook four more unspecified \" spying operations \" a year later , according to the Chicago Tribune .Reports of corruption on the force are still all too common .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.3052"}

{"text": "Because of the recent booming practice of some private companies publishing all mug shots in a single publication , Winder announced that as of Thursday , mug shots will no longer be available on the Salt Lake County Jail website .The county , he said , had become an unwilling accomplice to these publications because of its long - standing practice to post mug shots online where they could be accessed by the public .One company alone had downloaded 520,000 mug shots from his Salt Lake County Jail , Winder said , and about 2,700 from the Davis County Jail .He showed an example of one company that charged citizens $ 400 to have a single mug shot removed from their website , and nearly $ 1,500 for four mug shots to be taken offline .The problem , Winder said , is that once those mug shots are on the Internet , they never really disappear .While someone may pay money to have their picture removed from one website , it very easily could show up on another .Another issue , he said , is that many of the people who have their pictures taken are never actually booked into jail .Some are \" booked and released , \" meaning they are allowed to leave after their mug shot is taken .And some are never charged or are later found innocent of the crime they were accused of committing .Furthermore , Winder said some people have mug shots taken for relatively minor offenses .But to the public , \" A mug shot means criminal , \" he said .\" Yes , innocent people 's photographs are being put up there , \" he said .\" Individuals whose only offense was being arrested , and subsequently the charges were dropped .\" Just this week , Winder said a couple who were originally arrested in a domestic violence case came to the jail records department to complain .The charges involving the couple were eventually dropped and they went through counseling to improve their marriage .But the first thing that pops up when they Google their names are the mug shots , Winder said .The couple said that was hurting their efforts to move on .In another case , a man was arrested for disorderly conduct in 2000 , Winder said .It turned out to be the man 's only offense and he went on to law school and eventually became a lawyer .However , when his name is searched on the Internet , his mug shot still pops up .Even worse , Winder said , are the publications that place crowns onto the heads of people arrested or publish issues with the \" hottest chicks \" or \" most ridiculous \" mug shots - something he called \" trash .\" Winder said the jail will still work with the media , which commonly use mug shots and booking reports , and other members of the public who show up in person and need a mug .He said he was sorry for the new hurdles that have been created but said , \" I 'm not sorry it will make it a little more difficult for these bullies to torment our citizens .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.166725"}

SUBJECT : sorry Sir .Shawn opened the e - mail and scanned the contents .Again it read pretty much as he had expected it to .He shed a couple of tears of frustration , finally .He could admit that , now that the letter was finally here , that it was over .Of course he had hoped that he would be wrong , at least for once .He had hoped it was an explanation that she had been having some second thoughts but then had come to the realization that she wanted to continue on , but no such luck .Lisa was so perfect , he thought .Shawn had been sure almost from the beginning , when she started telling him about her life , that she was the one .The content of the letter , however , made it plain that she was n't though .Master Shawn , I 'm sorry it has taken me so long to write to you .I guess I have n't had the courage to tell you , so I 'm going to now .When I stopped calling you a few weeks ago and started avoiding you online a few weeks ago it was because I met someone else .His name is Tom and we went to school together .We saw each other at the store and got to talking , and then went to lunch the next day and talked some more , it was about 2 weeks after I met with you .Anyway I told him about all the stuff I told you , and we got close , and finally I went to see him .I 'm sorry I did n't tell you .It got more serious .Right after I stopped calling I moved in with him .I 'm getting divorced from Randy .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.93106"}

{"text": "The church suffered after the conviction and was eventual renamed to The Life Church Birmingham .David Webb has served his time and is a free man , but no church should hire convicted pedophile and registered sex offender to work as a pastor .If he still believes , there are plenty of other ways to serve .Contrition helps too .There was precious little of that in this case .Webb maintained his innocence until he admitted his guilt by taking a plea deal .At least he is a registered sex offender .I remember this case for two reasons .First , David Webb worked as a youth pastor in his father 's church .This implies that there were inadequate controls in place at the church since no background check or oversight were in place at a family church .The reality was that David Webb was a princeling operating as an owner and was untouchable in his little domain .And second , his wife is what I call \" Christian Crazy \" , meaning that she forgave her husband when he confessed and then forgave the victim too .There was way too much forgiveness and too little accountability .If there had been accountability , there would have been less abuse .Walsh told MPR News on Wednesday that he never sexually abused children .\" I 'd have been shocked if I was on the list because there 's nothing credible about it , \" he said .\" If I were hiding that , you would n't be in my house right now ; I would have been very careful .\"Walsh said he left the priesthood voluntarily because he has a heart condition .\" I gave almost 50 years of service , \" he said .\" I felt that was a generous offering .\" If Walsh did not abuse a child , then why did the church pay out a settlement on his behalf and seek his removal from the priesthood ?Nienstedt told the Vatican : \" Father Walsh 's scandalous living arrangements and his endorsement of ' optional celibacy ' for clergy have continued unchecked for too long .Furthermore , the allegations regarding possible sexual abuse of minors necessitate that Father Walsh no longer hold a place of prestige and authority in any parish in the Archdiocese . \" Nienstedt ... that would be Archbishop John Nienstedt .He needs to find another job or go to prison with the other child - molesting priests because he 's been accused too .In fact , the whole Archdiocese needs a do over .Seven of the priests named were not previously known to the public as accused abusers .Five of those seven are still living .About one - third of the priests on the list are dead .The accused priests have served at nearly half - 92 , in total - of the 188 parishes in the archdiocese , according to an email sent to priests by vicar general Rev.

{"text": "My friends , so much has happened since the man that preceeded me as National Commander , ' Sparky ' Gierke , spoke to you , last year , at this time .We are a growing veterans organization , not a dying one .I predict that we will reach 3.1 million members by the time we convene in out headquarters city of Indianapolis in late August .We are the fastest growing veterans organization in the world and we are a mainstream American organization .We reflect a cross - section of mainstream American values and I think we are growing because veterans of Vietnam are at the stage in their life now when they realize that the things American Legion represents are important to them and their families .Gierke was the first Vietnam veteran to serve the American Legion and I am honored to be the second .But , believe me , the Vietnam vet portrayed in the current movie , ' Born on the Fourth of July ' is not typical of the Vietnam veterans that I know .And believe me , the Legion has quite a few good men who have suffered at least as much as the one in that movie .And they love the Legion , they love this country .Yes , alot has happened since last year .The entire face of Eastern Europe is changing .The Berlin Wall came down and the people who lived under communist rule for almost 45 years , finally rose up to break the chains of tyranny and throw out their dictatorial governments .In the Soviet Union , major changes are taking place in the face of the people 's demands for more freedom and democracy .In Central America , the recent changes have been very significant .In Nicaragua , where only a year ago people were fleeing an oppressive communist government because they could not live freely under Sandanista 's rule , they have thrown out the Sandanistas through free and democratic elections by ballots , not bullets .In Panama , a criminal and cruel dictator was ousted and a truly elected democratic government was restored through the decisive and masterfully conducted ' Operation Just Cause ' in December .South Carolina lost two brave men in that operation and South Carolina has lost them before , for the last 200 years , they have been sending their sons and daughters to war .But , just because we have witnessed great changes in the past year , just because we have seen dictators like Noriega and Ortega fall , and communism begin to crumble like the Berlin Wall , we can not afford to let down our guard .We can not be lulled into a false sense of security by events which have only begun to run their course , and no one is sure of the outcome .The maintenance of a strong defense establishment for national security is what we all must still believe in and what we must fight to protect .There is one other thing that I would like to talk to you about and its something that is very near and dear to me and I hope that it will be very near and dear to you people here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "104.999985"}

Ballard : A novel unlike any other .I 'm still trying to figure out what was going on with that desert wasteland and the convertible and all the movie stars .My favorite chapter title is , \" Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan . \"The Space Vampires by Colin Wilson : Colin Wilson made an early reputation with the philosophical work , The Outsider , but his vampire - themed novels are the fun ones .These vampires are from space , and they 're horny .On January 16th , 2014 the Whatcom County Sheriff 's Office was contacted by Officials from Van Zandt County Sheriff 's Office in Texas regarding a suspect in a 2009 homicide case under investigation there , who they believed may be in custody in the Whatcom County Jail .The suspect , Billy Michael Dupree , 59 years of age had been in custody serving time on a commitment for harassment and assault 4th degree .He was released the evening of January 13 , 2014 .WCSO Detectives placed Dupree 's residence under surveillance and determined that he had boarded a WTA bus .Dupree was apprehended without incident when he departed the bus in downtown Bellingham .He was booked into the Whatcom County Jail at 1420 hours , and is scheduled to appear in court tomorrow .The Warrant , issued today by a Van Zandt County Magistrate lists the charge of Murder , 19.02(b)(1 ) Felony of the First Degree .It is believed that Dupree has lived in Whatcom County for the last several years and has been booked into the Whatcom County Jail for arrests that occurred in 2012 , 2013 and on this date .He has a number of arrests and criminal convictions on his record , the most serious of which is a 15 year sentence for Aggravated Robbery out of Dallas Texas .Detectives will be working with Van Zandt County Sheriff 's Office regarding the 2009 investigation and with the Prosecuting Attorney 's Office to determine extradition .As Whatcom County seeks citizen input on the proposed 521-inmate jail , it is important to highlight the process used to determine the size of the facility and measures taken to offer alternatives and reduce the growth of future jail needs .The County hired a leading jail planning firm who assessed that Whatcom County needs a jail to accommodate 521 inmates with a long - term expansion capacity to 649 inmates .It further recommended the inclusion of space for all of the educational / mental health programming recommended by the Task Force .The Prosecutor 's \" Fast - Track \" program expedited the process of bringing felony cases before the courts and contributed to reducing the average length of pre - trial detentions from 26 to 20 days .Drug court offer eligible offenders the option of treatment rather than incarceration .District Court Probation has enjoyed phenomenal success with mental health specialists that work with the mentally ill ( including veterans suffering PTSD ) who otherwise would occupy a disproportionate amount of jail space .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "113.455765"}

{"text": "The biggest through - line in the episode is Garvey and that damn deer .Remember the deer that tore up Garvey 's house in the pilot ?Well , another deer did the same thing all around town only days before the Sudden Departure .As Garvey secretly smokes , he spots the deer in the woods , around town and finally tearing it up at the school .Deer symbolism is in for television lately , so naturally the deer represents Garvey 's feeling of being trapped .Trapped in a marriage , in this job , in this suburban life , but mainly one without a purpose .Garvey recites a poem his father once told him .It goes a little like this : \" A man said to the universe , ' Sir , I exist . ' \" And then the universe tells him how he could care less that he exists .A lot of people think the world owes them something , a purpose , and Garvey believes , on some level , that he is owed one .Why is n't this life enough ?Well , nothing is enough for Garvey .Three years later , he 's called upon for having a purpose , but he rejects it .Garvey also wants to find the deer and let it go , but as we see when the deer is hit by a car , the universe does not care what Garvey wants .So he goes to a motel room with the stranger to have sex .We already saw that in the pilot he is having sex with a woman who vanishes , but here we can understand that it 's an act of defiance to do so .As Garvey rebels , Laurie 's just trying to deal .It is so fitting that Laurie is a therapist for some reason .And it 's another Lost moment when her patient is none other than Guilty Remnant leader Patti .Patti is predicting the end , actually always predicting the end due to the damage her abusive husband has inflicted upon her .But one thing remains clear about these two : they can see through the bullshit other people put up .Patti recognizes Laurie is another lost soul , even if Laurie has n't yet .Laurie is dealing with the news , as we later learn , that she is pregnant , just as her marriage is failing .So she wants a puppy , but really she wants a child and it 's so saddening to see her at her ultrasound .Because you know that child was going to disappear and you know that 's what put Laurie over the edge .Her son Tommy 's story is a bit more ambiguous , but it 's most definitely tied into his complicated relationship with his fathers .Learning he 's the adopted son of Kevin Garvey , Tommy is already a bit of a mess , getting drunk outside his bio dad 's house and pleading to talk .And he 's already upset that his father is pretending like he never had a wife and son , and he 's confused as to why he has to pretend .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "117.49575"}

{"text": "This appeal originated from a post - trial order awarding attorney 's fees and costs to petitioner , Baron Data Systems .The respondents , Melvin Gross , Phillip H. Loter , and Gary N. Smith , appealed on the grounds that the circuit court 's award of $ 26,000 in attorney fees was an abuse of discretion .Baron cross - appealed from the same order on the grounds that it should have received additional attorney fees of $ 7,390 for 73.9 hours of work .The Court of Appeals reversed , relying on the amount of the monetary judgment as the critical factor in making its determination ( The verdict obtained of $ 16 , 151 was less than the attorney 's fees . ) , and remanded .Judge Finney wrote the Opinion in which the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstated the trial court 's order .The SC Supreme Court affirmed the conviction and sentence .Yates ' application for post conviction relief was denied , and he sought a writ of certiorari from the SC Supreme Court to review the decision of the circuit court .The petitions were consolidated and both were denied by summary order .The US Supreme Court vacated the denial of the petition for writ of habeas corpus and remanded for reconsideration in light of an earlier decision .On remand , the S.C. Supreme Court denied relief on state law grounds , stating that caselaw may not be applied retroactively to invalidate a conviction final at the time the law - changing decision is rendered .Justice Finney dissented in a separate opinion citing that the doctrine of retroactivity should not prevent the court from reviewing constitutional issues when raised in collateral proceedings .His argument was incorporated in the US Supreme Court 's subsequent opinion reversing the state court .( d ) Marvin P.

Lexington Co.School Dist .The Court reasoned that the agreements constitute general obligation debt in violation of Article X , Section 15 of the State Constitution .The Supreme Court reversed , finding the liability under the agreement contingent and not carrying obligation to impose property taxes for payment .The non - appropriation clause in the lease agreement rendered it an annual operational obligation rather than a general debt .Judge Finney 's dissenting opinion held that the indebtedness is secured in part by the school districts property , which was acquired by its taxing powers , and , therefore , meets the test of being defined as a general obligation debt .He further held that if the district invoked the non - appropriation clause and declined to renew the annual lease , it could be guilty of misappropriating governmental property .Because he believes the leases violate the letter and the spirit of Article X , Section 15 , he believes they are a subterfuge to enable the District to evade their constitutional debt limitations , which were provided generally to protect the public .No matter how worthy the endeavor , contravening the constitution can not be justified , according to his dissenting opinion .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "139.37494"}
