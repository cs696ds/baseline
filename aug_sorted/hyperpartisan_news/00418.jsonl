{"text": "Suddenly , though , events took another unexpected turn this week .First Russia and then Syria reacted positively to a seemingly off - hand remark from Secretary of State John Kerry indicating that the crisis could be defused if Damascus agreed to put its chemical weapons under international control .The president said he was sending Secretary of State John Kerry to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday , and he added , \" I will continue my own discussion \" with Russian President Vladimir Putin .At the same time , he said the United States and its allies would work with Russia and China to present a resolution to the United Nations Security Council \" requiring Assad to give up his chemical weapons and to ultimately destroy them under international control .\" In a speech that lasted 16 minutes , Obama recounted the events of the deadly chemical weapons attack on Aug. 21 that the United States blames on Assad .\" When dictators commit atrocities , they depend upon the world to look the other way until these horrifying pictures fade from memory .But these things happened .The facts can not be denied , \" he said .The president said firmly that Assad 's alleged attack was \" not only a violation of international law , it 's also a danger to our security .\" If diplomacy now fails and the United States fails to act , he said , \" the Assad regime will see no reason to stop using chemical weapons \" and \" other tyrants will have no reason to think twice about acquiring poison gas and using \" it .Over time , he added , U.S. troops could face the threat of chemical warfare , and if fighting escapes Syria 's border , \" these weapons could threaten allies like Turkey , Jordan and Israel .\" The president sought to deal methodically with what he said were questions asked by lawmakers and citizens who took the time to write him with their concerns about U.S. military action .\" I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria , \" he promised .\" I will not pursue an open - ended action like Iraq or Afghanistan .I will not pursue a prolonged air campaign like Libya or Kosovo .This would be a targeted strike to achieve a clear objective : deterring the use of chemical weapons and degrading Assad 's capabilities .In the run - up to the president 's speech , Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel pointedly told a congressional hearing it was not time to let the threat of military retaliation lapse .\" For this diplomatic option to have a chance at succeeding , the threat of a U.S. military action , the credible , real threat of U.S. military action , must continue , \" he declared .At the same hearing , Kerry said any diplomacy \" can not be a process of delay .This can not be a process of avoidance .He later added that any agreement must include binding consequences if Syria fails to comply , and lawmakers moved to rewrite pending legislation along the same lines .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "26.68751"}

Security Council .And , indeed , Russian President Putin said such a U.N. effort could work only if \" the American side and those who support the USA in this sense reject the use of force .The president readied his speech as a small crowd of anti - war protesters , some waving signs , gathered outside the gates of the White House .U.S. officials say more than 1,400 died in the Aug. 21 episode , including at least 400 children , and other victims suffered uncontrollable twitching , foaming at the mouth and other symptoms typical of exposure to chemical weapons banned by international treaty .Other casualty estimates are lower , and Assad has said the attack was launched by rebels who have been fighting to drive him from power in a civil war that has so far claimed the lives of more than 100,000 civilians .Assad 's patron , Russia , has blocked U.S. attempts to rally the Security Council behind a military strike .But Monday , after a remark by Kerry , it spoke favorably about requiring Syria to surrender control of its chemical weapons , and the Syrian foreign minister did likewise .The foreign minister , Walid al - Moallem , said Tuesday that his government was ready to turn over its chemical weapons stockpile in line with Russia 's proposal in order \" to thwart U.S. aggression . \"He also said Syria was prepared to sign an international chemical convention it has long rejected - a step it can take on its own at any time without U.S. or U.N. supervision .Syria has long refused to provide an accounting of the size of its stockpile , rarely referring in public to its existence .According to an unclassified estimate by the French government , it includes more than 1,000 tons of \" chemical agents and precursor chemicals , \" including sulfur mustard , VX and sarin gas .Obama has said frequently he has the authority as commander in chief to order a military strike against Assad regardless of any vote in Congress .The response in Congress to support such a strike has been lukewarm at best - as underscored during the day when liberal Sen. Ed Markey , D - Mass . , and conservative Rep. Mick Mulvaney , R - S.C. , both announced their opposition .Said Mulvaney : \" While I am concerned about taking no action , it strikes me that international law can not be upheld via unilateral attack by the United States .And Rep. James Langevin , a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on committees dealing both with military and intelligence matters , said he feared that \" Iran and Russia could cause serious damage \" to the United States if they retaliated with a cyberattack .Earlier , Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell became the first congressional leader to come out against legislation giving the president authority for limited strikes .\" There are just too many unanswered questions about our long - term strategy in Syria , \" he said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "28.453775"}

Security Council scrambling to put together a resolution that is sweeping enough to ensure that Syrian President Bashar Assad surrenders all his chemical arms , and with sufficient penalties to discourage him from reneging .The five permanent members of the Security Council - the U.S. , Russia , China , Britain and France - all hold veto power , and Russia has not shied from blocking a council resolution that would punish Syrian behavior in the civil war .The Russians were especially vigorous in promising to veto air strikes to punish Syria for the Aug. 21 chemical attack that killed hundreds of people in a Damascus suburb .The U.S. blames Assad 's regime for the attack ; Russia says there is no proof that the regime was responsible and suggests it may have been the rebels who carried it out .Lacking U.N. approval , U.S. President Barack Obama - who had warned last year that Assad 's use of chemical weapons would cross a \" red line \" - was nevertheless about to wage a limited air offensive against Syria but pulled up short and sought U.S. congressional approval .It then quickly became clear that Obama would not get that backing , with polls showing the American public solidly against any further military involvement in the Middle East .At that point , Russian President Vladimir Putin stepped in and strong - armed Assad into agreeing to turn over his chemical arsenal to international control and destruction .Obama , faced with the prospect of attacking Syria against the will of both the U.S. Congress and the U.N. Security Council , jumped to accept the Russian gambit .\" Putin has put himself on the line .This was not done lightly .This was not done to embarrass Obama , \" said Stephen Cohen , professor emeritus at New York University .\" This was done for what Putin and ( Foreign Minister Sergey )Lavrov think is Russia 's national interest . \"James Collins , of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow , offered a similar assessment .\" Putin has put his neck way out in terms of responsibility for seeing this happen , \" he said .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "46.454704"}

General Assembly , particularly because of his moderate statements and exchange of letters with Obama .That has raised hopes of renewed talks on Tehran 's nuclear ambitions .Tehran insists its nuclear program is peaceful and that it is enriching uranium to levels needed for medical isotopes and reactor fuel .But Western powers , including the U.S. , fear Iran is trying to build a nuclear bomb .Distrust of the Iranians has led the United States , with wide agreement from key allies and even Russia and China , to impose economically crippling sanctions on Tehran .Rouhani is determined to work his way from under the damaging penalties and has suggested he 's ready to deal and has the authority to do so from the country 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .Any direct exchange between Obama and Rouhani at the United Nations would be largely symbolic , with substantive negotiations on Iran 's nuclear program almost certainly reserved for later talks with officials from both governments .But with that carrot hanging in front of both the U.S. and Iran , Tehran also is likely to have a significant , if behind - the - scenes , role in wider attempts to end the Syrian civil war .It 's possible that Security Council action to disarm Assad of chemical weapons could breathe new life into U.S.-Russian attempts to bring the parties to a peace conference in Geneva .With Russia - Syria 's main sponsor for decades - getting tough with Assad , the Iranians could well join in to work toward a settlement .Assad will likely be a winner as well .Tehran , like Washington and Moscow , is frightened of the increasing power of radical Islamist fighters flooding into Syria .The interests of the United States , Russia and Iran , to one degree or another , all point toward heavy pressure on Assad to sign on to an agreement , where his survival is the least bad outcome .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.15551"}

{"text": "Obama 's relatively low approval ratings may be as much a function of the era in which he is governing as it is a reflection on his leadership , management and decision - making .There have been relatively few international crises that helped to boost his public support , as the 9/11 attacks and Iraq War did for Bush , and as similar crises have done for other presidents .Arguably the only \" rally event \" in Obama 's presidency was the capture of Osama bin Laden .Obama also took office during the Great Recession , and the economic recovery since it ended has been slow and uneven .But Obama is also governing in a time of extreme partisan polarization .In Congress , that has meant political gridlock since Democrats lost control of the U.S. House in the 2010 midterm elections .In the American public , it is evident in his historically low support from the opposition party .Obama 's average 13 % approval rating among Republicans is on pace to be the lowest job approval rating from the opposition party by a full 10 percentage points , behind Bush 's average 23 % approval rating among Democrats .By comparison , Clinton averaged 27 % approval among Republicans , and presidents before Clinton averaged 40 % approval from the opposition .Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted July 20-Oct .19 , 2015 , on the Gallup U.S. Daily survey , with a random sample of 45,663 adults , aged 18 and older , living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia .For results based on the total sample of national adults , the margin of sampling error is \u00b11 percentage point at the 95 % confidence level .All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting .Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 50 % cellphone respondents and 50 % landline respondents , with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region .Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random - digit - dial methods .In U.S. , New Record 43 % Are Political Independents .STORY HIGHLIGHTS .Record 43 % of Americans are political independents .PRINCETON , N.J. - An average 43 % of Americans identified politically as independents in 2014 , establishing a new high in Gallup telephone poll trends back to 1988 .In terms of national identification with the two major parties , Democrats continued to hold a modest edge over Republicans , 30 % to 26 % .Since 2008 , the percentage of political independents - those who identify as such before their leanings to the two major parties are taken into account - has steadily climbed from 35 % to the current 43 % , exceeding 40 % each of the last four years .Prior to 2011 , the high in independent identification was 39 % in 1995 and 1999 .The recent rise in political independence has come at the expense of both parties , but more among Democrats than among Republicans .Over the last six years , Democratic identification has fallen from 36 % - the highest in the last 25 years - to 30 % .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "59.879944"}

Secretary - General Ban Ki - moon has said there is no alternative to a political solution to the crisis in Syria . \" A military solution is not an option , \" he said .But Obama proposed a limited military action against Syrian President Bashar al - Assad .\" This attack is an assault on human dignity , \" the president said Saturday , referring to the toxic gas assault .\" It also presents a serious danger to our national security ; it risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemical weapons . \"He worried aloud that a failure to respond with force \" could lead to escalating use of chemical weapons or their proliferation to terrorist groups who would do our people harm .In a world with many dangers , this menace must be confronted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.296913"}

Joe Manchin , have publicly stated that they do not support Obama 's position on Syria .With only 54 Senate Democratic votes to play with , Reid and the White House can not afford many Democratic defections .Top Senate Republicans , including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Whip John Cornyn , have yet to say how they will vote .How many of the 46 Senate Republicans will vote for the Syria AUMF is difficult to estimate at this point .A Democratic aide suggested Reid and Obama \" would be lucky \" to get 10 to 15 Republican votes for the measure .McConnell will take part in a broader meeting Tuesday at the White House that will also include Speaker John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) and the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate armed services , foreign relations and intelligence committees .Reid will not be attending that session .Corker and Arizona Sen.

Ben Cardin , D - Md . , is working to prepare the United States for the December United Nations climate change summit in Copenhagen .Cardin was recently in Athens to deliver an address on climate change to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , a regional security coalition .He was there as part of his duties as chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission , an independent federal agency staffed by congressional members and administration officials that works with OSCE .Cardin is also a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee , which is currently marking up the climate legislation introduced recently by Sens .John Kerry , D - Mass . , and Barbara Boxer , D - Calif .NJ : You have called for an international treaty to include an \" enforcement mechanism \" against imports \" from countries that do n't meet their international goals of reducing greenhouse gases .Can you elaborate on this proposal ?Cardin : What we want to make sure is that once we set international targets , and each state has their requirements and each state enacts their laws , that in fact there is an enforcement of those limits .If we enact targets and countries are supposed to meet their targets and they do n't , we 're not going to meet our overall targets .So , there needs to be a mechanism for enforcement .That assessment would be an import fee , basically , for a product entering another market .Cardin : In reality , yes , it 's the same thing .But it 's not enacted by a country .It 's an international standard .So rather than the United States having a border adjustment , it would be an international regime under the climate change [ agreement ] rather than under the WTO .So I think you have to be able to answer that question .I would rather answer it through international enforcement , but if you ca n't through international enforcement then I think it 's certainly a legitimate issue for each country to deal with on their own .Cardin : I 'm not so sure that the provision that 's in the House bill would promote a trade war , so I 'm not going to concede that point .But I do believe it is much more understandable internationally if it 's done under Copenhagen rather than each country acting on its own .Cardin : First , it provides U.S. leadership on the targets .The targets are aggressive .Secondly , it provides financing for the developing world , which is certainly a major issue in the international community .It also provides direct financing for deforestation remedies .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.38765"}

{"text": "Meanwhile , Republican identification is down from 28 % in 2008 to 26 % last year .The latest results are based on aggregated data from 15 separate Gallup telephone polls conducted throughout 2014 .These changes have left both parties at or near low points in the percentage who identify themselves as core supporters of the party .Republican identification , at 26 % , is a shade higher than the 25 % in 2013 .Not since 1983 , the year before Ronald Reagan 's landslide re - election victory , have fewer Americans identified as Republicans .The decline in identification with both parties in recent years comes as dissatisfaction with government has emerged as one of the most important problems facing the country , according to Americans .This is likely due to the partisan gridlock that has come from divided party control of the federal government .Trust in the government to handle problems more generally is the lowest Gallup has measured to date , and Americans ' favorable ratings of both parties are at or near historical lows .Thus , the rise in U.S. political independence likely flows from the high level of frustration with the government and the political parties that control it .Democrats ' Edge in Party Identification and Leaning Shrinks .Although independents claim no outright allegiance to either major party , it is well - known that they are not necessarily neutral when it comes to politics .When pressed , most independents will say they lean to one of the two major parties .For example , last year an average of 17 % of Americans who initially identified as independents subsequently said they \" leaned \" Republican , 15 % were independents who leaned Democratic , with the remaining 11 % not expressing a leaning to either party .In 2014 , an average 45 % of Americans identified as Democrats or said they were Democratic - leaning independents , while 42 % identified as Republicans or were Republican - leaning independents .That the three - point Democratic edge was down from six points in 2013 , and among Democrats ' smaller advantages the past 25 years .Democrats usually hold an advantage in this combined measure of party affiliation .In fact , the only year Republicans held a notable edge since Gallup began tracking independents ' political leanings was in 1991 , the year Republican President George H.W. Bush 's approval ratings soared after the United States ' victory in the Persian Gulf War .Democrats ' high point came in 2008 , in the final year of George W. Bush 's administration and the year Barack Obama was first elected president .However , the three - point Democratic advantage for all of 2014 obscures the change that occurred during the year .On a quarterly basis , Democrats started out 2014 with a five - point edge , similar to their advantage in 2013 .That dipped to two points by the third quarter .In the fourth quarter , likely in response to Republicans ' success in the 2014 midterm elections , Republicans held a slight advantage of one point .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.68059"}

Tom Allen , was reluctant to criticize her positioning on the debate .Although the six - term House Democrat said opposition to the war appears to be growing in Maine , there is no consensus among voters on a way forward .\" It 's such a complicated issue , \" Allen said .\" The ideas of what to do range from cut the funding now to stay the course and give it a little more time . \"Indeed , many political experts think the Iraq situation is far too fluid to anticipate how it might play in the next election .Charles E. Schumer ( N.Y. ) , the Senate Democrats ' campaign chairman for 2006 and 2008 , has warned party strategists and candidates not to expect Iraq to pack the political punch in the next cycle that it did last year .But even the most seasoned veterans acknowledged that voters expect Congress to take a more active role in the war debate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.666885"}
