{"text": "Intercollegiate Athletics .Although difficult , expensive , and risky to operate as a sport , football is usually the most lucrative , popular , and publicized athletic program on campuses of U.S. colleges and universities who sponsor a team that participates in a division of the NCAA .Across three NCAA divisions , the number of schools with football teams increased by approximately 31 percent , or from 497 in the 1981 - 82 college sports season to 650 in 2011 - 12 .Between these periods , the change in numbers of sponsors represents a decline from 4.2 to 3.5 percent as a proportion of total sports teams .This occurred , in part , because of Title IX legislation and thus the growth of women - and perhaps other men - sports .In response to the proposals of critics , the NCAA wrote , adopted , and implemented various reforms that have marginally improved ethics of athletic directors and operations of their programs but not necessarily the conduct of football coaches and academic performances of student athletes .Based on my research of intercollegiate athletics , school officials need to truly enforce NCAA rules and aggressively penalize anyone who violates them but also accept and control the expansion of commercialism in football .Sports Finance .During Fiscal Year ( FY ) 2010 , FBS teams had almost four times the median amount of generated revenue than those in men 's basketball .Meanwhile in net revenue ( or profit ) , football 's median amount exceeded basketball 's by more than 300 percent while amounts of other NCAA team sports were actually a negative net revenue or a net loss .For schools in conferences of the FCS and in Division II , however , their football programs ranked last with the most negative net revenue of all team sports .In other words , a relatively small number of universities with big - time football programs earned enough income from gate receipts and television broadcasts of their games , and in distributions from their conferences , to offset total expenses .Other interesting aspects of sports finance are schools ' and/or conferences ' media and television rights deals , and their revenue from football 's bowl games .These distributions , In part , reflect how games and tournaments in regular seasons and postseasons have contributed to college and university sports programs and groups of them from a financial perspective .Department of Athletics .In most American colleges and universities , the Department of Athletics ( DOAs ) consists of an Athletic Director ( AD ) who prepares budgets and supervises other administrators , and sports coaches and their staffs .Since the late 1990s , former business executives and managers with financial experience have gradually replaced men and women with college degrees in physical education to become ADs at major schools .During 2010 to 2011 , for example , the three most popular positions in DOAs among men were assistant and associate directors of athletics , and then sports information directors .Among women , the positions were administrative assistants , academic advisors / counselors , and senor women administrators .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.0822"}
