{"text": "While Bernie Sanders has been stimulated a remarkable amount of excitement around his campaign , some also have concerns over whether he can beat Clinton for the nomination and win the general election .While Joe Biden 's name comes up the most among those who believe another well - known candidate with gravitas is needed to enter the race , Salon has repeated another name which would be worth considering if he is interested - Al Gore .The story is entitled , It 's time to draft Al Gore : If Democrats want to win , it 's clear neither Hillary nor Sanders is the way .The article gives ten reasons why : .Enter Al Gore : the one person on the left , apart from Clinton and Biden , with the cachet to bridge the establishment and progressive wings of the party .Here are 10 reasons why a Gore candidacy makes sense , both for the Democratic Party and the country .Stature .Gore is a superstar with impeccable qualifications .The GOP will have a hard time marginalizing someone of his caliber and experience .His background speaks for itself : a former Congressman , U.S. Senator , and two - time Vice President .He 's even succeed wildly in the private sector as a businessman - something Republicans ca n't help but praise .In short , Gore passes the credibility test by any measure , and that matters in a national election .Hillary Clinton is the only other Democratic candidate who can match Gore on this front .Vulnerability .As the new AP poll shows , Clinton 's unfavorability ratings are rising among Americans overall and among Democratic voters in particular .Indeed , her positive marks have plummeted from 81 % to 70 % among Democrats since April .Worse , as the AP noted : \" Just 39 percent of all Americans have a favorable view of Clinton , compared to nearly half who say they have a negative opinion of her . \"Hard to win with numbers like that .These numbers are consistent with another recent poll , which confirmed that Clinton 's lead over the Democratic field has shrunk considerably over the last several months .Some of this is the result of Clinton fatigue , but it 's also due to the rise of Bernie Sanders .The left wing of the party is flocking to Sanders , in part , because they do n't trust Clinton 's centrist record .Gore , on the other hand , who has become much more outspoken since leaving office , could embrace much of Sanders ' populist platform while also selling himself as a more appealing national candidate .That 's a strong case on his behalf , one many Democrats will find persuasive .Besides Hillary Clinton , no one running as a Democrat is likely to challenge Republicans in a national election .Sanders is a regional candidate at best ; he should n't be , but he is , and that 's not changing next year .The other candidates scarcely warrant mentioning : Martin O'Malley , Jim Webb , Lincoln Chafee - these guys are political ornaments , running for reasons known only to their friends and families .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.966537"}

{"text": "In a nutshell , they argue that \" manhood \" - however an individual male 's culture might define it - is a status that must be continually earned .And one 's self - worth is tied to being perceived as a \" real man .\" It 's precarious because it can be easily lost - especially if the man fails to measure up to the relentless challenges that life throws at him , be they tests of physical bravery , or competition with other men for respect and status .When I introduce this concept to my male students , they instantly recognize what I 'm talking about .But when I ask the women if there 's a female equivalent , I 'm often met with confused looks .( Some do note that the inability to have a child could be a threat to womanhood . )Indeed , it quickly becomes clear in the ensuing discussion that \" manhood \" is more precarious than \" womanhood . \" The roots of this male dilemma reside deep in our prehistoric past .Throughout the animal kingdom , the sex that invests the least in the reproduction of offspring ( almost always males ) competes among themselves for sexual access to mates .Historically , powerful men have always enjoyed greater sexual access to women than men lower in the pecking order , and violence can often be traced to this grim struggle for status .Anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon spent years studying the Yanomamo people of South America .He discovered that men who had killed other men acquired significantly more wives than men who had n't killed anyone .And by all indications , a man 's status in the group was often dependent upon how believable his threats of physical violence were .In different cultures , the male \" quest for dominance \" may play out in different ways .Regardless , it is clearly a universal motivating principle among males , with the achievement of dominance satisfying and rewarding for those who attain it .As scholar Jonathan Gottschall put it : .To physically dominate another man is intoxicating .And so , violence committed against the right people at the right time became a ticket to social success .For sound evolutionary reasons , younger men find themselves especially concerned with status and dominance .In early human societies , competitive success or failure in early adulthood determined a man 's standing in a social group for the rest of his life .It was n't possible to simply hit the \" reset \" button and join another group , so what happened during the teen years mattered a lot .For this reason , high - risk competition between young males provided an opportunity for \" showing off \" the abilities needed to acquire resources , exhibit strength and meet any challenges to one 's status .Consequently , heroic or even recklessly daredevil behavior was rewarded with status and respect - assuming , of course , that the young man survived the ordeal .Today , the widespread promotion of sport in our culture undoubtedly developed as a constructive alternative for dealing with the proclivities of young males that evolved in a very different time .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "67.31094"}

Kennedy was the last Democratic president who had the chance to nominate a replacement for a conservative Supreme Court justice .Given the age of the justices , he says , \" it would be strange if at least one or two did n't retire in the next president 's term ( the last three presidents each appointed two justices ) .If the next president gets that chance , no matter which party he or she comes from , it will profoundly affect the court 's direction .If a Republican could appoint someone to replace Ginsburg or Breyer , it would mean a 6 - 3 conservative majority , which means that Kennedy would no longer be the swing vote and there would be a margin for error in every case .If a Democratic president were to replace Scalia or Kennedy , then the court would go from 5 - 4 in favor of the conservatives to 5 - 4 in favor of the liberals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.74249"}
