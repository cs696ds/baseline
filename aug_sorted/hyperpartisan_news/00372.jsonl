{"text": "Summary .These two papers add to the growing body of evidence that we are seeing more intense hurricanes as a result of human - caused global warming .The Grinsted paper also notes that the most harmful aspect of hurricanes - storm surges - have become larger over the past few decades .The future of hurricanes remains an open question .While Grinsted predicts that the most intense hurricanes will continue to become more and more frequent in a warming world , the results of Holland and Bruy\u00e8re suggest that we may be near the peak of intense hurricane frequency .The Grinsted results are more in line with most previous hurriane modeling research , but for the sake of people living in areas subject to hurricanes , we hope that Holland and Bruy\u00e8re are correct about the hurricane saturation level .One Response to New Research Finds Humans Causing More Strong Hurricanes .This research seems to be particularly relevant for Gulf Coast and southern states on the east coast .In the northeast it seems that except in rare instances by the time hurricanes make landfall they are Cat 1 or more likely have been downgraded to tropical storms .The Sandy situation seems more relevant for the northeast where a Cat 1 storm was blocked from going eastward and instead turned west and was incorporated into a storm heading east forming a superstorm with a huge storm surge .If global warming increases the odds of that happening there is big trouble ahead .Katrina - Like Storm Surges Could Become the Norm .Last year 's devastating flooding in New York City from Hurricane Sandy was the city 's largest storm surge on record .Though Hurricane Sandy was considered a 100-year - event - a storm that lashes a region only once a century - a new study finds global warming could bring similar destructive storm surges to the Gulf and East Coasts of the United States every other year before 2100 .Severe storms generate both high waves and storm surge , which can combine to erode beaches and dunes and flood coastal communities .Storm surge is seawater pushed ahead of a storm , mainly by strong winds .Onshore , the surge can rise several feet in just a few minutes .High waves travel on top of the surge , and cresting waves raise the sea 's height even more .Looking at extreme events , which researchers called \" Katrinas \" after the 2005 hurricane that flooded the Gulf Coast , a new model predicts Katrina - like storm surges will hit every other year if the climate warms 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit .That would be 10 times the rate seen since 1923 , after which there has been a Katrina - magnitude storm surge every 20 years , the study , published in the March 18 issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , found .In 2009 , the world 's nations agreed to try to limit climate change to a 2 C increase by 2100 , but recent studies show temperatures could rise 7.2 F ( 4 C ) before the century ends .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "40.361015"}

{"text": "Q : What force keeps a hurricane or its winds going around for so long ?What happens in layman terms , please .My father , 87 , wants to know .Thanks .Q : How do hurricanes get started ?A : When water vapor in the air ( this is the invisible form of water as a gas that you feel as humidity ) condenses to form cloud drops or turns directly into ice it releases that heat that it picked up when it evaporated .This is called \" latent \" heat .Hurricanes form , grow and stay alive over warm oceans with very humid air in a fairly deep layer over the ocean .Air in the center of the storm is rising , which makes the air cool .As the air cools , the water vapor condenses , which releases heat .This warms up the air , making it rise just as a hot - air balloon rises .As the air rises , more air flows in to replace it , causing the winds .The Earth 's rotation makes the winds spiral into the storm 's center .If you click here , you 'll go to one of our graphics that explains more about this .Obviously , for a hurricane to get started , you need to have warm ocean water and plenty of warm , humid air over that ocean .You also need to have winds at all levels of the atmosphere coming from pretty much the same direction at about the same speeds to avoid wind shear that can rip apart a storm .When these and other factors are present , a tropical depression and form and grow into a hurricane .A USA TODAY graphic shows the life cycle of a typical hurricane .Q : On Friday and Saturday there were four hurricanes in the Atlantic .Two of them are relatively close to each other .Have two hurricanes ever collided ?If so , what happens ?I imagine they would both be dissipated .A : You 're close to being right .Storms do n't actually collide , their winds begin interfering with each other .Often one of the storms will dissipate .But , sometimes the two storms will do a kind of dance around each other .Click here for more on this .Q : Can you tell me why is the center of a hurricane is not windy or rainy but is sunny ?A : A hurricane 's winds are spiraling toward the storm 's center , that is they are going in a circle around and toward the center .As the wind nears a hurricane 's center it goes faster and faster .It 's somewhat like being in a car trying to go around a sharp curve as high speed , if you do n't have a seat belt on you slide away from the center of the curve .If you try to go too fast , the car itself will skid away from the center of the curve .In a hurricane , this \" centrifugal force \" is pushing the wind away from the center , air pressure is pushing it toward the center .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.397778"}

{"text": "A : The process by which a hurricane \" picks up \" water over the ocean is called evaporation .That is , heating by the sun makes saltwater warm enough that molecules of water leave the liquid state and become water vapor in the atmosphere .The salts that are diluted in the water are left behind , making the remaining ocean water even saltier .The water vapor condenses to form clouds within the hurricane and eventually precipitates out of the storm as fresh rainwater .Q : What are the odds that a major hurricane will hit the U.S. coastline in 2006 ?A :According to hurricane experts at Colorado State University , there is a 73 % chance that a major hurricane ( Category 3 or higher on the Saffir - Simpson scale of hurricane intensity ) will hit somewhere along the U.S. coastline this year .This is well above the long - term average of 52 % .The East Coast and peninsular Florida have a 64 % probability of a major hurricane landfall in 2006 , more than twice the average of 31 % .The Gulf Coast has a 26 % probability , just below the long - term average of 30 % .Q : Why does wind shear tend to strengthen thunderstorms but weaken hurricanes ?A : Wind shear , changes in wind speed and direction with elevation , gives a thunderstorm its spin in the form of rotating updrafts called mesocyclones .Wind shear also helps to keep a thunderstorm 's updraft separated from its downdraft , increasing the storm 's strength and duration .A hurricane , on the other hand , is a large collection of thunderstorms and occurs on a much larger scale than do individual thunderstorms .A hurricane gets its spin from the rotation of the Earth rather than from wind shear .Hurricanes rapidly intensify when the thunderstorms form tightly around the center of circulation .Like pushing over a spinning figure skater , wind shear tends to disrupt the balance of the storm .A : Yes , Central America can be affected by hurricanes .Storms that form in the north Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins often hit or come close to the region .One of the worst storms was in October 1998 , when catastrophic Hurricane Mitch killed more than 9,000 people , mostly in Honduras and Nicaragua .South America , on the other hand , is rarely affected by tropical systems .Cooler water , high wind shear , and the lack of an Intertropical Convergence Zone -- a constant area of low pressure and thunderstorm activity along the Earth 's equator -- in the south Atlantic and south eastern Pacific basins limit any tropical activity that may affect South America .A : Tropical waves , also known as easterly waves , are elongated low - pressure areas that cause cloudiness and thunderstorms .They form when warm air drifts off of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean , and they are usually pushed westward by prevailing winds .Tropical waves can often develop into tropical cyclones : 60 % of all Atlantic tropical cyclones originate from tropical waves , and about 85 % of Atlantic hurricanes of Category 3 or greater come from tropical waves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.245377"}

Mid - latitude weather systems in the Northern Hemisphere do indeed typically move from west to east .However , in the subtropics , where hurricanes typically form , most weather moves from east to west .Q : What determines the different categories of a hurricane : wind speed or barometric pressure ?A : The Saffir - Simpson scale rates storms according to their intensity , as measured by the sustained wind speed of the storm .While wind speed is the determining factor in the scale , central air pressure and storm surge are also used to gauge the damage potential of the hurricane .A : Stronger , more intense hurricanes tend to produce a higher storm surge , which is the mound of water that builds up as a hurricane moves over water .Forecasting a hurricane 's path is just as important as forecast intensity to determine the potential for storm surge .As the mound of water approaches the shore , the topography of the ocean floor and coast , along with the timing of local tides , will ultimately determine the size of the storm surge .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.59097"}

{"text": "Strong winds are the defining characteristic of a hurricane .Wind is caused by the change in air pressure between two different locations .In the eye of a hurricane the air pressure , which is the weight of a column of air from the surface to the top of the atmosphere , is quite low compared with the air pressure outside the hurricane .This pressure difference causes the air to move from the outside of the hurricane inward toward the center of the hurricane .By a combination of friction as the air rubs on the ocean below and the spin of the Earth as it rotates on its axis , the air does not move directly inward but rather spirals in a counterclockwise direction toward the region of lowest pressure .The vertical component of the Earth 's spin is too weak to support a spiral within about 5 degrees of latitude from the Equator so hurricanes do not develop there .To a first approximation , the pressure difference between the eye and the surrounding air determines the speed of the wind .Since the pressure outside the hurricane is roughly uniform , a hurricane 's central pressure is another measure of a hurricane 's intensity .The lower the central pressure the more intense the hurricane .Pressures inside the most intense hurricanes are among the lowest that occur anywhere on the Earth 's surface at sea level .In the largest and most intense hurricanes ( like Hurricane Katrina in 2005 ) , the strongest winds are located in the eyewall that surrounds the nearly calm eye .If the hurricane is stationary ( spinning , but with no forward motion ) the field of winds is shaped like a torus , with a calm center and the fastest winds forming a ring around the center .Concentric rings of incrementally weaker winds are analyzed outward from the core of strongest winds .The distance from the center of the hurricane to the location of the hurricane 's strongest winds is called the radius of maximum winds .In well - developed hurricanes , the radius of maximum winds is found at the inner edge of the eyewall .This distance varies considerably from hurricane to hurricane and , due to cycles of eyewall replacement , even from day to day for a particular storm .While the wind just above the ocean surface spirals anticlockwise toward the center , the air at high altitudes blows outward in a clockwise spiral .This outward flowing air produces thin cirrus ( feathery ) clouds that extend great distances ( thousands of kilometers ) from the center of circulation and the presence of these clouds may be the first sign that a hurricane is approaching .Hurricanes are steered by large - scale wind streams in the atmosphere above the surface and by the increasing component of the Earth 's spin away from the equator .In the deep tropics these forces push a hurricane slightly north of due west ( in the Northern Hemisphere ) .Once north of about 23 degrees of latitude a hurricane tends to take a more northwestward track then eventually northeastward at still higher latitudes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.13624"}

{"text": "Water vapor also is an important atmospheric greenhouse gas .Unlike other greenhouse gases , however , the concentration of water vapor depends on atmospheric temperature and is controlled by the global climate system through its hydrological cycle of evaporation - condensation - precipitation .Water vapor is highly variable in space and time with a short lifetime , because of weather variability .Observations indicate an increase in globally averaged water vapor in the atmosphere in recent decades , at a rate consistent with the response produced by climate models that simulate human - induced increases in greenhouse gases .This increase in water vapor also strengthens the greenhouse effect , amplifying the impact of human - induced increases in other greenhouse gases .Human activity also affects climate through changes in the number and physical properties of tiny solid particles and liquid droplets in the atmosphere , known collectively as atmospheric aerosols .Examples of aerosols include dust , sea salt , and sulfates from air pollution .Aerosols have a variety of climate effects .They absorb and redirect solar energy from the sun and thermal energy emitted by Earth , emit energy themselves , and modify the ability of clouds to reflect sunlight and to produce precipitation .Aerosols can both strengthen and weaken greenhouse warming , depending on their characteristics .Most aerosols originating from human activity act to cool the planet and so partly counteract greenhouse gas warming effects .Aerosols lofted into the stratosphere [ between about 13 km ( 8 miles ) and 50 km ( 30 miles ) altitude above the surface ] by occasional large sulfur - rich volcanic eruptions can reduce global surface temperature for several years .By contrast , carbon soot from incomplete combustion of fossil fuels warms the planet , so that decreases in soot would reduce warming .Land surface changes can also affect the surface exchanges of water and energy with the atmosphere .Humans alter land surface characteristics by carrying out irrigation , removing and introducing forests , changing vegetative land cover through agriculture , and building cities and reservoirs .These changes can have significant effects on local - to - regional climate patterns , which adds up to a small impact on the global energy balance as well .How can climate change be projected into the future ?The difference between weather and climate is critically important in considering predictability .Climate is potentially predictable for much longer time scales than weather for several reasons .One reason is that climate can be meaningfully characterized by seasonal - to - decadal averages and other statistical measures , and the averaged weather is more predictable than individual weather events .A helpful analogy in this regard is that population averages of human mortality are predictable while life spans of individuals are not .A second reason is that climate involves physical systems and processes with long time scales , including the oceans and snow and ice , while weather largely involves atmospheric phenomena ( e.g. , thunderstorms , intense snow storms ) with short time scales .A third reason is that climate can be affected by slowly changing factors such as human - induced changes in the chemical composition of the atmosphere , which alter the natural greenhouse effect .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.54248"}

{"text": "The temperature at its upper boundary is very cold ( roughly -60\u00ba C ) .Because hot air rises and cold air falls , there is a constant convective overturn of material in the troposphere .Indeed , the name troposphere means region of mixing .For this reason , all weather phenomena occur in the troposphere .Water vapor evaporated from the earth 's surface condenses in the cooler upper regions of the troposphere and falls back to the surface as rain .Dust and pollutants injected into the troposphere become well mixed in the layer , but are eventually washed out by rainfall .The troposphere is therefore self cleaning .A narrow zone at the top of the troposphere is called the tropopause .It effectively separates the underlying troposphere and the overlying stratosphere .The temperature in the tropopause is relatively constant .Strong eastward winds , known as the jet stream , also occur here .The stratosphere is the next major atmospheric layer .This layer extends from the tropopause ( roughly 12 kilometers ) to roughly 50 kilometers above the earth 's surface .The temperature profile of the stratosphere is quite different from that of the troposphere .The temperature remains relatively constant up to roughly 25 kilometers and then gradually increases up to the upper boundary of the layer .The amount of water vapor in the stratosphere is very low , so it is not an important factor in the temperature regulation of the layer .Instead , it is ozone ( O 3 ) that causes the observed temperature inversion .Most of the ozone in the atmosphere is contained in a layer of the stratosphere from roughly 20 to 30 kilometers .This ozone layer absorbs solar energy in the form of ultraviolet radiation ( UV ) , and the energy is ultimately dissipated as heat in the stratosphere .This heat leads to the rise in temperature .Stratospheric ozone is also very important for living organisms on the surface of the earth as it protects them by absorbing most of the harmful UV radiation from the sun .Ozone is constantly being produced and destroyed in the stratosphere in a natural cycle .The basic reactions involving only oxygen ( known as the \" Chapman Reactions \" ) are as follows : .The production of ozone from molecular oxygen involves the absorption of high energy UV radiation ( UVA ) in the upper atmosphere .The destruction of ozone by absorption of UV radiation involves moderate and low energy radiation ( UVB and UVC ) .Most of the production and destruction of ozone occurs in the stratosphere at lower latitudes where the ultraviolet radiation is most intense .Ozone is very unstable and is readily destroyed by reactions with other atmospheric species such nitrogen , hydrogen , bromine , and chlorine .In fact , most ozone is destroyed in this way .The use of chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) by humans in recent decades has greatly affected the natural ozone cycle by increasing the rate of its destruction due to reactions with chlorine .Because the temperature of the stratosphere rises with altitude , there is little convective mixing of the gases .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.85094"}
