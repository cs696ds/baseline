{"text": "The design capacity of the leaching units is dependent on the amount of ore to be leached .For example , a 25-meter - long , 15-meter - wide , and 6-meter - deep vat unit is capable of leaching between 3,000 and 5,000 tons of ore per cycle .Vat leaching of concentrates ( as opposed to ore ) is also applied ( e.g. the cyanidation of gold - rich sulphide concentrates ) .Metal recovery .Typically , cementation precipitators are shallow - round or stair - stepped wooden or concrete basins ( U.S. Congress , Office of Technology Assessment , 1988 ) .The simplest and most common precipitation system used in the copper mining industry are open - launder - type cementation systems where copper - rich solution flows through a trough filled with scrap iron .Metallic copper precipitates on the iron ( with a concomitant dissolution of the iron ) .The copper precipitate is invariably contaminated .For copper , the solvent extraction operation is a conducted in two stages .In the first , dilute and impure leach solution containing dissolved copper , iron and other base - metals ( from the leaching stage ) is passed to a mixer for extraction of the copper .In the mixer , the aqueous solution is contacted with an active organic extractant ( chelating agent ) in an organic diluent ( usually kerosene ) , forming a copperorganic complex .The extractant is designed to selectively extract only the desired metal ( in this case copper ) , while impurities such as iron are left behind in the aqueous phase .The organic phase ( containing the organic - copper complex ) is then physically separated from the barren aqueous phase ( Anonymous , 1991 ) .The latter is recirculated back to the leaching units while the copper - loaded organic phase is transferred to the stripping section where the copper is removed by mixing the organic .phase with concentrated sulphuric acid solution ( spent electrolyte from the electrowinning stage ) to produce a clean , high - grade solution of copper for electrowinning .Copper is then plated out of solution onto inert ( non - dissolving ) cathodes made of lead alloyed with tin and calcium or of stainless steel .The obvious advantage of solvent extraction is that cathode copper of saleable quality can be produced directly from leach solutions and therefore further purification is not required .However , there are signs that traditional SX / EW for copper may be under threat from systems that remove the need for SX by allowing direct recovery from low - concentration copper solutions ( Clifford , 1997 ) .When heap leach operations are concluded , a variety of constituents remain in the wastes .These include cyanide not removed during rinsing or neutralization ( for gold leach operations ) , acid or alkalis ( for base metal operations ) , as well as heavy metals , sulphides and other metal - bearing minerals .After the operation has been closed or reclaimed , in the absence of proper design and control measures , runoff from the spent ore may occur .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.535683"}
{"text": "One result of this was that companies had to obtain the consent of the Aboriginal owners before they could explore or mine on such land .Because of the significance of land to Aboriginal society , and because of the owners ' wish to minimise the effect of a different culture on their traditional way of life , this requirement resulted in prolonged negotiations .The consequent added costs and uncertainty of the mineral exploration process meant that such areas have been less explored , in general .In the late 1970s , the rate of growth of the mining industry in Australia , which had been maintained for more than 15 years , began to slow .New mines had been developed around the world to meet a forecast demand for mineral , which turned out to be overly optimistic .The Australian industry 's costs had increased but mineral prices generally had not .The industry was largely dependent on exports and had to compete for sales with an increasing number of mines in other countries ; some of these mines were less affected by cost increases , or were assisted in various ways by their governments .Many new coal mines were established in Australia after the second oil shock in 1979 , but world demand stagnated , leaving the industry in Australia ( and the world ) with substantial surplus capacity .Metal prices failed to increase in line with the world economic upturn in the early 1980s , and few new metal mines were opened - Australian production increased largely because of capacity increases at existing mines to achieve economies of scale .Statistics show mine production and exports increased year after year , but the return on funds employed generally was low and a number of mines closed because they had become uneconomic .Coal exports in 1985 reached 88 Mt , providing 16 % of total Australian merchandise exports .By the mid-1980s , one of the few bright spots in the Australian mining industry was gold .Because its price had been fixed , gold was largely ignored in the expansion of the industry after World War II .Interest revived to some extent when the price was freed in 1968 , and strengthened with increasing confidence that the price increases of the late 1970s were likely to be sustained .Other factors heightened the interest in gold .There was the development in the early 1980s of the efficient carbon - in - pulp method for recovering very fine - grained and low grade gold .This , and other developments with mining equipment , meant that it was now economically feasible to mine by open cut , or by underground methods , entire zones of gold bearing veins ( whereas in the past only the main veins themselves would have been mined ) .So another gold boom emerged in the early 1980s .Australian gold production multiplied from 18 t in 1981 to 57 t in 1985 .In 1984 and 1985 alone , 24 new gold mines were opened , and retreatment of old tailings began at several centres .Notably , almost all the deposits opened up were close to , or at , old mines - very few were completely new discoveries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.61313"}

{"text": "While this will precipitate some price spikes , the price sensitivity to increased costs of , for example , the actual use of europium in liquid crystal displays is miniscule and the rare earths therefore remain relatively price- insensitive commodities .It is highly unlikely that that the Chinese dependence on imports supplied by both major and small mining companies for their supply of copper , iron ore , or phosphates and potash will diminish substantially in the near future .The prospects for growth in Chinese demand are much more likely .Of the enormous amounts of metals and minerals produced , copper and iron ore alone represent roughly half of the total value created in global metal mining .Chinese iron ore imports amount to over 500 Mt conservatively valued at US$ 50 billion .But there are also other strategic metals such as phosphates and potash which are crucial for the production of fertilizers and hence for Chinese food supplies and which also need to be taken into consideration in this import dependence scenario .The situation where China is dependent on a limited number of major transnational mining companies will therefore continue to be a much more serious risk for international conflicts in the future than the supply of rare earths .It is also important to appreciate as well that North America , Australia , and Europe have their own interests to protect in Africa and Latin America , and much of the anti - Chinese sentiment is driven by these factors .These countries have enjoyed more - or - less unfettered dominance of the African minerals sector for the most part of the 20th century in sourcing cheap raw materials , so the resistance to Chinese competition from these quarters is understandable .However , from the African experience of Chinese mining investments to date , it is clear that there is a dire need for efficient resource administration in order to manage Chinese investment effectively .In South Africa , for example , Chinese investors are aware of this and have been watching regulatory developments with a great deal of interest and concern .Consequently , there is a tendency for Chinese investors to seek control of their investments in the African mining sector .In conclusion , there are many misconceptions concerning the Chinese imperative to ensure security of supply for resources and hence its interest in African resources .It is , however , of major concern for China that it is not to be able to secure its supply of most of the economically important metals and minerals in the way the ' Western ' countries have been able to do for decades .This said , the perceived threat of China to the ' Western ' interests must be seen in its true context .The attempts by the Chinese to invest in new projects or to take control over established transnational mining companies have evoked strong but unjustified political concern in Australia , Canada , and elsewhere that is essence not supported by global production statistics .While these misconceptions are widespread and more often than not unsubstantiated , they are exacerbated by the lack of clear and transparent statistics from China itself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.502544"}

{"text": "Mining .Mining is the first operation in the commercial exploitation of a mineral resource .It can be defined as the act of tunnelling and digging out of the ground in order to recover one or more component parts of the mined material ( Dunster and Dunster , 1996 ) .In broad terms , there are three types of mining : surface , underground and in - situ ( solution mining ) .The latter is somewhat limited in its application , although it is sometimes used to exploit residual mineralisation as grades drop at surface or underground mines .Surface mining is dominated by open pit ( e.g. base and precious metal ore extraction ) or open cast ( e.g. coal operations ) methods .Surface and underground mining usually occur independently of one another ( e.g. the choice of method is \" either / or \" ) although open pit mining does occasionally occur in areas already partly worked by underground methods .Similarly , underground methods are sometimes used to extract ore from beneath , or in the vicinity of , pits where further extension of the pit itself is not economic or technically feasible .Irrespective of the method employed , mining is always accompanied by processing of some description .For relatively pure or homogeneous materials processing may be limited to crushing and sizing ( e.g. some natural zeolite extraction , quarried rock ) or washing ( e.g. some coal operations ) .Simple processing such as this is only possible where the target mineral forms the majority of the material mined .In these cases , the main environmental releases , effects and impacts are associated primarily with the mining itself rather than subsequent processing .However , the major benefit lies in economy of scale , as large capacity earth moving equipment can be used to generate high productivity .Open pit mining .Open pit mining is normally used for steeply dipping beds or veins or for massive irregular deposits .The ore itself is then removed for further processing .The mine shape is formed by a series of benches or terraces arranged in a spiral or in levels with interconnecting ramps .Open - pit mines may reach several thousand feet below the surface .The pit is deepened in a sequential manner using benches that also serve as haulage roads for the removal of ore from the pit .Restoration at the end of the operation can be very expensive particularly if it involves backfilling , as the wastes are often dumped at some distance to avoid obstructing the removal of economic ore .Overburden and waste rock are often used during the operation and closure of a mine ( e.g. inert waste rock for bunding , soils for reclamation at closure ) .However , if they are contaminated with significant concentrations of potentially harmful minerals ( albeit at sub - economic concentrations ) , they must be disposed of as wastes .Open cast mining .In open cast mining , extraction proceeds laterally rather than vertically and this method is therefore most suitable for shallow deposits .A \" strip \" of overburden is first removed to expose the underlying deposit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.41179"}

{"text": "However , sizing is more normally used to split streams with a broad size range into two or more products with a narrower size ranges .These more narrowly sized products are then fed to subsequent processes .Standard separation by size involves sieves , screens , spiral / rake classifiers and thickeners .Classifiers and thickeners work on the principle that in water a larger particle will drop faster , therefore the sediment will contain coarse particles , while the water above it will contain smaller particles ( still in suspension ) .Subsequent separation of the sediment and water ( as a continuous process ) therefore allows particles to be separated by size .However , differences in particle density ( e.g. base metal minerals are typically denser than the major associated gangue minerals ) results in small dense particles having similar settling characteristics to large light particles .Therefore a certain amount of material is misplaced during the separation process , and this can be a source of inefficiency in subsequent processes and increased environmental releases .Separation by size is increasingly conducted using hydrocyclones , which apply centrifugal force to accelarate the settling process .Hydrocyclones require less area than other size separation techniques and by placing them in parallel , very high volumes of slurry can be sized .However , as for the other size separation techniques , different particle densities result in misplaced material ( i.e. the coarse fraction may contain small , but dense , particles ) .Particle density ( gravity concentration ) .The accelerated settling of dense particles relative to lighter particles is used in the process of separation by density .Typical methods employed include dense medium separation , jigs , shaking tables and spiral concentrators .Jigs and shaking tables employ mechanical vibration to accelerate the separation process .As is the case for separation based on size , the similar behaviour of light large particles and small dense particles results in misplaced mineral .However , this can be minimised by using density separation on narrowly sized feeds .Gravity concentration has declined in importance due to the advent of froth flotation ( see below ) .When gravity is applied over flotation , it is normally on the basis of cost , as the minerals liberated at a size above those in the normal flotation range can be concentrated more economically using gravity methods .On the plus side , gravity methods do not have the cost of reagents ( as does flotation ) , are relatively simple to control and produce comparatively little environmental pollution .However , a lack of uniformity in feeding results in substantial failure in operating efficiency and may lead to losses in recovery .Heavy or Dense Media Separation relies on the principle that a thick suspension or pulp of some heavy material ( e.g. ferrosilicon ) in water behaves as a heavy liquid and is normally applied as a preconcentration stage to reject coarser gangue prior to grinding for final liberation .It is also applied in coal preparation to produce a graded end product .Magnetic properties .Selection of different mineral phases can also be achieved by employing the differing magnetic properties of minerals .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.237595"}

Knaut , wrote in an essay , \" Acculturation and Miscegenation : The Changing Face of the Spanish Presence in New Mexico , \" that intermarriage and acculturation not only did not create harmonious relations but actually had helped spur the revolt .His view is that the Pueblos had more reasons to rebel than not .Whatever the case , they did revolt and the Spanish did flee .A dozen years later they were back under the leadership of Diego de Vargas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.78584"}
