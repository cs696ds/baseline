Christopher Stevens asking for increased security .She replied that she was busy and had not read them .I find that inexcusable .Negligence , one hopes , is what Hillary is guilty of in not paying heed to Ambassador Stevens ' cables requesting greater security in Benghazi ; it 's the lesser offense .A darker possibility is that Hillary ignored the cables because it did n't fit her or the president 's worldview .Perhaps Hillary and Obama also feared that a stepped - up American security presence in Benghazi would inflame Muslims .Either way , Ambassador Stevens and three other patriots were killed by a terrorist - led mob on the night of September 11 .The terrorist attack on the Benghazi consulate was known to the CIA , the White House , and the State Department from the get - go , per this report from Fox News .That means Hillary knew in real time , and the president as well .It appears that Ansar Al - Shariah was the militant Muslim group spearheading and inciting the assault .The decision to stand down Special Forces positioned in Tripoli for a rescue attempt in Benghazi had to have originated with the president and among his highest circle , including the secretary of state , whose ambassador was imperiled .That 's all horrible enough , but the subsequent lies , disinformation , and denials are the real nails in Hillary 's political coffin ( right along with the president 's and other key players , as the story continues to unfold and ripen ) .Hillary , with Bill , is first and foremost a political animal .With a presidential election in the offing last autumn , Hillary fully appreciated that the president could ill - afford admitting a terrorist attack on the Benghazi consulate .The president was astutely aware of the political fallout in what was then considered a near - toss up presidential contest with Mitt Romney .For Hillary , had Mr. Obama lost reelection in November , a big contributable factor would have been the Muslim terror assault on the U.S. consulate .A good share of the blame would have fallen on Hillary , damaging her badly .It 's fair speculation that the president and Hillary hoped the Benghazi attack would not result in fatalities , permitting them to more easily spin the story .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.39998"}

Dayton gotten briefed lately on the state of identification databases in Syria lately ?If he has n't , how would he know that the vetting infrastructure is reliable ?Is he just trusting President Obama ?If that 's the case , would he trust a Republican president the same way in the same circumstances ?Finally , Gov.

Rice .She was chosen to make the rounds of all five network Sunday morning news programs on Sept. 16 .She reinforced the false narrative that Mrs. Clinton first pushed out publicly four days before in a joint Rose Garden appearance with Mr. Obama .State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland was evidently among those involved in massaging 12 different versions of \" talking points \" upon which intelligence officials drew to misleadingly brief the Congress .Mrs. Rice also used such guidance to justify the fraud that YouTube , not jihad , was responsible for the violence in Benghazi .Mrs. Clinton 's chief of staff , Cheryl Mills , was formerly in charge of managing so - called bimbo eruptions during Bill Clinton 's 1992 run for the White House and while he was in office .According to one of last week 's witnesses , Gregory Hicks - who became the chief of mission in Libya after his boss , Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens , was killed during the attack , Ms. Mills has lately been suppressing equally unwanted eruptions concerning Benghazi .She upbraided the diplomat for challenging the party line about what happened then and thereafter .She also reportedly sought to interfere with a congressional investigation into the matter .Mr. Hicks thinks he was demoted in retaliation for posing such unwelcome questions .Curiously , the truth that has finally begun to emerge has yet to shed light on the involvement of two other women who almost certainly were players before , during and after the Benghazi attacks .The first is Valerie Jarrett .She is Mr. Obama 's longtime consigliere .Such is her relationship with him and the first lady that she is permitted to involve herself in virtually all portfolios , including the most sensitive foreign affairs and national security ones .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.99754"}

Ted Cruz and Donald Trump .Good luck finding anything else on which they agree .The immediate cause of this debate is Syrian President Bashar al - Assad : Should the U.S. be trying to unseat him , so that everyone can then focus efforts on destroying the Islamic State , or ISIS , caliphate that 's been established on Syrian territory ?Or has recent history shown that throwing out thugs and dictators like him merely opens the doors for the kind of chaos that sucks in American troops and creates problems worse than the ones the U.S. was trying to solve ?But this is hardly an argument about Syria alone .This may sound like a repeat of the debate over the realpolitik approach that Henry Kissinger and others took in the 1970s .The essence of realpolitik was that the U.S. should live and even work with unsavory characters if doing so served America 's national interests .But the new debate over regime change is different in one important respect .The argument over realpolitik was in many ways a moral one : Did the U.S. have an obligation to try to force out , say , tin - pot dictators in Latin America who committed human - rights abuses yet served American interests by standing against the spread of communism ?The debate about regime change today is less about morality than about practical results .Those supporting regime change are arguing less that it 's the morally correct stand , but rather that getting rid of hated dictators who are feeding extremist anger through their brutality enhances stability and therefore American interests in the long run .The thugs , the argument goes , are merely sitting on kegs of dynamites that will explode with greater force the longer they stay there .Those who are against regime change argue that the stability those dictators provide is better for American interests than the leap into the unknown , and the resentment that arises within the local populace , when American force is used to expel them .To these skeptics , the chaos in Libya today and the bloody , decade - long occupation of Iraq illustrate that the dangers in regime change are real , while the rewards can be illusory .Better to keep the dictators in their box than to open Pandora 's box by ousting them .That argument was made forcefully in last week 's Republican debate by Sen. Ted Cruz : \" Assad is a bad man .Gadhafi was a bad man .Mubarak had a terrible human - rights record .But they were assisting us - at least Gadhafi and Mubarak - in fighting radical Islamic terrorists .And if we topple Assad , the result will be ISIS will take over Syria , and it will worsen U.S. national - security interests .Mr. Trump declared that \" we ca n't be fighting Assad .And when you 're fighting Assad , you are fighting Russia , you 're fighting a lot of different groups .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "69.43986"}

{"text": "Those problems are real but the wall is a non - solution .By the same logic , why would we not need a wall on our Canadien border ?The wall idea is a fundamentally irrational response to a complicated series of problems .The wall idea also reflects an utter lack of understanding of the history of immigration on our southern border .In her book , Undocumented , Aviva Chomsky explains how for much of U.S. history the border between Mexico and the U.S. was virtually unpoliced and migration flowed freely .U.S. business interests , especially agribusiness , relied on cheap , migrant Mexican labor to pick crops .Agribusiness still relies on these seasonal workers .Our Mexican immigration policy has been largely dictated by the needs of American business which wanted the economic development of the Southwest .Categorizing Mexican immigrants as \" illegal \" did not begin until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 when , for the first time , numerical limits were placed on Mexican migration .Even for 20 years after that immigration rules were relatively slack .Ironically , it was not until the middle 1980 's , that the number of undocumented immigrants precipitously rose after the U.S. began to try to seal the border .As Chomsky points out , this was in large part due to the fact that migrants felt compelled to stay after a season of work since they realized returning would now be more difficult .Before 1965 , the earlier waves of deportation directed against Mexicans in the 1930 's and 1950 's had nothing to do with their being undocumented .Entry then was restricted on the grounds of indigence and concerns that Mexicans would become public charges .Since the 1990 's , the Latino threat narrative has been manipulated and promoted by right wing politicians .They hope to channel national anxieties about economic inequality , job loss , and a worsening economic future away from their real causes .I see two political purposes behind the current Mexican wall idea .First , it is an effort to rabble rouse the most angry , racist , and xenophobic Americans , especially those with the least informed understanding of immigration matters .Second , it is an effort at blame - shifting .Migrants from Latin America who leave terrible situations to try and make a better life for themselves in another country did not shift good jobs out of the United States .It is the billionaire class in America which sold out American workers by shipping jobs out of the country in an effort to find cheap labor elsewhere .For those who are looking to blame someone , our American plutocrats are a good place to begin .There is something sinister about billionaires , ensconced in a life of luxury , using their hired and paid for right wing politicians to point the finger of blame at some of the poorest people on the planet .The Mexican border wall would cost a fortune , would predictably not work , would damage wilderness , and would act to poison relations with one of our closest neighbors and trading partners .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.60607"}

{"text": "It is significant that the Republicans have not pointed out what is wrong with the expansion as it currently functions .One observation I would make about the Republican bill : it does not recognize the degree of poverty poor people face .The overriding brutal fact of life for people living at or close to the federal poverty level is lack of income which leads to choices about what bills get paid .Basic necessities like housing , utilities , and food can reduce available cash to zero .Other costs like child care or transportation are necessary for employment .If money is short , preventing homelessness or repairing one 's car to get to and from work is likely a higher value than paying medical premiums .Experience has shown that low - income people are very sensitive to even nominal increases in medical out - of - pocket costs .There is a wealth of research supporting that conclusion .I would cite the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured .In February 2013 , they produced an overview of research findings relative to premiums and cost - sharing in Medicaid .The Kaiser Commission concluded that premiums act as a barrier to obtaining and maintaining coverage for low - income populations .It is common for premiums to result in coverage loss and the elimination of access to needed care , leading to adverse health consequences .State savings from cost - sharing and premiums are due more to eligible people dropping or declining coverage than to increases in state revenue .Significantly , early results from states charging premiums to Medicaid expansion enrollees indicate that the administrative cost of collection exceeds any money actually realized from the premiums .One would hope the Republican leadership would familiarize itself with the substantive research showing why premiums in Medicaid are generally seen as a failure .Their current bill appears to be more rooted in political posturing than evidence - based public policy .No doubt party positions will evolve as the legislative session unfolds .Recognizing the paramount importance of maintaining the Medicaid expansion , I , for one , hope the parties can reach a fair compromise .The Medicaid expansion , which helps so many , deserves better than to be reduced to a political game .In the last week , I got to visit my son Josh and his wife Nancy in Los Angeles where they live .We did get around .Here is my selection of best places we got to : .The Last Bookstore Located in downtown L.A. in a space that used to be a bank , this bookstore , ironically named , has volume .The place is kind of dark , poorly lit , but there are many new and used books .I did n't have enough time to look around that much but the literature and classic literature section were especially large .It looked like they put counterculture , aliens , and horror all in the same bank vault - an interesting commingling .I found a good book on Latino history by Juan Gonzalez titled Harvest of Empire .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.73723"}

{"text": "On the Republican side , Mr. Trump , hardly a movement conservative over the course of his peripatetic political history , now is trying to sound like one .The challenge , though , comes after the primaries , when nominees have to try to activate that quiet political center for the general election - and when the next president has to do so to sell policies crafted by the next administration .GDP Estimates Move Lower Following Durables Report .At first glance , today 's Commerce Department report on durable goods looks solid : Orders for long - lasting , factory - made items rose 9.9 % in September from a month earlier , a big rebound from the 13.1 % drop in August .But the rise was largely due to a rebound in commercial aircraft orders , which tend to swing from month to month .Details within the report were discouraging - and could point to a weaker - than - expected figure in Friday 's much - anticipated report on third - quarter gross domestic product .Perhaps most concerning : Business investment has fallen over the last three months .Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft - a proxy for business spending on equipment and software - were flat in September , after rising a bleak 0.2 % in August and falling 5.6 % in July .Shipments of those goods have fallen in each of the past three months .Until now , business investment , while hardly robust , has helped the economy grow .Last year , such spending accounted for nearly half - 0.8 percentage point - of the 1.8 % growth in the nation 's GDP , according to Stephen Stanley , economist at consultancy Pierpont Securities LLC .But Thursday 's figures have Mr. Stanley and other economists predicting that business spending was so weak over the summer that it may actually have held back the economy - acting as a \" drag \" in economist speak - rather than helped it .The consensus estimate of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires is that Friday 's report will show the economy grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.8 % in the July - to - September quarter .But after Thursday 's figures on business investment , some economists said they are bracing for a weaker GDP report than the consensus figure .Wells Fargo - pointing out that shipments of core capital goods fell at an annual pace of 4.9 % over three months - lowered its estimate of third - quarter GDP growth to an annual rate of 1.4 % from 1.6 % .J.P. Morgan Chase lowered its forecast to 1.6 % from 1.8 % .The downside risks are mounting to our already below - consensus estimate that GDP increased by only 1.3 % in the third quarter , \" Paul Ashworth , chief U.S. economist at London - based Capital Economics , said in a note to clients .\" At 1.8 % , the consensus forecast looks way to high .Mr. Ashworth , in addition to citing the weak business - spending numbers , pointed to a modest rise in durable - goods inventories as another possible sign that third - quarter GDP growth could be weaker than most economists expect .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.186325"}

Richard Burr ( R. , N.C. ) .\" What else is going through Congress ?Nothing .If the president and speaker ca n't cut a deal on the earned income tax credit , the next president may seek a different approach .Republican candidates do n't talk about the credit much on the campaign trail , where they emphasize lower tax rates and a simpler tax system .Front - Runners Give Ground as Rivals Make Mark in Iowa .Ted Cruz did what he had to do .Donald Trump fell well short of the shock - and - awe moment he hoped would set up a blitz through the rest of the country .Marco Rubio bought himself a big seat at the big table .And Hillary Clinton flirted all night with disaster .Those were the big story lines that emerged from Iowa 's caucuses Monday night .It 's early - ridiculously early , actually - to draw too many conclusions .But the results suggested that a fight still lies ahead on the Democratic side , and a potentially much bigger and longer is ahead on the Republican one .Perhaps most important , the Iowa results suggest that those fights will take place in two parties deeply divided between insiders and outsiders , between young and old , and between the most and least wealthy .The situation is volatile , and , as a consequence , unpredictable .By late last night , it was clear that Mr. Cruz rode his strong support among evangelical conservatives to a victory .He had to do that to be a viable long - term candidate ; if he could n't charge ahead in a state where evangelical voters traditionally have an outsize influence , his candidacy would have been seriously compromised .Mr. Trump calculated that he could make a late surge in Iowa , put away Mr. Cruz and pave the way for a big win in New Hampshire to start putting away the competition .That did n't happen .His brand has been that he is a winner ; it remains to be seen what the Iowa outcome does to that brand .On the other hand , Mr. Rubio simply needed to do well enough to establish himself as the third player in a three - handed game of high - stakes poker going forward .He did more than that - much more , in fact .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.218994"}

{"text": "And the government should give it to them .And they will vote for this president no matter what ....These are people who pay no income tax .The horserace implications of this statement are what the chattering class is chattering about .Unfortunately , they 're also unknowable at this point .On the other hand , Romney is disparaging folks whose votes he 's already written off .So let 's set that speculation aside and look at who the people are who actually pay no income tax .Romney 's statements are a little unclear , but it appears that the 47 percent figure represents all of those who pay no income tax , rather than the Democratic base .His problem is that those people are disproportionately in red states -- that is , states that tend to vote Republican : .One important note about these numbers : This measures only those Americans who filed for taxes with no liability .Millions more did n't even file ; it 's those millions , added to the estimated 52 million here , who combine to make that 47 percent .It 's important to remember that just because people are n't paying income tax does n't mean they 're not paying taxes -- they pay federal payroll taxes and state and local sales taxes , for example .Once those taxes are factored in , the tax regime is basically flat .And the reason that most income tax nonpayers do n't pay is they simply do n't make enough income to qualify to pay .As one might expect , the map of states with the highest poverty levels resembles this map fairly closely .Many of them are also seniors , a highly contested voting bloc .Just more than 10 percent of households pay no income tax because they 're retired .They might also be voters in places like Florida who are already jumpy about the changes to Medicare and Medicaid that the Romney - Ryan ticket has proposed -- although they would be mostly unaffected by those reforms .So Romney appears to be wrong about these voters .But if calling for a less progressive taxation system was enough to alienate poor voters in the Deep South , the Republican Party would have already lost its stronghold there .Update : My colleague Derek Thompson picks up the baton from me and digs deeper into the demographics of the so - called 47 percent .One important note he makes is that it 's often the lowest - income people in these red states who are most likely to vote Democratic -- it 's just that the rest of the population is conservative enough to carry the states into the Republican column .In 2008 , Obama lost Georgia by 5 percentage points but he won 70 % of voters who earned less than $ 30,000 -- which is precisely the demo most likely to owe no federal income tax .Obama lost Mississippi by 14 percentage points , but picked up 66 % of voters who earned less than $ 30,000 .As a general rule , Republicans win among richer voters -- both in the red states and the blue .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.133385"}

Rubio to nearly a huge upset and forcing the Donald to a potential third place finish .That is breathing life into a campaign that really needs it .Ted Cruz went one way too long in his victory speech .And while his religious references did not bother me , I thought about the rest of the nation and places that would be totally turned off by such overt Christianity .Sen.
