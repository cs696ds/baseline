{"text": "Forecasters of Maduro 's political swansong ignored three key elements to understand where Venezuela is right now : the source of the president 's legitimacy ; the high support he retains ; and a weak opposition incapable of democratically channelling existing discontent .In April 2013 , Maduro was elected with 50.61 % of the vote , only 1.49 % ahead of opposition leader Henrique Capriles .These results were disappointing for the opposition bloc .After Hugo Ch\u00e1vez 's death a month earlier , they had considered their political rivals mortally wounded in electoral terms .Ignoring the reports of national and international observers who backed the transparency of the election , the opposition was reluctant to recognise Maduro 's legitimacy .They requested an audit , which confirmed the initial result .The opposition validated the result by turning to preparations for the municipal elections in December 2013 .The economy was weakening after years of extraordinary growth .Inflation , nearing 50 % in a country chronically affected by this problem , brought extra burdens on the popular classes .Despite these circumstances and rising concerns about corruption within sectors of the government , pro - government candidates won a sweeping victory in the municipal elections .Voters opted for candidates associated with a project that , warts and all , has demonstrated a commitment to redistributive policies and social rights .The opposition lacked a clear alternative project .Opposition has dubious record .The opposition remains fragmented .This is largely due to a weak leadership , which over the past 15 years has ambiguously oscillated between electorally competing with the government and supporting extra - institutional adventures to oust elected presidents .The opposition did the latter when it supported a military coup against Ch\u00e1vez in 2002 and an oil industry lockout in 2003 .In 2005 , it disbanded before the National Assembly elections .The opposition has repeatedly questioned electoral results not in its favour .To add to its dilemma , the opposition has often turned towards the United States for guidance and financial assistance .This move has reinforced government legitimacy due to strong nationalist sentiments in the country .In the past few weeks , the opposition leadership fell into an old trap by not clearly disassociating itself from violent protesters .Government buildings , private property , public transport and police vehicles were destroyed .Actions such as the blocking of roads not only angered commuters , but also indirectly contributed to the country 's death toll by obstructing people 's access to medical treatment .On a couple of occasions , snipers assassinated citizens who tried to clear the barricades to facilitate transit .These actions seriously alienated sectors of the opposition base that do not support violent practices .A large challenge for the Maduro administration will come now from the trial of Leopoldo L\u00f3pez , the hard right - wing opposition leader at the centre of the protests .Calling on people to \" show their rage \" against the government , his main message was that protests must continue until Maduro resigns .Whether the attorney - general can put together a compelling case connecting L\u00f3pez to the violence remains to be seen .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.191185"}
