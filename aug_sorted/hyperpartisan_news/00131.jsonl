{"text": "Dare to be bold In creating Panera Cares , we essentially built a voting booth to determine whether people who had the means to pay more would do so .So many people told us , when we first started out , that the vast majority would vote \" no .\" What joy we took in proving them wrong .Conventional wisdom held that \" giving away food \" would sink Panera Cares and damage Panera itself .We could never understand such thinking .Panera Cares was a bold experiment with an audacious goal- and no downside .If it failed , like so many experiments often do , so what ?We 'd have tried something that was worth doing , at no material cost to the company .We thumbed our noses at conventional wisdom , and instead took an unconventional path .We proved that a brand - name restaurant company could sustain a business that serves nearly one million people annually , all while letting the people set the price .Be provocative We had another motive in creating Panera Cares , beyond confronting food insecurity in America .We also hoped to inspire or if necessary provoke other companies to contribute to society in a way that goes beyond philanthropy , and instead harnesses those non - renewable resources - their time and know - how - to directly address the world 's inequities .For every vital service now being provided by a not - for - profit or government entity in this country , there almost certainly is a large corporation with the skills , experience , and the scale to vastly improve and increase the capacities of those organizations .Imagine if Wal - Mart ran distribution for food shelters .Or if Gap opened thrift shops .Or if Home Depot rehabilitated housing in underprivileged neighborhoods .Are there other \" conscious capitalists \" who are willing to get their hands dirty so as to positively impact the world ?Of course there are , and many got to work long before we did .But given the past few years ' business scandals and economic hardships , we hope many more will step up to the challenge .2 Comments .Now I know why we like to eat at Panera ! :-)As for peoples ' appearance , just do n't judge .Many years ago I was a computer salesperson in the Silicon Valley .A scruffy old man came into the store , looking something like a bum .Most of the sales reps studiously ignored him , but something about his demeanor was at odds with his appearance .I approached him and asked what he was interested in , discovering that he was looking for a computer so he could design and build software to help run his stud horse ranch in Mendocino County .It turns out he was the multi - millionaire owner / founder of Arabian Horse World magazine , rancher , and engineer ... Needless to say , he became one of my best customers , and friends .So , do n't judge the book by its cover .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "125.356895"}
