Amos Yadlin weighed in .The problem , he goes on , is that there is too little trust that the United States will act .Then , in addition to words , \" actions should be taken to show that you 're serious ... in order to demonstrate to the world more clearly that you 're really training for this and preparing for this .\" That shows that you really do n't mean to do it . \" Yadlin wants Israel to delay a decision and wants the United States to take a tougher line .He concludes that \" even if the batteries of trust are not full , a public commitment and a legal commitment , like a letter to Congress , would help a great deal toward the correct decision being taken in Israel . \" Yadlin is at bottom right .The refusal of President Obama to make a categorical statement that Iran will be prevented from getting a nuclear weapon suggests that he is keeping his options open .Mr. Obama has said , \" My policy here is not going to be one of containment .My policy is prevention of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons , \" adding that , \" When I say all options are on the table , I mean it .\" On the other hand , no president is going to promise in August 2012 to undertake a military strike precisely \" by the summer of 2013 . \" Yadlin 's goals are clear , but his methods wo n't work in the American political and constitutional context .The idea of an Obama visit to Israel in the weeks just before , much less just after , the Democratic party convention is unrealistic ; the time for Obama to do that is long past .More persuasive than the Ross or Yadlin proposals would be an effort by the president to seek a formal authorization for the use of force from Congress .This is the way for him to show seriousness of purpose , and for Congress to support it - and send an unmistakable message to the ayatollahs .This path was suggested here in THE WEEKLY STANDARD early July , by Jamie Fly and Bill Kristol , and this is the moment to move forward with it .It would be to prevent Iran - the world 's foremost state sponsor of terrorism , in violation of countless U.N. Security Council and IAEA board of governors resolutions , and under international sanctions - from obtaining nuclear weapons .Such a proposal by President Obama would be controversial , and many Democrats would vote against him .( There is precedent for this : In the 1991 Gulf resolution , 45 Democrats in the Senate voted against the resolution and only 10 voted for it , and it passed only 52 - 47 ; in the House 86 Democrats voted yes and 179 voted no . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.94513"}

Bush that ended U.S. restrictions on India 's civilian nuclear power program , and allowed India to begin purchasing uranium on the international market .Indeed , by allowing India to buy uranium on the open market , the pact will let India divert all of its domestic uranium supplies to weapons production .That would allow it to produce up to 1,000 warheads , making it the third largest arsenal in the world behind the United States and Russia .Of course there was a price for these agreements : India had to vote to drag Iran before the Security Council .The Americans were quite clear that failure to join in on the White House 's jihad against Teheran meant the agreements would go on ice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.53394"}

{"text": "Q : I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about you had maintained this strong P5 + 1 consensus on this deal .SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL : As you know , this is a deal that has the full support of the international community through the P5 + 1 .It will be memorialized in a U.N. Security Council resolution .It achieves the basic objectives that were set out in terms of preventing Iran from being able to obtain a nuclear weapon , ensuring that its program is for peaceful purposes .I think it 's very important to note one of the comments the President made in his remarks , which is that some people have put forward the notion that we should not pursue this deal , but we should rather simply pursue additional sanctions .In the first instance , we believe that history shows that when we just walk away from the table and impose sanctions , that in no way serves as a check on Iran 's nuclear program .They steadily advanced their nuclear program under sanctions .Ultimately , sanctions helped pressure them back to the table , but keep in mind , before the Joint Plan of Action , they were accumulating more stockpiles ; they we 're installing more centrifuges ; they were developing more advanced centrifuges .And that was happening while they were being sanctioned .So sanctions alone did not prevent them from making progress .Sanctions could get them to the table to get this deal .And this is the fundamental point .The purpose of the sanctions was to get this deal .They were imposed for nuclear - related purposes .So , of course , they are going to receive sanctions relief .But the whole purpose was rooted in our strategic decision that it was important to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and that that was our principal priority .Because all the other things that Iran does that concerns us would be far more dangerous if they had a nuclear weapon .And I say that because if there was a decision taken by Congress to kill this deal , there is not a scenario that anybody could see whereby the rest of the world would sign up for additional sanctions .The world has had to make significant sacrifices , in some cases , to reduce their purchase of Iranian oil .They did that in support of this negotiation .So when we went around to Europe , to China , to India , to South Korea , to Japan , and got them and others to reduce their purchases of Iranian oil , the express purpose of that effort was to get this deal .So if , having gotten this deal , we then kill it , it is hard to see why those countries would then go back along with additional sanctions .Again , the world signed up for sanctions to get a deal .We have a deal .It 's a good deal .It will be endorsed by the world via the U.N. Security Council resolution .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.66286"}
