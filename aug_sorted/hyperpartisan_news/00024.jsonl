Chris Christie , a Republican .There is nothing independent voters like more than bipartisan cooperation .The president also controls the levers of power .Two key decisions Obama made this year demonstrate the advantages a sitting president has in a re - election race .During the summer , Obama issued an executive order allowing children of illegal immigrants to obtain a visa , permitting them to live and work in the U.S. legally for two years , if they meet certain criteria .Obviously , this type of action was unavailable to a challenger who has no ability to set policy until he is elected .Again , the president used the power and prestige of his office to hand an important symbolic victory to a key constituency .Since 1964 , presidents who have made it to the general election without facing an intra - party challenge have gone on to win .Ladies and gentlemen , meet Barack Obama .Republicans spent the entire year telling everyone that the 2012 race was exactly like the 1980 campaign when Ronald Reagan ousted President Carter .The comparison was wrong .Jimmy Carter was weakened by a strong primary challenge from Ted Kennedy .Obama had clear sailing to his re - nomination while Romney , as a member of the party out of power , naturally had to fight and scratch to secure the Republican nod .Page 2 of 2 - It seems like Republicans tried to fool themselves all the way through Nov. 6 .In the real world ( where Republican prognosticators never seem to tread ) , Obama won a slim popular vote majority while taking Romney to the cleaners in the Electoral College .Most of the pollsters had a great night .A majority of pre - election polls showed Obama with a slim national lead and an even more comfortable advantage in the Electoral College .The final numbers practically mirrored the final polls : With a few votes left to count , Obama is ahead by about 3 million votes nationally , and after adding Florida to his column , will defeat Romney in the Electoral College 332 - 206 .Trump tweeted incorrectly at about 11:30 election night that Romney was the popular vote winner .Donald Trump is a sham and a travesty .Trump aside , there were plenty of people shocked at the final results of the presidential election .Romney supporters thought they detected an undercurrent of movement toward the Republican nominee in the final days of the race .They noted Romney was attracting the largest and most enthusiastic crowds of his entire campaign in the last days before the election .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.93295"}

Michele Bachmann ran competitively against Obama in the Hawkeye State , trailing 47 percent to 42 percent .The July Granite State Poll pegs the president 's approval at 46 percent among New Hampshire voters , with 49 percent disapproving .A separate robo - poll conducted this month by Democratic - aligned Public Policy Polling shows him trailing Romney in the state , 46 percent to 44 percent .The fact that both states handed significant victories to Republicans in 2010 is attributable to this as well , and also makes the President 's standing in the polls there not entirely surprising .Nonetheless , there 's plenty in this for Obama to be worried about .He won election in 2008 by winning in battleground states like Ohio and Virginia , and by turning several traditionally Republican states like North Carolina and Indiana to the Democratic column .Depending how you run the numbers , it would take as little as 7 or 8 states flipping from blue to red for Obama to go from the 365 Electoral Votes he won in 2008 to under the 270 needed to win the election .Unless the economy improves greatly , and assuming the GOP does n't go completely off the rails in its nomination process , I would say that the Electoral College battleground is going to be a lot tougher for the President than some are anticipating .Obama won the Electoral College handily in 2008 , 365 - 173 .By flipping Pennsylvania , Ohio , Florida , Indiana , Colorado , Virginia , Nevada , and Wisconsin , Republicans edge Obama 295 - 243 .Swapping Florida for North Carolina still produces a 281 - 257 win for Republicans .Winning Michigan and conceding Colorado makes it 288 - 250 Republicans .It strikes me that each of these states are ones that a Republican candidate could conceivably win in 2012 depending on the economic conditions .If I were in the Obama campaign , I 'd be studying the map carefully , and worrying a little .Related Posts : .About Doug Mataconis Doug holds a B.A. in Political Science from Rutgers University and J.D. from George Mason University School of Law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.70795"}
