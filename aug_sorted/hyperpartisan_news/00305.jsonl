How was the strike launched ? A. The Defense Ministry said the missiles were fired from four ships in the Caspian Sea and flew across Iran and northern Iraq to reach their targets .Russia has maintained a naval flotilla in the Caspian - which is landlocked from the rest of the world 's seas - for nearly 300 years .The flotilla currently has no aircraft carriers or other large capital ships , but it has frigates and Buyan - class missile corvettes , including two that were commissioned just last year , the Grad Sviyazhsk and the Veliky Ustyug .Those two ships reportedly fired cruise missiles at sea targets during a major naval exercise last month .Q.

Bush 's approval ratings soared after the United States ' victory in the Persian Gulf War .Democrats ' high point came in 2008 , in the final year of George W. Bush 's administration and the year Barack Obama was first elected president .However , the three - point Democratic advantage for all of 2014 obscures the change that occurred during the year .On a quarterly basis , Democrats started out 2014 with a five - point edge , similar to their advantage in 2013 .That dipped to two points by the third quarter .In the fourth quarter , likely in response to Republicans ' success in the 2014 midterm elections , Republicans held a slight advantage of one point .Since 2008 , Americans have been increasingly reluctant to identify with either the Republican or Democratic Party , and now a record 43 % claimed political independence in 2014 .Given historical trends , 2015 could bring a new record , as the percentage identifying as independents typically increases in the year before a presidential election , averaging a 2.5-point increase in the last six such years .Although Democrats typically have an advantage in partisanship , that edge shrunk in 2014 and in the last months of the year the parties were essentially on equal footing .With each party controlling part of the federal government - Democrats the presidency and Republicans the Congress - they each will have a say in how the nation addresses its major challenges in the coming year .However , in recent years divided control of government has more often than not resulted in partisan gridlock , and Americans ' frustration with the frequent political stalemate is evident .Continued frustration with the government would likely encourage more Americans to identify as independents this year .Survey Methods .Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted January - December 2014 , with a combined random sample of 16,479 adults , aged 18 and older , living in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia .For results based on the total sample of national adults , the margin of sampling error is \u00b11 percentage point at the 95 % confidence level .All reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting .Each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of 50 % cellphone respondents and 50 % landline respondents , with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region .Landline and cellular telephone numbers are selected using random - digit - dial methods .New Emails Reveal Obama White House Worked on Concocting Benghazi Lie DURING the Attacks .The still classified Obama State Department email , according to Issa , shows that the Obama White House rushed to settle on the false narrative of the anti - Islamic YouTube video instigating the attacks , which was completely at odds with the conclusions reached by reports from the ground .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.49058"}

Bush 's approval ratings soared after the United States ' victory in the Persian Gulf War .Democrats ' high point came in 2008 , in the final year of George W.

{"text": "The decline in identification with both parties in recent years comes as dissatisfaction with government has emerged as one of the most important problems facing the country , according to Americans .This is likely due to the partisan gridlock that has come from divided party control of the federal government .Trust in the government to handle problems more generally is the lowest Gallup has measured to date , and Americans ' favorable ratings of both parties are at or near historical lows .Thus , the rise in U.S. political independence likely flows from the high level of frustration with the government and the political parties that control it .Democrats ' Edge in Party Identification and Leaning Shrinks .Although independents claim no outright allegiance to either major party , it is well - known that they are not necessarily neutral when it comes to politics .When pressed , most independents will say they lean to one of the two major parties .For example , last year an average of 17 % of Americans who initially identified as independents subsequently said they \" leaned \" Republican , 15 % were independents who leaned Democratic , with the remaining 11 % not expressing a leaning to either party .In 2014 , an average 45 % of Americans identified as Democrats or said they were Democratic - leaning independents , while 42 % identified as Republicans or were Republican - leaning independents .That the three - point Democratic edge was down from six points in 2013 , and among Democrats ' smaller advantages the past 25 years .Democrats usually hold an advantage in this combined measure of party affiliation .In fact , the only year Republicans held a notable edge since Gallup began tracking independents ' political leanings was in 1991 , the year Republican President George H.W. Bush 's approval ratings soared after the United States ' victory in the Persian Gulf War .Democrats ' high point came in 2008 , in the final year of George W. Bush 's administration and the year Barack Obama was first elected president .However , the three - point Democratic advantage for all of 2014 obscures the change that occurred during the year .On a quarterly basis , Democrats started out 2014 with a five - point edge , similar to their advantage in 2013 .That dipped to two points by the third quarter .In the fourth quarter , likely in response to Republicans ' success in the 2014 midterm elections , Republicans held a slight advantage of one point .Since 2008 , Americans have been increasingly reluctant to identify with either the Republican or Democratic Party , and now a record 43 % claimed political independence in 2014 .Given historical trends , 2015 could bring a new record , as the percentage identifying as independents typically increases in the year before a presidential election , averaging a 2.5-point increase in the last six such years .Although Democrats typically have an advantage in partisanship , that edge shrunk in 2014 and in the last months of the year the parties were essentially on equal footing .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.768684"}

{"text": "STORY HIGHLIGHTS .Average 45.9 % approval similar to 46.1 % in prior quarter .PRINCETON , N.J. - President Barack Obama 's job approval rating in his 27 th quarter in office , from July 20 to Oct. 19 , averaged 45.9 % , essentially unchanged from his 46.1 % average for the prior quarter .Obama 's daily approval ratings also varied little within his most recent quarter , averaging 46 % nearly every week during the quarter .There were just two modest but notable exceptions .In late August , as U.S. stocks fell in response to concerns about problems in the Chinese economy , his weekly approval rating dipped to 44 % .And in late September it rose to 48 % during the week of Pope Francis ' U.S. trip , which included a widely covered visit with Obama at the White House .Since he became president nearly seven years ago , Obama has averaged 47 % job approval .There have been only five quarters when he had majority approval , with four of those occurring during the first year of his presidency , the so - called \" honeymoon phase \" when new presidents tend to be rated positively .The only other time Obama 's quarterly approval exceeded 50 % was perhaps the most consequential one - the 16 th quarter , in which he was re - elected .Obama 's 27 th Quarter Midrange Compared With Other Presidents .Obama is the sixth post - World War II president to serve a 27 th quarter in office .Two of these - Dwight Eisenhower and Bill Clinton - were rated quite positively at this stage in their presidencies , with average approval ratings of 65.3 % and 59.7 % , respectively .In contrast , Harry Truman ( 23.0 % ) and George W. Bush ( 33.2 % ) were decidedly unpopular at the same point of their presidencies .Truman 's 27 th quarter average is the worst quarterly average for any president in Gallup 's polling history .Obama 's 27 th quarter average , along with Ronald Reagan 's , is between these two extremes .Reagan averaged 47.0 % approval , slightly better than Obama 's 45.9 % .After presidents have served nearly seven years in office , Americans ' opinions of them are pretty well - established and unlikely to change unless a major international or domestic crisis occurs .Clinton 's and Bush 's approval ratings did not change between their 27 th and 28 th quarters .Truman , Eisenhower and Reagan saw modest improvements of a few percentage points .Implications .Americans ' opinions of Obama have been steady this year , holding near 46 % .Obama 's relatively low approval ratings may be as much a function of the era in which he is governing as it is a reflection on his leadership , management and decision - making .There have been relatively few international crises that helped to boost his public support , as the 9/11 attacks and Iraq War did for Bush , and as similar crises have done for other presidents .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.112625"}
