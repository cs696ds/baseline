Bernie Sanders .More than one in three ( 34 percent ) of all New Hampshire Democratic primary voters said that honesty was the most important trait in their decision on which candidate to support .Of that bloc , Sanders won 92 percent of their votes as compared to just 6 percent for Clinton .\" Bottom line , Hillary Clinton has proven that female politicians can be just as despicable as male politicians .Collins writes : . \"Strong as the emotions are in the Clinton and Sanders camps , both sides have to feel sort of chipper when they look over at the Republicans , who are engaged in something between professional wrestling and Godzilla Versus Rodan .\" In fact , the real battle between Godzilla and Rodan will arrive if Hillary is nominated by the Democrats and runs against Trump in November .And in this case , no matter what comes next , everybody 's a ... loser .\" Clinton 's gender indeed matters .Just as you could n't properly evaluate Obama 's arc without factoring in race , you ca n't see her accurately without recognizing that she 's a woman of her time , with all the attendant obstacles , hurts , compromises and tenacity .That informs - and , ideally , illuminates - her perspective .And her presidency would carry a powerful , constructive symbolism that ca n't and should n't be ignored .But those are considerations among many , many others in taking her measure and in casting a vote .To focus only or primarily on them is more reductive than respectful , and to tell women in particular what kind of politics they should practice is the antithesis of feminism , which advocates independence and choices .\" Thank you , Frank !", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.573227"}

{"text": "But the shipment was one of many which did not show on any official Government list of shipments .In June 1975 , Mr. Edward Durell and my other associates were able to confront officials of the United States Mint with this example of missing shipments , and for once the confrontation took place under circumstances in which the Mint was under great pressure to respond .In the most specific terms the Bureau of the Mint was asked what was shipped out of Fort Knox in the four tractor - trailers on January 20 , 1965 .The written answer dated June 19 , 1975 came from the then Director of the United States Mint , Mrs. Mary Brooks .She confirmed that this unlisted shipment amounted to more than one and three - quarter ( 1 - 3/4 ) million ounces of gold -- and , my friends , it was not junk gold melted down from old coins which were confiscated from Americans in 1934 .The shipment was part of America 's true monetary gold , good delivery gold which is .995 fine or better .After this admission in writing about an enormous secret shipment of gold out of Fort Knox , one would have thought that there would be fireworks , but not so !My friend Mr. Durell showered the appropriate officials throughout the Government with this evidence of massive fraud at Fort Knox , and he notified the major media and all of the appropriate leaders in Congress about this evidence .For reasons which I will explain later in this message , I believe it 's time to call attention to one of these people .He is Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin , Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee .Proxmire loves to parade as a great defender of our financial interests in Washington .He 's famous for his so - called \" Golden Fleece Award .\" Proxmire searches through the Federal Budget with a fine - tooth comb , and he 's always able to find some project or contract which rightly or wrongly will look ridiculous to the public .He then trots it out , announces how much it costs , and with a great flourish gives it his Golden Fleece Award .By this and other means Proxmire is a master at maintaining his image as a protector of the American economy .But if ever a situation deserved the Proxmire Golden Fleece Award , it is the FORT KNOX GOLD SCANDAL .The petty examples usually chosen by Proxmire fleece the American public out of perhaps hundreds of thousands or a few million dollars .It makes good publicity for Proxmire , but it 's insignificant .By contrast , the Fort Knox Gold Scandal is fleecing every one of us out of the shirt on our back .It has undermined the dollar itself , which is on its way to destruction .It has set off ever - worsening inflation even while our economy is stagnating .The Gold Scandal is fleecing us all , but what has Senator William Proxmire done about that ? ?Let me tell you what he has , and has not , done .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.42714"}
