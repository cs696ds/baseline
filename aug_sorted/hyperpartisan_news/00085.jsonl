Gentzel , Executive Director of the National School Boards Association ( NSBA ) , responded to the guidance and noted that local school board and community involvement is essential in addressing concerns of discipline and race .\" Our nation 's school boards share the Education and Justice departments ' concerns for ' safe , inclusive and positive school climates , ' with zero tolerance for discriminatory practices in public schools , \" he said .\" NSBA is generally pleased with the documents ' emphasis on positive interventions , but it is vital to underscore that school discipline must acknowledge the various levels of resources available to public schools and communities .It is critical that the guidelines not impose any type of unfunded mandate on local public schools and not be misused as a loophole to fund private educational placements at taxpayer expense .A one - size fits all approach is not appropriate , since public schools , communities , and resources differ . \"Further , he added , \" NSBA is concerned that part of the Education and Justice departments ' legal framework may constitute an expansive interpretation of the law .We are studying the agencies ' legal analysis and will likely issue further comment .We invite the agencies to confer further with NSBA to ensure that guidelines released incorporate school boards ' perspective on these critical topics .\" The guide could be helpful to local school boards because it provides a detailed process of how the Education and Justice departments will approach investigations with respect to student discipline and race , he added .On a related topic , NSBA released a report , \" Addressing the Out - of - School Suspension Crisis : A Policy Guide for School Board Members , \" in April 2013 .The document examines discipline policies and the disproportionate impact on students of color .It recommends that school disciplinary measures should not be used to exclude students from school or deprive them of educational services , and suspensions should only be used as a last resort for school safety .It was called the \" broken windows \" theory , and it shows - quite tragically , in some cases - how taking a social policy that might make sense in one context and applying it to another can have disastrous consequences .The theory , popular with police departments and big - city mayors in the 1980s and 1990s , was that if police ignored petty crime - the broken windows of a neighborhood - these incidents would grow to create a climate where more serious crimes would occur .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.84288"}

{"text": "This example is by no means unique .My African - American brother - in - law , a white - collar professional , was driving to my house on Thanksgiving Day with his 20-something son when their car was stopped and surrounded by multiple police vehicles .The police officers immediately pointed guns at my relatives ' heads .If my brother - in - law or nephew - or if one of the officers - had sneezed , there could have been a terribly tragic police shooting .After the officers looked them over and told them they could go , my relatives asked why they had been stopped .The officers hemmed and hawed for a moment before saying , \" You fit the description of some robbery suspects - one was wearing a Houston Astros jersey just like the one your son is wearing . \" In reality , if my in - laws had fit the description of the robbery suspects so well , there is no way the police could have ruled them out as the robbers without searching their car .Sadly , it seems likely that the police were stopping - and presumably pointing guns at - every African - American male driver who happened by .I have heard similar stories from other African - American friends - and never from any white friend or relative .Many have noted that stop - and - frisk practices hinder important constitutional values : the liberty to walk freely down the street ; the reasonable expectation of privacy against unjustified invasion of one 's person by government officials ; and the equal protection of the laws .But even the best - intentioned white writers often gloss over the actual human impacts of these encounters .Now and again , an individual white elite will have an experience that personalizes this principle of individualized suspicion .For example , Linda Greenhouse , the Yale Law School Research Scholar and New York Times columnist , once wrote about the \" unnerving \" experience of being \" unaccountably pulled over by a police officer \" in a quiet , residential neighborhood in Washington , D.C. at night .In Greenhouse 's words , \" my blood pressure goes up as I recall it years later .\" Neither of these writers lacked knowledge about these issues , but their experiences obviously humanized and heightened their awareness .My son 's experiences aside , I can only call on one personal reference when the issue of stop - and - frisk is raised .As a graduate student in April 1981 , I spent a spring break traveling around Europe .When I visited Germany , I decided to spend one afternoon walking around Communist East Berlin .I quickly found myself being stopped at every single street corner by police officers whose suspicions were undoubtedly raised by my American clothing .Because of my limited knowledge of German , every encounter involved emphatic demands and raised voices , accompanied by threatening hand - slapping gestures .While Linda Greenhouse described her one - time experience with a police officer as \" unnerving , \" my encounter with a Communist police state would be better described as \" suffocating .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.40384"}
