{"text": "In addition to a wide - spread infiltration of the Muslim Brotherhood into the Obama Administration , Hillary Clinton 's longest serving assistant , Huma Abedin , has enjoyed an intensely close relationship with the Brotherhood for decades .Her father , Zyed Abedin , served as editor of an anti - Semitic journal funded by an Islamist ; her mother , Saleha Mahmood Abedin , replaced him as editor in 1993 when he died .As editor , Saleha has promoted the Muslim Brotherhood violent jihad and the \" right \" of women to be repressed under sharia .Therein rests the motivation for the policies formulated and actions taken by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in Egypt , Libya and Syria , all of which led to the growth of radical Islam in North Africa and the Middle East .In terms of US foreign policy and national security , the role of Hillary Clinton in the Libyan fiasco was as reckless as it was cataclysmic .Clinton was among the most vocal early proponents of using U.S. military force to topple Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi , claiming erroneously that Gadhafi was about to engage in a genocide against civilians in Benghazi , where the Islamist rebels held their center of power .Despite these concerns , the Obama Administration , on March 17 , 2011 , supported U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973 for military intervention in Libya .On that day Clinton ordered a general within the Pentagon to refuse to take a call from Gadhafi 's son Seif and other high - level members within the regime , to help negotiate a resolution .A day later , on March 18 , 2011 , Gadhafi himself called for a cease - fire , another action the administration dismissed .In released , but redacted emails , Clinton expressed interest in arming Libyan opposition groups using private security contractors , though at the time , the opposition was not formally recognized by the U.S. or United Nations , which prohibited arming without following strict guidelines and oversight .In an April 8 , 2011 email to her then - deputy chief of staff , Jake Sullivan , Clinton wrote : \" FYI .The idea of using private security experts to arm the opposition should be considered , \" attaching an intelligence report from adviser Sidney Blumenthal , her preferred source of intelligence .Many of those weapons would ultimately be destined for Syria .The cargo reportedly included surface - to - air anti - aircraft missiles , RPG 's and Russian - designed shoulder - launched missiles known as MANPADS , all believed destined for Syrian rebel groups .Both Obama and Clinton had a vested interest in lying about Benghazi and permanently concealing the truth ; Obama to ensure his reelection prospects in 2012 and Hillary to protect hers for 2016 .It is significant , however , that Clinton was the most aggressive administration official promoting the arming of the Libyan Islamists and the first to associate the video with the Benghazi attack ( see timeline ) as well as its most vigorous and persistent advocate . \"The present Shia - Sunni civil war in Iraq was fueled by American abdication of a foreign policy in Syria , where we sub - contracted our interests to Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Turkey .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.96649"}
