{"text": "How Terrorist Trends Develop .By Scott Stewart , Stratfor , 27 November 2015 .Summary .Developments in terrorism are driven by numerous factors .Some drivers , such as ideology and politics , are inherent to terrorism .However , there are other elements to consider , such as technology and counterterrorism tactics , which force terrorists to adapt their techniques to stay one step ahead of the authorities .Analysis .During the past two weeks , I have had the opportunity to speak to audiences in Ottawa , Canada and Washington , D.C. , about developments in terrorism that will affect the security of governments , companies and nongovernmental organizations in the next few years .But what I 'd like to do here is give readers a bit of an inside look at the factors I am thinking about when I forecast terrorist trends .One of the most obvious drivers of terrorism is ideology .Terrorism is always ideologically driven , and ideological developments can have a dramatic impact not only on the decision to employ terrorism but also on the types of attacks conducted and the types of targets selected .For example , the emergence of the Islamic State 's strain of jihadism in Yemen over the past year has led to a number of mosque bombings - attacks that al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula would not conduct under its operational guidelines .Ideology is also at the heart of the competition between al Qaeda and the Islamic State as the two rivals struggle to become the religious pole of the global jihadist movement .Summary : Here Stratfor looks at a seldom - mentioned aspect of the Paris attacks .Their roots lie deep in France 's history , allowing large - scale immigration from its colonies to provide cheap labor for its corporations .Just as American has done .But as Frances 's Jews discovered , France has little ability to assimilate foreigners .Its slow economic growth makes this even more difficult .Paris was a result .In France , New Attacks Come From Old Problems .By MarkFleming - Williams , Stratfor , 22 November 2015 .On the evening of Friday , Nov. 13 , eight people armed with assault rifles and suicide vests attacked several targets in Paris , killing 129 civilians .At least five of the attackers were French nationals and two were Belgians ; all eight appear to have been radical Islamists , and the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attacks .French President Francois Hollande declared the killings to be an act of war and immediately scaled up France 's military operations , primarily by increasing its airstrikes in Islamic State territory .Taking advantage of a temporary state of emergency , French police have conducted more than 100 raids each night since the attack as they track down suspects .While the attacks are obviously shocking , they probably will not have the same transformative effect as other major incidents such as 9/11 or the Madrid bombings , which led the states that were targeted to change their strategies .( 9/11 prompted the United States to invade Afghanistan and ultimately Iraq , while the Madrid bombings persuaded Spain to withdraw its troops from Iraq . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.06995"}

{"text": "Defeating Iraq Would Be Militarily Difficult .Most likely , the United States would eventually be victorious in a war against Iraq , but it would come at an enormous cost .It would be a mistake , for example , to think that defeating Iraq would result in as few Americans casualties as occurred in driving the Taliban militia from Kabul .Though Iraq 's offensive capabilities have been severely weakened by the bombings , sanctions , and UNSCOM - sponsored decommissioning , its defensive military capabilities are still strong .Nor would a military victory today be as easy as during the Gulf War .Prior to the launching of Operation Desert Storm , when the Iraqis figured out the extent of the forces being deployed against them , they decided not to put up a fight for Kuwait and relied mostly on young conscripts from minority communities .Only two of the eight divisions of the elite Republican Guard were ever in Kuwait , and they pulled back before the war began in mid - January .The vast majority of Iraq 's strongest forces were withdrawn to areas around Baghdad to fight for the survival of the regime itself , and they remain there to this day .In the event of war , defections from these units are not likely .There are close to one million members of the Iraqi elite who have a vested interest in the regime 's survival .These include the Baath Party leadership and its supporters , security and intelligence personnel , and core elements of the armed forces and their extended families .Furthermore , Iraq - a largely urban society - has a far more sophisticated infrastructure than does the largely rural and tribal Afghanistan that could be mobilized in the event of a foreign invasion .Nor is there an equivalent to Afghanistan 's Northern Alliance , which did the bulk of the ground fighting against the Taliban .The Kurds , after being abandoned twice in recent history by the United States , are unlikely to fight beyond securing autonomy for Kurdish areas .The armed Shiite opposition has largely been eliminated , and it too would be unlikely to fight beyond liberating the majority Shiite sections of southern Iraq .The U.S. would be reluctant to support either , given that their successes could potentially fragment the country and would encourage both rebellious Kurds in southeastern Turkey and restive Shiites in northeastern Saudi Arabia .U.S. forces would have to march on Baghdad , a city of over five million people , virtually alone .Unlike the Gulf War , which involved conventional and open combat where U.S. forces could excel and take full advantage of their firepower and technological superiority , U.S. soldiers would have to fight their way through heavily populated agricultural and urban lands .Invading forces would be faced with bitter , house - to - house fighting in a country larger than South Vietnam .Iraqis , who may have had little stomach to fight to maintain their country 's conquest of Kuwait , would be far more willing to sacrifice themselves to resist a foreign , Western invader .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.44249"}

{"text": "Iraq 's current armed forces are barely one - third their pre - war strength .Even though Iraq has not been required to reduce its conventional forces , the destruction of its weapons and the country 's economic difficulties have led to a substantial reduction in men under arms .Iraq 's Navy is virtually nonexistent and its Air Force is just a fraction of what it was before the war .Military spending by Iraq has been estimated at barely one - tenth of its levels in the 1980s .There Are Still Nonmilitary Options Available .The best way to stop the potential of Iraq developing weapons of mass destruction would be through resuming United Nations inspections , which - despite episodes of Iraqi noncooperation and harassment - were largely successful .It was Washington 's ill - considered decision to misuse the inspection teams for unrelated spying operations and the decision to engage in an intense four - day bombing campaign against Iraq that led Saddam Hussein to cease his cooperation completely in December 1998 .Since then , the United States has not offered any incentives for Iraq to allow inspections to resume .From the outset , Washington made it clear that even total cooperation with UNSCOM would not lead to an end to the devastating international sanctions against Iraq .As a result , Saddam Hussein may be refusing to allow UN inspectors to return not because he has something to hide but because he has nothing to gain by cooperating .Offering an end to or a substantial liberalization of nonmilitary sanctions in return for unfettered access by UN inspection teams would probably be the best way to regain access for the inspectors .Unfortunately , Bush administration officials are apparently no longer even interested in renewing UN inspections , dismissing out of hand Iraq 's recently announced willingness to consider their return .This raises questions as to whether the potential Iraqi possession of weapons of mass destruction is really a genuine concern of American officials or merely an excuse to go to war .A number of observers , including Scott Ritter - who had criticized the Clinton administration for not pushing the Iraqi regime harder on its initial refusals to allow inspections into some of the government 's inner sanctums - believe that the Bush administration is sabotaging United Nations efforts to reopen inspections .There is also no reason why the current emphasis on deterrence will not continue to work .Iraq was able to build up its initial raw components , equipment , and technologies for the development of biological , chemical , and nuclear weapons through imports , much of which came from the United States .The vast majority of these items and infrastructure has since been destroyed .Although the economic sanctions have been quite controversial as a result of their devastating effects on Iraqi civilians ( and are therefore frequently violated ) , international support for and enforcement of the military sanctions have remained quite solid .Furthermore , even without a resumption of inspections , relying on existing satellite surveillance - which ensures that Iraq can not build any large weapons plants without detection and presumably destruction , immediately afterwards - seems far less risky than an all - out war .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "85.6863"}
