{"text": "So what 's the difference ?On the other hand , a church can , of course , limit its hiring to only those who share the same faith .This is known in legal terms as the ministerial exception .And this is a crucial principle .Freedom of religion would mean nothing if the state could force a Christian church to hire a Buddhist as a minister .But what are the limits of such an exception ?What about a religious school ?Could the government force a Catholic school to hire an atheist teacher ?I think the vast majority of people , even atheists , would say no .But what about a religious day care center ?Or a homeless shelter ?Or a restaurant set up by a ministry to fund some charitable activity ?And that seems reasonable , though not a perfect solution .Some Christians claim that requiring them to serve gay customers in any context is a violation of their religious freedom .But if it is , it is exactly the same as requiring them to serve customers of every race or gender .Discrimination on the basis of race can be and historically has been based on religion as well , yet almost no one seriously argues today that any business should be able to turn away a black person .Who is going to stand up and say that a business should be allowed to refuse to hire women because their sincerely - held religious beliefs tell them that women should stay at home and not work ?Even if someone would make that argument , it 's not going to work , either legally or politically .It 's simply a non - starter .And there is no difference between those situations and discrimination against gay people or atheists .If it is a violation of religious freedom to force businesses to serve or hire gay people and atheists , it is just as much a violation of religious freedom to force them to serve or hire black people or women .But Prof. Koppelman is right to point out that , legally , the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and its many state versions does complicate this .That law requires that religious groups and individuals be given exemptions from generally applicable laws unless the government can show a compelling state interest in enforcing the law on them specifically in that particular context .And those laws are used everyday to exempt religious groups from zoning regulations and lots of other laws .It may be that RFRA and other such laws should simply be done away with , that there should be no exemption for religious groups or individuals , period .But then we go back to that ministerial exception , which I think even the most hardened atheist would agree with - no one thinks we should force churches to hire people who are not of the same faith .So perhaps Jeff 's solution is ultimately necessary , a narrowly drawn exception for churches and probably church - run schools , but not for businesses that just happen to be owned by Christians who feel the need to discriminate .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.103775"}

{"text": "You F off .Then we 'll all be happy .You have no proof whatsoever that the Bible holds any truth .Why ?Because there is n't any proof to support the fairy tales that lie within , and you 're a human being just like everyone else .If you are into it , so what ?You can believe whatever you want as long as it does n't hurt me or infringe on what I believe .Einstein first dismissed George LeMaitre 's mathematical explanation of the origin of the universe called the Big Bang Theory .Following Hubble 's discovery , Einstein changed his position to affirm LeMaitre LeMaitre was educated in physics and mathematics , but was first and foremost a Jesuit priest that believed in God .His scientific explorations never diminished , but rather affirmed , his beliefs .I 'm so happy we successfully moved towards theocracy past few decades .Our God is put in public money , we are favored by the government , we vote for Christian only presidents and much more .Thank God for the 40 % Evangelicals living in America .For me , I often wonder what my community or our nation would be like if religion was far removed .How wonderful it would be to advance at a faster pace since we would n't have religious groups combating our discoveries .How wonderful it would be to not have to hear some poor fool passionately cry out foul - play because his / her invisible friend has set certain commands unto him / her .How wonderful it would be to finally have a sense of equality for all , as rights to woman , gay or lesbian , color or whatever will be extended without prejudice .How wonderful it would be to be amongst highly educated children , as they will be taught from today 's known knowledge base without it being watered down to appease the religious .I often wonder ... .Sorry justme , sarcasm .Society stems from morality , without it , everything would descend into chaos .And where do we receive our morality , does the government give it to us , is it arbitrary , or is it a higher law ?I think we all know the answer , whether or not we agree on where that law comes from .To all of you whom state that religion is responsible for morals .Seriously ?Morality is a human condition .Think about it .We no longer have slavery .Why ?Not because of the bible .Actually , Jesus in the new testament even states slavery is great .Not to mention the many of moral attributes we now have compared to a hundred , even a thousand years ago .Such as ; Women have equal rights .We do n't stone our women and children anymore .And , many more moral attributes have changed ...We have morals because it is a survival tool .In essence we do unto others as we want done unto us .Thanks .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "128.95401"}
