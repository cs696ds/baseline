Chicago decision .Yet , the Court noted that this right was not unlimited , and that certain limitations on weapons considered \" dangerous and unusual \" could pass constitutional muster .Grenade launchers , rocket - propelled grenades , and atomic weapons fit this category , not AR-15 semiautomatic rifles .Yet , as Dahlia Lithwick wrote in Slate , it 's dubious whether the Supremes will get involved in Kolbe v. Hogan .It 's certainly a possibility , and it offers another legal avenue for Second Amendment supporters to make their case for a broader ruling over the entire country concerning the legality of assault weapons bans .On a side note , Ms. Lithwick , like most left - of - center publications , need to brush up on their firearms nomenclature ( of which I sometimes screw up ) right : .The 4th Circuit then argued that since handguns kill far more people than semi - automatic weapons , and that since Heller made handgun ownership constitutional , the less overall deadly semi - automatic assault weapons must not be dangerous and unusual either .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.16113"}
