S. I find it funny when people suggest that Sen Obama should leave the race .When have we seen the frontrunner stepping down ?Ironic , is n't it ?All the people above are correct about one thing .Lots of clinton supporters will be voting Republican this year especially if Obama gets the nom .Us voters who voted in the first primaries did n't know what we know now and we ca n't get our votes back .28 % it will be more like 50 % more repulicans this year :) .The Obama supporters should be nervous .Obama got more votes from Republicans and Independents than Democrats .In Nov those votes are going mostly to McCain .The Hillary supporters have had to put up with constant media bashing , along with sexism and race baiting .They may not vote for Obama either because this has been a very undemocratic and unfair primary process .Keep bashing the Clintons and you will give McCain the win !To me it really boils down to who is in the white house not what .The who which scares me is the BILL Clinton .The Clintons did party with the Reverend .Although Obama has n't partied with the Clintons .The what is opportunity for americans to be united by something which is earned by the peoples choice .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.17009"}
