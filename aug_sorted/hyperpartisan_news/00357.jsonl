{"text": "Even Iran 's Conservative Media Complain Of Filtering .A man browses the Internet at a cafe in central Tehran in January after Iran officially launched its cyberpolice unit to confront Internet crimes and counter social networks that spread \" espionage and riots , \" according to its police chief .Pro - reform Iranians have long complained about Iran 's filtering of the Internet and crackdown on online journalists and bloggers .Reformist and independent media have been the main target of the establishment 's Internet - control efforts that aim at disrupting the free flow of information .Yet reports in recent months suggest that conservative media , including blogs and news websites , have also been increasingly targeted by censors .The censorship has increased in the run - up to the June 14 presidential election .The actions have led to a rare protest by more than 100 media activists -- said to be involved in managing semiofficial news agencies and conservative websites -- who have criticized the increased pressure against online media .The statement adds that \" multiple centers of decision making \" in cyberspace is one of the main problems media face in their online activities .It says that for official media , being contacted by an unrelated body and ordered to remove some content or face filtering has become a \" trend \" in the past year .The signatories of the statement warn that the actions damage Iranian society 's mental health and commitment to the principle of news dissemination .Mehr says the activists are protesting against the actions of the so - called filtering committee , which is in charge of identifying online content that should be blocked according to its criteria .The committee has in recent weeks ordered the blocking of a number of websites , including several websites associated with Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei , the top aide to President Mahmud Ahmadinejad whose application to run in the presidential race was rejected .The committee is only one of several entities involved in Iran 's broader efforts to control online activities and enforce censorship .The main one is the Supreme Council of Cyberspace , which is an oversight body in charge of policy making .For more on the different bodies involved in Iran 's Internet censorship , check out this graph by the Iran media program at the University of Pennsylvania 's Annenberg School for Communication .Comments .Persian Letters is a blog that offers a window into Iranian politics and society .Written primarily by Golnaz Esfandiari , Persian Letters brings you under - reported stories , insight and analysis , as well as guest Iranian bloggers -- from clerics , anarchists , feminists , Basij members , to bus drivers .Follow @GEsfandiari .Guerrilla Translators .Seen anything in the Iranian blogosphere that you think Persian Letters should cover ?If so , contact Golnaz Esfandiari at esfandiarig@rferl.org Tags .Tags .Aaron McKenna : Thanks to the government , internet censorship is alive and well .Ireland has bent over backwards to accommodate the wishes of copyright holders by blocking file - sharing websites - but there is n't as much effort put into the voluntary blocking of child porn , such as exists in the UK or Norway , writes Aaron McKenna .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.84559"}

{"text": "Those arguing for establishing red lines fail to comprehend the complexity of the digital domain , in which adaptation and anonymity are the norm .The United States is better served in the long run by not establishing such thresholds , for four reasons .First , not doing so allows government leaders the latitude to tailor response options based on a hostile act , its physical and digital effects , and how it relates to the current state of affairs in the international system .As retired Air Force General Kevin Chilton remarked in 2009 as commander , U.S. Strategic Command , \" I do n't think you take anything off the table when you provide [ response ] options to the president to decide .Why would we constrain ourselves on how we would respond [ to hostile acts in cyberspace ] ? \" Such an approach does not differ from the way the United States addresses hostile acts in other domains .If red lines are established , we will be compelled to respond to each threat that crosses the line , which is unrealistic , given that our computer networks are subjected to millions of probes , scans , and attacks on a daily basis .Even if red lines are narrowly focused ( e.g. , employing military force if a cyber attack results in the deaths of U.S. citizens ) , the first time the United States fails to respond accordingly , it will undermine the credibility and deterrence effect of our other capabilities .A second reason in favor of ambiguity is that if our adversaries know our response to such acts , they will adjust accordingly .Because neither the national nor the defense strategy explicitly defines a hostile act in cyberspace or exactly how the United States will respond , this leaves it open to interpretation .As one military official remarked , \" If you shut down our power grid , maybe we will put a missile down one of your smokestacks . \"16In addition , hostile actors may perceive a green light for certain acts that do not cross a particular response threshold .While one such act below this threshold may not be harmful to U.S. interests , what if 100 million are ?Again , maintaining ambiguity concerning when , how , and to what extent to respond gives the United States greater latitude .Third , because cyberspace is a global domain that emphasizes open access , the free flow of information , and anonymity , it is extremely difficult to determine where the threat or attack originated .For example , U.S. military networks are probed more than six million times a day by assailants operating in one corner of the world using computer networks or servers in another corner .Most perpetrators are never identified , except for a computer Internet protocol address or a one - time user alias .17 If red lines demand a timely response and there is no one to pin responsibility on , then how can a response be implemented ?Finally , even if the source of the attacks is determined in a timely manner , automatic triggers for a response , particularly those that employ military force , could create negative second- and third - order effects that make a bad situation even worse .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.774216"}

{"text": "Though important , tribal loyalties were not the only factor at play .Mobilization for the revolutionary militias largely occurred on the basis of towns and cities , rather than tribes .17 Moreover , support for the revolution cut across most regions and cities , excluding strongholds of the three tribes whose members formed the backbone of the Qadhafi regime .18 The most obvious reason is that Qadhafi , after having initially curbed the power of tribal notables by redrawing administrative units to transcend tribal fiefdoms , had increasingly used tribal divisions and loyalties as instruments of power .This had been evident since the mid-1970s in the establishment of alliances with major tribes through family marriages and appointments of senior officials , particularly in the security apparatus .Even in some urban areas , tribal allegiances continued to determine elections for the Basic People 's Congresses , as observed by John Davis in Ajdabiya in 1979 or by Moncef Ouannes in Benghazi in 1995 and 1998 .The tribes ' political function was formalized during the mid-1990s through the establishment of the Popular Social Committees , in which tribal leaders were represented and which were designed , among other things , to hold tribal leaders responsible for subversive activity by members of their tribe .20 At the same time , political mobilization across tribal divides , through parties or civil - society organizations , was impossible .In addition , state formation , urbanization and economic transformation had in many ways perpetuated tribal loyalties rather than undermined them .The disruptive nature of Libyan state formation allowed tribal loyalties to survive .Ottoman attempts to curtail tribal autonomy and extend state control into the interior of the territory during the second half of the nineteenth century were short - lived .Tribes reemerged as major military and political players during the Italian conquest ( 1911 - 31 ) .The short , but traumatic , colonial experience failed to disrupt tribal ties , which were revived by indirect rule during the British and French military administration ( 1943 - 51 ) .Tribal leaders subsequently played a leading political role under the monarchy .Under Qadhafi , tribal notables were at first marginalized , though deliberate strategies to weaken state institutions promoted recourse to tribal networks , including in dispute settlement .Indeed , Qadhafi 's apparent pursuit of \" statelessness \" by undermining state institutions has been interpreted by Davis as being rooted in , and responding to , Bedouin distrust of central authority .22 Libya 's transformation into an oil economy was far from incompatible with tribal ties , since it allowed officials to distribute positions , budgets and projects based on clientelistic considerations rather than merit and efficiency .Moreover , at least until the late 1980s , Qadhafi 's economic policies deliberately sought to prevent social differentiation into classes that would have posed a threat to tribal loyalties .Finally , urbanization saw communities settle in cities according to parentage , with close relatives settling nearest to each other .23 While this pattern inevitably faded over the past decades , it remained sufficiently strong for districts of major cities to side with the regime or the revolutionaries , depending on the tribal community dominating the neighborhood .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.806244"}

Lind , wrote : .The defense establishment 's concept of quality leads to weapons that push the technological state of the art but often do so in areas that have little relevance to actual combat .These weapons also tend to be fragile and very difficult to maintain in the field , often fail to perform under combat conditions - which are very different from conditions on proving grounds - take decades to develop , and are extremely expensive both to buy and operate .Unfortunately for the military reformers , when the United States went to war in 1991 , many of the systems they had championed , such as the F-16 , proved to be of limited effectiveness .By contrast , more advanced weaponry , such as the F-15E , proved to be more militarily potent .The experience of the 1980s holds lessons for today .Should we allow our technological edge to erode , we could find ourselves at a battlefield disadvantage relative to an adversary - a situation we have had not had to face for over a half - century .Interagency Illusion .The final criterion for judging the adequacy of our defense posture has to do with the division of labor between DOD and the rest of the national - security community to meet current and future challenges .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.37554"}

{"text": "Several attempts to bring the brigades in Tripoli under the NTC 's control failed , as did attempts to disarm them .On the emergence of new currents and parties during the transitional period : .The transitional period is likely to be defined by a profound transformation of the political arena , and not only because of the transitional roadmap , with its several phases in which new legislative bodies are elected and new governments appointed .Power struggles are emerging between the representatives of prominent families , tribes and cities dominating the political scene after the fall of Tripoli .Among the most notorious manifestations of these rivalries have been the attacks by Abdelrahman Suweihli and the Sallabi family on leading NTC figures , including former prime minister Mahmoud Jibril , as well as those by military leaders from Misrata and the Western Mountains on Abdelhakim Belhadj .38 Given the patterns of mobilization on the basis of family , tribal or local interests during the conflict , it is likely that such power struggles will be a defining feature of the transitional period .Among other things , leading families , tribes and cities in northwestern and central Libya have been moving to rectify the disproportionate influence held by representatives of the northeast in the NTC and its executive bureau until November .This does not mean that regional rivalries are likely to define post - Qadhafi politics , despite the fact that the weak development of central administration and national identity led to the adoption of a federal constitution under the monarchy .The patterns of mobilization during the civil war suggest that rivalries are emerging at the sub - regional - i.e. local and tribal - as well as national levels , rather than between the regions of Tripolitania , Cyrenaica and Fezzan .39 The constituencies of the former regime - in particular the Warfalla , Magarha and Qadhadfa - will also need to be brought into the political process if their permanent alienation , with serious consequences for political stability , is to be avoided .But it is unlikely that politics during the transitional period will only be defined by parochial interests .The political arena is likely to see the emergence of broader political camps and coalitions of interests .Some of the rivalries outlined above can also be interpreted in other terms , such as power struggles between secularists and Islamists , or between former regime officials and members of the ( previously imprisoned or exiled ) opposition .With respect to political parties , civil - society organizations and social movements , the political field remains almost virgin territory .Although several youth activist groups as well as some small parties have already been founded , the need to close ranks acts as a major impediment to the formation of rival political camps as long as the threat from Qadhafi 's rump security apparatus persists .Even the Islamist currents , though comparatively well - established , have historically been much weaker than in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt , and at the beginning of the transitional period have yet to coalesce into clearly defined formal organizations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.62603"}

Taylor provided a critique in Erring : A Post - modern A / Theology that can support the claim that certain ways of unfolding narrative can lead to inauthentic engagement with the world .The attempt to fold all of understanding and Truth ( with the capital T ) into a single over - arching point of view was unveiled as deeply flawed , requiring disengagement with the ever - changing human experience of the world and the limitations of human understanding .There is no such singular point of view , although history itself is riddled with attempts to create one .Such narratives are referred to as meta - narratives , narratives of the whole that seek to eliminate dissenting voices in order to create a uniform position on what is True about humanity , history , and the future .Religion narratives can be dangerous .Through the narrative structures of religion people have justified a multitude of acts of violence , and looking at these there would seem to be many religious villains .For the victims of the violence , the person(s ) and the religion he or she may claim to represent are villainous .At the same time , the ability to do extreme violence to another requires seeing the other as a villain who is a threat to oneself or one 's community .This threat may be ideological , moral , social , political , or even physical .It may be real or perceived .As a result , that person is perceived as a threat .In the domain of religious violence it can seem easy to identify religious villains .Take , for example , the attacks in Norway by Anders Breivik in 2011 .These show villainy in the name of ideology when he killed more than 70 people to \" protect \" Norway from supporters of Muslim immigration and multiculturalism .2 Throughout his trial he has remained unrepentant regarding these acts of violence .As one reads about the trial or watches video clips of him speaking , he seems to embody villainy .This event raises a series of questions regarding the ability to identify and respond to religious villains .What is it that makes one person see Breivik as a villain and others see him as a hero ?One way to understand it is through the difference between those whose story promotes diversity and multiculturalism and those whose story is threatened by it .If so , is it possible to choose a position that is more correct or must one simply accept that there is no better or worse position here ?In other words , should relativism drive one 's analysis or can a standard of evaluation be applied ?If relativism is the \" better \" option , and no standard of evaluation is possible , then there is no discussion to be had because there are no religious villains .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.9635"}

Michael Bray and a friend blew up a building claiming , \" Before daybreak , the only abortion chamber in Dover was gutted by fire and put out of the business of butchering babies \" ( Juergensmeyer Terror 20 ) .Connected to the Army of God movement , and supposed author of the manual Army of God , and publisher of Capitol Area Christian News , Rev. Bray 's Defensive Action movement has justified the use of violence in anti - abortion activities on the basis of his understanding of Christianity .Bray sees the United States as being at odds with its own values , \" undermining individual freedoms and moral values \" by not allowing him to live under the biblical law he thinks should govern American society ( Juergensmeyer Terror 23 ) .As described by Juergensmeyer , Bray . was convinced that if there were some dramatic event , such as economic collapse or social chaos , the demonic role of the government would be revealed , and people would have \" the strength and the zeal to take up arms \" in a revolutionary struggle .What he envisioned as the outcome of that struggle was the establishment of a new moral order in America , one based on biblical law and a spiritual , rather than a secular , social compact .( Terror 23 ) .There are many similarities between Bray and Breivik .Bray 's narrative is villainous in two ways .First , it is a villainizing narrative .Bray and his colleagues are at war with the evil that seeks to destroy the Biblical values of the United States .Second , it is a villainous narrative and Bray is a religious villain .It promotes the destruction of the goods of society in the name of the good as he sees it .He has shaped a narrative that puts him at the epicenter of knowing the way God wants people to live and any deviation from that is a threat that must be destroyed .In the process , he threatens basic , social , and intellectual goods by threating life , human relationships , and the capacity of those who follow him to see a wider worldview than the one he provides .There is no living in community by integrating the differences of life .There is only his way of seeing community .In 1994 , Rev. Paul Hill , a friend of Bray 's , killed Dr. John Britton and his escort .Later , Hill wrote to Bray and others about what it was like to have killed these two men .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.46367"}

{"text": "The use of improvised mines and boobytraps , however , is a continuing issue .Since a guerrilla force expects to have the population become increasingly loyal to it , there is an obvious psychological problem with leaving an area with active explosive devices .Especially when a guerrilla force has limited supplies , there is tactical utility to improvising devices , which could be as simple as a hand grenade , fastened next to a trail , and with a taut wire attached to the activating lever of the grenade .Stepping on the wire would pull out the safety ring and start the detonation sequence of the grenade .SF policy does not clearly address this type of device , or those made completely from local materials and having no automatic disarming features .The U.S. Rules of Engagement might ban such devices , but , especially in urban or jungle areas where the guerrillas are not constantly observed , the ban might not be enforced .Snipers , when the term is used properly , are highly skilled riflemen that use specialized weapons and tactics to attack specific personnel and equipment far outside normal rifle range .SF sniper training is separate from the training of snipers assigned to conventional units ; the USSOCOM sniper school is at Fort Bragg , NC while the general Army school is at Fort Benning , GA . .Both sabotage and subversion are means to reduce the military , political , economic , or morale strengths of an opponent .They differ in that sabotage involves physical damage or damage to information systems , while subversion relies more on changing the behavior of personnel trusted by the opponent .Before the act of sabotage or subversion is executed , preparations for the act must be kept under tight security control .Only a small information leak could defeat the attack .When sabotage takes place , it may be covert rather than clandestine , in that the enemy knows he has been hurt , but may not know who hurt him .In the more subtle examples of sabotage , however , the enemy may not suspect deliberate action caused an aircraft to crash .Where the saboteur might contaminate aircraft fuel , the aircraft could be put out of service by a clerk committing subversion , by delaying or losing maintenance orders , resupply of fuel or munitions , or \" misrouting \" an order for the aircraft to attack .[ 1 ] .In a more modern context , sabotage may be one of many ways to attack a given enemy target system .If , for example , the POL target system is targeted , tank farms and refineries could be raided , or pipelines and tanker trucks ambushed or attacked with mines .These will be very evident to the enemy , and the resistance could be damaged if some of their combat teams are captured and interrogated .If a saboteur were able to gain access to that tank farm , or fuel tanks of vehicles and aircraft , and add a chemical that slowly damaged engines , that agent could be far away by the time the enemy determines what had happened .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.29555"}

{"text": "Thus it is not a completely effective narrative resolution .And it breaks down precisely in moments of heightened racial awareness .Just as a person draws on a stock of stories to frame and understand what is currently happening , so members of a culture draw upon its stock of stories or myths to frame and understand what is happening to them .These myths organize experience and the culture 's reaction to that experience .The value of myth is that it helps us understand what is new in terms of what is already understood .As we saw previously , stories save time and energy in figuring out what is going on , what is socially real , what it is appropriate to do , and what is likely to happen in the future .The myths of a culture reorganize the world to take on the appearance of a story that is already well understood .Thus an attack on American interests is readily envisioned as another Alamo or Pearl Harbor .If the new experience fits the old story well enough , the myth will be strengthened and confirmed .But experience is often recalcitrant .Although we try to understand social events in terms of stories that lie to hand , the world will not always so easily conform .Viewing every conflict as the moral equiv\u00ad alent of Pearl Harbor and every war as World War II is a recipe for disaster .So a culture 's myths are gradually adjusted and reconstituted in order to take account of the changing world it faces .The stories of the past are given new glosses and new meanings .In this way old icons like \" the Winning of the West \" or \" the Civil War \" take on multiple and conflicting associations .Widely shared stories serve as a springboard for future improvisation .Like other memes , myths are transformed as they are communicated to others in new circumstances .Thus the myths of a society are not simply handed down ; they are subtly remade in each generation for its own purposes , even as that gen\u00aderation is guided and shaped by what it works with .[17 ] .Occasionally new stories and icons replace older ones . \"Vietnam \" has be\u00ad come a permanent fixture in American consciousness , with a highly conflicted and ambivalent set of meanings .Yet as with all cultural bricolage , the new is always built on the old .A culture 's new stock stories are constructed out of variations on older narratives , which in turn were based on still older frame\u00adworks originally used to understand the problems of the distant past .Thus it is hardly surprising to find that the stock stories of different cultures have many elements in common , even if these elements have now come to be used for widely different purposes and have quite different meanings .Because a culture 's stock stories are a shared way of understanding the shared past , present , and future of its members , media of mass communication take on a special importance in the creation and development of social myths .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.247375"}

Nar\u00adrative and narrative structures are ubiquitous and pervasive features of cultural life .They are easily transmitted through communication .They are deeply en\u00ad trenched in human thought .Indeed , as we shall see in this chapter , human thought uses narrative structures for a wide variety of purposes .Narratives are pervasive forms of human thought because narrative struc\u00adture is a particularly efficient form of human memory storage .Our minds are comparatively well designed to remember and understand narrative sequences .For example , people are better able to recall complex sequences of events in stories than complex lists of words and numbers .Indeed , translating informa\u00ad tion into narrative form is often an excellent method of memorization .This fact explains the importance of bards and epic poets in oral cultures , where information storage through writing is difficult , costly , or unavailable , and memorization skills are at a premium .Human beings pick up narrative structures easily from watching and ob\u00ad serving events .We naturally seem to create narrative explanations for events or abstract narrative structures from our experiences .We glean narrative struc\u00adtures from life ; we impose narrative order on the world .For all of these reasons , the memes associated with narrative structures find a particularly hospitable environment in the ecology of human minds .Narrative memory is memory of expectations of events in time .It is more than an ability to recall strings of sequences of events ; it also involves the ability to store expectations about what usually happens under certain conditions .These expectations are coded in narrative form .People recall that A happened and then B happened , but they also remember that C is usually followed by D. .Our comparative abilities for narrative memorization have probably been shaped by evolutionary forces .In the struggle for survival , storing sequences of events and ex\u00ad pectations may have proved much more useful than storing isolated bits of information in propositional form .Whether or not there is an evolutionary advantage to narrative memory , human beings have a particularly well - developed capacity for it .As a result , people use narrative structures for many different mental tasks and operations .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.01184"}

'( 1997:160 ) , and this clearly appeared to be the case in Ethiopia .The cause of the struggle for self- determination found adequate justification in the eyes of many disgruntled Ethiopians , including Tigraians .Radical ideology The main ideological source of inspiration for TPLF 's ethno - nationalist drive was , however , none other than Stalin 's theory on ' the national question ' , influential in the Leftist - Marxist thinking among the opposition movements of the time .One should not forget the origin of organizations like the TPLF in Leftist students ' movements , which were charmed by these abstract ideas .The TPLF 's departure point was Stalin 's definition of a nation as ' a historically evolved , stable community of language , and territory , .6 economic life and psychological makeup manifested in a community of culture ' ( 1942 : 12 ) .Based on this definition , it was believed that Tigrai constituted a nation which had the right to self - determination . 'Furthermore , if the rights of a given nation are curtailed , Stalin propounded ' a nation has the right to arrange its life on autonomous lines .It even has the right to secede ' ( 1975 : 61 - 62 ) .So far , Stalin sounded a devout nationalist , and so was the TPLF , especially in bringing the issue to the people it claimed to liberate - the Tigraians .In contextualizing the right of self - determination up to secession , Lenin had asserted that ' the several demands of democracy , including self - determination , are not an absolute , but only a small part of the general democratic ( now : general socialist ) world movement .In individual concrete cases , the part may contradict the whole ; if so it must be rejected ' ( 1971 : 132 ) .And Stalin reasserted that : ' [ T]he Bolsheviks never separated the national question from the general question of revolution ....The main essence of the Bolshevik approach to the national question is that the Bolsheviks always examined the national question in inseparable connection with the revolutionary perspective ' ( op . cit .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.72003"}

{"text": "We wondered , therefore , about the real working of our narratives , and we could no longer deny their confessional nature .Moving Beyond Confessional Narratives .Confessional accounts - efforts toward disclosing positionality , sharing an emergent recognition of oppression , and stating complicity paired with the need to counter injustice - are commonplace in anti - racist , feminist , class - conscious , and other social justice discourse .Yet , we realized that these confessionals , like all genres , have affordances and consequences .There are certainly important reasons for the continual re - emergence of confessional narratives , even in our own conversations and processual work .We , like many others , write such narratives responding to the desire to record : we feel the urge to know and to articulate the when , where , how , and the agonizing why , which together catalyze an increased recognition of oppression and dominance .This accounting transcends memory and recovery per se .We document to process , interpret , and testify .When in conversation , we also need to account for and often justify our investment in anti - racism , providing an originary moment , evolutionary history , and critical genealogy for our commitment .An articulation of positionality is necessary for the ethos of the speaker / writer who chooses to address racial justice in order to understand the stake or mandate in the discourse .As such , narratives can ground our argument , pinpoint manifestations of racism , and renew our commitments .We also acknowledge that confessional narratives can be important indirect arguments against claims of ( dis)trust as well as toward establishing alliance or solidarity .Recognizing these different functions is important , but the discourse that emerges within confessionals can limit the possibility of where the originary moment might lead .Confessional accounts can trap us between narratives of victims / saviors and of villains / heroes .The confessional can lock us into the moment of countering outright denials or reluctant dismissals to claims of injustice ( e.g. , that racism does n't still exist today , or that it exists outside of the self ) .Our own confessional accounts began to trap us into a stasis of fact : in affirming the presence of racism through countering denials of its existence .The classical rhetorical stases are invention / interpretive tools , pinpointing crucial questions that inform , constitute , and probably constrain our anti - racism discourse .These personal histories provided us only with a starting point when exploring together our commitments to racial justice and how we make these commitments actionable .We also realized that our accounts are bound to be local and individual , and so separately they deflated the political dimensions of all encounters with oppression .We see value in the adage \" the personal is political , \" but the value also comes from showing the seamless and seamed connections between these domains .The personal is not just loosely situated in a bigger political scene where power is , on the one hand , ( ab)used to maintain inequities and privilege and , on the other hand , minimally contested and optimally re - configured and subverted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.941154"}

Ideology , leadership and mobilization which are important basis for ' movement hegemony ' will be considered in the comparative study .A substantial body of theoretical and empirical studies on ethnic nationalism and political pluralism exists , and a selective use of these materials has been invaluable for this study .The review of the secondary literature and the resulting analysis ( see Chapter 2 for more details ) were intended to shed light on current theoretical understandings in juxtaposition .15 with empirical realities .This understanding will help to grasp the concrete problems that trigger such state of conflict and lead us to infer an alternative framework that could help bring an end to such cycles of conflicts and blood - letting .Other points as to why this study is timely are as follows : a. The present Ethiopian regime has demonstrated the country 's potential as a major player in the region since 1991 .Therefore , it is necessary to understand factors that could destabilize the present balance .It could be certainly a waste if ethnic- based civil war breaks out again as a consequence of the failure to resolve Ethiopia 's ethno - national contradictions .b. Given the cultural influence of civil wars and political violence that are based on ethnic and national loyalties , it is exceedingly clear that if we are to comprehend at least some of the complexities and nuances , then we need to focus our attention .16 towards problems raised by ethnic nationalism .At present one can observe that in the case of Ethiopia ethno - nationalism largely supersedes religious loyalties.8 c. There is no doubt external factors had a role to play in ethnic - based conflicts in Ethiopia and the surrounding region .We need to assess if the external impact could be utilized to play a positive role in averting civil wars and political violence instead of contributing to prolong ethnic conflicts .d. Events in Ethiopia not only impact upon local scenarios , they also have an impact regionally .Thus one needs to examine whether the current political dispensation of Ethiopia along ethnic lines generate proxy conflicts that may destabilize the region as a whole ( cf .Abbink 2003b ) .e. It is a contribution towards ongoing efforts to explore the possibilities of moving away from 20th century ' tradition ' of ethnic and national wars in Ethiopian in particular and the region in general .In the next chapter , some theoretical arguments will be offered to give us a frame of reference for our discussion on the evolution of the TPLF as an ethno - nationalist group in contemporary Africa .This will help to explore the thinking of the radical or ' revolutionary ' group that shaped and led the struggle of the Tigraians .Chapter 3 will discuss and fit together the objective conditions upon which the group evolved to become a cohesive organization to launch an armed insurrection .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.59994"}
{"text": "Both the insurgent and the terrorist struggle to gain legitimacy for their ideas in the minds of a target audience , and to detract from the legitimacy of a non - compliant government .Essentially , the difference between insurgency and terrorism is that the former is a situation of political grievance that escalates to violence while the latter is a violent strategy that those with political grievances may employ .Hence terrorism is one strategy available to those engaging in insurgency .Whether terrorism is possible outside a situation of insurgency depends on whether there is a threshold beyond which a minority group engaging in violent activism is sufficiently large to be called insurgent , and below which a group ' merely ' comprises fringe radicals .As terrorism is best understood as a strategy of insurgency , counter - terrorism is thus best understood as a component of counter - insurgency .All four counterterrorism models fit into one or several of Galula 's COIN strategies for a Cold Insurgency .Activities that fall within the Defensive and Criminal - Justice models can be considered ' reinforcement of the state political machine ' as both bolster institutional legitimacy and security .The War model describes ' direct action against insurgent leadership , ' as might the Criminal - Justice model , depending on the action .Intelligence operations against terrorists , under either the War or Criminal - Justice models , constitute ' infiltration . 'Conclusion .The question ' What is the difference between counter - insurgency and counter - terrorism ' may be interpreted as suggesting that the two are dichotomous , but as a closer look demonstrates , they are in fact closely linked .Terrorism , as an ideological strategy of psychological warfare by political violence , falls under the aegis of insurgency , which is a situation of violent political activism directed against a government by a rebellious minority .Counter - terrorism falls within four models : defensive , reconciliatory , criminal - justice , and war .Those models in turn fit into the broader categories of COIN identified by David Galula in his seminal book on the subject .The difference between counter - terrorism and counter - insurgency is simple : counter - terrorism focuses more narrowly on combating the tactics and strategy of terrorism and those who employ it , while counter - insurgency is a broader category of responses to political violence carried out by minority groups , both terroristic and otherwise .The latter subsumes the former .Archives .Subversion .Subversion refers to an attempt to transform the established social order and its structures of power , authority , and hierarchy .Subversion ( Latin subvertere : overthrow ) refers to a process by which the values and principles of a system in place are contradicted or reversed .More specifically , subversion can be described as an attack on the public morale and , \" the will to resist intervention are the products of combined political and social or class loyalties which are usually attached to national symbols .Following penetration , and parallel with the forced disintegration of political and social institutions of the state , these loyalties may be detached and transferred to the political or ideological cause of the aggressor \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.68851"}

Col .David Galula .Abstract .India has a longstanding counter - insurgency experience in the Northeast ; a region that has suffered from multiple insurgencies since the 1950s .This counter - insurgency experience has witnessed its share of successes and failures .This article locates the Indian counter - insurgency experience in the Northeast of India within the conceptual framework of counter - insurgency best practices .The best practices include : Primacy of Political Goals ; Centre of Gravity : Population ; Counter - Propaganda ; Resolute leadership ; Intelligence ; Unity of Effort ; Appropriate Force Structures ; Rule of Law ; and Operational Clarity .The selected best practices have been identified across the literature as most critical for the successful conduct of counter - insurgency operations .Analyzing the Indian counter - insurgency experience in the Northeast of India within these best practices , the article concludes that ' popular legitimacy and population support ' are the most critical factors for optimal counter - insurgency outcomes .Insurgencies by their very nature are a violent struggle against the state for legitimacy and influence over relevant populations .Therefore , in order to win against any insurgency , the first core insight for any counter - insurgency force is to gain the support of the population .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.625984"}

{"text": "Narratives ascribe mental states to others ( or to oneself ) to justify or account for deviations from what is culturally canonical or socially expected .[5 ] Conversely , our ascriptions of belief and purpose make sense because they implicitly rely on background cultural expectations .It makes sense to believe that a person has certain beliefs or desires because of the way she reacts against the background of existing cultural conventions .In this way narratives mediate between beliefs , desires , hopes , intentions , and actions on the one hand , and existing cultural conven\u00adtions on the other .They understand the former in terms of the latter .In short , narrative structures are a medium through which three facets of human life are understood and explained in terms of one another : ( 1 ) cultural conventions , ( 2 ) human behavior , and ( 3 ) beliefs , plans , goals , and desires .Narratives as Stock Stories .As forms of cultural software , narrative structures can be passed to others through communication , imitation , or other forms of social learning .Many narrative structures are transmitted through mass media , through artistic ex\u00ad pression , and through myths and legends .Much art is based on narrative struc\u00ad tures , and our understanding of art is based on absorption and appropriation of these narrative structures .Adults and especially children like to hear stories told over and over again , just as they enjoy hearing a song played repeatedly .Listening to a familiar story can be pleasurable because it fulfills our expecta\u00ad tions .Hearing new stories reinforces or alters the existing stock of narrative structures that we use to make sense of what is going on in the world .Art manipulates and plays on our storehouse of stories , retelling them with inter\u00ad esting variations and details .And art can also replenish and expand our stock of stories by exposing us to new narrative structures , new ways of behaving , and new ways of understanding .Although art is a crucial method of memetic transfer , one of the most important ways that we assimilate scripts and social expectations is through watching other people .The transmission of narrative structures through ob\u00ad servation is a good example of how the spread of memes differs from a simple copying of information .Usually people do not transmit social expectations like messages that are coded and uncoded .Rather , watching others acting out social scripts in front of us creates expectations in our own memories .Moreover , because people have different bodies of experience and different sets of prior expectations , they carry away different things from their social encounters .They assimilate behaviors and produce expectations in slightly different ways .As a result , each person in a given culture will have a slightly different set of social scripts , with slightly different expectations , and therefore each will un\u00ad derstand and react to the behavior of others slightly differently .Furthermore , social scripts are not simply routines that we must invariably follow blindly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.106125"}

Mark Rushdoony , son of the founder of the movement .He said : .The power of Christian Reconstruction lies in the fact that it walks not by sight but by faith that Jesus Christ is now victorious and His victory over men and nations will be revealed in time and history .In the rhetoric that becomes action there is a plan , a vision of the whole .In carrying out destructive acts , these men are not doing so arbitrarily .They see themselves as fulfilling an obligation to realize the universal telos of the world as given in their villainizing meta - narrative .As Juergensmeyer explains , these men see themselves as saving the world by fighting evil .Villainous narratives begin in villainizing narratives , seeing the world as having become so corrupt that no amount of discussion will bring about the necessary change .The acts may seem small , but they leave a mark .The narratives of Reconstruction claim after a thousand years of Christian rule , Jesus will come again , but it is up to the people to prepare the world for Christ .The goal is a Christian theocratic state , and once that is achieved peace will reign and it will be possible to live a life of integrity ( Juergensmeyer Terror 10 ) .Religion is dangerous when it threatens the integrity of life .Such narratives are simultaneously villainizing narratives - the way the world is being distorted and good is threatened by the forces of evil - and villainous narratives - that the only path to winning a cosmic war is perpetual fighting against enemies wherever they might be found .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "94.74034"}

How did the movement develop from a small guerrilla group to a mass - based politico - military force that brought the state to its knees and could redefine its national political identity ?An ethno- nationalist collectivity - often called ' nationality ' - becomes an effective means of creating a force that can challenge a state , with the aim of replacing an old system of governance and relationships by a new one .12 exclusionist and does not necessarily entail democracy .Democracy is taken to mean here representative , elected government , rule of law , a parliamentary system with free activity of political parties , and an independent judiciary . 'Ethnic pluralism ' is not necessarily in opposition to political pluralism .What basically makes it conflict - ridden is the manipulation of ethnic dissensions by elites competing for political power .Hence , the greater the inter - elite competition for power , the greater the chances for ethnic polarization , that in most cases - and particularly in Ethiopia - is accompanied by ethno - regional or ethnic - styled conflict .In this regard , the study will aim to elicit the complex nature of ethnic nationalism and the ensuing conflicts in Ethiopia both historically and in its contemporary setting , via in - depth description . 13 ( c ) Investigate the extent to which the power of ethnicity and ethnic mobilization can derange a long established state like Ethiopia .The role of the revolutionary elite of the TPLF in mobilizing the peasantry and all the mechanisms it adopted to create a strong peasant force that could support a revolutionary army will be critically scrutinized .( e ) Finally , reflect on the ethnically charged state formation of the ruling TPLF / EPRDF and its implications for the relationship of the various ethno- nationalist groups and the stability of the Ethiopian state .The methodology of this research project was informed by a multi - disciplinary approach .It depends heavily on the use and evaluation of existing political and anthropological theories of ethnicity , ethno - nationalism , and self - determination as related to the problematic of conflict management and democratization in multi - ethnic and divided societies , and of course in Ethiopia in particular .14Although ethno - nationalism has been primarily shaping the social and political dynamics of Ethiopia , the wider regional setting and international geopolitical factors also played a significant role .b. It will take into account the raison d'\u00eatre of ethnic nationalism in modern Ethiopia both historically and in its contemporary setting , which consequently established the dominance of one particular ethno - regional group and hence the counter- hegemonic ethno - nationalism of the dominated ethnic groups .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "97.96144"}

'Conclusion .The question ' What is the difference between counter - insurgency and counter - terrorism ' may be interpreted as suggesting that the two are dichotomous , but as a closer look demonstrates , they are in fact closely linked .Terrorism , as an ideological strategy of psychological warfare by political violence , falls under the aegis of insurgency , which is a situation of violent political activism directed against a government by a rebellious minority .Counter - terrorism falls within four models : defensive , reconciliatory , criminal - justice , and war .Those models in turn fit into the broader categories of COIN identified by David Galula in his seminal book on the subject .The difference between counter - terrorism and counter - insurgency is simple : counter - terrorism focuses more narrowly on combating the tactics and strategy of terrorism and those who employ it , while counter - insurgency is a broader category of responses to political violence carried out by minority groups , both terroristic and otherwise .The latter subsumes the former .I believe that the world should deal with counter - insurgency as focal point because the insurgency breeds terrorism .In Pakistan the state still deal Balochistan issue under the insurgency pattern .Nevertheless , the insurgency in Balochistan has been an old phenomenon and the province is facing an escalating terrorism today .It is very obvious that terrorism is dealt with the use of force ; however an excessive use of force can create more problems and may result in escalation of terrorism .But , the insurgency factor needs to be more focused .Military force against any form of insurgency can result into the terrorism ; therefore it is significant to establish a strong link with the insurgence groups in order to come by the side of the table for talks .Right through the history of the world , we have witnessed many wars around us which have always been finished over the talks .If the end of any war is the talks , then it is principally vital to give the \" talks \" not just one chance but many .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.152985"}

{"text": "Interpretation does not happen by simply taking in data .Interpretation comes within the context of the values and perspectives already present to a person , as Gadamer ( Truth and Method ) pointed out , each person has a hermeneutical horizon .Moreover , as seen in the work of thinkers such as John D. Caputo ( More Radical Hermeneutics ) , each person 's horizon is distinct , which creates a gap between one 's own horizon and that of the other .Living in the world requires sorting through the information constantly being received , and the only way to do that is through the lens already given to each person .This unfolding of interpretation is the creation of narrative .This narrative is one 's worldview .One does not simply interpret individual bits of information but unfolds them in relation to each other , into the story that shapes one 's identity .Narrative , then , is how one experiences the world .Each of us has a narrative identity , to borrow a phrase from Ricoeur ( Oneself as Another ) .Each person understands him or herself through the way that person unfolds the interpretation of history , the present , and the possibilities for the future in constant interaction with the other .As Philip Davies describes it : .Stories are never innocent of point of view , plot , ideology , or cultural value .We tell our stories of the past in a historical context , looking at the past from a particular point : the present .We can not be objective , neutral observers .We ourselves are in history , in the sense both of events happening and of the stories ( news , gossip , history books ) that interpret these events - not to mention our own memories .( Memories 11 ) .Our narrative identity is not simply the past of ourselves , it is culturally constructed - what Davies calls cultural memory and others ( including myself ) call sacred history .Within the life of a person who considers him or herself religious , there is a particular quality to the narrative , and that is the relationship with the holy or sacred as the driving force of the narrative .In such narratives , everything is at stake .The unfolding of one 's story in relation to the holy , one 's narrative identity , is in relation to one 's community , cultural period , and place in time .And these narratives point to the future of how the narrative will continue to unfold .As Ricoeur pointed out , the process of hermeneutics is a dialogue , a continual back and forth with that which one is interpreting ( \" What Is A Text \" ) .And in the case of personal and communal identity , one is always adding to the story of life itself and its telos by every interaction with the world .Others , then , are characters in our own stories .The underlying assumption of this essay is that there is no non - narrative engagement with the world .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "99.41939"}

'The TPLF thus could claim success , especially over the discredited military regime of Colonel Mengistu Haile - Mariam and a number of other opponents which were either ethnic or multi - ethnic political organizations .Although previously there had been a number of ethno - nationalist movements of one form or the other that rose up to challenge the Ethiopian state , none of them were able to break the backbone of the central state .In 1991 after waging a sixteen years ' protracted war , the ethno - nationalist TPLF finally managed to conquer Ethiopian state power , with a host of local and external factors contributing to its success .John Young , who wrote the first academic work on the TPLF ( 1997 ) and Jenny Hammond , a former literature teacher at Oxford Brookes University , with an account strongly sympathizing with the TPLF .Both will be touched upon in subsequent chapters .5According to , among others , former EPDM members ( e.g. , Yared Tibebu 2003 ) , it was the pressure of the TPLF that forced the former multi - national EPDM to change its name and program into an ' ethnic ' organization , the ANDM .4 With the seizure of power by an ethno - nationalist force , one might assume that in post-1991 Ethiopia ethnic - based conflicts would have a better chance of being resolved .Yet after almost two decades of controversies and experimentation , ethnic - based conflicts have not gone away but grown into new forms , and , according to some , to an unprecedented level .The realization of democratic governance and self - determination for Tigrai or the rest of the Ethiopian ethno - nationalities , for that matter , remains a moot point .As Solomon Gashaw ( 1993 : 156 ) already put it as early as 1993 , ' ... the EPRDF is already encountering resistance by various groups - ethnic groups such as the Oromo have openly challenged that the EPRDF is simply a Tigraian front ' .Even before 1993 , as many as nineteen ethno - nationalist organizations were created and legally registered to challenge the EPRDF ( see Appendix 1 ) .The number of the unregistered ethnic organizations probably even went beyond that .The new state policy did not take long to have effects , both negative and positive .Clapham noted that : ' Any insurgency , dependent on mobilizing local - level support , almost necessarily must articulate concepts of identity which bind together its supporters and distinguish them from their adversaries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "100.80626"}

Walker , the executive secretary of the RDB from 1950 - 1951 and later President of Penn State University .Walker was contacted by phone in 1987 by Steinman .He was asked first whether he had attended meetings at Wright - Patterson AFB concerning the military recovery of flying saucers and bodies of occupants .According to Steinman , he responded , ' 'Yes , I attended meetings concerning that subject matter . ' 'When asked as to whether he knew about MJ-12 , he responded , ' 'Yes , I know of MJ-12 .I have known of them for 40 years . ' 'In subsequent interviews and correspondence by other researchers , Walker became much more evasive .We have learnt so much , and we are not working with them , only contact .The technology is far beyond what is known in ordinary terms of physics .

{"text": "Often the only way to dislodge a narrative is with another narrative that also fits most of the facts but shows them in a very different light .Personal Narratives .Judgments of human character are also organized around narratives .We form expectations about people 's behavior and ascribe attitudes to them that are consistent with these expectations .When we describe what individuals are like , we often do so in terms of stories about the sorts of things they usually do or the kinds of things we normally expect of them .We often judge people and explain them to others through anecdotes that reveal their characteristic be\u00ad haviors and attitudes .Family members often have stock stories that they tell about other members .These stories not only describe the character of partic\u00ad ular family members but also their place in the family , as beloved firstborn son or black sheep .[ 10 ] We also use anecdotes to characterize organizations and even entire cultures .Travel guides often contain a wealth of anecdotes that create expectations about how members of a given country are likely to behave .Just as social scripts are made from fragments of older ones , our expecta\u00ad tions about people are created from expectations about other people who seem similar to them .Moreover , in our culture we have a well - developed set of stock characters - the miser , the ladies ' man , the clinging mother , the neurotic in\u00ad tellectual , and so on -- that we use to frame our understanding of others .These stock characters are templates of expectations that we use as building blocks to form our expectations of particular people that we meet .Although our expec\u00ad tations about people may change greatly as we learn more about them , the initial framing of individuals as fitting a certain stock character may have a significant effect on the future development of our expectations about them .That is because we will tend to behave toward them according to our existing expectations .In this respect , it may well be true that first impressions are lasting ones .Often our pool of stock characters is tied to ethnic and gendered stereo\u00ad types .We have stock stories about how whites and blacks or American tourists and French waiters normally behave ( and therefore are expected to behave ) with respect to each other .We have literally hundreds of stock stories about how men and women behave , for example , with all sorts of variations -- the macho man , the passive wallflower , the stupid hunk , the femme fatale , the henpecked husband , the ditzy blonde .Each of these stock characters can form a template for organizing and giving meaning to our encounters with others .T hey are important parts of stereotypical thinking and often have significant ideological effects .Narrative structures are extremely important in interpersonal interactions , and especially close personal ones .Individuals in the early parts of an intimate relationship often talk incessantly with each other so that they can create a set of expectations about who the other person is and what he or she is like .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.694466"}

{"text": "The Truman memo An attached document of one page , dated September 24 , 1947 , was supposedly written by President Harry Truman , addressed to Secretary of Defense James Forrestal , authorizing the formation of the group ' ' Operation Majestic Twelve ' ' .In it , Truman stated he wanted ultimate decision - making power to reside with the Office of the President , after consultation with Forrestal , Hillenkoetter , and Dr. Vannevar Bush .One historical detail that perhaps supports the Truman memo 's favor was that this was the only date on which both Forrestal and Bush met with Truman .( It is also the day after Gen. Twining wrote a Secret memo saying flying saucers were real and urged an extensive investigation by multiple government agencies ) .While this does n't prove authenticity , it would suggest that if the documents were hoaxed , the hoaxer(s ) had conducted considerable research .Also , according to contemporary newspapers the Forrestal / Bush / Truman meeting concerned Bush being appointed by Truman as chairman of the new Defense Department Research and Development Board under Forrestal 's direction .The appointment was made official the following day and Forrestal swore Bush into the post a week later .The Cutler / Twining memo ( 1985 )In 1985 , Shandera and Moore began receiving post cards postmarked New Zealand with a return address of ' ' Box 189 , Addis Ababa , Ethiopia . ' 'The cards contained a series of cryptic messages referring to ' ' Reeses [ sic ] Pieces ' ' and ' ' Suitland ' ' ( among other terms ) that Shandera and Moore assumed were a code ; however , they were unable to ' ' decode ' ' the seeming message .After a few days in Suitland , Shandera and Moore discovered yet another MJ-12 document , the so - called Cutler / Twining memo , dated July 14 , 1954 .Interestingly enough , the memo turned up in ' ' Box 189 ' ' of the record group .In this memo , NSC Executive Secretary and Eisenhower?s National Security Advisor Robert Cutler informed Air Force Chief of Staff ( and alleged MJ-12 member )Nathan Twining of a change of plans in a scheduled MJ-12 briefing .The Cutler - Twining memo lacked a distinctive catalog number , leading many to suspect that whether hoaxed or genuine , the memo was almost certainly planted in the archives .Moore and Shandera have been accused of hoaxing the memo and then planting it in the archives .However , Friedman notes that the memo , unlike the other early MJ-12 papers which were available only as photos , is on original onionskin paper widely used by the government at that time .It also has some subtle historical and other details that a civilian hoaxer would be unlikely to know , such as a red pencil declassification marking also found with the other declassified files .Furthermore , NARA security procedures would make it difficult for a visitor to the Archives to plant such a document ; even the skeptical Klass argued that NARA security procedures made it highly unlikely that Shandera and Moore could have planted the Cutler - Twining memo in the archives .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.82016"}

{"text": "All radios , at home or mounted in cars are provided with an antenna which may receive radio signals from a number of broadcasting stations .Radio signals are broadcast over specific frequencies , each defining a channel .To operate the radio receiver , one has to tune it , viz .to choose the desired channel , separate it from other channels and extract the voice and/or music carried through said channel .Tuning is done by a device with a very narrow bandwidth filter .In order to be effective , the filter operates at a fixed , low frequency called IF ( Intermediate Frequency ) , which is standard at 10.7 MHz .The antenna is connected to the RF port of a mixer .The mixer also receives an input from an LO ( Local Oscillator , generally a Frequency Synthesizer ) .The mixer is a device that produces sum and difference of the radio signal received and LO inputs .The LO is tuned to a certain frequency f 0 .Only the signal which differs from said frequency by the standard IF , which is practically 10.7 MHz , will be passed by the filter , while the others will be blocked .The sound , which is carried by the signal that has passed , is extracted , amplified , and transferred to the speaker of the radio receiver .The oscillator was tuned by means of a knob in old stages of the prior art , and still is in some cases , but in modern radios the tuning is performed by a keyboard and/or digital display .Cable TV operates in a similar mode but in different frequencies .All channels at different frequencies come to the converter .At the converter , a similar process of LO and mixing occurs , which translates all of the frequencies to a single one , to which the TV set is tuned .Publicity and/or broadcasted program transmitted by radio are heard to a very considerable extent during travel by car .Since taxi drivers always keep their radio in operation , passengers are also exposed to the radio transmissions , whether they desire it or not .Therefore , an important slice of radio publicity and/or broadcasted program is that which is sounded by car radios .U.S. Pat .No . 6,643,494 B1 discloses a broadcast survey system configured to identify radio stations to which tuners are tuned .The tuners have local oscillator signals emitted therefrom .The survey system employs a method that includes generating and broadcasting a survey signal that is one of the local oscillator signals , modified to incorporate a signal identifier .This reference also discloses a method for active tuning of the survey system and another method for providing short range communication with remote transceiver to facilitate uploading and downloading of system setting and data .WO 99/62260 discloses an audience rating system for digital television and radio , using identification codes in control streams of time - multiplexed digital transmission .U.S. Pat .No . 3,800,223 discloses a monitor which includes one or more channels provided with a signal pass band window or slot that is swept at a constant rate but stopped when a television local oscillator signal enters the window .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "112.511"}

{"text": "The social consequences of status and value homophily are explained by reference to two theoretical traditions .Status homophily draws on identity theory , while value homophily pulls from social identity theory .Identity theory [ 33 ] argues that an individual defines his ' self ' in terms of how well he fulfills expectations of the various social roles from which he may choose .[34 ] A social role is a set of expectations prescribing behavior that is considered appropriate by others .This approach thus posits a definition of self in terms of others ' ( or society 's ) behavioral expectations .The complete set of these expectations in a given time and place is a description of social structure .Social identity theory , on the other hand , focuses on the way in which social categories provide definitions of self and so influence values and attitudes .[ 35 ] It focuses on intergroup interaction , suggesting that individuals act as , and are perceived as , representatives of a particular group rather than as unique selves .[36 ] .Social identity theory also addresses the process of identification with groups , including the formation of stereotypes , the positive valuation of in - group behavior and the negative valuation of out - group behavior .Social identity theory thus has a normative dimension .Identity theory , however , is structural and descriptive .It focuses on descriptions of the roles themselves and their manifestation through behavior and does not assign positive or negative value to those roles .For this reason , the type of self - identification described by social identity theory ( self - identification as a member of a group ) is more likely to lead to inter - group conflict than is the type of identification developed through role behaviors .In social identity theory , in - group and out - group behaviors become prototyped , stereotyped , and valued .In identity theory , in contrast , the primary dissonance is between individuals who do not agree on role expectations .This could lead to intra - group conflict as we see with ( for example ) the expression of different expectations for female behavior in some Muslim cultures .Relative deprivation .An individual will engage with those with whom he has high status homophily ( i.e. , with those in his status network ) .Through this engagement , he gains information about his own social condition or quality of life relative to those in his status network .This allows him to determine what is called his relative deprivation .[ 37 ] Thus , an individual compares himself to others , not to an objective standard , in order to determine his satisfaction .Efforts by individuals or groups to correct feelings of relative deprivation that emerge from the comparison of oneself to others are likely to lead to social strife or to stimulate the rise of large social movements .[ 38 ] , [ 39 ] , [ 40 ] When these perceptions of relative deprivation are combined with attitudes of ' blame ' for that relative deprivation ( which we address in the next section on stance ) , the possibility of social unrest increases .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.78221"}
