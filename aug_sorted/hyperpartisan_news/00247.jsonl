Espenshade and Alexandria Walton Radford found that white students were three times more likely to be admitted than Asians with the same academic record .I recall several years back there was a report that Stanford was rejecting numerous Asian applicants with perfect GPAs , and simultaneously allowing in some black students with ( ahem ) \" less than stellar \" GPAs .The reason ?They wanted the student body to look as precisely like society as possible , and they saw that they already had \" too many Asians \" .Is n't the reason obvious ?A far greater majority of Hispanics and blacks do n't make it to college .Thus there are a number of scholarships that try and encourage that in these communities .Furthermore , most top private universities do n't do merit scholarships any more .They instead give need based financial aid regardless of race .Yes , the world is unfair if you 're white and poor or Indian and poor ( like me ) .But overall , whites and Indians are better off .This means that there need to be some minority specific scholarships in order to give Hispanics and blacks as a whole a fighting chance at least .No one is trying to actively victimize the white man or the Indian man .Rather , given limited resources , these resources are sometimes being used to encourage underrepresented minorities to attend college .One of my best friends is a fall , busty blonde who only ever dates Asian guys .Not even , like , good - looking Asian guys , too , they 're all really weird - looking , short , super skinny guys .That 's just what she likes .To be honest , they just want you to bring them to America .Get them a green card .Then they will divorce you and start bring their whole family over .You 're not attractive .Your country is .Tell them you came from Iran or something , see how they perceive you now .Happened to some of my friend .There was a time where a lot of Vietnamese girls wanting to marry Korean because according to their drama , Korean has a very fun life .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.51155"}

Whiting decision might at first glance belie this view , but the regulations at issue there fit neatly within an explicit exemption in federal law .With preemption analysis perhaps more than anything else on the Supreme Court docket , text matters .For example , Rhode Island law enforcement officers have long been checking immigration status during traffic stops as a matter of policy .As - applied challenges are still possible in future , of course , depending on the policies and practices of particular law enforcement agencies and officers .But a law 's constitutionality is , again , not synonymous with its wisdom .As I said above , S.B. 1070 is an unsurprising reaction to the federal government 's failure to both enforce existing law and reform that law in a manner that would make sense for economic , security , and civic - cultural interests .But noble \" \" or at least understandable \" \" goals are neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for good public policy .The law 's proponents tend to invoke the deleterious effects illegal immigrants have on our economy by way of taxing federal , state , and local social services and engaging in a disproportionate amount of criminal activity .Research on these issues shows otherwise .As my colleague Dan Griswold found in a 2009 report , even though the number of legal and illegal immigrants in the United States has risen strongly since the early 1990s , the size of the economic underclass has not .From 1993 through 2007 , the number of people living below the poverty line declined by 2 million , from 39.3 million to 37.3 million .Similarly , a 1 million increase in immigrants living in poverty was more than matched by a 3 million drop in native - born Americans under the poverty line .( These figures might be less rosy now , but the immigration - related effects \" \" holding constant for the Great Recession \" \" would no doubt remain the same . )", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.584404"}

{"text": "However , the recent US Supreme Court rulings did find that colleges have a compelling interest in the use of race in admissions , and so affirmative action is not in itself unconstitutional .( The government may treat individual people differently according to race only for the most compelling reasons and when the racial classification is narrowly tailored to further those compelling interests .When race must be considered to further a compelling interest , it does not violate the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment when the use of race is narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling interest and the goal is sufficiently compelling to warrant the use of race . )Rather , it is only the University of Michigan 's automated approach using a point system that is not narrowly tailored and hence unconstitutional .As a result , it appears that Title VI of the CRA does not prohibit the use of race in admissions and financial aid .This means that private colleges can continue to consider using race in college admissions and financial aid , to the extent that they do not rely on mechanical formulas involving race .Since private colleges tend to review every application and use a more subjective process , they can avoid the need to use an automated system involving race .This gives them an advantage over public colleges , which are often faced with a much larger applicant pool and class size .There are also several Federal regulations that prohibit discrimination in the provision of financial aid .For example , 45 CFR 80.3(b ) prohibits discrimination on the basis of race , color or national origin in the awarding of financial aid under programs receiving federal assistance through the Department of Health and Human Services .Similarly , 34 CFR 1200.130(b ) prohibits discrimination on the basis of handicap .Race - based Scholarships Funded by Private Donors .There is also some debate about whether schools may administer minority scholarships that are funded by private donors .Rice University , for example , has rejected donations from alumni who sought to place racial restrictions on scholarship funds .On the other hand , there is no problem with purely private minority scholarships such as the Gates Millennium Scholarship Fund and the United Negro College Fund .The problem arises when the college has a role in the selection of recipients or provides resources for the raising of funds .If the private donor specifies a selection method that provides the school with little or no room for subjective judgment , such as requiring the minority scholarship to be awarded to the most academically talented minority student who demonstrates financial need , such an award would likely be constitutional .Likewise if the donor selects the recipients directly .The issue is who controls the selection process and the extent of this control .Does or will the organization ( or any department or division within it ) discriminate in any way on the basis of race with respect to admissions ; use of facilities or exercise of student privileges ; faculty or administrative staff ; or scholarship or loan programs ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.703724"}

Bush 's administration saw a marked increase in illegal immigration and a drop in immigration enforcement throughout much of his tenure .For example , the number of illegal aliens arrested in workplace cases fell from nearly 3,000 in 1999 to 445 in 2003 , with the number of criminal cases against employers during this period falling from 182 to four .Not surprisingly , by 2005 , there were an estimated 10 - 20 million illegal aliens living in the United States .Despite the failure of past amnesties and the fact that these increase illegal immigration , Bush repeatedly pushed mass legalization ( amnesty ) schemes for illegal immigrants using the well - worn line that they \" are doing jobs Americans will not \" or \" are not \" doing .One scheme was the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act 2007 which was defeated by widespread popular opposition .Today , over 1 million immigrants enter our country legally per year , while the illegal alien population grows by about 500,000 per year .Most of those who violate our borders and enter illegally come from Mexico and other Latin American countries .Only about 6 percent of the illegals come from Canada and Europe .Close to half of all illegal immigrants now residing in the U.S. did not enter illegally but rather overstayed their visas .Just as the federal government has historically failed to secure its borders , it has concurrently failed to closely monitor visa holders .About 12 - 20 million illegal aliens currently reside in the United States .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "62.28844"}

Dowell , vice - president of the California Federation of Labor , testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Immigration in February of 1928 about the burden of the unrestricted flow of Mexicans on the state 's taxpayers , prisons , hospitals and American workers ' wages .He estimated that while 67,000 Mexicans entered the U.S. legally the prior year , many times that number entered illegally .Furthermore , a Los Angeles Times story from April 1926 noted that many of the ranch workers in California 's Imperial Valley entered the U.S. illegally without passing the ( then ) literacy test and did not pay the $ 18 entrance fee .Visas were required for legal residency .Immigration dropped sharply during the lean years of the Great Depression .After the stock market crashed in 1929 , the U.S. tightened visa rules which markedly reduced Mexican immigration .Local , state and federal government officials debated what to do with those already here .Some Mexicans repatriated themselves either voluntarily or under pressure from local welfare officials .Others were deported .Eventually between about 500,000 to 1,000,000 Mexicans left the United States between 1929 and 1939 .This was due to deportation , as well as other factors such as the threat of deportation and acute unemployment .This repatriation began during President Herbert Hoover 's administration and reached its peak in the early 1930s .It also applied to all alien groups , not just Mexicans .Hoover believed they were taking jobs from Americans , and endorsed a vigorous effort to reduce legal and illegal entries and expel \" undesirable aliens . \"Deportations and repatriations of Mexicans and others decreased ( along with legal immigration ) during President Franklin Roosevelt 's administration , during the Great Depression , but did not end .In July 1935 , for example , Roosevelt ordered a large deportation of alien criminals ( such as mail robbers ) , but exempted Mexican and Canadian criminals due to the fear that they would sneak back in .Today 's high level of illegal immigration originated during the war years of the early 1940s .Labor shortages caused the federal government to set up a program to import Mexican laborers to work temporarily in agriculture , primary in the Southwest .This was called the Bracero Program .The goal was to import foreign workers ( originally thought to number in the hundreds ) during agricultural harvest and then encourage them to go home .Over the next two decades about 4.8 million Mexican workers came into the country and provided cheap labor to many U.S. employers .Although braceros were supposed to be hired only if an adequate number of Americans could not be found , employers preferred the foreign workers who were willing to work for lesser wages .The program finally ended in 1964 due to complaints from unions and Mexican - Americans that these foreigners were taking jobs from them .Not surprisingly , many of the former braceros reentered and worked in the U.S. illegally -- many for the same employers .Illegal immigration increased greatly during the years of the supposed \" temporary work \" Bracero Program .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.84154"}

{"text": "For background information about this case , please see our previous post .Tuesday 's arguments focused primarily on a piece of the Equal Protection Clause , known as the \" political process doctrine , \" which states that political processes can not be altered in a way that puts minorities at a disadvantage .This , they argue , places an unfair and disadvantageous burden on minorities .Swing vote , Justice Anthony M. Kennedy , expressed doubts about whether Proposition 2 truly violates the political process doctrine and only two liberal members of the court voiced major criticisms of the Michigan measure .Thus , with Justice Elena Kagan recused from the case , the numbers point toward the court upholding Proposition 2 .Such a decision would effectively preserve similar bans adopted by voters in Arizona , California , Nebraska , Oklahoma , and Washington ; by lawmakers in New Hampshire ; and by the public university governing board in Florida .In addition , it could theoretically embolden campaigns for similar ballot measures elsewhere .While it seems clear the Justices will rule in favor of Michigan , it is less clear whether the Justices are interested in reversing the political process doctrine , which dates back more than 40 years .In 1982 , for example , the justices ruled against a Washington referendum that attempted to prevent Seattle from using a local busing program to desegregate schools .NPR reports that Michigan Solicitor General , John Bursch , \" urged the Supreme Court to reverse the Seattle decision and others like it , if necessary .\"Oct .The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) recently released \" Skills Outlook 2013 , \" a report that studies adults ' skills in literacy , numeracy , and technology across 24 countries .While Japan and Finland ranked first and second respectively in average scores , the United States scored significantly below average in all three fields .Many experts worry that the US will not be able to compete in a global marketplace unless we are able to improve proficiency in these skill areas .Furthermore , socioeconomic background was a greater predictor of skill proficiency in the United States than in other countries , indicating large social disparities and a low potential for upward mobility .However , socioeconomic background was less of a predictor for younger US adults , meaning ( perhaps ) that socioeconomic background is becoming less of a barrier with time .Lastly , not only did the US score below average in all areas , there was hardly any improvement between younger and older generations .For numeracy , older US adults ( ages 55 - 65 ) performed near the average , but younger US adults ( ages 16 - 24 ) scored dead last among all participating countries .This last point is particularly concerning as it suggests young people are entering a much more demanding labor market , but are not much better prepared than those who are retiring .These disappointing results raise an interesting question : if the US has such a dearth of skilled workers , how is it able to remain an innovative and productive economy ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.41962"}
