Bush 's brother , on the line .Governor Bush asks coldly , \" Who is Ed Kast , and why is he giving an interview on national television ? \" Harris is unsure who Kast is for a moment .Kast is the assistant director of elections , whose division reports to her office .The governor does not want the media narrative to focus on recounts and voter intent , and has already tasked his general counsel with the job of getting Kast off the air as quickly as possible .( CNN \" loses \" Kast 's transmission in mid - sentence minutes later . )Democrats have questioned the propriety of having the Florida official with ultimate authority over elections being a state chairman for a presidential campaign before now , and in the coming days , the question will devolve into outright accusations of partisanship and impropriety .Harris has called herself \" thrilled and honored \" to be part of the Bush campaign , and served as a Bush delegate during the Republican National Convention .During the campaign , she often traveled around Florida representing the ticket .Representative Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) says of Harris : \" She is clearly a partisan Republican - and there 's nothing illegal about that .And I give everyone the benefit of the doubt , expecting them to perform their public functions appropriately .But her actions will speak volumes about whether she is qualified .If she does this fairly , fine .But if she acts as an emissary for Bush to steal this election in Florida , she will delegitimize Florida 's vote count . \" Harris gives some initial media interviews on November 8 , and according to a 2004 Vanity Fair article , \" appear[s ] overwhelmed and uninformed .\" She does not know what county elections supervisors have been doing , and seems unaware of the chaos surrounding the Palm Beach County \" butterfly ballot \" ( see November 9 , 2000 ) and other ballot disputes .The Bush campaign senses trouble and assigns Harris a \" minder , \" Florida Republican lobbyist Mac Stipanovich , a former campaign advisor for Jeb Bush and a close Bush ally .Stipanovich , the Vanity Fair article will observe , \" appealed to Harris 's grandiosity .( Her emails replying to Bush supporters later revealed that she had begun identifying with Queen Esther , who , in the Old Testament , saved the Jews from genocide .
