Prater has the conclusion of the investigation on his desk and is currently making his decision on what should be done .Call : .David Prater Oklahoma County D.A. Main Office Location : 320 Robert S. Kerr , Room 505 Oklahoma City , OK 73102 Phone:(405 ) 713 - 1600 .But murder is legal for cops .So why would they get in any trouble ?I mean , 2 different sets of cops in California that opened fire on completely innocent people who posed absolutely no threat to the cops , and they did n't even get a ticket .So face it people , cops can shoot who they want , when they want , and as long as they bring up their old pal Officer Safety , they 're off the hook .Traci .Common Sense must be one of these heartless band wagoners that has never been in any trouble or had a speeding ticket .You can get a warrant from not paying a parking ticket .I would hate to see people start getting mowed down for such a simple warrant .RIP .This is so stupid just like how tho cops killed a poor dog and the dog did nothing Cops now a days are corrupted .God bless us all ... .Common Sense , Lord and Master of Zion . \"Zion ? \" Like from the \" Matrix ? \" Or were you going for \" Zion Park \" and just could n't spell it correctly ?Sorry sport , there is no god for whom to bless anyone .Maybe you 'd like to see something from Aesop .The fables are far shorter and much easier to read , and they do n't compell those with differing views to wage war on the other .Doug .Years back , a cop was killed because he pulled his gun on someone that was doing nothing wrong .The guy that shot the cop , was cleared as self defense .Would that be a nice change of scenery .A criminal actually getting what was coming to them . shawn .@d0nj3nko .Common trashes God , so he ca n't be a Zionist .Another example of cops pumped up on adrenaline and praying for the chance to kill .Oathkeeper .Usms and obndd on a burglary warrant ?Hmmmmmmm ?It 's absolutly amazing how many rounds are fired when cops are not trained to the point of even safely drawing their weapons .I always found it was better to out smart the bad guys so I would n't have to out shoot them !Although outshooting an unarmed couple seems to have been pretty hard for this band of alleged LE !I guess being professional is no longer a requirement for LE .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.533405"}

{"text": "What was he trying to hide ?If we had that video , many of the questions surrounding the shooting would likely have been cleared up by now .What we do know is that 11 of 12 witnesses said that Alan was on the ground before Masso fired , in sharp contrast to Masso 's statement .What we do know is that Alan was killed by Masso as the result of a racist stop and frisk practice built around a discourse labeling all black and brown young men as dangerous , particularly at night .Many police departments believe they have a license to kill these young men whether or not there is an objective reason to believe they are dangerous .What we do know is that police are killing unarmed citizens who pose no immediate threat at an alarming and increasing rate .Over and over police reports state that an officer \" thought he had a weapon \" or the victim was \" reaching for his waistband \" , only to find out that the dead victim was shot , sometimes in the back , unarmed .Q. Is it true Officer Masso shot himself ? A. Yes .Officer Masso fired four shots .One of them ended up going into his foot .Q. What did the Coroner 's report have to say about Alan ? A. The Coroner 's report said there was no gun residue on Alan 's hands , meaning that he never fired a weapon .Nor did he have any alcohol or drugs in his body .Q. Was there some issue with the Coroner 's report ? A. Yes .For reasons which are unclear , the Oakland Police demanded that the Alameda Coroner not release the report .Q. When did the Blueford family first go to the City Council ? A. In mid - May , a few weeks after Alan 's death .Q. What happened ? A. Council members , especially President Larry Reid , promised their help in finding out what had happened to Alan .Q. Did they get that promised help ? A. No .Q. What is the Justice 4 Alan Blueford Coalition ( JAB ) ? A. A group of people who came together to help the Blueford family obtain the truth .They come from all walks of life and belong to various existing organizations .It seeks to find justice for Alan and to try to ensure that no further such murders are allowed to happen .Q. What has JAB done ? A. JAB has organized two BBQ 's for community awareness , held multiple press conferences , held a rally in downtown Oakland , gone en - masse twice to City Council meetings , analyzed the District Attorney 's report entitled \" Investigation of the Shooting Death of Alan Blueford . \" and reached out to community organizations , churches and labor unions seeking support against police violence .Q. Did JAB shut down a City Council meeting ? A. Yes .In mid - September , after months of non - action by the Council and the City , the Blueford family and JAB stood in front of the City Council demanding justice and specifically demanding the police report on Alan 's death , not yet released .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.461426"}

{"text": "Mumia Abu - Jamal talked about the campaign for justice for Alan Blueford on his Nov. 4 Prison Radio broadcast .Q. Who was Alan Blueford ? A. Alan was a just - turned 18 year old high school student attending Skyline High School in Oakland , CA .His parents are Adam and Jeralyn Blueford .Q. When and where was Alan Blueford killed ? A. Alan was killed at approximately 12:05 AM on May 6th , 2012 , in the driveway of 9230 Birch St , Oakland , CA .Q. Who killed him , and how ? A. Oakland Policeman Miguel Masso fired three bullets at Alan , one striking his shoulder , one his right chest , and one close to the heart .Q. What happened ? A. Officer Masso and his partner stopped Alan and two friends as they were walking on 90thSt. After being stopped , for reasons unknown , Alan decided to run .Officer Masso decided to chase him .The chase went on for approximately four blocks until Allan and Officer Masso arrived at 9230 Birch .At this point accounts diverge .Either Alan was shot once , stumbled into driveway , and was shot twice more while lying on his back , or he stumbled into a gate , fell into the driveway and was then shot three times while lying on his back .Q. What were Alan 's last words ? A.According to multiple witnesses Alan said \" I did n't do anything ! \"Q. Did Alan have a gun ? A. There is no conclusive evidence one way or another .A gun was found long after Alan was killed , 20 feet away from Alan 's body up an inclined driveway .Despite multiple witnesses present , none reported seeing a gun move from where Alan lay to the location where the gun was found .Q. Did witnesses say that Alan had a gun ? A. Most did not say anything one way or the other in their signed statements .Some of the witnesses are immigrants who may be concerned about their own safety .It was dark , things happened quickly , and multiple shots were fired by the policeman , leading understandably to confusion .We do know that Officer Masso said to his partner after - the - fact \" I swear he had a gun ! \"An odd turn of phrase if Masso was sure Alan had a gun .Q. Why did Officer Miguel Masso kill Alan Blueford ?( Did he have a good reason to shoot him ? ) A. We do n't know exactly why Masso shot Alan .We probably never will .What we do know is that Officer Masso helped torture a defenseless prisoner in a NY City jail cell , and then refused to call for medical attention ( this is documented by the NY Police Department ) .What we do know is that Officer Masso served as an MP in Iraq .What we do know is that Officer Masso claimed in his report that he freaked out , perhaps a minute before he shot Alan , and was unable to hear or think clearly .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.321884"}
