Security Council Resolution 1973 for military intervention in Libya .On that day Clinton ordered a general within the Pentagon to refuse to take a call from Gadhafi 's son Seif and other high - level members within the regime , to help negotiate a resolution .A day later , on March 18 , 2011 , Gadhafi himself called for a cease - fire , another action the administration dismissed .In released , but redacted emails , Clinton expressed interest in arming Libyan opposition groups using private security contractors , though at the time , the opposition was not formally recognized by the U.S. or United Nations , which prohibited arming without following strict guidelines and oversight .In an April 8 , 2011 email to her then - deputy chief of staff , Jake Sullivan , Clinton wrote : \" FYI .The idea of using private security experts to arm the opposition should be considered , \" attaching an intelligence report from adviser Sidney Blumenthal , her preferred source of intelligence .Many of those weapons would ultimately be destined for Syria .The cargo reportedly included surface - to - air anti - aircraft missiles , RPG 's and Russian - designed shoulder - launched missiles known as MANPADS , all believed destined for Syrian rebel groups .Both Obama and Clinton had a vested interest in lying about Benghazi and permanently concealing the truth ; Obama to ensure his reelection prospects in 2012 and Hillary to protect hers for 2016 .It is significant , however , that Clinton was the most aggressive administration official promoting the arming of the Libyan Islamists and the first to associate the video with the Benghazi attack ( see timeline ) as well as its most vigorous and persistent advocate . \"The present Shia - Sunni civil war in Iraq was fueled by American abdication of a foreign policy in Syria , where we sub - contracted our interests to Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Turkey .Instead of dealing directly with the moderate Free Syrian Army , we outsourced the funding and arming responsibilities .They then pursued their own interests ; the Saudis supporting radical Islamic Salafis , while the Turks and Qataris backed the Muslim Brotherhood , all of which was at least partially meant to counter growing Iranian influences in the region , but complicating America 's anti - terrorism efforts . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.528"}
