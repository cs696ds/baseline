's Catholic Archdiocese , who likened the bill to techniques used by Nazis that compelled people to turn each other in .The Arizona legislature just passed the country 's most retrogressive , mean - spirited , and useless anti - immigrant law .The tragedy of the law is its totally flawed reasoning : that immigrants come to our country to rob , plunder , and consume public resources .That is not only false , the premise is nonsense .Speaking at the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce 's Black and White Ball on Saturday , she said - .In regards to Senate Bill 1070 , I will tell you that I never make comment , like most governor 's throughout our country , before a bill reaches my desk .But I hear you , and I will assure you that I will do what I believe is the right thing so that everyone is treated fairly .Amongst those who support the bill is Senator Russell Pearce , author of SB 1070 , who has defended it against accusations of racial profiling saying , \" That 's the biggest myth in the world ...Illegal is a crime .It 's not a race .\" While it might come as a surprise to most of us that all but one Republican in the Arizona Senate supported the bill ( all the Democrats opposed it ) , it is clear that many opinions around the bill are being shaped by upcoming election mania .His office later said his comments did not represent an endorsement , but did not deny his support to the bill either .When the fate of the country rests in the hands of politicians who can only see as far as the next election , we can only hope that the courageous voices that are constantly fighting for equality , justice and human rights , are not ignored .Take action and tell Governor Brewer that vetoing SB 1070 is the only option .Tonight , Arizona 's future hangs in the balance as Arizona Governor Jan Brewer decides whether to sign SB 1070 , one of the harshest anti - immigrant bills in recent memory , into law .The bill will be forwarded to the Governor 's desk this evening and could ostensibly be signed into law by midnight tonight .Ironically titled the \" Safe Neighborhoods Bill \" , the bill makes it mandatory for state and local police to stop anyone based on a \" reasonable suspicion \" of being undocumented , effectively mandating racial profiling and creating panic across communities .Immigration law is within the domain of the federal government , not local police , but the bill is egregious even in its application of due process , allowing for the arrest of people without a warrant including day laborers and those who hire them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.23652"}

Gutierrez , of Puerto Rican descent himself and a big advocate for immigration reform , said that the situation is going from bad to worse .He saw Eduardo 's case in Chicago to be emblematic of everything that would go wrong if Arizona 's anti - immigrant law was to be implemented .In Arizona , they want everybody to be able to prove they 're legally in the country .They want everybody to prove that they 're an American citizen .Here we had an American citizen , that the federal government ... could not determine , for more than three days , his status as an American citizen .It 's very , very , very dangerous ground to tread .While Caraballo is considering legal action , Rep. Gutierrez is hoping that this outrageous incident will demonstrate the risk involved in the local police enforcing immigration law , and open the eyes of Congress and the White house to the dangers of racial profiling .The urgent need for a reversal of Arizona 's law and a broader immigration reform bill has led to a series of protests around the country .Organizers say that they will continue resisting until their demands are met .And on May 29th , civil rights groups and immigrant activists are organizing a massive rally against Arizona 's SB1070 law .The boycott against Arizona has been put on hold for the weekend as thousands of protesters are expected to arrive from across the country to join in a march of defiance against the state .In addition to over 50,000 people , the rally will include speeches by the DREAM Act students , Rep.

{"text": "But the spirit of reform has been strangled by an \" over - reliance on enforcement policies \" .There has been little growth in community alternatives to detention or legally enforceable standards and people continue to face poor medicare care and substandard conditions .2009 has seen the growth of partnerships with state and local law - enforcement that arm them with the power to enforce immigration law even though this is a federal responsibility .There has been a growth in programs that criminally prosecute those caught crossing the border , draining resources away from prosecution of serious crimes such as drug and human trafficking .And the failures .There has been little tangible progress in the areas of due process , with the immigration court system continuing to remain overburdened , and an appeals process still compromised .The continued expansion of state and local law enforcement programs like Secure Communities and 287(g ) programs have led to accusations of racial profiling and large scale prosecutions of individuals with no criminal history .But although there are many areas where reform is desperately needed , ultimately these will be administrative measures carried by an administrative agency DHS .But the fundamental problems of the system will continue to grow until Congress works up the courage to institute just and humane immigration reform .It took courage for 18-year old Olympian bronze medalist Simon Cho to relate the inspirational story of his life as an immigrant in America .Born in Seoul , Simon came to the U.S. with his family at the age of four as an undocumented immigrant .Aspiring to give their children the American Dream , Simon 's parents worked tirelessly , day and night , to ensure that their children got the opportunities they deserved .While Simon 's parents worked hard in their seafood shop 365 days of the year , Simon devoted most of his time to speed skating , a sport he was exceptionally good at .Realizing their son 's talent , Simon 's parents sold their shop and everything they had in order to afford his full - time training with the Olympic team in Salt Lake City .Now a U.S. citizen ( due to more relaxed immigration regulations at the time ) , Simon tried for and made the U.S. Olympic speed skating team as one its youngest athletes , returning from this year 's Vancouver games with a bronze medal for the U.S. .Like Simon , thousands of immigrant youth have the potential to realize the American Dream and make their country pride .Unfortunately , many of them never get the chance to do so , and instead , live in fear despite having lived in America most of their lives .21-year old Jessica Colotl , a student of Political Science and French at Kennesaw State University in Georgia , is a case in point .A bright , diligent young woman , Jessica worked nights in order to pay her tuition and hopes to continue her education and become a lawyer after graduating in the fall .Sounds like someone you know ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.2592"}

Raul Grijalva calling for an economic boycott of Arizona as a consequence of SB1070 , a move which led to the closure of his Tucson and Yuma offices after receiving threats of violence .I am asking national organizations across this country , civic , religious , of color , unions , women 's organizations , not to have their conferences and conventions in this state , until we rectify this law .Rep. Raul Grijalva continued his calls for an economic boycott , calling on the Obama administration to oppose the new law by refusing to cooperate with local law enforcement in Arizona saying - .We 're going to overturn this unjust and racist law , and then we 're going to overturn the power structure that created this unjust , racist law .Rep. Luis Gutierrez denounced the Obama administration 's inaction on immigration reform and the federal 287(g ) program which he held responsible for setting a precedent for Sen. Russell Pearce 's SB1070 law .Let me just say , every time the federal government said that you can carry out a 287(g ) extension , you gave Arizona an excuse to do 1070 ...Now it is time to say no more excuses , no more enforcement - only actions .It is time to bring about comprehensive immigration reform once and for all .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.62634"}
