Bush administration .The vote came after Sen. Rand Paul dropped his opposition to a confirmation vote on Comey , clearing the path for the Senate to vote on the president 's nominee .In the 93 - 1 vote , Paul was the only senator who voted against the confirmation .Paul , a Republican from Kentucky , had blocked a confirmation vote this summer while demanding answers from the law enforcement agency about the legal use of surveillance drones in the United States .The FBI had responded to his questions twice as of last week , saying they acquire a warrant before using a drone when a suspected individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy .But Paul sent another letter Thursday asking for more clarification on the FBI 's understanding of a \" reasonable expectation of privacy . \"Paul announced Monday that the FBI had responded again , reiterating that the Supreme Court 's interpretation of a reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment would \" apply to all of our investigations and any collection of information . \"Although he was n't satisfied with the answer , he decided to withdraw his hold on Comey 's nomination .\" I disagree with this interpretation .However , given the fact that they did respond to my concerns over drone use on U.S. soil , I have decided to release my hold on the pending FBI director nominee , \" Paul said in a statement .On Monday , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy called on senators to support Comey so the FBI could have a confirmed director before Congress breaks for its month - long August recess and before the 12-year tenure of the current director , Robert Mueller , ends in September .The Vermont Democrat noted this was the first time an FBI director nominee had been filibustered in history .Obama nominated Comey on June 21 .\" We should be voting to confirm James Comey tonight .It has already taken twice as long to bring this nomination up for a vote in the full Senate as for any previous FBI director , \" Leahy said in a statement . \"No other FBI director has waited longer than 20 days from nomination to confirmation .The FBI director plays a vital role in our national security , and the Senate must put an end to these routine delays . \" In his role as deputy attorney general during the Bush administration , Comey received both praise and criticism from outside groups .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "44.15823"}

Bush administration , as U.S. attorney in Manhattan and then as deputy U.S. attorney general to Attorney General John Ashcroft .Comey is credited with heading off White House officials who were trying to get a woozy Ashcroft to approve a warrantless surveillance program from his hospital room in 2004 .But the American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concern Comey approved waterboarding of terror suspects and the detention of a U.S. citizen without charges on U.S. soil .After leaving the Bush administration , Comey spent five years at Lockheed Martin as general counsel and senior vice president .He also served as general counsel for Connecticut hedge fund Bridgewater Associates .Since leaving Bridgewater in early 2013 , he 's been affiliated with Columbia Law School , Politico said . \"In Jim Comey , the men and women of the FBI will have the leadership of one of our nation 's most skilled and respected national security and law enforcement professionals , \" a White House official told The Hill . \"In more than two decades as a prosecutor and national security professional , Jim has demonstrated unwavering toughness , integrity and principle in defending both our security and our values . \"United Press International is a leading provider of news , photos and information to millions of readers around the globe via UPI.com and its licensing services .UPI also provides insightful reports on key topics of geopolitical importance , including energy and security .A Spanish version of the site reaches millions of readers in Latin America and beyond .UPI was founded in 1907 by E.W.
