{"text": "( AP Photo / Rich Pedroncelli ) .SACRAMENTO , Calif.( AP ) - Legislation approved Thursday by the state Senate would send more money to a program unique to California that seizes guns from people who are prohibited from having them , a number that has risen to nearly 20,000 .The bill authorizes $ 24 million for the state Department of Justice 's Armed and Prohibited Persons program , which is the only one of its kind in the nation .It prohibits gun ownership for people convicted of a felony or a violent misdemeanor , who are subject to a domestic violence restraining order or who are determined to be mentally unstable .The department has confiscated more than 10,000 weapons under the program since 2006 but has a backlog of nearly 20,000 people because it has too few agents to go after the weapons .Those individuals own about 39,000 handguns and 1,600 assault weapons , said Sen. Mark Leno , D - San Francisco , the author of SB140 .The additional money would come from a surplus in fees paid for firearms purchases .It would let the department hire six supervisors , 30 special agents and support staff to create six new teams to seize the weapons .They use a computerized system that cross - matches five databases to identify people who bought guns but are not allowed to own them .It 's the first bill to be considered by the Legislature from among the dozens of gun control measures introduced after recent mass shootings , particularly the Newtown , Conn. , school massacre .\" We have a chance to get those weapons now .The money 's there .\" The Senate passed the emergency legislation 31 - 0 , with support from eight Republicans .The bill would take effect immediately if it is approved by the Assembly and signed by Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown .Despite the bipartisan vote , some Republican lawmakers objected that the money should come from general taxes instead of the $ 19 fee on firearms purchases or transfers .The surplus shows that the fee should be reduced , said Sen. Ted Gaines , R - Roseville .Sen. Jim Nielsen , R - Gerber , criticized the Department of Justice for not already spending the surplus to seize illegally held weapons , although Leno noted that the Legislature took $ 11.5 million from that fund to help close a budget deficit .The large surplus has accumulated in recent years only because so many people are buying weapons in anticipation of tighter gun controls , he said .Nielsen abstained from voting on the bill , but Gaines and Sen. Joel Anderson , R - La Mesa , were among eight Republicans voting for it .\" This is not an easy decision for me , \" said Anderson , who supports gun - owners ' rights but co - authored Leno 's bill .\" I 'm making the best choice I can to protect my Second Amendment rights , but most importantly , to protect Californians .I ca n't sit idly by and allow 6-year - olds to be shot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.17437"}

F. James Sensenbrenner , a Wisconsin Republican who heads the committee .In an unusual twist , many members of the committee said they were voting for the legislation not because of strong concerns over Net neutrality -- but instead because of a turf battle .They said they were worried that a competing proposal already approved by a different committee last month would diminish their own influence in the future .That other bill , called the Communications Opportunity , Promotion and Enhancement , or COPE , Act , says the Federal Communications Commission \" shall have exclusive authority \" to investigate violations of Net neutrality principles .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.26104"}

Berman ( D - Mission Hills ) and put them in an adjacent district represented by Brad Sherman ( D - Sherman Oaks ) .Berman 's district also was pushed farther south into predominantly white areas of the Hollywood Hills , while Sherman 's district was moved north and wrapped around Berman 's district , to include many Latinos living in Sylmar and some nearby areas .MALDEF asserts that this would dilute Latino registered voters in Berman 's district from 45 % to 31 % in next year 's Democratic primary .The change would about double the number of Latino registered voters in Sherman 's district , but still leave them far short of the numbers required to threaten the incumbent .Other assertions in the suit are that the redistricting was designed to protect state Sen. Betty Karnette ( D - Long Beach ) and Rep. Bob Filner ( D - San Diego ) by reducing the Latino vote in their districts .Berman 's brother , longtime Democratic redistricting consultant Michael Berman , drew up the Senate and congressional redistricting plans approved this year , and many past redistricting plans as well .However , the courts have occasionally stepped in to redraw his plans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.71239"}

{"text": "How finely ?When the San Mateo County - centered Assembly district now represented by veteran lawmaker Lou Papan was reconfigured , legislators very carefully excluded the home of county Supervisor Mike Nevin , discouraging him from challenging Papan 's daughter , Gina , for the seat .Nevin opted out .Nevin 's experience was replicated throughout the state as lines included or excluded areas to create a specific political outcome , either partisan or personal , in advance of any election - not exactly an exercise in textbook democracy .It 's no secret , for example , that Democratic leaders changed Rep. Gary Condit 's Central Valley district to both discourage the scandal - tinged congressman from running for re - election and make it more difficult for any Republican candidate .One of the subtler refinements is found in Contra Costa County Congresswoman Ellen Tauscher 's district .Democrat Tauscher had refused to support San Francisco Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi 's bid for Democratic whip and Pelosi 's pals punished Tauscher by dropping conservative suburbs from her district and expanding it into liberal , labor - oriented communities , forcing her to walk the party line more closely .What happened to Assemblyman Fred Keeley , D - Boulder Creek , is a classic example of how personal politics affected redistricting .Although Keeley is regarded as one of the Assembly 's brightest and hardest working members , his ambition to succeed Republican Bruce McPherson in the state Senate ran afoul of leadership priorities in both houses .McPherson 's coastal district was carved up in ways that helped another Democratic assemblyman , Dennis Cardoza of Merced , seek a Senate seat if he wishes ( although it now looks as if Cardoza will run for Condit 's congressional seat ) .And Keeley did n't get any sympathy from the Democratic leader of the state Senate , John Burton , because Keeley had refused Burton 's offer of support to challenge McPherson last year .Burton ( brother of Phil ) also played a key role in changing the lines of his own San Francisco - based district to help his old pal , San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown , return to the Legislature after his reign as mayor ends .The new Senate lines split the heart of San Francisco 's gay community , the Castro district , and thus erode the base that Assemblywoman Carole Migden or some other gay or lesbian candidate would need to run for the Senate .In preserving the partisan status quo and drawing lines to favor political insiders , the establishment , almost by necessity , ran roughshod over political hopes of California 's non - white communities .Many Latinos are bitter about not achieving big gains in either the Legislature or Congress under the plans and San Jose 's Asian - American community was fragmented among several districts , for example .The new maps are now in effect and throughout the state , candidates are lining up to run .But those who believe they were short - changed are complaining , and taking those complaints to court .Keeley , for instance , has joined a plea by Latino groups to U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft to intercede under the Voting Rights Act .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "106.27129"}
