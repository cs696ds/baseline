'Liquid biopsy ' relying on detection of either circulating tumor cells ( CTCs ) or extracellular RNAs encapsulated in exosomes in patient blood samples has great potential to achieve this goal .Furthermore , none are able to simultaneously capture and detect both circulating exosomes and CTCs .We recently developed a simple and low - cost method ' Tethered Cationic Lipoplex Nanoparticle ( TCLN ) biochip ' that , for the first time , may achieve this goal ( a manuscript is under review in Nature Nanotechnology ) .In TCLN , molecular beacons ( MBs ) are pre - loaded in liposome nanoparticles to capture circulating exosomes and detect encapsulated extracellular RNAs from the patient blood or fluid sample without extra complicity .The in situ detection of target RNAs without diluting the sample leads to very high detection sensitivity not achievable by existing methods , e.g. qRT - PCR .The same biochip can also detect intracellular biomarkers in the captured CTCs by lipoplex internalization .Preliminary data in lung cancer cell line and patient blood samples using miR-21 and TTF-1 mRNA as biomarkers are very promising .TCLN can be extended to a multiplexing array design to allow the detection of many targets for RNA profiling .This new method may also be applied to other cancers and viral infection .In this proposal , we plan to evaluate its feasibility for early lung and liver cancer detection and surveillance .With data gathered from this project , we will submit two R01 or R33 proposals to NCI in two years and a P01 proposal in the future .This proposal is highly recommended by Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center ( NSEC ) at OSU .If funded , NSEC and the College of Engineering will match $ 50K / year for 2 years to allow the proposal team to pursue a broader scope of this challenging project .STAT3 as a Mediator of Immune Suppression in the Pancreatic Cancer Stroma Awardees : Greg Lesinski and Michael Ostrowski .One important hallmark of pancreatic cancer ( PCa ) is the dense stroma consisting of activated fibroblasts termed ' pancreatic stellate cells ' ( PSC ) that surround each tumor .This fibrotic material arises due to chronic inflammation in the pancreatic microenvironment .Although these stromal cells produce numerous factors supporting tumor growth , little is known regarding their interactions with immune cells within the tumor microenvironment .Our data shows that PSC secrete factors that promote differentiation of immune cells into myeloid derived suppressor cells ( MDSC ) .We hypothesize that STAT3 signal transduction in the tumor - associated stroma is essential for promoting immune suppression in PCa .Our long - term goal is to develop a comprehensive research program aimed at understanding how the stroma influences local and systemic immune suppression in PCa .This knowledge will be instrumental for prioritizing the most relevant stromal targets that could be manipulated in the clinic to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy for PCa .These data will be essential for a future R01 application .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "46.5511"}

{"text": "This rapid division is a hallmark of most malignant cancers , which allows the drugs to target the cancerous cells .One of the drawbacks , however , is that the chemicals do not discriminate between rapidly dividing cancerous cells , and rapidly dividing healthy cells .Some types of cells in the body which divide rapidly under normal circumstances , and can be affected by chemicals in chemotherapy regimens , include cells in the digestive tract , hair follicles , and bone marrow .This is often the reason why common side effects of chemotherapy include hair loss ( alopecia ) , inflammation of the digestive tract ( mucositis ) , and decreased blood cell production ( myelosuppression ) .Another method in which chemotherapy drugs can affect cancerous cells is by causing the cell to kill itself .All cells have a pre - programmed lifespan , and also have triggers which may be activated to cause that cell to die .These triggers activate a process called \" apoptosis , \" which basically means the cell undergoes a programmed death .Chemotherapy is most effective when it is used in the early stages of cancer , including mesothelioma .This is because at these early stages , the cancerous cells are dividing more rapidly and the cells are usually well - differentiated and uniform .As the tumor grows , the cancerous cells become diffuse and less receptive to the chemotherapy chemicals .In addition , as the tumor grows , the cells at the center do not divide as quickly so the chemicals do not target them .The tumor may also become so dense that the chemicals can not reach the center of the tumor .New research has also uncovered that in some older cancerous cells , the cell walls have pumps which draw the chemicals out of the cell .There are three general types of chemotherapy : .Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy : This type of chemotherapy is designed for cancer patients who are in the initial stages of cancer .It is referred to as pre - operative treatment .The purpose is to reduce the size of the tumor so that other interventions can be made , such as surgery .Adjuvant Chemotherapy : This type of chemotherapy is designed for patients who have undergone a surgical resection of a tumor , or have had cancer removed .This type of chemotherapy is often referred to as post - operative chemotherapy .Adjuvant chemotherapy is intended to ensure that any cancerous cells which remain after removal of the primary tumor are destroyed .It is also used to ensure that any cancerous cells which may have spread before surgical intervention , or which were merely missed , are destroyed .Palliative Chemotherapy : In some cases , cancer may be far too advanced for chemotherapy , or another type of intervention .The intent of palliative chemotherapy is not cure the cancer , but rather reduce the size of the tumor(s ) by as much as possible in an attempt to increase life expectancy .Before it can be determined what kind of chemotherapy treatment a mesothelioma patient will receive , it must be determined how well the patient can tolerate such treatments .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "47.4173"}

Kris at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center ( MSKCC ) in New York City told the doctor , \" When I 'm sitting in the waiting room , everybody looks better than they used to \" seven or eight years ago .The newer therapies are also much less disruptive to patients ' lives and work schedules .Says Kris : \" When I started in 1983 , patients treated for cancer for the first time were hospitalized for two or three days every month , just to get the treatment .With crizotinib [ one of the new targeted drugs for lung cancer ] , you take a pill twice a day in your home . \"Mass General 's Theresa McDonnell , nursing director of the cancer center , is excited by how the new treatments affect her patients .\" My image of cancer used to be the play Wit -bald , vomiting , emaciated , exhausted people just trying to cope with breathing and living , \" she says .\" Now we have stage 4 patients who are living full lives , working full time .And when we talk to patients , we have greater confidence and hope .\" How the new drugs work .Genetically targeted drugs aim to disrupt the growth and spread of cancer cells .Normally , your body 's cells divide in a controlled manner , but with cancer , some cells go crazy and clone themselves rapidly .Often the clones form tumors , and those tumors , if not removed in time , may send out colonies of cloned cells that multiply relentlessly in other parts of the body .Think of what happens when a virus corrupts your computer .Each cancerous cell 's behavior is governed by instructions it receives from a protein , which in turn takes its orders from a mutated gene .One simple example of a cancer - causing mutation happens when the ends of chromosomes 22 and 9 break off and trade places .The product of this bizarre translocation , known as the Philadelphia chromosome , creates a protein that signals white blood cells to reproduce unchecked , causing a disease called chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) .Gleevec is a drug designed to inhibit this mutation , which is found in all CML patients .In the drug 's first clinical trial , 53 out of 54 patients experienced complete remission , making Gleevec arguably the most successful targeted medication in existence .It is also one of the earliest : Gleevec came on the market in 2001 .Nearly two thirds of the clinical trial 's original patients stayed on it .About 17 percent developed resistance within five years , and many were shifted to a second - generation drug , on which they are still being maintained .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.08595"}
