{"text": "Astonishingly , the Pousargues 's mongoose shares its jungle home with eight different species of mongoose .Observations from the Chinko show that Pousargues 's mongoose lives in small groups ranging from three to 12 individuals which move between their favourite termite mounds on a regular basis .Breeding has been observed taking place in mid - May during the early rainy season .A small group of three adults have been observed caring for an infant , carrying it around in their mouths .A first genetic survey based on collected scat samples , shows the Pousargues 's mongoose being a close relative of the forest dwelling Kusimanse crossarchus .Based on more than 1,500 km of walked transects , over 14,500 camera traps , days spent in more than 400 different locations and countless hours of field observations , Pousargues 's Mongoose seem to occur in much lower densities than most other mongoose in the Chinko Project Area .Habitat preferences and their ecological recommendations are still largely unknown so further studies are still needed .The vegetation is relatively pristine in eastern CAR , South Sudan and northern DRC due to less human interference in these areas and as such it can be assumed that the habitat of Pousargues 's mongoose is still available in large scale .Poaching and overgrazing pose a serious threat to animals like lions , elephants , wild dogs and possibly this little mongoose in the Central African Republic .Therefore , it is important to manage large scale reserves like the Chinko Project Area to secure a functional ecosystem and the long term survival of a diverse wildlife community including nondescript dwarfs like the Pousargues 's mongoose .On April 29 , Britain 's Guardian newspaper revealed the sexual abuse of children aged between 8 and 15 by French soldiers in Bangui , the capital of the Central African Republic ( CAR ) .The deeply impoverished country has experienced escalating sectarian fighting between Christian Anti - balaka and Muslims Seleka militias .Thousands of civilians had fled Bangui neighborhoods to seek shelter in nearby M'Poko airport .According to the Guardian , the alleged abuse took place between December 2013 and June 2014 in a refugee camp in Bangui .Reuters cited French judicial sources saying that a number of French soldiers had been identified .Chadian peacekeepers were also allegedly involved in the sexual abuse .On Thursday , Le Monde reported that more than 14 soldiers are under investigation .The Guardian revelation was based on a leaked report by a senior UN aid worker , Anders Kompass , who disclosed the abuse allegation to French prosecutors last July , after the UN failed to take action to stop the abuse .Kompass is under investigation for breaching confidential information and was suspended after leaking the report .According to many witnesses , young boys accused French soldiers of having raped and abused them \" in exchange for food \" or money .The incidents took place before and after the establishment of the UN - led peacekeeping mission in CAR .One interview describes how two nine - year - old children were sexually assaulted together by two French soldiers who demanded oral sex in exchange for food .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.18059"}
