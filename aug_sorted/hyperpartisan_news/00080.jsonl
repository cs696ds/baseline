{"text": "Hillary Clinton supports many ideas which Democrats would never accept from a Republican , but many Democrats defend when it comes from Clinton .Similarly , Democrats would be very skeptical of a Republican who received such large contributions from Wall Street , or who benefited financially from parties they were making decisions about .Yet many Democrats ignore unethical conduct from Clinton they would never accept from a Republican .Maybe this would n't hurt the future of the Democratic Party , but it would leave us with a Democratic Party which stands for even less than the party now stands for .That threaten the future of the nation .The article gives many excellent reasons to vote for Sanders over Clinton in the primaries , along with reasons to be upset if the system gives the nomination to Clinton without a fair fight .However , should Clinton win the nomination , it does not address the fact that the Republican candidate will be even more conservative than Clinton on some issues .While Clinton is more like Reagan than FDR , and is in many ways a combination of George W. Bush and Richard Nixon , the Republican Party has moved much further to the right in recent years .This leaves the question as to whether it will matter if Clinton or a Republican wins - which is more difficult to say without knowing which Republican will be the GOP nominee .It is definitely possible that there will be no meaningful difference with regards to foreign policy and civil liberties issues if Clinton or a Republican wins .There is the danger that the next president will be hostile to government transparency , and nobody has reached the level of the Clinton corruption in using the office of the presidency to enhance their personal worth .We will probably see a continuation of the surveillance state and of the drug war regardless of whether Clinton or a Republican wins .The biggest danger in a Clinton presidency would be that many Democrats will support conservative policies , leaving a weak liberal opposition to her policies , while there would be greater unity in opposing what might even be the exact same policies coming from Republicans .The biggest upside to Clinton winning over the Republicans might be that after campaigning as a progressive for the nomination , she will continue to govern as one .At very least Clinton would support a handful of liberal positions such as reproductive rights if elected .While this would be favorable , it is hardly enough to be happy with the prospect of her election considering her many conservative views .Unfortunately we have already seen her swing to the right on some issues and she has shown throughout her career that she can not be trusted to stand up for liberal ideas .Much of the differences we now see between Clinton and the GOP candidates are far less differences on the issues and more a matter of which party 's voters they are currently trying to attract .The biggest differences could be the veto pen and the Supreme Court .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.50082"}

Nelson Rockefeller tried unsuccessfully to win the nomination three times in the 1960s as a liberal Republican with a scandalous personal life in an era when his party was moving rapidly to the right .He eventually became Gerald Ford 's unelected vice president but was unceremoniously dropped from the ticket in 1976 when Ford needed to appeal to conservatives .Prominent New York political figures including John Lindsay , Al Sharpton , George Pataki , and Giuliani , have made dismally unsuccessful runs for the presidency .Mario Cuomo , Colin Powell , and Bloomberg have managed to generate fevered media speculation without ever actually running .Keating goes on with more examples , because he sees something has changed : .If Democrats ultimately reject Sanders , they 'll be backing a former New York senator who calls Chappaqua home .The specter of a third - party run by Bloomberg still hangs over the contest .The American electorate as a whole is becoming more urban , more socially liberal , and more culturally diverse - a source of hope for some and terror for others .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "82.45616"}
