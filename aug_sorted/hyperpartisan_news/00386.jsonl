John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) wins in November .The 2012 election would coincide with the end of Clinton 's second Senate term , effectively turning her into a lame duck .A run for New York governor would hasten Clinton 's departure by two years .But if Obama wins in November , her next likely opportunity for the presidency would be in 2016 , when she would be 69 .If Clinton makes it clear her future is in the Senate , she could find several paths open to her , aides and colleagues said .One would be to champion a major piece of legislation , such as the health - care bill Obama has promised early in his first term .A member of three prominent committees , Clinton remains a junior member on all three panels and does not stand to become a committee chairman for at least another decade .But another option would be to assume the chairmanship of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , a demanding but high - profile post that is an appointment by Reid .Sen.

Barack Obama .\" I loved the Senate before I ran for the president , \" Kennedy explained in an interview before his recent cancer diagnosis .Losing to Carter , he said , made him appreciate the opportunities in Congress all the more .\" I think I became a better senator , with greater focus and attention , \" Kennedy said .But he added : \" It all depends on the attitude , what 's in the mind of the person . \"Clinton , Kennedy continued , must decide where her heart lies .\" She 's got great capacity -- she was a good senator before , and she can be a great senator in the future , \" he said .The question , he said , is \" what she does with this experience .\" When Kennedy returned to Capitol Hill before the 1980 election , the Massachusetts Democrat was in a similar fix .Like Clinton , he was the heir to a powerful political legacy .But the climate was volatile , and voters were in the mood for change .Kennedy was rejected by many of his Senate colleagues , despite Carter 's sagging popularity , and he won just 10 primary states .But like Clinton , he hung on until the bitter end .Yet Kennedy was an 18-year Senate veteran who had already risen to chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a health subcommittee .Clinton faces few options for quick advancement should she give up her presidential bid , prompting some to speculate that she may look elsewhere for a prominent political post , possibly the governorship of New York .The climate on Capitol Hill has changed considerably in the 18 months since Clinton began her presidential campaign .The Senate leadership path that she had once viewed as a viable alternative is now all but blocked .Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid ( Nev. ) has gained clout in his role , and he will grow even more powerful if Democrats succeed in expanding their narrow majority in November by up to half a dozen seats .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.1062"}

Clementa Pinckney , Abedin has held two private meetings with South Carolina state legislators on her boss 's behalf .When Clinton got stuck in traffic on her way to a meeting with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio - who since the meeting has refused to endorse her campaign - Abedin met with him one - on - one for 45 minutes before Clinton eventually appeared .It marks a transformative shift for Abedin , from loyal assistant , more often seen than heard , to campaign power center of her own .\" For all intents and purposes , she 's No . 3 on the campaign , after [ campaign chairman John ] Podesta and [ campaign manager Robby ] Mook , \" explained a Clinton campaign aide .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.26402"}

Carl Gettinger was sitting at his desk in the U.S. embassy when the phone rang .On the line was Colonel Eldon Cummings , the commander of the U.S. military group in El Salvador , who said there was a lieutenant from the Salvadoran National Guard in his office who could tell Gettinger about the harsh tactics of the guerrillas .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.19148"}

{"text": "Her reactions are priceless .Divisive President Laments On How Much He Sucked At Easing Partisan Rhetoric .Wednesday , February 10 .By Matt Vespa .Today , President Obama ventured back to Springfield , Illinois , where he launched his 2008 presidential campaign , to address the Illinois General Assembly .He lamented about how he 's been an utter failure regarding bridging political divides and calming the vicious partisan rhetoric ( via NBC News ): .Returning to the place where his political career - and his first presidential campaign - began , President Obama visited the Illinois capital Wednesday , renewing his call for healing the nation 's partisan discord and building a better electoral system .Bemoaning a \" poisonous political climate \" that made citizens cynical and disillusioned and leaders unable to achieve great goals , Obama posed the challenge : \" What can we do all of us together to try to make our politics better ? \"He outlined a few solutions , none of them new : limiting the influence of money in politics - including a Constitutional amendment , if necessary ; reforming the congressional redistricting process ; and making it easier to register and vote .Well , for starters , this president is the most divisive in the modern era .Second , gerrymandering really did n't have that much of an impact on our political process .But if Democrats want to continue this charade of throwing temper tantrums about the way congressional districts are drafted , then win some state and local elections .You actually have to care about the states , Democrats .By all accounts , you have zero interest in state legislatures , secretaries of state , governors , insurance commissioners , and other positions that are key to congressional maps , and finding future talent for the party .But enough about how Democrats have been completely eaten alive at the state level ; Obama added that not being able to shed his divisive nature is one of the biggest regrets of his presidency .In short , a divisive president lamented about how awful he was at trying to ... be not as partisan .That 's rich - almost as rich as Bill Clinton trying to accuse other of sexism given his sordid sexual history .President Obama at Illinois General Assembly : \" I had to acknowledge that one of my few regrets is my inability to reduce the polarization and meanness in our politics .I was able to be part of that here , and yet , could n't translate it the way I wanted to into our politics in Washington .Which is why , in my final State of the Union address , and in the one before that , I had to acknowledge that one of my few regrets is my inability to reduce the polarization and meanness in our politics .I was able to be part of that here and yet could n't translate it the way I wanted to into our politics in Washington .And people ask me why I 've devoted so much time to this topic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.80727"}

'The salient question every interfaith couple needs to answer is , \" Will we practice both religions equally or will we choose one religion to be the ' lead religion ' in our home ?\" I have coined the term \" lead religion \" because it describes a sometimes challenging reality : the existence of two religions in the home .Even when there is a conversion , there are still two religions in the home since each person comes from a different religious background , and parents and grandparents , aunts , uncles , and cousins come from and celebrate different religions .Embracing a \" lead religion , \" means practicing one religion as the dominant religion in the home , while still respecting the other religion .This is an approach that both honors and welcomes the other religion , a vital decision for any interfaith family .This article is the first in a series that will cover key issues relevant for interfaith couples .The second will discuss the places interfaith couples can go for help .The third will focus on constructing a religious identity .The fourth will present \" best practices \" on how to have a successful marriage , and the fifth will present how to create an interfaith wedding ceremony . \"Chelsea and Marc each come from families where religion was an integral part of their lives . \" Flat out lie .Both sets of parents worship GREED AND LYING.They and their families are disgraces to their grandparent 's faith .They should both convert out to islam or satanism ( redundant ) .And you should stop pushing your interfaith hocus pocus in case you really brainwash someone who has the potential to embrace their faith and not dilute it / shelve it for \" romance \" .When people \" intermarry \" their children INVARIABLY GROW UP WITHOUT GOD.Of course that s what you leftists really want .PSolus .\" When people \" intermarry \" their children INVARIABLY GROW UP WITHOUT GOD . \"Lucky kids . schnauzer2 .Why does every keep qsking which one will convert ?Who says they plan on having any religious involvement in their lives at all ? politicians and their family go to church becasue that s what the average voeter expects .It says nothing about their actual level of religiosity .Even if their families were on the above average end of religious observation , there is nothing that says the kids are the same .As a side note , who cares ?Chelsea is only know because of her parents and Marc is only known because of Chelsea .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "124.72876"}
