Kennedy to head the CIA .The Senate Armed Services Committee , considering the nomination , was informed that in World War II , McCone and associates in a shipbuilding company had made $ 44 million on an investment of $ 100,000 .Reacting indignantly to criticism of McCone , one of his supporters on the Senate committee asked him : . Bruce Catton , a writer and historian working in Washington during the war , commented bitingly on the retention of wealth and power in the same hands , despite a war that seemed to promise a new world of social reform .He wrote : .We were committed to a defeat of the Axis but to nothing else ....It was solemnly decided that the war effort must not be used to bring about social or economic reform and to him that hath shall be given .... .And through it all ... the people were not trusted with the facts or relied on to display that intelligence , sanity , and innate decency of spirit , upon which democracy ... finally rests .In a very real sense , our government spent the war years looking desperately for some safe middle ground between Hitler and Abraham Lincoln .It becomes difficult to sustain the claim that a war is just when both sides commit atrocities , unless one wants to argue that their atrocities are worse than ours .True , nothing done by the Allied Powers in World War II matches in utter viciousness the deliberate gassing , shooting , and burning of six million Jews and four million others by the Nazis .The deaths caused by the Allies were less , but still so massive as to throw doubt on the justice of a war that includes such acts .Early in the war , various world leaders condemned the indiscriminate bombing of city populations .Italy had bombed civilians in Ethiopia ; Japan , in China ; Germany and Italy , in the Spanish Civil War .Germany had dropped bombs on Rotterdam in Holland , on Coventry in England and other places .Roosevelt described these bombings as \" inhuman barbarism that has profoundly shocked the conscience of humanity .\" But very soon , the United States and Britain were doing the same thing and on a far larger scale .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "107.38896"}

{"text": "This is the view of Princeton historian Arno Mayer , in his book Why Did the Heavens Not Darken , and it is supported by the chronology - that not until Germany was at war was the Final Solution adopted .Hilberg , in his classic work on the Holocaust , says , \" From 1938 to 1940 , Hitler made extraordinary and unusual attempts to bring about a vast emigration scheme ....The Jews were not killed before the emigration policy was literally exhausted .\" The Nazis found that the Western powers were not anxious to cooperate in emigration and that no one wanted the Jews .We should examine another claim , that World War II was fought for the right of nations to determine their own destiny .This was a direct appeal to the dependent countries of the world , especially the colonies of Britain , France , Holland , and Belgium , that their rights of self - determination would be upheld after the war .The support of the nonwhite colonial world was seen as crucial to the defeat of fascism .And in late 1942 , Roosevelt 's personal representative told French General Henri Giraud , \" It is thoroughly understood that French sovereignty will be reestablished as soon as possible throughout all the territory ; metropolitan or colonial , over which flew the French flag in 1939 . \"( These assurances of the United States are especially interesting in view of the claims of the United States during the Vietnam War , that the United States was fighting for the right of the Vietnamese to rule themselves . )If neither saving the Jews nor guaranteeing the principle of self - determination was the war aim of the United States ( and there is no evidence that either was the aim of Britain or the Soviet Union ) , then what were the principal motives ?Overthrowing the governments of Hitler , Mussolini , and Tojo was certainly one of them .But was this desired on humanitarian grounds or because these regimes threatened the positions of the Allies in the world ?The rhetoric of morality - the language of freedom and democracy - had some substance to it , in that it represented the war aims of many ordinary citizens .However , it was not the citizenry but the governments who decided how the war was fought and who had the power to shape the world afterward .Behind the halo of righteousness that surrounded the war against fascism , the usual motives of governments , repeatedly shown in history , were operating : the aggrandizement of the nation , more profit for its wealthy elite , and more power to its political leaders .One of the most distinguished of British historians , A.J.P. Taylor , commented on World War II that \" the British and American governments wanted no change in Europe except that Hitler should disappear . \" World War II was an opportunity for United States business to penetrate areas that up to that time had been dominated by England .Secretary of State Hull said early in the war , \" Leadership toward a new system of international relationships in trade and other economic affairs will devolve very largely upon the United States because of our great economic strength .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "117.49323"}
{"text": "They see it as bad , but also as a possible means to something good .And so they distinguish between wars that are just and those that are unjust .The religions of the West and Middle East - Judaism , Christianity , and Islam - approve of violence and war under certain circumstances .The Catholic church has a specific doctrine of \" just \" and \" unjust \" war , worked out in some detail .Political philosophers today argue about which wars , or which actions in wars , may be considered just or unjust .Beyond both viewpoints - the glorification of war and the weighing of good and bad wars - there is a third : that war is too evil to ever be just .The monk Erasmus , writing in the early sixteenth century , was repelled by war of any kind .One of his pupils was killed in battle and he reacted with anguish : Tell me , what had you to do with Mars , the stupidest of all the poet 's gods , you who were consecrated to the Muses , nay to Christ ?Your youth , your beauty , your gentle nature , your honest mind - what had they to do with the flourishing of trumpets , the bombards , the swords ?Erasmus described war : \" There is nothing more wicked , more disastrous , more widely destructive , more deeply tenacious , more loathsome . \"He said this was repugnant to nature : \" Whoever heard of a hundred thousand animals rushing together to butcher each other , as men do everywhere ? \" Erasmus saw war as useful to governments , for it enabled them to enhance their power over their subjects : \" ... once war has been declared , then all the affairs of the State are at the mercy of the appetites of a few .\" This absolute aversion to war of any kind is outside the orthodoxy of modern thinking .In a series of lectures at Oxford University in the 1970s , English scholar Michael Howard talked disparagingly about Erasmus .He called him simplistic , unsophisticated , and someone who did not see beyond the \" surface manifestations \" of war .He said , .With all [ Erasmus 's ] genius he was not a profound political analyst , nor did he ever have to exercise the responsibilities of power .Rather he was the first in that long line of humanitarian thinkers for whom it was enough to chronicle the horrors of war in order to condemn it .Howard had praise for Thomas More : \" Very different was the approach of Erasmus 's friend , Thomas More ; a man who had exercised political responsibility and , perhaps in consequence , saw the problem in all its complexity . \"That being the case , it was a requirement of humanity , of religion and of common sense alike that those wars should be fought in such a manner as to cause as little damage as possible .For better or worse war was an institution which could not be eliminated from the international system .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.35"}
