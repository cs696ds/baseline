[ ... ]For many Norwegians it probably seems both odd and incomprehensible that one of the world 's superpowers can not manage such a simple task as to deploy an ambassador to a close ally like Norway .It becomes more incomprehensible when one considers the fact that the hold - up is not related to neither the candidate , nor the bilateral relationship .If Donald Trump or Ted Cruz then occupy the White House , Norway may find itself welcoming a completely different character than Sam Heins .I believe most Norwegians agree with me that it is probably best for all of us if we avoid that scenario .It is time : Congress , send Norway an ambassador !The article is a pretty good account of what happened to the nominations dating back to 2013 when the initial nominee melted down on C - SPAN .We do n't know if the Heins nomination will make it through the Senate , but even if it does get a full vote , and Mr. Heins gets to Oslo , this is an election year .There will be a new occupant in the White House come January 2017 .All ambassadors -including Mr. Heins if he gets confirmed this year - resign their positions following a change in Administration .The resignations of career ambassadors are typically almost always refused , while those of political appointees are almost always accepted .Which means , unless the nominations of political ambassadorships get confirmed soon , the window of opportunity is winding down .At some point , it becomes a waste of resources to pack and ship an ambassador designate 's household effects if he / she gets to serve as chief of mission for only a few months ; that is , only to pack out again after the November 2016 elections .Of course , it can be done , we just ca n't recall an example , but would folks really subject themselves to such a relocation for a short - term ambassadorship ?", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.8898"}

Bob Goodlatte announce that the Judiciary Committee will now markup the ECPA reform bill , meaning that the bill is moving forward again .It 's not entirely clear why it 's happening now , but at the very least , it sounds like the SEC 's constant protests may no longer be an obstacle .Hopefully it does move forward , and whatever results from the process leads to much stronger privacy protections on electronic communications , such as actually requiring a warrant , like the 4th Amendment says should happen .from the press-'delete'-to - retire dept .Most of former NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly 's emails on his desktop computer were deleted at the end of his tenure despite an order they be preserved for a high - stakes class - action suit alleging a summons quota system within the department .The NYPD -- and its top officials -- have never been fans of transparency or accountability .The only shocking aspect is that the deletion was done in direct disobedience of a court order .The plan to secure Kelly 's legacy by destroying his emails was likely in place long before his retirement .Back in 2013 , it was made clear by Michael Bloomberg that there would be no effort made to archive the mayor 's communications .Four government agencies were also on the \" assured destruction \" list , the NYPD being one of them .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "90.80057"}

{"text": "Not all ECIE agencies are small , however - several , such as the National Science Foundation and Amtrak , are relatively large , and the U.S. Postal Service is very large .There are also three legislative IG offices - those of the Library of Congress , the Government Printing Office , and the Capitol Police .They do not fall under the IG law , but are covered by three separate statutes that each imposes responsibilities and duties parallel to the IG law .These IGs are agency - appointed so , although they are not executive agencies and therefore not technically DFEs , they are members of the ECIE .For ease of reference in this report , we use the terms \" DFEs , \" \" agency - appointed IGs , \" and \" ECIE members \" interchangeably and include in them the three legislative IG offices .The legislative IGs were not placed directly under the IG law because to do so would have been seen as compromising the institutional integrity of Congress , theoretically allowing some executive branch control of the operations and activities of legislative agencies .35 These legislative IGs could almost be said to straddle two worlds , since they belong to the ECIE , an executive body .Yet because they have separate legislative authorities , they are not always covered by changes made to the IG law .For example , legislation currently pending in Congress to improve the independence and resources of IGs would largely exclude these three offices .At this writing , the IG Act does not require Inspectors General at the DFEs to be selected under the same criteria of political impartiality , integrity , or demonstrated ability as the PCIEs .36 This is an egregious oversight , and the law should make clear that those fundamental qualities should be sought in all potential IG candidates .There are a number of DFE agencies that are governed by boards or commissions , so those IGs actually have a bit more independence than those who must deal with only one agency head .As one IG for a six - member commission told POGO , \" four of them have to get annoyed with me ... [ so ] my independence is pretty good . \"However , most DFE IG offices are small , under - resourced and often quite dependent on their parent agencies .Most do not have separate line items in the president 's budget , many do not have in - house counsels , some lack staff auditors or investigators , and some are unable - whether due to lack of funds or lack of approval from management - to bring in contract help when needed .A few are not even allowed to post reports on their own page on the agency website without agency permission .This creates a severe disincentive to continued government service , as well as obvious morale problems .Because IGs should not be allowed to receive cash awards or bonuses , steps should be taken - regardless of the various pay schedules that apply to the different IGs - so that they are all paid commensurate with the total compensation received by senior staff at their agency .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.85048"}
