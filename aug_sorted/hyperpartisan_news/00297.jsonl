Martin O'Malley was there , but this was a battle between Clinton and Sanders , two black belts of American politics .These two powerhouse candidates entered the ring , throwing their best punches .Sanders needed an outstanding victory Sunday night .However , Clinton expertly attacked Sanders ' weak points .This was the Bernie Sanders debate .He brought the most policies to the table , he outlined tax plans and most questions were seemingly directed toward him .Sanders started this campaign with the image of a candidate who would n't be in for the long haul .With the election starting in two weeks , the debate was focused on America getting to know the Democratic socialist from Vermont .However , Clinton did not allow Sanders to hog the attention , and she expertly defended herself .The former First Lady did not spend much time appealing to America 's liberals - Sanders won that war .She dug in on centrist policies , appealing to voters who want realism , not idealism .This was a fight over the identity of the Democratic Party .Sanders prides himself on not attacking his opposition , and he has mostly stayed away from attacking Clinton directly - let 's not forget about the famous \" sick and tired of your damn emails \" moment .However , this was the end of Mr. Nice Socialist Guy on Sunday .Sanders launched a full - frontal assault on Clinton 's \" cozy \" relationship with big banks , specifically Goldman Sachs .\" The first difference is I do n't take money from big banks .I do n't get personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs , \" Sanders unloaded .Clinton 's relationship with the banking industry has been one of her biggest criticisms from liberals .Sanders ' burn was met with slight applause and a faint boo or two from the audience .The tone of the room was tense .You could hear a pin drop ; the nation 's attention was focused on this exchange .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.637524"}
{"text": "Sanders received some momentary praise for defending her , but he was wrong .As Philip Bump pointed out after the debate , only Democrats are sick and tired about hearing about Clinton 's email .Independents do care , and this will hurt her in a general election .As The Washington Post also noted , this is not a problem which is going to go away .It should n't have been necessary to wait for the fact check articles to point out how Clinton was repeating the same lies she has been telling for months about the email .If Sanders had his way , he would talk only about income inequality and economic policy .It is possible he might not even be aware of the facts related to the Clinton scandals .This is not how to win a campaign .Sanders needs to be prepared to defend transparency in government and criticize Clinton for her abuses .He also needed to be even better prepared to criticize her for her support for greater military intervention in Libya and Syria .He needs to oppose her more strongly on civil liberties and social issues .He must defend his position on guns , both supporting rational gun control and respecting the rights of hunters , as part of an overall difference between Sanders and Clinton on civil liberties issues .He must make more out of his support , and Clinton 's opposition , to expanding Social Security .He needs to continue to discuss climate change , along with pointing out the weakness of Clinton 's environmental record .Considering how dirty her 2008 campaign was against Obama , there has been speculation as to how negative Hillary Clinton will get against Bernie Sanders , and against Joe Biden if he decides to run .The New York Times notes that Clinton must be cautious in debating Sanders : .\" I 've seen every attack people have thrown at him , and none of them have worked , \" cautioned Howard Dean , the former governor of Vermont , who supports Mrs. Clinton .Not all of them have been exactly subtle .In 2004 , the Republican challenging him for his House seat sought to deride him as a political oddball . \"Crazy Bernie , \" an advertisement called him , \" a holdover from the Woodstock days of reefer and flowers . \"But Vermont voters did not seem to mind ... .For Mrs. Clinton , debating Mr. Sanders poses a challenge reminiscent of the more troublesome one she faced in 2008 , when Senator Barack Obama 's criticisms of her were widely characterized as fair , but Mrs. Clinton 's efforts to counter them and defend herself often were not .Already , a \" super PAC \" supporting Mrs. Clinton showed the risks that can come if an unsuccessful attack on Mr. Sanders blows back .Mr. Sanders , calling it \" the same - old , same - old negative politics , \" seized on the report and raised more than $ 1 million in two days .More on how Sanders set fund raising records in response to this attack here .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.661423"}

Sanders fail that national security test , \" Mook said .But Jeff Weaver , who is Sanders ' campaign manager , said that much of the debate unfolded on issues that his candidate had introduced in the campaign -- namely the influence of big money in politics .And he denied that Sanders was guilty of an underhand smear against Clinton .\" These big companies that give all this big money do n't do it just out of the goodness of their heart , they are thinking they are getting something back for it , \" Weaver told Lemon .

'Now , suddenly , last week , you 're against it , \" Cooper said .\" Will you say anything to get elected ? \"Clinton said that over the course of her career , her values and principles have remained consistent , though some positions have evolved as she \" absorb[s ] new information . \"\" You know , take the trade deal , \" Clinton said .\" I did say , when I was secretary of state , three years ago , that I hoped it would be the gold standard .It was just finally negotiated last week , and in looking at it , it did n't meet my standards .My standards for more new , good jobs for Americans , for raising wages for Americans .And I want to make sure that I can look into the eyes of any middle - class American and say , ' this will help raise your wages .

Bush 's invasion of Iraq was a mistake , but she apparently learned little from it .Clinton was a leading advocate for overthrowing Moammar El - Gadhafi in Libya , leaving behind a failed state that provides ISIS with an alternative base .She supported calls for the United States to help oust Bashar al - Assad in Syria , an approach that has added fuel to a horrific civil war .She now advocates a confrontation with Russia in Syria by calling for a no - fly zone .Her support for President Obama 's nuclear agreement with Iran was marred by an explicit rejection of better relations with that country and bellicose pledges to provide Israel with more arms .If elected , Clinton will be another \" war president \" at a time when America desperately needs peace .Sanders 's approach is different and better .The senator has n't talked as much as we would like about global challenges and opportunities , and we urge him to focus more on foreign policy .But what he has said ( and done ) inspires confidence .An opponent of the Iraq War from the start , he criticizes the notion of \" regime change \" and the presumption that America alone must police the world .He rejects a new Cold War with Russia .He supports the nuclear - weapons agreement with Iran , and he would devote new energy to dismantling nuclear arsenals and pursuing nonproliferation .He has long been an advocate for normalizing relations with Cuba and for reviving a good - neighbor policy in the hemisphere .Sanders 's foreign policy would also create conditions for rebuilding a broadly shared prosperity at home .He would lead an international effort to end the crippling austerity that threatens to create another global recession , and he would champion a green New Deal to combat climate change .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "56.404144"}

Bernie Sanders ( D - VT ) and Hillary Clinton .The average age of the Democratic field is 71 .First , read Guy 's post about how the Clinton campaign is nervous about Monday night 's tallies , where she barely eked out a win over Sanders , mostly due to coin tosses .Another surprise was the fact that Sanders apparently overcame the biggest turnout obstacles he faced in the state : turning out voters who really do n't vote .And the voters we 're talking about are young liberals .With income , it was hero of the proletariat , Sanders , vs. money bags Clinton : .Under $ 30k : 57/41-Sanders .Clinton won the East Central , Des Moines Area and Central parts of the state , while she tied Sanders in the Eastern cities and the West .Those who described themselves as Democrats broke for Clinton 56/39 ; Sanders took the \" Independent and something else \" crowd 69/26 .He also nabbed the \" very liberal \" voters 58/39 over Clinton , whereas the former first lady took somewhat liberal and moderates 50/44 and 58/35 respectively .When it comes to health care , it was n't shocking either ; the Sanders people only trust him on the issue and vice - versa with Hillary .Another interesting aspect of the Democratic exits belonged to unmarried women .This key ( and mostly liberal ) voting bloc went to Sanders , showing that identity politics was n't really a factor in this contest .This is a woman who had a significant double - digit lead over Sanders - and wasted it ( throwback to Obama ) .The Des Moines Register poll released last August showing that her support had dropped by a third at the time , a course projecting an eventual defeat for her for the then - upcoming caucuses , serves as a prophetic event for the first 2016 bout for Democrats .As Guy outlined in his post , Monday night 's results prove that Clinton is still a bad campaigner .Yet , she dodged a blowout loss ( which did n't seem likely ) meaning that her southern firewall should be able to keep Sanders from toppling her for the nomination , despite the poor optics and criticisms of weakness associated with losing key primary contests as the frontrunner .Also , as the Cook Report noted , the delegate math is still in her favor : . ...98 percent of pledged Democratic delegates will come from states with lower shares of liberal whites than Iowa and New Hampshire .Just 447 of 4,051 pledged Democratic delegates - 11 percent - are tied to results in states or districts with higher shares of college - educated whites than New Hampshire .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "61.311974"}

John Kasich , for instance - may be fine as the race moves to New Hampshire on Tuesday morning if they have invested little in Iowa .On the other hand , second place for Trump could puncture his aura of invincibility .Iowa , where more than half the GOP voters are evangelical Christians , always seemed tailored to Cruz .Second place for Trump - unless it 's very , very close - could generate questions about his viability as a candidate .Managing expectations .Unfair as it may seem , how a candidate fares can be less important in Iowa than how he or she performs compared to the fluid , arbitrary and disputed expectations in a race .Pundits , candidates and polls all contribute to the stew .The Des Moines Register /Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll released Saturday night showed Trump leading Cruz 28 - 23 , with Rubio in third place at 15 percent of likely caucus - goers .That 's a tight race at the top , with momentum on Trump 's side .Just six weeks ago Cruz led by 10 percentage points in the same highly regarded survey run by The Des Moines Register 's longtime expert pollster , Ann Selzer , whose track record in the art of predicting Iowa caucus outcomes is unmatched .Cruz has predicted outright victory in the past .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.11029"}

{"text": "The last few Democratic debates have settled into a consistent pattern : Sanders simplifies everything , and then Clinton explains , in detail , why he 's wrong .Clinton can win every argument , or blur their lines , saying \" we agree , \" but lose a debate .And it 's largely because she feels constrained : Clinton is presenting herself as someone who can accomplish things in the real world , while Sanders is selling a vision .She challenged Sanders specifically on his implication that Clinton is part of a political establishment corrupted by campaign contributions , noting that Obama \" was the recipient of the largest number of Wall Street donations \" in history .Sanders said he did n't think anyone would be fooled .\" Let 's not insult the intelligence of the American people .People are n't dumb .Why in God 's name does Wall Street make huge campaign contributions ? \"he said , chiding : \" I guess just for the fun of it , they want to throw money around .\" But Clinton at the end found a line that may work and could be featured on the trail and in future debates -- dismissing Sanders as a one - note candidate .\" I am not a single - issue candidate and I do not believe we live in a single - issue country , \" she said .Sanders throws shade .Remember when , in the heat of the 2008 primary , Obama looked at Clinton mid - debate and said , dismissively , that she was \" likeable enough \" ?Sanders had his \" likeable enough \" moment Thursday night .It came after Clinton discussed her ability to pay for $ 100 billion in new policy proposals , saying that , \" I think once I 'm in the White House , we will have enough political capital to be able to do that .\" Sanders shot back : \" Secretary Clinton , you 're not in the White House yet .\" Passive - aggressive as it was , it showed Sanders ' increasing willingness to mix it up with Clinton .Even in the last debate , under a constant barrage of attacks from Clinton , Sanders seemed unwilling to deliver such a personal one - liner .Clinton , meanwhile , had clearly dialed back her tone , dropping the shouting and lessening the tense exchanges with the Vermont senator , while talking more to the audience .Why the exchange about Henry Kissinger mattered .Clinton 's fluency on foreign policy has long been a strength Sanders ca n't possibly match .So over and over , he 's leaned on a single comeback : She voted to go to war in Iraq in 2002 and he voted against it .On Thursday night , Sanders had a second she's - for - it , I'm - against - it play : Henry Kissinger .He attacked Clinton , out of the blue , for having touted the mentorship of Kissinger , a Republican former secretary of state under Richard Nixon hated by liberals for his role in Vietnam , Cambodia and elsewhere .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.0188"}
{"text": "It does not directly cut benefits .The one area with little disagreement also happened to be the one area with the most misleading : China .It 's not a new trend for politicians to attack China .The Asian country has become the scapegoat for all economic problems in the U.S.But in this election cycle , politicians have brandished a new line to attack China : currency manipulation .This , as Ohioans have likely heard dozens of times , is why jobs are leaving Ohio and why the amount of manufacturing jobs has dropped in the U.S.In fact , if politicians are taken at their word , it 's probably the entire reason the U.S. economy is in a bad spot .In the Brown - Mandel debate , Brown repeatedly pointed to his currency manipulation bill , which he claims would put an end to Chinese currency manipulation .Mandel also made references to getting tough on China 's currency manipulation .One problem : China is no longer manipulating its currency .There is no doubt China greatly massaged its currency in the past to gain an unfair advantage , but those days are over , says Joseph Gagnon , an economist focused on trade and currency manipulation .Gagnon argues the problem with currency manipulation is no longer a problem with China ; it 's a problem with Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , South Korea , Switzerland and Saudi Arabia .If the U.S. wants to crack down on currency manipulation , those countries should be the targets , not China , he argues .In other words , if currency manipulation is a problem , Mandel was right when he said that countries other than China need to be targeted .To Brown 's credit , his currency manipulation bill targets any country engaging in currency manipulation , not just China .The problem seems to be the misleading campaign rhetoric , not proposed policy .The debate went on to cover many more issues .Just like the first debate , Brown typically took the liberal position and Mandel typically took the conservative position on social issues like gay rights and abortion .Both touted vague support for small businesses .Each candidate claimed to support military bases in Ohio , although Mandel specified he wants bases in Europe closed down to save money .As far as debates go , the contrast could not be any clearer , and the candidates disagreed on nearly every issue .The final debate between the two U.S. Senate candidates will take place in Cincinnati on Oct. 25 .As always , I 'll be writing down quotes on the fly without a transcript , so they might not be word - for - word , but I 'll try to keep them reasonably accurate .8:17 - As the candidates are announced and most of them walk to their podiums , Donald Trump and Ben Carson stay near the back !When Carson finally walks up to the stage but Trump stays back , the moderator announces Trump again , saying : \" Lastly , we welcome . . .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.02768"}

{"text": "Sanders on mass incarceration of African - Americans .By Marshall Cohen , CNN .Sen. Bernie Sanders was asked about criminal justice reform Thursday night , and said mass incarceration of minorities was \" one of the great tragedies in our country today . \"He went on to assert that \" a male African - American baby born today stands a 1 in 4 chance of ending up in jail .\" Are the numbers really that high ?In fact , according to the Sentencing Project , the numbers are more staggering than Sanders claimed .The nonprofit , which researches racial disparities in the criminal justice system , released a report in 2013 with a stark conclusion : \" If current trends continue , one of every three black American males born today can expect to go to prison in his lifetime .\" That report was submitted to the United Nations Human Rights Committee .The NAACP , on its website , also includes these same figures on mass incarceration .There is some question over the freshness of these statistics -- some of the conclusions in the Sentencing Project report are based on studies that are 15 years old and there are criminal sentencing reforms happening in many states that may make a difference .But the underlying claim is not an assertion of fact , it is a projection based on historical trends .So , if anything , based on the existing projections , Sanders understated the likelihood of African Americans ending up in jail .Verdict : TRUE .Reality Check : Sanders on super PACs .By Kevin Bohn .Sen. Bernie Sanders repeatedly rails on the influences of super PACs during his campaign appearances .\" We had a decision to make early on .Do we do a super PAC ? ... we said no .We do n't represent Wall Street .We do n't represent the billionaire class , \" Sanders said during the debate .\" I 'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates , who has no super PAC .\" First , let 's define what a super PAC is .No candidate can control a super PAC , although it can support a candidate so long as there is no coordination with the campaign .It can raise unlimited amounts for a candidate , but can not work in conjunction with that person 's campaign on strategy and must disclose its donors .Hillary Clinton has several super PACs supporting her candidacy , including Priorities USA Action and Correct the Record , which are run by her allies .Through December of last year , Priorities had raised $ 41 million and CTR had brought in $ 3.4 million according to the non - partisan Center for Responsive Politics .Clinton pointed out during the debate the super PAC originally supported Obama four years ago , Priorities , which now backs her saying \" It 's not my PAC \" although she is the only candidate it is working to elect .There is also an organization backed by a nurses union that has registered as a super PAC -- National Nurses United which is now supporting Sanders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.16869"}

{"text": "Verdict : TRUE .Hillary Clinton .Reality Check : Clinton says \" vast majority \" of donors giving small contributions .By Tom LoBianco , CNN .Hillary Clinton defended herself on questions of her fundraising , saying , \" I 'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750,000 donors and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions . \"Without being able to check the number of small individual contributions through the Federal Election Commission , the Clinton campaign has to be taken at its word regarding the number of individual donations .But the FEC does track the total dollar amounts .The non - partisan Center for Responsive Politics , which tracks campaign donations , reports that roughly $ 19 million of the $ 109 million Clinton raised through individual contributions last year were small donations ( less than $ 200 each ) .But large individual contributions accounted for roughly $ 90 million .By comparison Bernie Sanders raised $ 54 million in small donations and roughly $ 19 million in individual large donations to make up the $ 73 million he raised in individual contributions last year .Yes , Hillary Clinton raised quite a bit of money from small donors , but Bernie Sanders raised much , much more from small donors .Verdict : TRUE , BUT MISLEADING .Reality Check : Clinton on incarceration rate of black men in Wisconsin .By Eve Bower , CNN .In response to a question about the high rate of incarceration of black men in Wisconsin , Clinton said , \" the statistics from Wisconsin are particularly troubling because it is the highest rate of incarceration for African - Americans in our nation , twice the national average . \"A 2013 study from the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee supports Clinton 's claim .The study further found that Wisconsin incarcerated Native American men at a higher rate than any other state , with 7.6 % of working age men behind bars , compared to an average 3.1 % of Native American men incarcerated nationwide .Wisconsin 's white men were incarcerated at a slightly lower rate than their counterparts nationwide , at 1.2 % and 1.3 % , respectively , the study found .The NAACP lists policies that promoted \" get tough on crime \" and the \" war on drugs \" as being among the chief contributing factors to the racial disparities in incarceration rates in the United States today .During her tenure as first lady , during a period of high crime rates , Clinton spoke in support of these policies .Once Clinton became a senator from New York , she appears to have changed her view .In 2007 , she co - sponsored a bill to eliminate the five - year mandatory minimum sentence for first - time possession of crack cocaine and increase funding for drug treatment programs for incarcerated people .While campaigning for president later that year , she also advocated programs to divert non - violent drug offenders away from prison .Verdict : TRUE .Reality Check : Clinton on Obamacare insuring African - Americans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.54122"}

{"text": "The final section is Choosing Hillary threatens the future of the Democratic Party .The section notes the conservative background of New Democrats such as Bill Clinton .I would also take this a step further .Hillary Clinton supports many ideas which Democrats would never accept from a Republican , but many Democrats defend when it comes from Clinton .Similarly , Democrats would be very skeptical of a Republican who received such large contributions from Wall Street , or who benefited financially from parties they were making decisions about .Yet many Democrats ignore unethical conduct from Clinton they would never accept from a Republican .Maybe this would n't hurt the future of the Democratic Party , but it would leave us with a Democratic Party which stands for even less than the party now stands for .That threaten the future of the nation .The article gives many excellent reasons to vote for Sanders over Clinton in the primaries , along with reasons to be upset if the system gives the nomination to Clinton without a fair fight .However , should Clinton win the nomination , it does not address the fact that the Republican candidate will be even more conservative than Clinton on some issues .While Clinton is more like Reagan than FDR , and is in many ways a combination of George W. Bush and Richard Nixon , the Republican Party has moved much further to the right in recent years .This leaves the question as to whether it will matter if Clinton or a Republican wins - which is more difficult to say without knowing which Republican will be the GOP nominee .It is definitely possible that there will be no meaningful difference with regards to foreign policy and civil liberties issues if Clinton or a Republican wins .There is the danger that the next president will be hostile to government transparency , and nobody has reached the level of the Clinton corruption in using the office of the presidency to enhance their personal worth .We will probably see a continuation of the surveillance state and of the drug war regardless of whether Clinton or a Republican wins .The biggest danger in a Clinton presidency would be that many Democrats will support conservative policies , leaving a weak liberal opposition to her policies , while there would be greater unity in opposing what might even be the exact same policies coming from Republicans .The biggest upside to Clinton winning over the Republicans might be that after campaigning as a progressive for the nomination , she will continue to govern as one .At very least Clinton would support a handful of liberal positions such as reproductive rights if elected .While this would be favorable , it is hardly enough to be happy with the prospect of her election considering her many conservative views .Unfortunately we have already seen her swing to the right on some issues and she has shown throughout her career that she can not be trusted to stand up for liberal ideas .Much of the differences we now see between Clinton and the GOP candidates are far less differences on the issues and more a matter of which party 's voters they are currently trying to attract .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.59108"}

{"text": "These are presumably winning messages in a Republican primary .It 's not clear whether they would be in a general election .The question is whether the run - for - your - lives talking points will crash into statistical reality , or whether they will gradually help create a new political reality .The Republicans do deserve some credit for being willing to display their views in public .The article does chastise the Democrats here in concluding that the Republicans are \" acting like a confident party - perhaps an overconfident party - while the Democrats are acting like they 've lost their feck . \" In reality , it is the Clinton campaign ( which only wanted four debates ) and the DNC , which expanded the number to six but hid most of them on nights when few would be watching , which are acting cowardly .Both Sanders and O'Malley have been pushing for more debates .I also think that Clinton has benefited from the exaggerated coverage paid to Trump .If not for his unexpected success in the Republican race , the big story of the year might be Sanders ' challenge to Clinton .After all , Sanders does beat Trump in head to head contests - and often by a larger margin than Clinton does .Clinton benefits in other ways from Trump being in the race .The large number of lies from Trump dominated the year - end report from Factcheck.org .This led to a fairly long list of lies from Clinton being less obvious , posted further down in the story after Trump 's lies .An article at Salon ( More like Reagan than FDR : I 'm a millennial and I 'll never vote for Hillary Clinton ) is receiving some attention for providing reasons why the author would not vote for Hillary Clinton .Walker Bragman began by suggesting that the usual course would be to utilize primaries to try to select the candidate most aligned with the change he wants , and then vote for the lesser of two evils in the general election if it came to this .He argues that this strategy does n't apply this year due to the manner in which the DNC is resisting the possibility of selecting a change candidate in rigging the rules for Clinton .Bragman then went through the arguments as to why he does not want to vote for Clinton .He started with Hillary 's personality repels me ( and many others ) .The section would be better labeled with her character as opposed to personality , as it deals with her dishonesty and double talk .The next section is more accurately labeled with On foreign policy , Clinton is a neoconservative .This section primarily deals with her approach to handling ISIS , and I would add more regarding her neoconservative views on Iraq and Libya .The next section is On domestic policy , Clinton is basically a moderate Republican .Many examples are listed to back this up , concentrating on economic policy .I would have included her conservative views on civil liberties and social / cultural issues .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "74.1774"}

{"text": "The Washington Times editorial defending Cruz is especially ironic since one of the conservative newspaper 's top columnists , Jeffrey Kuhner , wrote a 2011 column arguing that Obama was not born in the US and is consequently an illegitimate president : .If Mr. Obama was not born in America , then it would serve as the final damning indictment of the establishment media 's complicity with the Democratic Party .Not only would it bring the Obama presidency down , but the entire liberal power structure as well .Moreover , it would spark a constitutional crisis .The Constitution is absolutely clear that to be president one has to be a \" natural born citizen .It would drive a stake through the heart of Mr. Obama 's regime , triggering impeachment and his removal from office .This is why liberals ferociously insist that the birth issue must be buried at almost any cost . ...The birth issue is slowly casting a shadow over Mr. Obama 's presidency ; it threatens to undermine public confidence in his legal and moral authority to govern .Several states are pushing to pass laws compelling future presidential candidates - including Mr. Obama - to fully disclose all documents proving their natural born citizenship status .This desire for greater political transparency and accountability is healthy .It is time Mr. Obama came clean .At a minimum , if he does not reveal his birth certificate , he can not - and should not - be allowed to run for a second term .Birther congressman Steve Stockman says he 's not a birther after all , now that Canadian - born Sen. Ted Cruz is considering a run for president .The Texas Republican , who is crafting a birther bill with Rep. Ted Yoho ( R - FL ) , said his home state senator is indeed eligible for the presidency even though he was born outside of the US .The debunked birther conspiracy theory centers on the idea that President Obama forged his Hawaiian birth certificate to hide his foreign birth to an American mother and Kenyan father , which would make him ineligible to be president .Cruz , who also has an American mother but unlike Obama was actually born abroad , would therefore also be deemed ineligible if birthers had any logical consistency , which apparently they do n't .Stockman told the arch - birther website WorldNetDaily that he has no problem with Cruz 's likely presidential bid , noting that they are both friends and attend the same church .To hear Rep. Steve Stockman , R - Texas , describe it , the difference between President Obama and Sen. Ted Cruz , R - Texas - on the question of their eligibility for the highest office in the land - may be a case of comparing apples and oranges .The congressman said with Cruz , it is a legal question of whether he is eligible to serve as president - whereas the issue with Obama is not really about where he was born , but whether his documentation is authentic .Cruz released a copy of his birth certificate Sunday to the Dallas Morning News , as some have begun questioning the possible presidential contender 's eligibility , just as many have questioned Obama 's eligibility since 2008 when the argument was first raised by Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "75.682884"}

Bush was not the president and Dick Cheney was not the vice president .Panetta was then Clinton 's chief of staff , from 1994 to 1997 , and would have been party to years worth of discussion on this issue .Under Clinton , the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel issued secret rulings that the Ford / Reagan ban on assassinations did not apply to \" military targets or \" to attacks carried out in pre - emptive self - defense , \" according to Steve Coll , Pulitzer Prize - winning author of Ghost Wars .Shortly after 9/11 , Clinton stated this position publicly , supporting the Bush administration 's \" war on terror \" targeted - assassination policy , saying on NBC News , \" The ban that was put in effect under President Ford only applies to heads of state .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.73385"}

Bernie Sanders repeatedly rails on the influences of super PACs during his campaign appearances .\" We had a decision to make early on .Do we do a super PAC ? ... we said no .We do n't represent Wall Street .We do n't represent the billionaire class , \" Sanders said during the debate .\" I 'm the only candidate up here of the many candidates , who has no super PAC .\" First , let 's define what a super PAC is .No candidate can control a super PAC , although it can support a candidate so long as there is no coordination with the campaign .It can raise unlimited amounts for a candidate , but can not work in conjunction with that person 's campaign on strategy and must disclose its donors .Hillary Clinton has several super PACs supporting her candidacy , including Priorities USA Action and Correct the Record , which are run by her allies .Through December of last year , Priorities had raised $ 41 million and CTR had brought in $ 3.4 million according to the non - partisan Center for Responsive Politics .Clinton pointed out during the debate the super PAC originally supported Obama four years ago , Priorities , which now backs her saying \" It 's not my PAC \" although she is the only candidate it is working to elect .There is also an organization backed by a nurses union that has registered as a super PAC -- National Nurses United which is now supporting Sanders .It was formed in 2010 and has backed other candidates but is a major supporter of Sanders this campaign .A spokesman for the group , Charles Idelson , draws distinctions between it and those supporting Clinton since his organization does not take money from billionaires or Wall Street interests .\" This is totally funded by members ' dues , \" he said .It spent $ 1.36 million through the end of last year with its money dedicated to engaging in grassroots activities , such as sponsoring buses with its members in the key early voting states .Idelson also pointed Nurses United is working to further some of the issues it prioritizes -- health care , college affordability , climate change -- which dovetail with Sanders ' positions rather than just overall generally supporting a candidate .While the groups supporting Clinton are solely dedicated to backing her candidacy , supporting Sanders is not the only cause for National Nurses United and its leadership are not long - time Sanders allies or staffers .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "78.027145"}

{"text": "The Republican governor also warned city residents against using tap water from the Flint River .\" The Supreme Court heard oral arguments this morning over a seemingly obscure issue : public - sector unions ' \" agency fees . \" But while this may seem like a tangential dispute , the outcome of the case will matter a great deal to many labor unions nationwide .The basic idea is pretty straightforward , and The New Republic 's Elizabeth Bruenig summarized the issue this way : .Agency fees work like this : Public sector unions are required to cover all employees in a given bargaining unit , whether the employees opt into union membership or not .Agency fees do not fund unions ' political activities , but rather strictly the costs of union grievance - handling , organizing , and collective bargaining .So far , so good .The trouble , according to many on the right , is that literally everything unions do -- even collective bargaining itself -- is inherently political , even if it 's unrelated to campaign activities .As a result , we 're left with a case -- Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association -- in which the justices have an opportunity to overturn the Abood precedent , and as of this morning , it appears a majority of the justices are prepared to do exactly that .In the race for the Democratic presidential nomination , much of the intra - party fight has focused on strategic and tactical considerations -- most notably which candidate is the \" electable .\" The campaign has unfolded this way in part because the top candidates tend to agree on most of the key issues .But there 's one major area of substantive disagreement between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders , and as the New York Times reported over the weekend , the former Secretary of State seems to believe she has an important advantage on this issue .Hillary Clinton pressed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on his gun control record during her appearance on \" Face the Nation \" on CBS on Sunday , and brushed off \" dead end \" attacks from Donald J. Trump and other Republicans about Bill Clinton 's past scandals .On CBS , Mrs. Clinton continued to knock Mr. Sanders for a past Senate vote to give gun manufacturers immunity from prosecution when a gun is used in a crime .She is seeking to highlight one of the few areas where she is to Mr. Sanders 's left on an issue .That 's true .Sanders ' reputation as a progressive champion is well deserved , but on guns , the Vermont senator 's record is n't nearly as liberal .By his own admission , when it comes to guns , Sanders is eyeing an ideological \" middle , \" rather than the left .And his vote shielding gun manufacturers from prosecution is a good example of an issue on which Sanders took a decidedly conservative posture .Clinton argued yesterday , \" It 's the only industry in our country where we have given that kind of carte blanche to do whatever you want to do with no fear of legal consequences .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.05462"}

{"text": "WASHINGTON ( AP ) U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft was urged in early summer last year by his top security experts not to fly aboard commercial aircraft because of personal threats on his life , not out of fears about possible terrorist hijackings , the Justice Department said Thursday .The department moved quickly to quell suggestions that Ashcroft , who routinely flies aboard a small jet operated by the FBI , took precautions for his own safety in the months before Sept. 11 based on warnings of any threats involving Osama bin Laden or his al - Qaida terrorist network .It was completely unrelated to this , ' ' Justice spokesman Mark Corallo said , referring to what the White House described as general information conveyed to President Bush in August that bin Laden 's group might be planning to hijack planes .The Justice Department said Ashcroft 's travel patterns did not change after the White House learned of possible hijacking threats by al - Qaida .An FBI security review after Ashcroft took office recommended that the attorney general eschew flying on commercial planes whenever possible , citing non - specific threats against Ashcroft 's life .Since July 2001 , Ashcroft has typically flown aboard an FBI jet or aboard other jets leased by U.S. agencies , although he occasionally has traveled on commercial flights , such as during a recent trip to Trinidad , Corallo said .U.S. intelligence told President Bush before the September 11 terrorist attacks that Osama bin Laden 's network might hijack American airplanes , prompting the administration to issue a private warning to federal agencies , the White House acknowledged last night .But officials said the president and U.S. intelligence did not know that suicide hijackers were plotting to use the planes as missiles , as they did against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .There has been long - standing speculation , shared with the president , about the potential of hijackings in the traditional sense , \" White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said .\" We had general threats involving Osama bin Laden around the world and including in the United States . \"He said the administration , acting on the information received last summer , notified the \" appropriate agencies \" that hijackings \" in the traditional sense \" were possible .The warning was never made public , he said .The development , first reported by CBS News , comes as congressional investigators intensify their study of whether the government did not respond adequately to warnings of suicide hijackings .It is the first direct link between Mr. Bush and intelligence gathered before September 11 .The CIA would not confirm what it told Mr. Bush , but the agency said the issue of bin Laden 's attempting an airline hijacking was among a number of terrorist methods raised to U.S. government officials at the time .But the information did not suggest that hijackers would crash planes into American landmarks , nor did it mention a date , a CIA official said .The information was based on intelligence obtained by the U.S. government , the official said , without specifying .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "84.44415"}

Powell and his deputy , Richard L. Armitage , Mr. Comey 's standing in the White House declined after he challenged some positions championed by Mr. Cheney .But also like them , Mr. Comey ultimately chose not to resign and , while he unquestionably had some influence , he did not fundamentally shift the administration 's policies .At this week 's hearing , Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , compared the hospital standoff between Mr. Comey with Mr. Card and Mr. Gonzales to the so - called Saturday night massacre in the Nixon administration .At the height of the Watergate scandal , the attorney general , Elliot L.

Nixon 's order to fire the Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox .But there is a difference .By his own account , Mr. Comey threatened to quit -- along with Mr. Ashcroft and the F.B.I. director , Robert S. Mueller III -- but never did .Mr. Bush allowed new procedures in the N.S.A. program , which officials have said included Justice Department audits , and the eavesdropping continued without the court warrants some legal authorities believe the law requires .Former colleagues say strains with the White House began after the arrival in 2003 of Jack L.

{"text": "As the Boulder Daily Camera 's Alex Burness reports , following up on a controversy we touched on over the weekend : .Congressman Jared Polis wrote in a column Tuesday that he \" misspoke \" last week when he suggested colleges should be able to expel students accused of sexual assault even if they 're innocent ... .But he did not apologize for arguing last week that colleges may be wise to use a \" preponderance of evidence \" standard - a lower threshold than criminal courts would use - in deciding whether to punish or expel a student .For one , that practice is already in place .As Polis notes in his column , the Department of Education required four years ago that schools use a standard based on preponderance of evidence to rid campuses of alleged sexual assailants .I committed a major gaffe during the back - and - forth exchange with a witness who was advocating for removing the authority of colleges to adjudicate sexual assault cases that happen on their campuses .My words did not convey my beliefs nor the policies I now or have ever supported .During that exchange I went too far by implying that I support expelling innocent students from college campuses , which is something neither I nor other advocates of justice for survivors of sexual assault support .That is not what I meant to say and I apologize for my poor choice of words ... .To most people who do n't know much about this issue , it makes sense to solely adjudicate these cases in our criminal justice system , just like we do other crimes ... this is a deeply dangerous idea that demonstrates a cursory and superficial understanding of the issue .Ask any sexual assault advocate and they 'll tell you the same thing .As we noted last Sunday and Rep. Polis tried to clarify after his remarks became controversial late last week , at no point was he suggesting that a lower standard of proof be allowable for criminal convictions of rape .And as Polis makes clear in his column today , colleges already use a lower standard of proof than the strict \" beyond a reasonable doubt \" standard required in criminal proceedings when investigating alleged sexual assaults .Polis explained that his statements were in response to a witness who asserted that law enforcement should handle all sexual assault investigations on campus , instead of the status quo allowing colleges to conduct investigations with a \" preponderance of the evidence \" standard of proof .It 's just too easy for the criminal justice system 's protection of the rights of the accused to be invoked here , which of course makes Polis look pretty bad - unless you understand that a different standard already applies , and for good reasons .Nobody wants to see innocent people punished , but the issue is not so clear cut that you can say with confidence a strict criminal evidentiary standard is called for in all cases .Sometimes that 's just not what 's needed to get justice .In the end , we think this episode is a good lesson in why word choice is very , very important .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "87.39635"}

{"text": "The above electoral map prediction from Western Illinois University has received a lot of attention , especially among supporters of Bernie Sanders , for showing Sanders winning in a landslide .Some argue that we should take this seriously because the mock election model has been right in every election it was used in since 1975 .The catch is that it was only used three times since 1975 .They deserve some credit for correctly predicting victories for Jimmy Carter over Gerald Ford before many people had heard of Carter , and for predicting the election of Obama when many were ( as with Sanders now ) claiming he was unelectable .While I would love for this to be true , it is also very hard to accept the results in specific states , such as Sanders winning Mississippi and Georgia but losing in Hawaii and Maryland .Of course the claims of being right are limited to the final results and not accuracy of state by state predictions .A victory for Sanders , even if closer and involving a different set of states , would still be welcome .It is easy to dismiss this prediction , and I could not blame either Clinton or the Republicans for denying any meaning to it beyond the enthusiasm of college students for Sanders .The bigger question this year is whether we can believe the conventional polls , especially when they are being used to determine who qualifies for the debates , which can potentially influence the outcome .Mike Huckabee and Chris Christie have been eliminated from Tuesday 's main debate , along with George Pataki and Lindsay Graham being excluded from the undercard debate .Even some pollsters have argued that the polls should not be used in this manner .One problem is that the Republican candidates are too close together to use the polls to separate them .Then there is the question of whether the polls are all that accurate in predicting a primary election well before the vote .I 've followed the Democratic primaries far more closely , and have noted many times how little predictive value the polls have .This polling report from December 2007 described how Clinton had a huge lead over Obama .In December 2003 , Howard Dean was pulling away in the polls .Eventual winner John Kerry was in sixth place with only 4 percent , even trailing Al Sharpton .Among the problems with these polls , many voters in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire do not decide until the last minute .People are far more likely to switch between relatively similar members of their own party than they are to switch from a liberal Democrat to a conservative Republican in a general election .Pollsters also adjust the raw results based upon projections as to who will actually vote , but that is difficult to predict .Some polls this year are basing their prediction upon whether someone voted in previous Democratic primaries , but this excludes the people are who , at least from discussions on line , are saying they have just recently registered to vote Democratic in order to vote for Sanders .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.83559"}

Bush presidency .When we look at Figure 1 we can see that naming popularity seems to be heavily affected by First Ladies .Most names experienced a steady downward trend in popularity .The name \" Rosalynn \" is an exception as it peaked in popularity during the Carter administration before falling by the end to have risen in popularity once again .The name \" Hillary \" is very unique in this pattern as unlike most names , it was growing rapidly in popularity prior to the Clinton administration .However , early into the Clinton administration the popularity dropped rapidly falling to pre-1980s levels for the name .Except for a small rally in during the 2007/2008 primary campaign against Obama , it has not recovered .While this is certainly quite silly and does n't necessarily mean anything , it 's strange to think about how many American girls could have potentially been named Hillary if Bill Clinton had lost the 1992 election .Obama Quips That New Low Unemployment Number Is ' Inconvenient ' For Republican Candidates .Friday , February 5 .By Cortney O'Brien .\" Americans are working , \" President Obama proudly declared at a White House press conference Friday morning .He was referring to the new jobs report that revealed unemployment has dropped to 4.9 percent - the first time it 's fallen below 5 percent in 8 years .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "89.57565"}

Marco Rubio .Christie lambasted Rubio on being ill prepared to be president of the United States .Christie stated that being a Senator does not prepare one to be president , whereas when one is a governor , they need to make decisions that impact the people who elected them and are held accountable for those decisions .\" Fool me once , shame on you .Fool me twice , shame on me , \" Christie had said ( bettering his former benefactor , George ) .Rubio 's comeback was pretty good , if a little obvious in its intent : He argued that experience was overrated ; if it mattered , Vice President Joe Biden would be a good candidate for commander - in - chief .He then argued that an unspoken premise of the criticism - that Obama has failed in part due to his inexperience - is faulty .Obama knows exactly what he 's doing , Rubio said .The president is not a fool ; he 's a menace .Christie was n't having it , dismissing Rubio 's Biden straw man and recommitting to his initial attack .Rubio 's a nice guy , a smart guy , Christie said ; but the simple fact is that he 's never had to make an important decision .This got a noticeable round of applause from the audience .And perhaps that 's why Rubio then proceeded to self - destruct .Christie stated with regards to Rubio , \" you have not been involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable , you just simply have n't .\" Christie followed up with , \" the fact is , when you talk about the Hezbollah sanctions act that you list as one of your accomplishments , you were n't even there to vote for it . \" Then Christie crushed Rubio with the fact that he did n't even show to vote with ... \" that 's not leadership , that 's truancy \" .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "91.76396"}

''Fugitive Days , ' ' the memoir I 've written about my participation in the Weather Underground and the antiwar movement and the events of 30 years ago , is now receiving attention in a radically changed context .My book is a condemnation of terrorism in all its forms .We are witnessing crimes against humanity .The intent of my book was and is to understand , to tell the truth and to heal .Brent Staples then published an excoriating review of Ayers ' book ( on September 30 , 2001 , in the Times ) which takes apart all of Ayers ' rationalizations and refusals to take responsibility for himself .Kathy Boudin has served 17 years in prison for her role in a 1981 Brink 's robbery that left a guard and two police officers dead and nine children fatherless .She received a sentence of 20 years to life , but in most cases an inmate with her record of model behavior could expect parole .Few people were surprised , though , when Boudin was turned down for parole at a widely publicized hearing in August .Prison officials cited the extraordinary violence of the crime .But looming over the case was Boudin 's membership in the Weathermen , a spinoff of Students for a Democratic Society .A group of affluent white kids , they played at being revolutionaries during the 1970 's and took credit for bombing two dozen public buildings , including the Pentagon .The robbery made clear the extent to which the student protest movement of the 1960 's had deteriorated into naked criminality .Boudin , at 58 , is confronting the possibility of spending the rest of her middle age in prison .But her former comrades Bill Ayers and his wife , Bernardine Dohrn , members of the Weathermen high command -- once known as the Weatherbureau -- who led the group through its most violent period in the 1970 's , have served no significant jail time .Both of them teach at name - brand universities and are headed for cozy retirements like those of the bourgeois parents they so despised during their Weathermen days .Ayers has further cushioned his future by writing a maddeningly evasive memoir , ' ' Fugitive Days ' ' -- one of those books that tell by not telling .The jacket copy is the kind of agitprop that could have been written by the young Ayers himself .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.10234"}

{"text": "As the Denver Post 's John Frank reports : .Colorado voters appear split on whether the death penalty should remain in place , a new poll finds , a result that may indicate support for capital punishment is softening in the state .The survey comes amid a conversation about the future of the death penalty in Colorado after juries in two high - profile trials opted against imposing it .Public Policy Polling , a Democratic firm , asked voters last week whether the state should replace the death penalty with life in prison without the possibility of parole .The survey found 47.2 percent favor keeping the death penalty and 42.9 percent want to replace it - a difference that is essentially within the margin of error of 4.3 percentage points .An additonal 10 percent remained undecided , according to the poll , which was commissioned by the Better Priorities Initiative , a Colorado - based group that opposes the death penalty .A press release from the Better Priorities Initiative quotes Boulder DA Stan Garnett : .\" This poll shows that Coloradans have grown weary of this wasteful government program that prolongs victims ' suffering , provides little to no deterrent effect , and ultimately yields no executions , \" said Stan Garnett , District Attorney for the 20th Judicial District . \"As Coloradans continue to have this statewide conversation about the death penalty , they are concluding they can live without it .These findings come on the heels of the state 's two highest profile death penalty cases in many years .In both cases , the death - qualified juries determined that life in prison without the possibility of parole was the appropriate sentence for the perpetrators instead of death by lethal injection .Garnett went on to say , \" As a District Attorney who has the responsibility of managing a large office of lawyers and staff , I always focus on what is efficient and what keeps my community safe .The reality is that the death penalty is wasteful and does nothing to make our communities safer .Tough and focused prosecutors across Colorado are coming to the same conclusion .The poll stands in marked contrast to another poll taken during the recently - concluded trial of the Aurora theater shooter , in which over 60 % percentage of respondents indicated they favored the death penalty in that case .The most recent round of debates over the death penalty has raged in Colorado since well before this summer , however , after Gov. John Hickenlooper granted a reprieve to the so - called \" Chuck E. Cheese killer \" who had been scheduled to be executed in 2013 .It was widely assumed that Hickenlooper 's decision to grant a reprieve in that case would cost him politically .In last year 's gubernatorial election , GOP opponent Bob Beauprez used Hickenlooper 's decision in campaign ads to paint the incumbent as \" soft on crime\"-a similar tactic to what Beauprez had unsuccessfully tried against Bill Ritter in 2006 .It did n't work , in part because Beauprez 's ugly negative campaign had begun to backfire on a variety of issues .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.493164"}

' 'When the group blows up a building , the act is cast as revenge for the power structure 's ruthless attacks on the ' ' black struggle . ' 'This affinity , by the way , is what landed Kathy Boudin -- Bryn Mawr graduate and famous lawyer 's daughter -- among the criminals who robbed that Brink 's truck .Fugitive Days ' ' contains a great many obfuscations .Chief among them is the author 's reluctance to mention Boudin .The two had a longstanding acquaintance that probably began in Cleveland during their S.D.S. days .They would certainly have known each other by 1969 , when the Weathermen split off from S.D.S. in pursuit of a more perfect radicalism .Years later , after Boudin went to jail for the armored truck robbery , Ayers and Dohrn took custody of her young son , Chesa , who was not yet 2 years old .The absence of Boudin in the book is peculiar , especially since she became famous in the event that forms the emotional center of ' ' Fugitive Days , ' ' the explosion that leveled the Greenwich Village town house the Weathermen were using as a bomb factory in 1970 .Boudin survived the explosion , walking naked from the wreckage and onto the F.B.I. 's most wanted list .But the blast killed three people , including Ayers 's lover , Diana Oughton , who was later identified from a fragment of finger .Ayers fixates on the explosion ....Ayers sifts and sifts this event , but somehow avoids mentioning Boudin -- even as he recounts meeting with ' ' two of the comrades who 'd come out of the explosion alive , ' ' one of whom had to have been Boudin .We can only guess why he fails to mention her .One possibility is that he wished to avoid adverse publicity at a time when Boudin was seeking parole .There is also a more complicated possibility .Ayers wants us to see Oughton as a revolutionary saint who struggled against the Weathermen 's bomb - based violence .He imagines that she blew up the town house deliberately , killing her comrades and herself , to prevent the explosives from being used against their targets .The notion that Oughton resisted the group 's more violent tendencies is borne out in Lucinda Franks 's 1981 New York Times Magazine account of an argument that is said to have consumed the day and the night before the explosion .Franks suggests that Boudin favored using antipersonnel bombs , and that Oughton had misgivings .The story of Oughton 's struggle is poignant , whether or not it 's true .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "111.978615"}

Lewis Libby Jr. .In 2004 , he backed Justice Department subordinates who withdrew a legal memorandum justifying harsh interrogations of suspected terrorists .This spring , more than a year after leaving the government , he publicly praised several United States attorneys who had been dismissed , undermining the administration 's claim that they were removed for poor performance .The Justice Department had ruled that the program would not be lawful without certain changes , and President Bush subsequently directed that the changes be made .Colleagues say Mr. Comey is , even now , a reluctant critic of the administration he served .But they say he feels strongly that there was no justification for the purge of prosecutors and remains furious about what he saw in 2004 as an improper attempt by the White House to bypass the Justice Department .Senator Charles E.

{"text": "One can only sit back and laugh at the completely absurd claims they make .One of the major things Geert Wilders speaks about is his belief that there is no such thing as a moderate Muslim , that this is in no way achievable .However there is no such thing as \" radical \" \" extreme \" or \" fundamental \" Islam either .There has been a growing use of the phrase \" Radical Islam \" ... in actual fact radicalism and Islam has no correlation .There is no such thing as \" extremists \" in religion ... its either religious or it 's not , and when it gets to what 's described as \" extreme \" it is no longer religion .Suicide bombing derives from a psycho - mentality that we have seen in many groups , Buddhism being one of those ... it does not originate from Islam .People who condone things like this \" Killing in the Name of God \" are not Muslims , but rather brain washed psycho 's .It 's not just Muslims in these regions which hold tensions toward the west .Using terrorists and radical psychotic figures as the face of Islam is much like using the KKK as the face of white people , and claiming that the KKK 's white supremacist ideologies are the ideologies of the entire White race .This is an absolutely inaccurate suggestion , which is far too general to be realistic .Practising Muslims , strive to read and understand the Qur'an in its original script in order to gain the real meaning of it , while Islamic critics read a void translation of separated verses taken out of context and use these as evidence against Islam .You ca n't read one paragraph of a book and generate an entire synopsis on the book .I 'll give you an example of what is being done to Islamic texts today in order to give a negative interpretation of text by taking one sentence from my above paragraph : . \" Islam is a religion of violence and not peace , hatred and not love \" .Without reading the sentences before and after this , we have an unfinished sentence with no back up and no explanation .For someone who is reading that on it 's own it appears as if I am attacking Islam , while in actual fact in that paragraph I am trying to point out that these are ignorant claims .When a verse or line in the Qur'an is quoted , and used as proof of all the negative claims against Islam , I have to stick by the argument that this is absolutely foolish .We know for sure that there is a massive tension between the West and the Middle East , and as I have stated before , this is entirely generated because of Political tensions and has nothing to do with people being Muslims .I mean let us not forget that 9/11 caused the invasion of two countries ... and a few thousand deaths of innocent civilians ... led to approximately 1.7million innocent civilian deaths .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "122.06099"}
