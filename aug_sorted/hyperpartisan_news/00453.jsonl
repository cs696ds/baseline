{"text": "that is what they are planning SENATOR CARDIN 'S RESPONSE TO REP .KING 'S U.S.ANTI -MUSLIM HEARINGS .HON .BENJAMIN L. CARDIN .OF MARYLAND .Tuesday , March 15 , 2011 .Mr. CARDIN .Mr. President , I rise today to share my thoughts on the hearings held last week in the House of Representatives called \" The Extent of Radicalization in the American Muslim Community and that Community 's Response .\" Congressional hearings are supposed to serve as an important role of oversight , investigation , or education , among other purposes .However , this particular hearing -- billed as the first of a series -- served only to fan flames of fear and division .My first concern is the title of the hearing -- targeting one community .That is wrong .Each of us has a responsibility to speak out when communities are unfairly targeted .In 1975 , the United States joined all the countries of Europe and established the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe , now known as the OSCE .The Congress created the U.S. Helsinki Commission to monitor U.S. participation and compliance with these commitments .The OSCE contains commitments in three areas or baskets : security , economics , and human rights .Best known for its human rights advancements , the OSCE has been aggressive in advancing these commitments in each of the OSCE states .The OSCE stands for religious freedom and protection of minority rights .I am the Senate chair of the U.S. Helsinki Commission .In that capacity , I have raised human rights issues in other countries , such as in France when , in the name of national security , the Parliament banned burqas and wearing of all religious articles or when the Swiss restricted the building of mosques or minarets .These policies were restrictive not only to the religious practice of Muslims but also Christians , Jews , and others who would seek to wear religious symbols and practice their religion as they saw fit .I have also raised human rights issues in the United States when we were out of compliance with our Helsinki commitments .In that spirit , I find it necessary to speak out against the congressional hearing chaired by Congressman Peter King .Radicalization may be the appropriate subject of a congressional hearing but not when it is limited to one religion .When that is done , it sends the wrong message to the public and casts a religion with unfounded suspicions .Congressman King 's hearing is part of a disturbing trend to demonize Muslims taking place in our country and abroad .Instead , we need to engage the Muslim community in the United States .A cookie - cutter approach to profile what a terrorist looks like will not work .As FBI Director Mueller recently testified to the Senate : . during the past year , the threat from radicalization has evolved .A number of disruptions occurred involving extremists from a diverse set of backgrounds , geographic locations , life experiences , and motivating factors that propelled them along their separate radicalization pathways .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "72.628075"}
