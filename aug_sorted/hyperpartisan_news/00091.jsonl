{"text": "R.J. Johnson - the architect of much of Gov.

Scott Walker , county employees and every other county department are facing deep cuts .But if Abele expects Clarke to quietly cooperate and willingly help the county close its $ 55 million budget gap , the county executive should n't hold his breath .That 's pretty much a direct quote . \"He ( Abele ) may think that he can require me to submit reports , \" Clarke said , adding that he does n't have to do that for anybody .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "38.22793"}

' \" [ USA Today , 4/27/2011 ] .Georgia State Representative Mark Hatfield ( R - GA ) introduces his so - called \" birther \" bill , House Bill 401 , which would require presidential and vice - presidential candidates to prove their citizenship before being placed on Georgia 's elections ballot .\" I think the issue with our sitting president has been left unresolved for a significant length of time that people have concerns , \" Hatfield says .\" But this is not just about our current president .It 's about enforcing the constitutional provisions for anyone who seeks the office of presidency .\" Ninety - three fellow representatives , all Republicans , sign on to Hatfield 's bill as co - sponsors .By the next day , March 3 , 20 withdraw their names , and several more withdraw the following day .On March 4 , local attorney and Libertarian Loren Collins publishes a scathing op - ed in the Atlanta Journal - Constitution noting that Hatfield 's bill would create requirements for president that do not exist in the US Constitution .Noting that the bill would require candidates to affirm that they have never held dual citizenships in other countries , Collins writes : \" There is not and never has been any constitutional rule mandating that the president ' has never held dual or multiple citizenship . 'This is pure birther fantasy , a nonexistent bit of pseudo law that an attorney such as Hatfield should know better than to promote .\" PolitiFact , the nonpartisan , political fact - checking organization sponsored by the St. Petersburg Times , determines that Collins 's claim of the bill 's extraconstitutionality is true .When PolitiFact contacts Collins for comment , the lawyer reminds it that Article II of the Constitution reads : \" No Person except a natural born Citizen ... shall be eligible to the Office of President .\" The language does not and should not exclude candidates who are or were dual citizens , Collins says .Foreign law decided who qualifies for dual citizenship , and foreign law should not decide who is eligible to be US president .Hatfield tells PolitiFact that he does not consider himself a \" birther , \" but wants proof that Obama is indeed eligible to be president .\" We 've seen a computer - generated summary of a live birth but not the particulars of his birth on a long form , \" Hatfield says ( see June 13 , 2008 and July 1 , 2009 ) .\" Congress has never created an enforcement mechanism , so it is up to the states to step up and fill the gap . \"Hatfield says the Founders thought that presidents should be born in the United States , their parents should be citizens , and dual citizens should be barred to avoid foreign influence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "71.04124"}
