'The Art of War .Storyline .Although accounts differ over the Sun Tzu 's origins , according to a biography written by a 2nd century BC historian he was a general who lived in the state of Wu in 6th century BC .Sun Tzu is most famous for the Art of War , praised as the definitive work on military strategy and tactics prior to the collapse of imperial China .Consisting of 13 chapters , the Art of War is one of the most famous studies on strategies for military success .The most fundamental of Sun Tzu 's principles is that \" warfare is based on deception \" , and he believed that \" the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting \" .One of his stratagems emphasizes the importance of knowing your enemy , \" If you know the enemy and know yourself , you need not fear the result of a hundred battles .If you know yourself but not the enemy , for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat \" .Today his work has found new applications in areas totally unrelated to its original military purpose and used as a guide in business , sport , diplomacy , and even in dating !Sun Tzu is 100 % right , and it does not only applies to warfare , but also to work : I 've convinced a seniot CEO to promised a hole lot of money if I could achieve a bold gold .( doen't matter what those golds were , only the time to achieve them : 5 months ) .Sun Tzu says : there are 5 elements you should consider BEFORE going to war .I verified the 5 elements BEFORE the \" war \" and reckon they were all in my favour ...so I WON !Straight & simple !As a mathematician I ca nt help but draw parallels to the Utility maximization problem .Which is basically Sun 's idea expressed in mathematical form .maximise gain , minimise loss .Sun Tzu was a truly rational thinker who also accounted for human emotion .@Ashish - I agree but I would like to say that it is maybe a little less \" emotion \" and a little bit more \" human problem solving \" .What I mean is that if you present a problem to someone its not pure logic vs emotion , alot of it is just how people tackle problems .There is another documentary on this site about Maths .One part of the doc showed how people consistently made bad decisions playing a game called \" lets make a deal \" .That shows that to predict human behavior you have to understand what a persons problem solving system is .I think this is where art of war shines .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "25.922085"}

{"text": "Top critical review .First off , I 'd like to make it clear that I have read the Art of War by Sun Tzu in a variety of translations , interpretations , and presentations - so this is not in so much a review of the work as it is this version .The Art of War is a seminal text on military strategy , doctrine and mindset .Absolutely essential reading for any involved with martial arts , warfare , or simply seeking a new way to enlighten their daily lives .An astounding work , and a fairly painless , quick read .However .And there 's always a however .I recently bought this version after misplacing one of my former versions of the work .Needless to say , this was a buy I do n't regret , but I would have liked to have picked another version had I been given the chance to do it all again .There are a number of typos , formatting errors , and misinterpretations in this version .The page size is large for the amount of text per page , likened to an 8 1/2 ' x 11 ' piece of paper folded width - wize .Actually , that may be what this is really printed on , save for a better paper stock .The editors and printers would have done better to select a smaller book format , made it thicker , or utilized more of the page space itself .This is a short work , but placing it in a large format does n't add to it 's value - especially for a public domain piece .In any case , this is an adequate version and printing of the text , but consider spending your money on a more developed version .There was a problem filtering reviews right now .Please try again later .What a different book .I picked it up , knowing it had been around forever and I had a mild curiosity what it had in it .I 've quoted Sun Tzu often enough , especially in the old Quote meme I used to host , but felt weird having never read the book .Amazon had it free and that was my golden opportunity to read it and see exactly what I had been missing .Philosophy .Are n't most philosophical statements just common sense told in parable ?That 's how I see them , and that was especially true in this book .Most of the points or statements Sun Tzu made , I felt were common sense if you just sat and thought about it .I took time after each point / statement and thought hard about what it meant .Sometimes you did n't have to think hard at all , it was plain as day .Each one rang true , and each one was different from the last .Look , I know we are not a world where every country is at war .But this book is n't just about fighting a war on land , it also touches on the wars we have within ourselves .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "33.196373"}

{"text": "This is the context in which Sun Tzu wrote the above introduction .To him , war was not the health of the state ; war was the potential death of the state , a cataclysm similar to a national heart attack that needed a general to perform CPR and save the nation from defeat and collapse .Even in \" victory , \" survival usually meant a massive expenditure of men and materiel that impoverished the entire society , making observations better suited to Adam Smith than Napoleon .Thus , in modern terms , Sun Tzu was wholly motivated by a single objective encompassing his entire strategy : delivering value to his stakeholders .To Sun Tzu , this meant to bring victory in the quickest , least bloody , least expensive , least ruinous manner possible .Sun Tzu 's stakeholders were : .His sovereign ; .His army ; .And the public at large of his nation .This view of stakeholders was then , and is now , remarkable in its breadth .Many believed then , and a good many believe now , that someone serving a particular leader should absolutely never regard this as \" public service \" ; the individual serves that specific leader as a retainer , serving at his pleasure and leaving at his whim .By the same token , the army is viewed as a tool ; and if a tool is not used , what good is it ?Therefore , the army must be used , period .Furthermore , the army must be used for the maximum advantage of the sovereign without any concern for the public at large .Sun Tzu recognized this view as short - sighted , politically motivated nonsense .Even in an autocratic , monarchical system , to act without the interests of the people in mind is to act with disregard for the self , even when viewed in an entirely selfish manner .Indeed , even the much - maligned Machiavelli wrote about the good of the people , abandoning notions of republicanism to try and shape good behavior by appealing to the base selfish interests of political princes .( Not that he really succeeded in this . )Even here , Sun Tzu sought to end wars quickly and with a minimum of fighting so as to minimize the damage to neighboring states , for what is the point of destroying the village to save it ? ...Particularly if it 's your sovereign who 's going to rule that village .It 's more like , \" If you buy it , make sure not to break it .\" When Sun Tzu narrowed \" The Art of War \" to , well , the art of war , he knew exactly who his stakeholders were ; he did not over - extend himself in trying to speak as to philosophy , economics , or other things .He dealt narrowly with what his specialty was , and in that supposedly narrow niche , discovered and propagated knowledge that can only be considered vast , flowing like a vast river rich in natural bounty .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "43.660034"}

{"text": "It makes more sense to vote by affiliation in Canada than it does in the US , where you get to vote for your president directly .But is a Senator 's party affiliation meaningless ?The furor over Jeffords tends to suggest otherwise .Party affiliation is n't meaningless , in that more often than not , members of the same party vote the same way on a given proposal .But it 's also not the sole measure .Legislators are individuals and while they align themselves with the party they feel the most affinity for , no one of them is going to agree with every point in the party platform .A President whose party holds the majority of seats in either house of Congress can be pretty sure of getting their support for his programs , and therefore , the programs ' passage in that part of the Congress , but it 's not guaranteed .Thanks for that explanation , Dave .At the point where you 're in one party and consistently voting with another and do n't see it as a temporary thing , it 's probably better for all involved if you leave .I understand completely some Republicans being unhappy with the effect Jefford 's realignment has on their immediate situation .And even in the short term , being unhappy about a turn of events does n't always translate into being ' wronged ' .I have a feeling that there are many , many people in this country , elected or not , who are reconsidering their party affiliation .Neither the Democrats nor the Republicans are the party they used to be .Affliation itself matters in terms of actual power , but both of our current major parties are becoming weaker in their ability to address the interests of the majority of the people .It 's safe to vote party line only when the party actually represents what you agree with .Dave 's being a trifle misleading about the Canadian system : the PM is elected , but not by the entire country on a simple majority vote .The PM is the elected leader of the party that has a majority of MP 's in the House of Commons .However , the PM is also an MP of a riding , and is elected in that riding .The party leader is elected by the party membership , not just the MPs of the party .Actually , Jessica , it is you who is being misleading .It is misleading to say that a leader was elected simply by virtue of their being elected leader of their party .In that case most Communist leaders were elected .Clearly it is misleading to say , \" Joseph Stalin was elected , \" without additional context .Additionally , although the Prime Minister does traditionally run for a seat in the House , he does not need to actually win that seat to become Prime Minister , he only needs to be the leader of the party with the most seats .( If he does n't win his seat it is traditional that somebody in a \" safe \" seat resign so he can have their seat .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.431915"}

{"text": "The Republican - turned - Democrat won 64 percent of the vote in Philly , but Sestak was winning 57 percent of the vote in the rest of the state - and that number might rise when all the votes are counted .This suggests that something quite interesting happened here today : Sestak was clearly the candidate of middle class and upper middle class liberals , and he ran a campaign that sought to convey the activist feel of Obama 's ' 08 race .But as Sestak suggested in his victory speech tonight , he also profited from being the anti - establishment candidate , and this helped him in a long list of rural and small town counties that are anything but liberal .Who knows if he can repeat this in November - especially since many of the smaller counties Sestak carried will no doubt vote Republican this fall .But the surge toward Sestak after he ran his ad questioning Specter 's motives in switching to the Democratic Party was quite comprehensive .And the breadth of his victory suggests he could be the sort of coalition - builder a politician needs to be to carry this complicated state .There 's much more to say , but for now , it 's worth noting that the overall message tonight can not be summarized as neatly as Washington kept trying to before the polls were closed .True , it was not a great night for incumbents .In Arkansas , Sen. Blanche Lincoln was forced into a runoff by Lt .Gov. Bill Halter .But that is hardly a clear sign of what will happen between Republicans and Democrats in November .After all , the Democrats handily won the one partisan race on the ballot today , with Mark Critz defeating Republican Tim Burns for the western Pennsylvania seat left vacant by the death of John Murtha .In Kentucky , Rand Paul 's sweeping victory is a rebuke for whom exactly ?Well , mostly for the Republican establishment , including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell .The Tea Party has some strength , but so far , its power has been seen mostly in Republican primaries .Does it really have reach outside the G.O.P. ?There is no obvious sign in any of tonight 's elections that Republican turnout was higher in relative terms than Democratic turnout - though Paul 's vote was fairly impressive .That may mean absolutely nothing this fall , but what we did n't see is a huge Republican surge that the \" enthusiasm gap \" registered in many of the polls might have suggested .The incumbent push back was part of the loss , but what put Sestak over the top was two other things .The attack on an admiral with 31 years of service backfired and the nay vote for Kagan getting a SCOTUS nomination played into a GOPer in Dem . clothing .I do n't agree with conservative districts going to Toomey , PA 12 went Dem . even after McCain won the district .Toomey will be considered as an incumbent vs Sestak .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.5649"}

{"text": "Well , I do n't think it 's too outrageous to suggest that someone who is running for president of the U.S. might want to educate himself on the issues facing the most populous state in the union .Power shortages began in California during the summer of 2000 .One San Diego newspaper ran more than 100 stories on the power shortage in the year 2000 .It 's possible that GWB may not have been aware of the situation , but if so , it 's not excusable .Beth is n't suggesting that politicians be given complete amnesty for breaking promises under changing circumstances -- she 's saying that they should be taken into consideration when assessing whether or not someone was right to break a promise .But anyway , I 'd say that that point is moot , because I do n't think that running as a Republican actually constitutes a promise to stay with the party or to vote along party lines .Jen , I think it should be obvious that was not what I meant .Let me rephrase : How does Cheney saying California knew about the problem for years imply that Bush would have a complete and total understanding of the problem ?I note you earlier mis - paraphrased what I said earlier and perhaps this contributed to this later misinterpretation .I did not say Bush did n't know about the problem , but that it turned \" out to be a much bigger problem than poor old Bush Jr. though .\" As you have already indicated , the problem only became a big issue shortly before the election .And I think a promise is a promise .People should n't make promises they ca n't keep . \" Jeffords ran as somebody who would be subjected to the influences of the Republican party .After he was elected he changed the rules .\" I do n't think I 've ever seen anyone put it that way ... nor do I think a politician would get many takers if they ran on a platform of being someone who is prone to allowing themselves to be ' subjected to the influences ' of anyone .At least for appearences sake , we rather like our politicians to have enough character and intelligence to avoid that sort of thing .In Jeffords case , he 's been running for years , successfully , as someone who would NOT be unduly subjected to the influences of the Republican party .I 'm sorry Dave , but your argument here seems to be mainly a lot of wishful thinking mixed in , possibly , with a misunderstanding about how U.S. politics work .While I can imagine being really disappointed in a representative I voted for switching affiliations , I think that Jeffords has a greater responsibility to the whole of Vermont , not just the few Republicans who voted straight party line .A senator is supposed to represent his whole state , just as a President is supposed to represent his whole country .On that count I feel that Jeffords is doing a far better job than Bush .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.58899"}

{"text": "Negative campaigning on the Republican side has prevented them from increasing their lead by even more .Republicans have pulled even in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire , while taking a moderate lead in New Hampshire .Republican Primary ( National ) : George W.

Bush : 40 % Ron Paul : 17 % Mark Sanford : 12 % Donald Trump : 11 % Duncan Hunter : 1 % .Analysis : In the first month of campaigning , President Bush was able to maintain roughly the same percentage of the Republican vote .The President has done a good job defending his decision to run for a third term , but a weak economy and the public souring on the Iraq war is causing the President to still remain below 50 % .In mid - July , South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford entered the Presidential race , and was able to sway many Southernors who were previously undecided into his camp .Both Ron Paul and Donald Trump made strong starts to their campaigns , nearing 10 % nationally .Duncan Hunter started his race getting a lot of attention and potentially becoming the \" Anti - Bush \" candidate , but has since failed to maintain that momentum .Democratic Primary ( National ) : Hillary Clinton : 44 % Chris Dodd : 18 % Joseph Lieberman : 13 % Mike Gravel : 2 % .Democratic Primary ( Iowa ) : Hillary Clinton : 35 % Chris Dodd : 28 % Joseph Lieberman : 10 % Mike Gravel : 2 % .Analysis : At the start of this campaign , Hillary Clinton looked to be the presumptive Democratic nominee .However , that soon changed , as Chris Dodd charged onto the scene , running an upbeat and aggressive campaign , heavily focused on denting Senator Clinton 's lead in Iowa .Senator Clinton began her campaign with an impressive announcement speech and a strong interview with Bill O'Reilly , and her position with moderate Democrats has greatly improved .Senator Lieberman seems poised to be making a run as well , and looks to already have the support of former Vice President Albert Gore .Bill Richardson had a good start of his campaign , but financing never materialized , and he dropped out by the end of the month .Mike Gravel has stayed pretty well out of the spotlight , but has certainly produced some interesting advertisements .Endorsement List : .President George W.
