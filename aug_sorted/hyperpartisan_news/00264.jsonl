{"text": "You say pretty concretely that the ghetto traps young people .Really ?All young people ?You did n't answer my question .No doubt growing up in a ghetto is mainly horrible .The man was a PIMP !He was making fat stacks of cash by furthering the commoditization of human beings for the benefit of some horny assholes .And then , ultimately , innocent people DIED from his direct and deliberate violence .He gets no more of a moral pass , regardless of his background , than anyone else doing this , be they a street pimp or multinational corporation .Think of the hiphop nation as one where ANY kind of crime is a capital crime .Even the Mafia and motorcycle gangs dispense justice with a sense of perspective : while most infractions can indeed get you murdered , there are situations in which simply breaking your kneecaps or firebombing your place of business is punishment enough .Hip - hoppers , however , will \" go to the mattresses \" over something as trivial as eating someone else 's candy -- anything less makes you look \" weak .\" Most recently , rapper and record label owner Rick Ross was fired upon because he displayed Gangster Disciple insignia on one of his albums , and they want to be compensated .Apparently , GoogleTube is too busy cracking down on people who post their favorite songs to notice that this kind of stuff is being uploaded : I guess they 're cool with your making lethal terroristic threats as long as your background music is original .This had nothing to do with rap music .This was two rival pimps .Granted , rap music contains far more than its share of both violence and misogyny , but this had way more to do with \" disrespect \" and/or business than music .Furthermore , I 'd suggest that most rap music is a reflection of attitudes , rather than the cause of attitudes .Years ago when I moved to Vegas , . one of my neighbors , probably in her 70s , who had lived in the city for decades was the first person I heard say what I call the Vegas Mantra : \" Things were better when the mob ran the city . \" A couple of years later I watched a documentary about Las Vegas and Debbie Reynolds - sweet , butter - wouldn't - melt - in - her - mouth Debbie Reynolds - said \" When the mob ran things nobody got killed that was n't supposed to be killed .\" This morning , hearing about the taxi driver and passenger who were collateral damage in this rolling shootout , I started to believe the Mantra .This megalomaniac shit sucks more than my Dyson .Why anyone spends time immersed in this surreal , cocky , fake - hero bullshit is beyond me .This truly ranks right up there with all of the other self - obsessed crap that is a sign of the times .I sure hope that there was more to this fellow than this video suggests .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.29585"}
