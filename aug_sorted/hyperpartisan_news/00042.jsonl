Bush , including one who threatened to resign to block legally questionable anti - terror surveillance , have a realistic chance of being asked to head the FBI , according to people familiar with the search .James Comey and Kenneth Wainstein served in sensitive national security - related posts at the Justice Department in the Bush administration .That could make for interesting confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee if President Barack Obama selects either to succeed FBI Director Robert Mueller .His 10-year , nonrenewable term expires Sept. 4 .Their service as political appointees under a Republican president is a key factor in explaining the rise of Comey and Wainstein in the search .The Obama administration faces an expanded Republican minority in the Senate with the votes to seriously complicate the confirmation prospects of any nominee who draws their united opposition .On the other hand , Comey became a hero to Democratic opponents of Bush 's warrantless wiretapping when Comey refused for a time to reauthorize it .Bush revised the surveillance program when confronted with the threat of resignation by Comey and Mueller .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.35122"}

'Then , more and more , politics led the way .When we did well with it in the 2006 elections , we made a decision to become ' the place for politics , ' as the late Tim Russert dubbed us - and all of a sudden began to take off a little .Griffin says that both Olbermann and fellow MSNBC stalwart Chris Mathews \" both had a strong point of view about the war -- but our strategy then was simply to hire smart people , allow them to have a point of view , and to be authentic .At the same time , we moved even further toward politics and away from trying to be ' all things to all people . 'Yes but ...Fox News covers politics as well , albeit with a clearly conservative slant .Does n't the hiring of Schultz -- and Maddow before him -- signal that MSNBC is positioning itself as the progressive alternative ?Well , Rachel did so well as a guest analyst -- and was so smart , like Keith -- that we asked her to fill in when he went on vacation , \" Griffin recalls . \"", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.034454"}

{"text": "If MSNBC can hold just a portion of these numbers over time , it could signal a turnaround in the cable news hierarchy .MSNBC has not been particularly successful in building their audience , while Fox has masterfully captured the glassy - eyed disciples of conservatism .Time will tell if this is a blip or a trend .In related news , the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press released their post - convention survey of attitudes and opinions of the candidates and their events .The headline notes that President Obama was overshadowed by keynoter Bill Clinton .That provides a stark contrast for the RNC where Mitt Romney was similarly overshadowed by Clint Eastwood .Who would you rather be overshadowed by ?And Fox News viewers affirm Pew 's findings : .For much of the past decade Fox News has been a virulent opponent of NBC .They have severely lashed out at its news division and many of the hosts on their MSNBC cable arm .The attacks have ranged from NBC being in bed with President Obama to being responsible for the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq .Rupert Murdoch 's news empire has made it their mission to destroy NBC .In addition to castigating people like Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow , they aimed their vitriol at the executive suites .Bill O'Reilly famously called GE 's CEO Jeffrey Immelt \" a despicable human being . \"Meanwhile , Murdoch 's New York Post trades in gossipy articles about Olbermann 's mental health and even published his home address , a despicable act whose only purpose was to incite acts of violence .That makes it all the more curious that Fox News has not said a single derogatory word about Donald Trump 's affiliation with NBC .Does Fox know that \" The Apprentice \" is an NBC program ?This fact seems to have evaded their attention entirely .After so many years of lambasting NBC as a bastion of liberal propaganda , why do they suddenly have no complaints ?In fact , why are n't they praising NBC for employing one of their favorite conservative prospects for the GOP nomination for president ?The only place I have heard any criticism of NBC for its affiliation with Trump is on MSNBC .That 's a rather startling turn of events as it is almost unheard of for a network to permit such intramural attacks .But MSNBC 's Lawrence O'Donnell has been unrelenting in his denouncement of Trump 's show and of NBC for running it .He has noted its declining ratings and mocked its ludicrous presentation of iconic wackos like LaToya Jackson and Gary Busey .And O'Donnell was not the least bit reserved in saying that ... .\"The NBC standard for crazy people in their primetime schedule saying evil and hateful things ... apparently you can do that on NBC .\" O'Donnell , like many others , believes that Trump 's prospective campaigning is only about ratings for his struggling program .If that 's true he is failing miserably .The last episode of Celebrity Apprentice drew 7.6 million viewers , down from 8.2 million the previous week and 9.7 million the week before that , right after he began his Birther spiel .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "98.22589"}
