{"text": "In other words , the 49ers started out with 48.6 % more draft value than the Packers .Of course they 're going to be able to get more out of it !Secondly , these players have yet to play a single down in the pro arena .We should very well know by now that high draft picks can be phenomenal busts , while low draft picks can be hidden diamonds in the rough .It 's worthwhile to compare draft value based on scouting grades and reports ; however , it 's rather silly to make concrete future predictions based on that .Which leads to my third and most important point : a team 's draft picks do n't contribute that much in their rookie season .We call it \" draft and develop \" because these players do n't come ready - made for the NFL .They have to be coached , and they have to improve their technique and football knowledge in order to be effective at the professional level .Let 's take the San Francisco 49ers for example .They reached the Super Bowl in 2012 , but do you recognize any of these names from their rookie draft class ?A.J. Jenkins , LaMichael James , Joe Looney , Darius Fleming , Trent Robinson , Jason Slowey , and Cam Johnson played a combined total of 12 games and zero starts .That means the 49ers were a Super Bowl team in the making over several years and that drafted players take time to really make an impact .Of course , I do n't want to rest my assertion on that one example .I wanted to make sure that this claim actually has some validation to it , so I started doing some research .My goal was to look at the Green Bay Packers ' draft classes since Ted Thompson became GM and see how much each one has contributed to the team .How much does a rookie class generally contribute to the team ?How long does it take for a given draft class to hit its peak contribution ?In other words , when does a team finally see its highest value of return from a single draft ?Before I started compiling and calculating the statistics to answer these questions , I had to determine the best way to measure a draft class 's \" value .\" The single best measurement I could figure was number of games played and number of games started by each player , averaged out by draft year and sorted by season .It 's not a perfect measurement , I know , but it 's the only one that could be compiled and applied to all players .( Number of snaps played would be similarly effective , but I could n't access that kind of data . )The biggest drawback is that certain players contribute more on a per game basis than others .A good example would be Aaron Rodgers and Mason Crosby .Both players have started in every game they 've played in for the past five seasons , but we can easily say that Rodger 's starts have more value to the team 's success than Crosby 's .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.307434"}

Lang , Quinn Johnson , Jarius Wynn , Brandon Underwood , and Brad Jones .Yet as guys like Lang and Jones saw increased success and eventually starting roles , the rest were simply replaceable and eventually cut from the team .One more calculation we can make is what I call the \" AGS / AGP Ratio .\" It 's essentially a percentage of how many games played were starts .Thus , 1.00 would mean that all the games played by that draft class were also starts , while 0.00 would mean that none of the games played were starts .In other words , it gauges how strong the draft class 's contributions were on a general level .You 'll notice the obvious trend : the ratio is directly proportional to the number of years played .Aaron Rodgers , the sole remaining player from 2005 , starts every game that he plays .You can also look at how individual draft classes compare .Despite being a relatively strong class , the 2009 group does n't really compare in this category with the 2006 group .The latter draft class had a much higher AGS / AGP ratio , even though their total games played was rather average .( Top picks A.J. Hawk , Daryn Colledge , Greg Jennings , and Jason Spitz all saw starting time very quickly in 2006 . )There 's a lot to digest here , but hopefully it will shed some new light on this aspect of a team 's management .That said , this only represents a Ted Thompson - built roster .Were we to do the same data mining with other teams , we could possibly see some different trends .There 's also the effects of injuries to consider in looking at the numbers .The 2011 draft class did n't get a lot of chances their first year due to how stacked the team already was , but their second year was further hampered by injuries to Derek Sherrod , Davon House , and D.J. Smith .Back to my original premise , though , and you can see that it 's generally not common to see rookie draft classes make a big contribution to a team 's success .Yes , particularly strong draft classes can make a difference , but even then it 's mostly in back - up and special teams roles .Aside from the top picks and the sleepers , most players are developed into starting talent , rather than being ready to go on Day One .Even players who start their first year are n't playing at their ceiling yet .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.03505"}
