Simpson verdict .This was the night that St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch announced that Officer Darren Wilson would not be indicted for the shooting of Mr. Michael Brown .One year later , my thoughts are 550 miles away in Minneapolis , MN , dealing with another police shooting of an unarmed black man .As in Ferguson , the community is protesting the targeting of black lives and the shooting of Mr. Jamar Clark .Community members are being arrested for expressing their constitutional right to peacefully assemble while the victim is being demonized as a criminal without the opportunity to defend himself , and the officers protected from the scrutiny of the citizens that they are sworn to protect .SEE THE REST OF THIS POST .Rekia Boyd , Eric Garner , Ezell Ford , Tamir Rice and Michael Brown are among the countless lives that have been lost at the hands of law enforcement officers across the country .The reports of unnecessary or excessive force by police continue to mount , captured by body cameras , dashboard cameras , cell phones and eyewitnesses .SEE THE REST OF THIS POST .Today , we learned that a grand jury in Ferguson decided not to indict Police Officer Darren Wilson for the shooting death of Michael Brown - an unarmed 18-year - old - in August .The community response to Mike Brown 's death , and the response that is likely still to come , mark a pivotal moment in the human rights movement and in U.S. history .It 's a moment of passion , of frustration , and of activism .It 's within this moment that officials in Ferguson and throughout the United States must stand up to ensure that each individual 's human rights - including the right to freely express themselves in the form of peaceful protest - are respected , protected and fulfilled .SEE THE REST OF THIS POST .Riot police in military gear in the streets , dispersing peaceful protestors gathered to address grievances with their government .Protestors threatened with weapons .Civil rights violated .Despite similarities to recent events in the US , I 'm not talking about Ferguson .This is Zimbabwe .SEE THE REST OF THIS POST .Police reportedly used tear gas on May 28 to disperse a group protesting the demolition of Taksim Gezi Park in Istanbul .This was just one of many recent instances where Turkish police have used excessive force to repress peaceful protests ( Photo Credit : Bulent Kilic / AFP / Getty Images ) .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.224308"}

{"text": "That is why protesters say black lives matter .Each of these is also a separate case in which \" justice \" is a complicated mess of facts and law , with no societal conclusions to be drawn or clarified by considering them together .That 's true for criminal cases , which must be considered in isolation .But it 's not true for broader concepts of justice when considered as a matter of public policy .In policy analysis , patterns matter .Medical science does not allow us to determine which particular cigarette gave a smoker lung cancer , but we know damned well that smoking causes cancer .Similarly , Ferguson protest leader Deray McKesson tweeted ... .\" I do not condone the killing of the two NYPD officers today .I do not condone the killing of unarmed black people .I do not condone killing .Also despicable .He , like the alleged shooter Brinsley , is drawing a false equivalence between what may be legal shootings by police unrelated to color and the killing of the two officers , who were not black , in response .Jack 's reaction to this is just unhinged .McKesson and Sharpton are both denouncing the killing of police officers .They are saying that killing cops does not serve their cause .And in Jack 's mind , this is linking the police killings to the cause in some sort of false equivalence .Granted , the cold blooded murder of officers Ramos and Liu is a terrible crime , without question .But some of the things police officers are being accused of are pretty terrible too , even if they do n't quite rise to the level of first degree murder .As Jack points out , the police killings may in fact be legal , but then again , they may not be .( Officer Peter Liang , for example , looks like he might do time for killing Akai Gurley , although that crime does n't seem to have any racial component . )And even if the killings are legal , that does n't mean they 're morally right .Lots of terrible things that people do to other people are perfectly legal and yet terribly wrong .This is an argument not that these things are acceptable , but that the laws should be changed .Another point is that McKesson and Sharpton are not the ones who linked the cop killings to their cause .That was done by everybody from Governor Pataki to former Mayor Giuliani to the head of the NYPD union .Activists like McKesson , Sharpton , and the rest are responding to that by saying they oppose violence against the police as much as they oppose violence against black people .This does not seem like a bad thing .The deaths of police officers in the wake of the ongoing , high - profile campaign to demonize police and the justice system for political advantage were predictable .It 's always possible that rhetoric will incite crazy people to do terrible things .But censoring yourself because of how a crazy person might respond is a madness of a different kind .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "52.746124"}
{"text": "You ca n't blame anybody for at least suspecting that this was a racially motivated killing .As it happens , after a thorough investigation , which probably would n't have happened without the protests , it turns out there 's some convincing evidence that Mike Brown attacked Officer Wilson .It appears to have been a reasonably justifiable shooting .But in the early days it only made sense to assume the worst - that the shooting was part of the long racist pattern of policing in Ferguson .When I read Spencer Ackerman 's story in the Guardian about a Chicago Police \" black site \" right here in the city - where CPD supposedly keeps people in secret to interrogate them without access to a lawyer - I was skeptical .Scott Greenfield is too : .What about a civil suit ?Where are the \u00a7 1983 actions for the deprivations of civil rights ?Even if the state courts were part of some conspiracy to keep this black site out of the courtroom , are the federal courts part of the conspiracy as well ?And what of the family of the \" at least \" one dead guy ?Did n't they go to a lawyer to address this little detail , that their father or husband turned up dead ?Scott does n't like when people speculate in his comment section , so I 'll do it here .Part of the answer to Scott 's question of why this has n't come out is that this is Chicago and that 's how we roll .Former Commander Jon Burge tortured people for years before it came out .Actually , it came out all the time , but just from criminal scumbags , not anyone that the good people of Chicago were willing to believe .I 'm sure this place really exists , and I 'm sure people are occasionally interrogated there .I 'm also pretty sure there have been some shenanigans about whether or not somebody 's client is actually there .However , I also think that calling it a \" black site \" is just hype for the Guardian .Big city police departments have lots of buildings that are n't technically police stations - armories , administrative centers , supply depots , specialized units , stuff like that .It 's not hard to imagine that if you 're a cop who 's grabbed somebody up and you want to talk to them without the distractions of a busy police station ( or their lawyer ) you might want to take them to one of these buildings .It 's police - controlled , but it 's not the first place someone will look .Or suppose you 're a cop attached to one of those special units that operates out of that Chicago - Police - building - that - is - not - a - station , maybe a unit with some kind of intelligence function .You 're trying to develop an informant , so you pick the guy up and bring him to your office .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "53.73123"}

{"text": "Because of the inevitable tension inherent in illegal protest , disobedients must not only eschew violence at the outset of their actions but also assess their ability to remain peaceful given the reasonably foreseeable consequences of their conduct .My second contention is that Civil disobedience has been an important catalyst for change and is part of America 's heritage and history .The Stanford University Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that throughout history , acts of civil disobedience famously have helped to force a reassessment of our society 's moral parameters .Why talk about long ago , before there were even laws against most offenses that civil disobedience can be against .The civil disobedience of the civil rights movement of the 1960s is well known .Not only were local segregation laws violated , but when people engaged in \" sit - ins \" in 1960 and 1961 to protest racial segregation , they were in violation of recognized federal law , as discussed in the Civil Rights Cases of 1883 .The nation soon recognized that these violations of law were honorable , and that punishment of people seeking to support the principles of the First Amendment of the Declaration of Independence was wrong .My third and final contention is that civil disobedience is justified because everyone who conducts civil disobedience has the same basic human rights in a democratic society .If we do n't protect the human rights that we have , everyone wo n't be equal .Here is where the \" moral \" part ties itself into this subject .It is moral for everyone no matter what age , race , gender , or anything that can be a reason to dismiss someone from something , to have a say .Human rights are codified in the laws of a society .Further those same laws represent the morals of the society since the majority of a society will want its beliefs to be expressed in the laws .Therefore , by protecting human rights we uphold the ideals of a democratic society .Let me add on that without human rights , people are open to oppression from others .If a democracy allows for people to be oppressed then the whole reason for creating a government would be pointless .Civil disobedience shows that we are a democracy because the people have the ability to protest the government .The people would n't be in control because they would n't be allowed to protest the government that is made for , from , and by them .The government will have more control without civil disobedience , therefore making the government not as democratic , and then it would be harder to have more human rights with more control since the people would be prone to oppression from the government .Thank you .I have sources that are cards for debating ... and have no idea how to put them online from word documents to make public .First , I would like to thank my opponent for proposing a very challenging debate and I hope to be able to adequately defend the con position I have accepted .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.711426"}
