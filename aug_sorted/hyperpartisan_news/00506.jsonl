Alamoudi .Even the notorious criminal case against Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) operative Sami Al - Arian began as a naturalization fraud investigation .But a handful of victories in a sea of ignored cases is not really success .There is much room for improvement and , ironically , improvement may not even require legislative change but no more than shift in focus and willingness by executive branch agencies responsible for investigating and prosecuting the violations .This matter appears ripe for congressional inquiry .The CIS report has opened that door .A summary of polls about the ideological makeup of the Muslim - American community shows that the majority is moderate , but there is a formidable minority influenced by Islamist doctrine .A significant number are refusing to give answers or are still figuring out where they stand on issues like terrorism and Sharia Law .The number one question is how many Muslim - Americans support terrorism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.243546"}
