Blanchflower and Andrew J.

{"text": "You ca n't control how inconsistent she is , but you can control your behavior .If you are n't getting much out of this , and she keeps pushing you away , then it 's time to seriously question if it 's worth it .RHOA Recap : Peaches Divided [ Episode 14 ] .Last week we witnessed some RI - DIC - U - LOUS foolishness between Apollo , Brandon , Kenya , Natalie and Christopher .Considering that blows were actually landed , I 'm surprised more damage was n't done .We come back seeing everything die down , but we 've also seen the previews where Kandi pops off .So what the heck happened ?Apollo and Phaedra are on their way out , NeNe is chasing Kenya around trying to get her to apologize .For some reason , Apollo circles back to Brandon .That 's quickly resolved , as Peter restrains Apollo and Greg walks Brandon out .Meanwhile Chuck stands behind Mynique .Porsha and Lauren take off because Porsha starts seeing spirits in people 's faces .In the midst of Chris apologizing to NeNe for partially starting the drama , he manages to bring up the situation between Kenya and Natalie and why Kenya would be so involved in their relationship .This strikes a chord with Kandi , and she jumps in about how Natalie was all up in her and Todd 's business the same way , saying he was an opportunist .Here 's where it gets a little weird .Cynthia jumps up to defend Natalie , and since Cynthia is probably close to a foot taller than Kandi and starts waving her hands around , Kandi starts getting a little heated .Then Peter jumps in the picture asking some questions , the boys push each other , and Malorie pushes Kandi .That sets Kandi COMPLETELY off !I do n't need to explain it , because if you 've seen any preview in the last week , it 's clear how Kandi acted .Kandi realizes she 's out of control and leaves willingly .Peter and Todd talk out their differences , and now are cool .Everyone seems to be calming down , and the evening comes to an abrupt end .I 'm a \" do n't start none and wo n't be none\"-type of gal , but if you start some , I 'm going to finish it .Everyone wakes up to rehashing the previous night 's events .Todd diffuses the situation in his house by joking that he almost saw someone 's titty .Kandi is remorseful because of how out of control she got .She knew she had gone too far and probably made Cynthia think differently about her ( which she is correct ) .NeNe and Gregg stop over Peter and Cynthia 's place and NeNe talks about how she has to go see a therapist because it was so dramatic .At Kenya 's house , Brandon talked about how he could press charges because Apollo broke his rib and gave him a shiner but wo n't do it because of the kids .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "109.79872"}
{"text": "I also think it is important to note that the social model of disability comes directly out of the disability rights movement and is something that has been adopted into the social sciences .It 's not something able - bodied social scientists just invented as an explanatory model because they favor social constructionism or something like that .I am actually advocating that we use a model that PWDs have put forward to explain disability and that we abandon the medical model because PWDs disagree with it and have provided very convincing arguments as to why it is harmful .Indigenous cultures of the Americas had a variety of two - spirit identities that accommodated various transgender modes of expression .Some tribes held them as having special status or shamanic power .India had the sub - culture / spiritual group called Hjira who were mtf spectrum transgender ( though intersex folk were also included ) .They occupied a fairly accepted social position until stigmatized by British imperialists .Thailand has had the tradition of kathoey ... they are both stigmatized AND sometimes regarded as \" lucky \" or a status symbol .Islam has had the category of mukhannathun , who were mtf / eunuch and occupied a specified , accepted social role .There were the Galli priestesses of Cybele in Ancient Greece .Afghanistic had a special status afforded to trans men in families without sons ... the name escapes me at the moment .There are numerous other examples .And basically in EVERY culture , throughout the world , in every historical time period , we can find examples and instances of transgenderism .The literature substantially supports this .Yes , the exact socio - cultural way these identities were treated , defined and articulated has varied widely .Sometimes regarded as \" both sexes \" , sometimes as \" third sex \" , sometimes as genuine members of the identified sex .Sometimes as stigmatized outcasts , sometimes regarded as having special status or special spiritual significance or potency or powers .But what is a culturally universal constant is the existence of individuals who express their gender in a way \" opposite \" that of their assigned sex .The fact that the exact end - point of their transitions varied does not , to me , suggest that the actual feelings and disorder were different , it simply suggests that their cultures provided limited means of accommodating , expressing or coping with those feelings .I do not in any way think it 's much of a leap to imagine that throughout all of these cultural expressions of transgenderism , there were people experiencing what we call GID : a sense of extreme discomfort with the gendering of their body .Language and culture profoundly shapes how we conceive and think about realities .But it does n't actually change those realities .Although GID may have been concieved , defined , articulated or expressed in different ways throughout different cultures does n't mean the underlying issue was n't constant : a disconnect between gender identity and physical anatomy .And to keep it from straying too far off topic : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "110.23233"}
