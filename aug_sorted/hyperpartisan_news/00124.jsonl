Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had one more retirement home rumble before New Hampshire residents flock to the polls Tuesday .In some areas , the two candidates showed great respect for one another , along with agreement on some policy issues .At other times , the gloves came off and things got a bit testy .NBC 's Chuck Todd and Rachel Maddow moderated the debate .Bernie Sanders opened by saying that millions are leaving political process because they know the economy is rigged .The top one percent is reaping the benefits , and there 's a corrupt campaign finance system is keeping that system in place via donations to super PACs .We need to work to create an economy that works for all .Hillary Clinton said that we could get back on the right track , where wages reflect people 's work .I 'm fighting for people , and I 'm not making promises I can not keep .Clinton said that she shares a lot of policy goals with Sen.

Chicago decision .Yet , the Court noted that this right was not unlimited , and that certain limitations on weapons considered \" dangerous and unusual \" could pass constitutional muster .Grenade launchers , rocket - propelled grenades , and atomic weapons fit this category , not AR-15 semiautomatic rifles .Yet , as Dahlia Lithwick wrote in Slate , it 's dubious whether the Supremes will get involved in Kolbe v.

Sanders said that our great task was not getting sucked into perpetual warfare in Syria and Iraq .As president , he said he would do his very best to make sure that does n't happen .Sending American troops is what ISIS wants for a propaganda campaign .Sanders would n't give in to that , but air support and the deployment of special operations ( when appropriate ) would be options on the table for a Sanders White House taking the helm on this issue .When asked about his foreign policy doctrine by Chuck Todd , Sanders said that we learned the lesson of the wars in Iraq ; we can not do it alone .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "83.495346"}

Traxler Jr. , writing for the majority , found that the Maryland law \" significantly burdens the exercise of the right to arm oneself at home \" and should have been analyzed using a more stringent legal standard .[ ... ] .The Maryland law was challenged by a group of gun - store owners and individuals who said the prohibited firearms are not military weapons and are used for lawful purposes such as self - defense , target practice and hunting .Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh ( D ) , who helped pass the law as a state senator , said Thursday that the court majority got it wrong .\" I think it 's just common sense that the Second Amendment does not give people a right to own military - style assault weapons , \" he said .In a strongly worded dissent , Judge Robert B. King wrote : \" Let 's be real : The assault weapons banned by Maryland 's [ law ] are exceptionally lethal weapons of war \" and as such , he said , not necessarily protected by the Second Amendment .Bob Owens noted that this could impact the legality of assault weapons bans from other anti - gun states as well .The National Shooting Sports Foundation voiced their support in a statement released yesterday : .\" We are greatly heartened by the Fourth Circuit panel 's ruling today , \" said Lawrence G. Keane , Senior Vice President and General Counsel , National Shooting Sports Foundation ( NSSF ) , one of the lead plaintiffs in this case . \" As this important case goes forward , NSSF will continue to work with our co - plaintiffs to ensure that our citizens ' Second Amendment rights are protected and that the lawful commerce in firearms is restored in support of this constitutional protection . \"Liberals keep twisting themselves into pretzels over these so - called assault weapons , which are a figment of the liberal imagination .It looks scary - that 's their argument .An AR-15 rifle has the same operating system as a handgun .They 're both semi - automatics , meaning they self - reload upon discharging a round .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.15285"}

Cruz propose building a wall and tripling the amount of border patrol agents .He noted that once you 've secured the border , we could tackle our illegal immigration problem .On the wall Cruz added , \" I 've got someone in mind to build it , \" while looking at Trump .Rubio wants to expand the border patrol , have an entry / exit system to track the number of visa overstays , and have mandatory e - verify for businesses .Yet , the ghosts of the 2013 \" Gang of 8 \" bill reared its head , with Christie chiming in pushing the senator if he fought for his bill .Again , Christie noted that this is a difference between a governor and a legislator , touting his record in taking on the teachers unions - and winning the fight over tenure .The Democrats did n't shut down the government , and the tax increase was n't passed , because they knew , according to Christie , that he would fight for what he thinks is right for the state .Hot Air 's Mary Katharine Ham asked Donald Trump whether he was closer to Bernie Sanders than the conservative movement regarding health care policy , quoting the billionaire magnate for saying that everyone 's got to be covered .Oh , and the government is going to pay for it .Trump said , \" I 'm closer to common sense , \" while saying there are so many examples of something that we could do to fix our health care system .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.081924"}

{"text": "STORY HIGHLIGHTS .Average 45.9 % approval similar to 46.1 % in prior quarter .PRINCETON , N.J. - President Barack Obama 's job approval rating in his 27 th quarter in office , from July 20 to Oct. 19 , averaged 45.9 % , essentially unchanged from his 46.1 % average for the prior quarter .Obama 's daily approval ratings also varied little within his most recent quarter , averaging 46 % nearly every week during the quarter .There were just two modest but notable exceptions .In late August , as U.S. stocks fell in response to concerns about problems in the Chinese economy , his weekly approval rating dipped to 44 % .And in late September it rose to 48 % during the week of Pope Francis ' U.S. trip , which included a widely covered visit with Obama at the White House .Since he became president nearly seven years ago , Obama has averaged 47 % job approval .There have been only five quarters when he had majority approval , with four of those occurring during the first year of his presidency , the so - called \" honeymoon phase \" when new presidents tend to be rated positively .The only other time Obama 's quarterly approval exceeded 50 % was perhaps the most consequential one - the 16 th quarter , in which he was re - elected .Obama 's 27 th Quarter Midrange Compared With Other Presidents .Obama is the sixth post - World War II president to serve a 27 th quarter in office .Two of these - Dwight Eisenhower and Bill Clinton - were rated quite positively at this stage in their presidencies , with average approval ratings of 65.3 % and 59.7 % , respectively .In contrast , Harry Truman ( 23.0 % ) and George W. Bush ( 33.2 % ) were decidedly unpopular at the same point of their presidencies .Truman 's 27 th quarter average is the worst quarterly average for any president in Gallup 's polling history .Obama 's 27 th quarter average , along with Ronald Reagan 's , is between these two extremes .Reagan averaged 47.0 % approval , slightly better than Obama 's 45.9 % .After presidents have served nearly seven years in office , Americans ' opinions of them are pretty well - established and unlikely to change unless a major international or domestic crisis occurs .Clinton 's and Bush 's approval ratings did not change between their 27 th and 28 th quarters .Truman , Eisenhower and Reagan saw modest improvements of a few percentage points .Implications .Americans ' opinions of Obama have been steady this year , holding near 46 % .Obama 's relatively low approval ratings may be as much a function of the era in which he is governing as it is a reflection on his leadership , management and decision - making .There have been relatively few international crises that helped to boost his public support , as the 9/11 attacks and Iraq War did for Bush , and as similar crises have done for other presidents .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "88.19368"}

Bush ( 33.2 % ) were decidedly unpopular at the same point of their presidencies .Truman 's 27 th quarter average is the worst quarterly average for any president in Gallup 's polling history .Obama 's 27 th quarter average , along with Ronald Reagan 's , is between these two extremes .Reagan averaged 47.0 % approval , slightly better than Obama 's 45.9 % .After presidents have served nearly seven years in office , Americans ' opinions of them are pretty well - established and unlikely to change unless a major international or domestic crisis occurs .Clinton 's and Bush 's approval ratings did not change between their 27 th and 28 th quarters .Truman , Eisenhower and Reagan saw modest improvements of a few percentage points .Implications .Americans ' opinions of Obama have been steady this year , holding near 46 % .Obama 's relatively low approval ratings may be as much a function of the era in which he is governing as it is a reflection on his leadership , management and decision - making .There have been relatively few international crises that helped to boost his public support , as the 9/11 attacks and Iraq War did for Bush , and as similar crises have done for other presidents .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "92.33293"}

Chicago decision .Yet , the Court noted that this right was not unlimited , and that certain limitations on weapons considered \" dangerous and unusual \" could pass constitutional muster .Grenade launchers , rocket - propelled grenades , and atomic weapons fit this category , not AR-15 semiautomatic rifles .Yet , as Dahlia Lithwick wrote in Slate , it 's dubious whether the Supremes will get involved in Kolbe v. Hogan .It 's certainly a possibility , and it offers another legal avenue for Second Amendment supporters to make their case for a broader ruling over the entire country concerning the legality of assault weapons bans .On a side note , Ms. Lithwick , like most left - of - center publications , need to brush up on their firearms nomenclature ( of which I sometimes screw up ) right : .The 4th Circuit then argued that since handguns kill far more people than semi - automatic weapons , and that since Heller made handgun ownership constitutional , the less overall deadly semi - automatic assault weapons must not be dangerous and unusual either .Writing alone in dissent Judge Robert B. King is unequivocal : \" Let 's be real : The assault weapons banned by Maryland 's FSA are exceptionally lethal weapons of war .In fact , the most popular of the prohibited semiautomatic rifles , the AR-15 , functions almost identically to the military 's fully automatic M16 . \"He also notes that the Supreme Court specifically called out M16 rifles in Heller when defining \" dangerous and unusual .\" First , there are no weapons that are \" less deadly semiautomatic \" weapons , unless you 're referring to bolt - action rifles , commonly associated with hunting , or muzzle - loaders , of which no one has really used en masse since the 18 th and 19 th centuries .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.38687"}
