{"text": "A milestone for the Ebola outbreak .The end of Ebola transmission in Guinea marks an important milestone in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa .The original chain of transmission started two years ago in Gueckedou , Guinea in late December 2013 and drove the outbreak which spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone and , ultimately , by land and air travel to seven other countries .This is the first time that all three countries - Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone - have stopped the original chains of transmission that were responsible for starting this devastating outbreak two years ago , \" says Dr Matshidiso Moeti , WHO Regional Director for Africa .I commend the governments , communities and partners for their determination in confronting this epidemic to get to this milestone .As we work towards building resilient health care systems , we need to stay vigilant to ensure that we rapidly stop any new flares that may come up in 2016 .In addition to the original chain of transmission , there have been 10 new small Ebola outbreaks ( or ' flares ' ) between March and November 2015 .These appear to have been due to the re - emergence of a persistent virus from the survivor population .Among the challenges survivors have faced is that after recovering from Ebola virus disease and clearing the virus from their bloodstream , the virus may persist in the semen of some male survivors for as long as 9 - 12 months .December 28 , 2015 .Swedish doctors fear that ' super - gonorrhea ' , untreatable by conventional antibiotics , is on the rise after seeing the number of cases of the sexually transmitted disease more than double in six years .The situation in Sweden is worrying , \" Hans Fredlund , a doctor in charge of Communical Diseases and Prevention in the city of \u00d6rebro , told The Local .\" We need new antibiotics effective against gonorrhea within a few years or the situation may become worse .Gonorrhea , a bacterial infection , leads to a burning sensation and a thick green or yellow discharge from the urethra or vagina .Untreated , it can lead to inflammation of the joints and heart valves .In a small number of cases , it can even be fatal .Dr Fredlund said that Sweden had already recorded several cases of a new strain of ' super - gonorrhea ' , with bacteria resistant to azithromycin , one of the three most common antibiotics usually used to treat the sexually transmitted infection .The international antibiotic resistance situation is well known in Sweden and we have seen some azithromycin resistant strains , but also different other resistant strains , \" he said .Doctors should ... always take a bacterial culture to see which antibiotic will be best for treatment .For this reason it is important that all these patients should be treated and controlled by experienced venereologists , as we do .Fredlund 's comments come after Dame Sally Davies , England 's chief medical officer , wrote to all doctors this month , calling on them to make sure they were prescribing the right antibiotics , following the discovery of ' super - gonorrhoea ' in Leeds in northern England March .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "137.61877"}
{"text": "In Brazil , although we have identified the Zika virus , we do n't know much about it compared with dengue or yellow fever .The degree of ignorance is comparable to what we faced 32 years ago .This is a major health incident in the history of Brazil .We face a very serious problem for which scientific knowledge is far from sufficient .The scientific community has the responsibility to discover as much as possible as rapidly as possible .Zika virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 .It is thought to have arrived in Brazil in 2014 , possibly with visitors to the World Cup .There are now an estimated 1.5 million cases of Zika infection and the number is growing fast , though nobody knows how widespread the disease is because there are no symptoms in about 80 % of cases .In the rest , it can lead to fever , aching joints , muscle pains , sore eyes , itching skin and rashes and is now suspected as a cause of the spike in microcephaly cases in Brazil , although without scientific certainty .Cases of microcephaly have risen from fewer than 150 in 2014 to more than 4,000 in the past three months , but sceptics suggest this may simply reflect a previous under - reporting of abnormalities , which are also found in countries without Zika .The fear is real .The scare is real , \" said G\u00fabio Soares Campos , a virologist at the Biology Institute of the Federal University of Bahia who was one of two researchers who first identified Zika in Brazil last April .\" People have to really be careful right now because we do not yet know whether there will be other major consequences .Functioning well while frightened is Hemingway 's courage : \" grace under pressure .\" That 's the kind of stress that reveals true character ( or the lack thereof ) .HIV / AIDS taught us how little character we have when sex is involved , and a sexually transmissible disease inspires extra stigma - a deeply ingrained human tendency to blame the victim .Until last fall , Zika was just another goddam mosquito - borne disease that would make you ache for a week and then get better , and anyway it affected people living in hot countries fit only for winter getaways from richer , colder , and whiter countries .Dallas County Health and Human Services ( DCHHS ) has received confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) of the first Zika virus case acquired through sexual transmission in Dallas County in 2016 .The patient was infected with the virus after having sexual contact with an ill individual who returned from a country where Zika virus is present .For medical confidentiality and personal privacy reasons , DCHHS does not provide additional identifying information .Now that we know Zika virus can be transmitted through sex , this increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others , \" said Zachary Thompson , DCHHS director .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "138.4927"}
