{"text": "Deterring the Spread of Cell Phone Spying .The Department of Justice further recommends a legislative change to enable law enforcement to seize the profits of those who use cell phone spyware .The spread of computers and cellular phones in recent years has created a new market in malicious software that allows perpetrators to intercept victims ' communications without their knowledge or consent .This is illegal under current law , and current law also provides that law enforcement can forfeit the surreptitious interception devices themselves .It does not , however , enable forfeiture of the proceeds of the sale or use of those devices , or the forfeiture of any property used to facilitate their manufacture , advertising , or distribution .Further , the surreptitious interception of communications is currently not listed as a predicate offense in the money laundering statute , 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956 .Because perpetrators of these crimes often act from abroad , making it more difficult to prosecute them , it is particularly important that law enforcement be able to seize the money that the criminals make from engaging in this criminal surveillance , and seize the equipment they use .Selling Access to Botnets .We also recommend amending current law to address the proliferation of botnets , such as the Coreflood botnet I discussed earlier .Botnets can be used for various nefarious purposes , including theft of personal or financial information , the dissemination of spam , and cyberattacks , such as Distributed Denial of Service attacks .But creators and operators of botnets do not always commit those crimes themselves - frequently they sell , or even rent , access to the infected computers to others .The CFAA does not clearly cover such trafficking in botnets , even though trafficking in infected computers is clearly illegitimate , and can be essential to furthering other criminal activity .We thus propose that the CFAA be amended to cover trafficking in access to botnets .In addition , section 1030(a)(6 ) presently requires proof of intent to defraud .Such intent is often difficult to prove because the traffickers of unauthorized access to computers often have a wrongful purpose other than the commission of fraud , or do not know or care why their customers are seeking unauthorized access to other people 's computers .This has made it more challenging in many cases for prosecutors to identify a provable offense even when they can establish beyond a reasonable doubt that individuals are selling access to thousands of infected computers .We therefore recommend that Congress consider amending the CFAA to address this shortcoming .Conclusion .I very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss with you the ways in which the Department protects American citizens and businesses by aggressively investigating and prosecuting hackers - both outsiders and insiders .We understand how devastating it is to victims of cybercrime who have their personal and financial information siphoned away , whether by hackers on the other side of the world or by insiders at a company that might hold their personal information .The Justice Department is committed to using the full range of investigative tools and laws available to us to fight these crimes and protect Americans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.949028"}
