{"text": "Last week marked the second year anniversary of the popular uprising in Syria .On its current trajectory , Syria is headed toward geographical fragmentation .As the security situation deteriorates and Washington persists in its refusal to lead , neighboring states will begin to carve out effective buffer zones inside the country .Once that process is complete , Syria will become a unitary state in name only .Two years in , we 're beginning to see this take place .Having realized that the US has no desire to intervene , Washington 's regional allies have had to adjust their posture .On the one hand , these states do n't have the capability to shape the outcome in Syria on their own .On the other hand , they understand that , with the US sitting this one out , they will have to grapple on their own with a protracted Syrian mess .Meanwhile , the Assad regime 's allies have been more aggressive , and have already established a presence on Syrian soil , as we see Hezbollah has done along the border with Lebanon .In historical terms , this state of affairs is not new or unnatural for Syria .In fact , throughout history , Syria was a collection of buffer and/or satellite states .As far back as the Bronze Age , Syria was the land between regional power centers , namely Egypt and Asia Minor , as well as the powers further east in Mesopotamia and Persia .These powers carved spheres of influence in Syria , governed by local rulers who maneuvered and struck alliances within the confines of this geopolitical balance .This practice recurred persistently through the centuries .It was replicated , for instance , in the standoff between the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt and the Byzantine Empire in Asia Minor .Eleventh - century Aleppo under the Hamdanid dynasty , for example , was one such buffer state .Likewise , in the Crusader period , the County of Edessa west of the Euphrates functioned as a buffer state to protect Antioch against incursions from the east .And so on .As Brookings scholar Michael Doran reminded us last year , this basic configuration continued into the modern period .For example , the early 1920s rebellion led by Ibrahim Hananu in northern Syria against the French was , in fact , sponsored by the Turks .The current situation differs slightly .Aside from Hezbollah in Lebanon , Syria 's neighbors are mainly concerned with protecting themselves from the Syrian chaos , and are perhaps looking to project limited influence within confined zones near their border .In addition , other than Iran and Hezbollah , none of these neighboring states actually wants to deploy militarily in Syria .Rather , they wish to safeguard against unwanted repercussions and threats from the Syrian war .Turkey hoped the US would intervene in Syria , only to learn the hard way that it would have to fend for itself .Among other things , Ankara has had to contend with the Assad regime shelling Turkish border towns , and has witnessed multiple operations on its soil by regime intelligence operatives , ranging from kidnappings to bombings .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.05844"}

{"text": "The restrictions on Jewish immigration became particularly deadly when Jews fleeing Auschwitz and other concentration camps were turned away at the gates of Palestine to be killed back in Europe ( after infamous the Evian Conference , no country agreed to take Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust ) .In many ways , the next years of history reflect what both communities perceived as a joint betrayal .The Jews saw the British repudiate their 1917 promise and responded with a concerted program of illegal immigration , continued political activity and an eventual turn to violence .Jewish groups such as Irgun and Lehi began to target British forces , and to the extent they attacked civilians , to terrorism .While Hajj Amin al - Husseini fled Palestine after the end of the riots , he continued to incite and direct activities there .He returned to the Middle East in the late 1940s and began to make preparations for the end of the British Mandate , the formation of an Arab state west of the Jordan river , and the slaughter of all Jews in Palestine .For the next few years , Jewish and Arab forces consolidated until May 14 , 1948 , when David Ben - Gurion declared an independent state of Israel and the 1948 war began .Two very interesting patterns emerge here .The first is that the Arab Riots of 1936 - 1939 began a continuing pattern wherein Western powers have rewarded Arabs for their violent behavior by caving in to their needs .Indeed , it was the British appeasement policy that emboldened al - Husseini and other leaders to continue their violence , knowing that it was the best way to extract concessions from the British .Since then , Arab nationalists in the Middle East have discovered that rioting , war and terrorism are the most effective way to get concessions from European powers , especially when couching such acts in the guise of anti - colonialism .The best contemporary example is , of course , the Arab desire to return to the 1947 Partition Plan .The Arabs unanimously rejected Partition in 1947 , launching a campaign to destroy Israel and liquidate the Jews .They missed their chance for an Arab Palestinian state , and continued to wage a 60 year campaign of violence .Those 60 years of violence toward Israel have actually improved the Arabs ' negotiating position , now many states support their desire for a state and argue that Israel must remove Jews from Arab lands as a precondition to peace .Israel has been pressured to give away land to the Arabs despite the fact that the Palestinians refuse to even acknowledge the Jewish right to self determination .The second interesting feature is that we assume that the Jewish state was ripped from an Arab state or Arab homeland .As previously noted , there was no Arab sovereignty over Palestine for 400 years .To the extent that there was an Arab majority in British Mandatory Palestine , 70 % of the Mandate was used to create a state that ended up having 100 % Arabs and 0 % Jews : Transjordan .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "64.0951"}

{"text": "It is certainly hard to tell what reasons the Young Turks or Sultan Abdulhamid had in essentially ignoring the wave of Aliyah into Palestine , especially when those Aliyot were so key to the accomplishment of the Zionist dream .It was in those years that Hebrew was reborn , that Jewish political parties started to develop and that Jewish defense groups began to form .Perhaps it was the eternally testy relationship between the Arabs and the Turks that kept the Turkish government from taking serious measures against the Aliyot .Whatever it was , the influx of Jews into Palestine before 1917 can not be blamed on Western Imperialists seeking to undermine Islamic rule .There are several aspects of the history of the Palestinian people that are unique .Another interesting aspect of Palestinian nationalism that is unique is that it is the only current nationalist movement whose primary goal is to destroy another nation and prevent another people from having any self determination .Before going further , I must admit that do not believe that the goal of Palestinian nationalism is a state in the West Bank and Gaza .All historical indications point to the Palestinian goal of national liberation \" from the river to the sea . \"Hamas makes this pronouncement quite clear , and the history of Fatah / PLO is full of their internal pronouncements of dissatisfaction with a Palestinian state in anything but all the land west of the Jordan river .Indeed , the PLO 's spiritual leader , Yasser Arafat , was a protege of Hajj Amin al - Husseini , the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , who starting in the 1920s spearheaded anti - Jewish attacks in Mandatory Palestine and began the path of \" no negotiations , no peace .\" I do not believe that Fatah has moved away from this position despite their lip service pronouncements otherwise .Their unwillingness to waiver on the right of return issue is strong evidence of Fatah 's intentions for the Jewish state of Israel .So let us look at the elements of Palestinian nationalism .The achievement of Palestinian nationalistic aims requires the destruction of another state .This situation can be viewed in comparison to most other nationalist movements of the last 50 years .While many national liberation movements involved liberation from European colonialism , there are a few examples of national liberation struggles that provide better analogies to the Palestinian struggle .The best example , in my opinion , is the 30 year nationalist conflict between Sinhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka .Sri Lanka 's national liberation struggle was driven by its Sinhalese population , and the subsequent independent state empowered the Sinhalese at the expense of the Tamil minority .The Tamil insurgency , even at its most violent and anti - Sinhalese , never professed its intention to destroy Sinhalese nationalism completely , the vision for Tamil Eelam foresaw a contiguous Tamil state coming into existence in northern and eastern Sri Lanka .The idea of the Tamil insurgency was not the same kind of \" Phased Plan \" that the PLO adopted in 1974 because all indications were that the LTTE was satisfied to control Tamil majority - territory and leave the Sinhalese their state .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.05612"}
{"text": "In regard to the Geneva Convention and UN Resolution 242 , we have seen that the settlements do not constitute violations of international law .Therefore , this argument is a red herring .The Camp David accords called for a 3-month moratorium on settlements .Prime Minister Menahem Begin kept this agreement .The Oslo Accords say nothing about settlements .It was tacitly and informally agreed upon that a moratorium on settlements would be one of 16 \" confidence building \" measures that Israel and the PNA would undertake .The provision about not changing the \" status \" of the territories refers to the agreement that neither side would unilaterally annex the areas ( or declare them an independent state ) .In the presence of glaring , overt , and provocative violations of every one of the Oslo Accords by the Palestine National Authority almost immediately after its signing , Prime Minister Netanyahu 's government felt itself under no obligation to maintain the tacit informal agreement .Since the Palestine National Authority was not building confidence by ending terrorist attacks ( it was actually behind them ) , why should Israel compromise its security and position for future negotiation ?While Israel has built a total of 144 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza , more than 260 new Palestinian settlements have been constructed .These serve as testimony to the flourishing of the West Bank 's economy and the growth of Palestinian population under Israeli control ( 1967 - 1994 ) , contrary to the Arab allegations that Israel has perpetrated genocide and crippled the economy of the West Bank .By what logic would anyone suggest that these Palestinian settlements are any less a threat to negotiations or a change of status of the territories than are the Israeli ones ?Summing up : All the settlements except those of the rogue variety BIG LIES / 52 . are legal .Their growth and expansion have contributed substantially to the economic improvement of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .When there were no settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , no territorial compromises or peace settlements were reached .Later territorial compromises and peace agreements have been reached despite the existence of settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip .Israel 's settlements violate no international accords .Therefore , it is irrational to suggest that Israeli settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip prevent peace .Rather , it is the unwillingness of the Palestine National Authority to control the Arab terror groups , to stop the incitement and to negotiate honestly , that makes compromise impossible .What About Unilateral Withdrawl ?Part of the intent in creating \" uvdot bashetakh \" ( facts in the field ) was to create \" bargaining chips \" for future negotiations .They are one of the issues that Israel will negotiate .That is clearly what Netanyahu and Barak had in mind when they encouraged settlement expansion following Arafat 's violations of the Oslo Accords .There is no rational justification for a one - sided curtailment of population growth when the other side maintains a state of war despite the agreement to curtail violence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "70.06095"}

{"text": "Israel began to invoke this right with vehemence in the last decade after the Palestine Liberation Organisation had satisfied its earlier demand in the 1970s and 80s that the Palestinians recognise its \" right to exist \" .In international law , countries are recognised as existing de facto and de jure , but there is no notion that any country has a \" right to exist \" , let alone that other countries should recognise such a right .This is a crucial matter , as all these rights that Israel claims to possess , but which are not recognised internationally , translate into its rights to colonise Palestinian land , to occupy it , and to discriminate against the non - Jewish Palestinian people .Israel insists that these rights are not negotiable and that what it is negotiating about is something entirely different , namely that its enemies must accept all its claimed rights unequivocally as a basis to establish peace in the region and end the state of war .However , the rights that Israel claims for itself are central to what the Palestinians and the international community argue is under negotiation - namely , colonisation , occupation , and racial and religious discrimination .But these three practises , as Israel has made amply clear , are protected as self - arrogated rights and are not up for negotiations .Indeed they are central to the realisation of Israel 's very definition .To negotiate over them would mean to nullify the notion of a \" Jewish State \" .As this is the case , then what does Israel think the negotiations between it and the Palestinians have been all about since the Madrid peace conference inaugurated them in 1991 ?Let me revisit the history of these claims in order to understand Israel 's point of view and make clear what the basis of the negotiations are .Israel 's rights and the historical record .The Zionist movement has often argued that establishing a Jewish State for world Jewry was a moral and historical necessity that must be protected and enshrined in law , something it tirelessly pursued over the decades .However , this did not mean that its foundational texts proceeded from this juridical or moral principle .Herzl did speak of a \" solution \" to the Jewish Question but not of a \" right \" .And neither did the first Zionist Congress Herzl convened in 1897 and the Basel Program it issued , which did not cite such a \" right \" .This also applies to the three international foundational texts that Zionism worked hard to bring about .This was followed by the Mandate for Palestine , issued in 1922 by the Council of the League of Nations , which based itself on the Balfour Declaration , and also did not recognise any Jewish rights to a state or even to Palestine .Israel 's claims .As the documentary record shows , however , neither Herzl nor the Zionist Congress proclaimed such a right at all .Yet the \" Declaration of Independence \" proceeds to tell us that : .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.35583"}
{"text": "Therefore , claims that the so - called Israeli \" occupation \" is illegal - without regard either to its cause or the factors that have led to its continuation - are baseless allegations without foundation in international law .Palestinian efforts to present Israel 's presence in the territory as the primary cause of the conflict ignore history .Palestinian terrorism predates Israel 's control of the territories ( and even the existence of the State of Israel itself ) .The Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) was founded in 1964 , three years before Israel 's presence in the territories began .Consequently , the West Bank can best be regarded as disputed territory over which there are competing claims that should be resolved in peace talks .The final status of this disputed territory should be determined through negotiations between the parties .Attempts to force a solution through terrorism are ethically indefensible and only serve to encourage further violence and terrorism .Israel hopes that peace negotiations with its Palestinian neighbors will be restarted , and a permanent agreement reached which addresses the aspirations of both parties in an equitable and peaceful manner .There are no provisions in any of the agreements signed between Israel and the Palestinians that require a withdrawal to the 1967 boundaries .There are no geographic imperatives that sanctify the 1967 lines .There certainly is no logic to enshrining an inadvertent boundary that existed for less than 19 years .The 4 June 1967 lines of the West Bank were not based on historical fact , natural geographic formations , demographic considerations or international agreement .The pre-1967 boundaries were based instead on the armistice lines demarcated on the basis of the position of armies in the field after the 1948 War of Independence .Accordingly , the 1949 Armistice Agreement explicitly refrained from defining them as final political borders .These lines merely reflected the relative positions of the Jordanian / Iraqi and Israeli military forces at the end of the War .Several months after the 1967 Six Day War , the international community adopted UN Security Council Resolution 242 , the seminal UN decision on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .The resolution acknowledged the problematic nature of the 1967 lines - which had left Israel with a \" narrow waist \" of 9 miles - and recognized Israel 's need for \" secure and recognized boundaries \" .Subsequent peace negotiations have addressed solutions that include compromises on the borders between Israel and a potential Palestinian state .Even the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin , winner of the Nobel Peace Prize , stated in his last address to the Knesset before his assassination in 1995 , that Israel \" will not return to the 4 June 1967 lines .\" This position reflects both the changes that have occurred on the ground over the past four decades , as well as the problematic nature of the original lines .Major Israeli population centers now existing in the West Bank , mostly concentrated in settlement blocs , are located close to the 1967 lines .The forced deportation of their residents , rather than the rationalization of the border , would not be countenanced by the Israeli population , and would create an insurmountable challenge to any Israeli government .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.379"}
{"text": "Faced with this conundrum , there is a real question as to why Abbas and the PA are pushing for the UN statehood vote now .Beyond the internecine struggles between Hamas and Fatah , there are serious questions about the future Palestinian state 's ability to absorb Palestinians from neighboring countries , create and functionally operate a government and be economically viable .For example , let 's say the General Assembly votes in favor of a Palestinian state but the Security Council vetoes it .What will that mean ?Any true attempt at statehood will depend on Abbas ' willingness to change facts on the ground in the West Bank .To the extent that Abbas believes that he and Fatah are in danger from Hamas , any declaration of independence will change things no more than the 1988 Declaration or the Oslo Accords did .And if Abbas does try to change facts on the ground , then he is taking the same risk he took when he agreed to the Bush Administration 's brilliant idea to have elections in Gaza .Perhaps the move for independence is Abbas last ditch effort to regain some credibility for Fatah and try to reestablish it as the true leader of the Palestinian nationalist movement .Indeed , one must wonder if all of this is a huge bluff by Fatah to try to scare the Israeli government into negotiating concessions .Indeed , Abbas had previously attempted to offer to cancel the UN bid in exchange for an Israeli settlement freeze .At this point , Abbas is all bluster and little substance and quite frankly , Hamas has little to gain and a lot more to lose by hitching its wagon to him .Abbas is grasping at straws is and I would be shocked if he was really willing to carry out any meaningful change in the West Bank to bring Palestine closer to statehood .To say that Jordan 's relationship with the Palestinians is complex is a gross understatement .When the 1949 Armistice Agreements went into effect , Jordan occupied the largest swathe of territory that had been promised to Palestine in the 1947 Partition : the West Bank .By then , Jordan was already ruled by the Hashemites .For 19 years , Jordan controlled the West Bank and annexed the territory ( an annexation recognized by only two countries : Great Britain and the United States ) .Since then , Jordan has been very ambivalent about integrating Palestinians into its society .Jordan 's Hashemite government has been consistently worried about what will happen if the demographic balance tips too far in the Palestinians ' favor and increases the likelihood of a coup .Over the past five years , Jordan has occasionally revoked citizenship to thousands of Palestinians , especially those that have recently migrated from the West Bank .Jordan , like Lebanon , has a very fragile demographic balance between its Palestinians , Bedouins and Hashemites .The government fears that any significant upset to this balance will likely create a civil war like Lebanon 's .Indeed , this was part of the reason why Jordan renounced its claims to the West Bank in 1988 to avoid being saddled with an influx of Palestinian refugees if it was ever forced to exercise sovereignty over the West Bank .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.419174"}

Lindsay , a former UNRWA general counsel , under UNRWA 's definition , that 5 million figure represents only half of those potentially eligible for Palestine refugee status .In other words , rather than diminish 5-fold over six decades , UNRWA has the population of refugees increase almost 7-fold .That number could grow faster yet due to the growing sentiment that female refugees should also pass on their refugee status .Even when , in about 40 years , the last actual refugee from mandatory Palestine dies , pseudo - refugees will continue to proliferate .Thus is the \" Palestine refugee \" status set to swell indefinitely .Put differently , as Steven J. Rosen of the Middle East Forum notes , \" given UNRWA 's standards , eventually all humans will be Palestine refugees .Were the Palestine refugee status a healthy one , this infinite expansion would hardly matter .A giant key ( said to be the world 's largest ) sits atop the entrance to the Aida Refugee Camp in Bethlehem , reminding residents to insist on their \" right of return .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.7038"}

{"text": "I want to encourage readers to comment and discuss my thoughts .In continuation of my pre - Israeli Jewish history in Palestine , it is important to start again by indicating that Arabs had not exercised political control over Palestine since the Mamluk defeat in 1517 .Indeed , while Arabs continued to live in Palestine after Selim 's conquest , there were no serious disruptions to Ottoman control of Arab lands until the Wahhabis who formed a breakaway state from 1744 to 1818 .Palestine , however , remained firmly within Ottoman control for 400 years , from 1517 to 1917 .In 1917 , led by General Allenby , the British took Jerusalem and established control over Palestine .With the Ottoman Empire in collapse and the Young Turk government in limbo , Turkey would not achieve political stability until Mustafa Kemal Ataturk 's consolidation of power in 1923 .The British received a Mandate over Palestine from the League of Nations at the San Remo Conference , which incorporated the stated goals of the 1917 Balfour Declaration : the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine .Of course , the British had made other promises .In exchange for their instigation of the Arab Revolt , which proved crucial to defeating the Ottomans , the family of Sharif Hussein bin Ali , were given substantial control over the lands newly freed from Ottoman hands .the Sharif 's son Abdullah was given the Eastern part of the British Mandate of Palestine , Transjordan , while the Sharif 's other son Faisal became the King of Iraq .Hussein himself became the King of Hejaz and claimed sovereignty over all Arabia , but was eventually overthrown by his opponents : the House of Saud .There are important implications to this history .The Zionists were not marching into lands that were under the political dominion or control of the Arabs .Indeed , there had not been Arab control over Palestine in 400 years .In the decades since Israel 's founding , Palestinian Arabs have lamented the role the British played in controlling Jewish immigration into Palestine and their supposed siding with the Jews and helping them found their state .In reality , the British , after their initial support for Jewish sovereignty west of the Jordan river , quickly reneged on their promises and took many actions to aid the Arabs at the expense of the Jews .The formative moment was the appointment of Hajj Amin al - Husseini as Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and de facto leader of the Arabs west of the Jordan River .Ironically , this appointment was made by Governor of Palestine Herbert Samuel , a British Jew .Husseini was vehemently anti - Zionist , anti - Semitic and anti - British .He saw himself as the leader of the Arab state , as the new Caliph .Soon after his appointment by the British , Husseini changed sides and flew to Berlin to meet German leader Adolf Hitler .He would form strong relationships with several famous Nazis : Adolf Eichmann , Joseph Goebbels , Henrich Himmler and Joachim von Ribbentrop .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "80.62651"}

The Palestinians do n't present militarily a threat to the existence of Israel .There are certain risks to the personal security of a limited number of Israelis .Q. What if the personal - security risks to Israelis increase ? A. If terror will continue , it means the Palestinians can not keep their commitments , so what is the meaning of the agreement ? Q. In that case the accord would be rolled back ? A. I did n't say so .You said it .Q. How will your government respond if the right wing in Israel rebels against the accord ? A. I do n't believe that there will be rebellion .Israel is a democracy .There might be expressions of opposition , but I believe that whatever the government and Knesset approve will be carried out .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "81.242966"}

{"text": "After all , while Palestine was not of great importance , it was an old territory , conquered in 1517 by Selim I and was not one of the later conquered European territories .Of course , while the Turks had disdain for the Jews , they also had a questionable relationship with the Arabs .Many Arab leaders in Hejaz , Egypt and other territories were not too keen on Turks maintaining the Caliphate .It seems unlikely that the Ottoman and Young Turk authorities would be so thrilled to respond to Arab complaints about encroaching Jewish settlers who were , for example , driving up real estate prices in Jaffa by buying up substantial land with support from the Rothschilds and other donors .It is certainly hard to tell what reasons the Young Turks or Sultan Abdulhamid had in essentially ignoring the wave of Aliyah into Palestine , especially when those Aliyot were so key to the accomplishment of the Zionist dream .It was in those years that Hebrew was reborn , that Jewish political parties started to develop and that Jewish defense groups began to form .Perhaps it was the eternally testy relationship between the Arabs and the Turks that kept the Turkish government from taking serious measures against the Aliyot .Whatever it was , the influx of Jews into Palestine before 1917 can not be blamed on Western Imperialists seeking to undermine Islamic rule .There are several aspects of the history of the Palestinian people that are unique .Another interesting aspect of Palestinian nationalism that is unique is that it is the only current nationalist movement whose primary goal is to destroy another nation and prevent another people from having any self determination .Before going further , I must admit that do not believe that the goal of Palestinian nationalism is a state in the West Bank and Gaza .All historical indications point to the Palestinian goal of national liberation \" from the river to the sea . \"Hamas makes this pronouncement quite clear , and the history of Fatah / PLO is full of their internal pronouncements of dissatisfaction with a Palestinian state in anything but all the land west of the Jordan river .Indeed , the PLO 's spiritual leader , Yasser Arafat , was a protege of Hajj Amin al - Husseini , the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , who starting in the 1920s spearheaded anti - Jewish attacks in Mandatory Palestine and began the path of \" no negotiations , no peace .\" I do not believe that Fatah has moved away from this position despite their lip service pronouncements otherwise .Their unwillingness to waiver on the right of return issue is strong evidence of Fatah 's intentions for the Jewish state of Israel .So let us look at the elements of Palestinian nationalism .The achievement of Palestinian nationalistic aims requires the destruction of another state .This situation can be viewed in comparison to most other nationalist movements of the last 50 years .While many national liberation movements involved liberation from European colonialism , there are a few examples of national liberation struggles that provide better analogies to the Palestinian struggle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "86.90701"}
