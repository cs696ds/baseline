{"text": "Rudy Giuliani , John McCain , Arnold Schwarzenegger : The new faces of the GOP ?( Dan Balz ) .By Dan Balz LOS ANGELES --The leaders of a new Republican Party gathered on the factory floor at a solar energy facility in Los Angeles Thursday morning : John McCain , Rudy Giuliani and Arnold Schwarzenegger .It was a tableau that makes the old Republican Party shudder .The three Republicans used the factory as a backdrop for Schwarzenegger to lend his support to McCain 's presidential campaign .After his victory in Florida on Tuesday and Giuliani 's endorsement on Wednesday and more endorsements to come , McCain is now rolling toward wrapping up the Republican nomination as early as next Tuesday .If he does so , it will cap his remarkable comeback , one of the more astonishing resurrections in the modern history of presidential nomination battles .McCain 's determination and durability have carried him through multiple setbacks that produced enough predictions of his imminent demise to leave egg on the faces of nearly every political strategist and commentator around .It took only seconds for the question to arise at McCain 's joint press conference with Schwarzenegger and Giuliani .Is there a downside to this image , he was asked ?\" You will see a flood of endorsements across the country ... both liberal and conservative , \" McCain responded .\" I am prepared and succeeding in uniting [ the Republican Party].We need all parts of our party together if we 're going to win in November .I believe our party is beginning to realize that . \" The Arizona senator 's upbeat appraisal of the state of his party reflects the aspirations of someone who has spent the better part of the last four years attempting to move from maverick to establishment Republican .Now in the final stages of locking down the nomination , he believes the consolidation he long has sought is beginning to happen .Others have a different view . \"Arnold coming in really brings the conservative coalition together , \" GOP strategist Greg Mueller said with a laugh during a phone interview just before the McCain - Schwarzenegger event .\" My view is that there obviously continues to be a rocky relationship between Senator McCain and conservatives . \"Democratic pollster Mark Mellman sees a major rift brewing within the dispirited Republican Party , which he said is far different from what Democrats are likely to face even after the intense and sometimes nasty personal battle between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama . \"John McCain is winning without the base of the Republican Party , \" he said .\" Without evangelicals .Without conservatives .He 's going to have a much more fractured , much more divided party than are we . \"The Democratic race , he argued , is far different .\" It 's personal , \" he said .\" Both are trying to win .Elbows get thrown .But on the Republican side it 's fundamental and ideological . \"The Florida results help to underscore the divisions within the GOP as McCain , Mitt Romney , Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul continue campaigning for votes in the 21 states with GOP contests next Tuesday .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "108.52431"}
