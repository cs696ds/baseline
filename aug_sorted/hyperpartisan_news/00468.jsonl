{"text": "The market for used suppressors in the U.S. is consequently very poor , which has driven innovations in the field ( buyers want the height of technology , because they are basically \" stuck \" with the purchase ) .Primitive suppressors are available in other countries for under US$ 40 , [ 15 ] but they are usually of crude construction , using cheap materials and baffle designs that were obsolete in the United States by the 1970s .While suppressors in the US are more expensive ( hundreds to thousands of dollars ) , they are generally built with highly advanced baffle stacks and exotic materials like Inconel and high - grade heat - treated stainless steels .Several states and municipalities explicitly ban any civilian possession of suppressors .The Federal legal requirements to manufacture a suppressor in the United States are enumerated in Title 26 , Chapter 53 of the United States Code .[16 ] The individual states and several municipalities also have their specific requirements .The question is : Why have silencers been demonized and banned and ultra - severe penalties been set ?There does n't appear to be a lot of information available on the history of silencer / suppressor laws , but I did find this excellent paper titled Criminal Use of Firearm Silencers written in 2007 by Paul A. Clark .The abstract sums up the situation neatly .Both the public and sentencing judges regard silenced firearms as more dangerous than ordinary unsilenced firearms , and the federal penalty for possession of a silenced firearm during crime is a 30-year mandatory minimum .The assumption that silenced firearms are more dangerous than ordinary firearms has never been empirically researched .This study examines federal and state court data to compile statistics on who is being prosecuted for possession of silencers and what crimes they are used to commit .This data indicates that both on the federal and state level those prosecuted for crimes involving silencers are far less likely to have a criminal record , and are far less likely to actively use their weapon than those people convicted using ordinary unsilenced firearms .The data indicates that use of silenced firearms in crime is a rare occurrence , and is a minor problem .Moreover , the legislative history of silencer statutes indicates that these provisions were adopted with little or no debate .The silencer penalty has been justified by a need to crack down on \" professional criminals \" or to punish people using \" dangerous weapons .\" The evidence suggests that 30-year minimum sentences make no sense .Mandatory minimums should be repealed and sentencing judges permitted to treat each case on an individualized basis .I was thinking recently about how pointless many laws are .Too often legislation is written and passed in an attempt to solve ( or appear to be attempting to solve ) some real or perceived problem , but without any intelligent consideration as to whether there is any logical or practical value to the legislation .Silencer laws seem to fit neatly into that category .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "34.78968"}

{"text": "Wow , I ca n't believe it took me this long to take notice of this thread .Actually , the BATFE has ruled on this very subject .It is NOT legal to make a silencer for an airgun because it is POSSIBLE for that silencer to be used on a traditional firearm .I believe , IIRC , the case in question was about silencers for paintball guns .Someone asked BATFE about their legality and they got the answer that they had to be registered as NFA because they acted like a traditional silencer and it was possible to affix them to a traditional firearm .Remember , if it quiets the noise down even 1db , it must be registered with NFA .I 'll dig around and see if I can find that ruling ... .OK , so I found it .The ruling is that if the silencer is an integrally , permanently attached part of the air gun ( or paintball gun in this case ) then it is not a \" silencer \" as defined as part of the NFA .If all or part of the silencer is detachable , then it falls under the NFA and must be registered accordingly .So because my idea has a portion that 's removable , even though not readily adaptable to a firearm , still qualifies as a silencer ?The good news is , if I had a silencer welded to my pellet gun then it 's legal !There are legal catch-22s for the federal government and gun owners here though .The first problem for gun owners being - how do you get to the point where you weld a DIY silencer on to your gun ?You have to build it first .This puts you legally in a \" make firearm \" activity requiring an ATF FORM 1 to be filed and approved plus a $ 200.00 \" Make \" tax .Even if you ignore this , then once it 's built you are in possession of a firearm requiring a permit with all of the federal and state regulations that apply - basically everything you need to get a handgun .All of this falls under the Brady Gun Control Law meaning that even though this effort is being spent on a pellet gun which has no juristiction under the law - you are completely bound by it .So you can have a silencer on your pellet gun , you just have no easy way to get it on the gun .We also find the government in the other catch-22 , legally speaking .A \" prohibited person \" ( 18 usc , sec 922 ) ends up being denied the ability to do something that is perfectly legal ( that is ... have a perminently afixed suppressor on an airgun ) .This is because they can not engage the \" make \" or permit process under current gun control laws .They end up as an entire class of people being denied due process ; a very serious violation of the constitution .The community could push for reform but many fear the resulting spotlight would be a call to arms ( ironic pun ) for gun control advocates to push for tighter regulations of airguns .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.138153"}

Matt Salmon ( AZ-05 ) .This historic piece of legislation will remove suppressors from the purview of the National Firearms Act ( NFA ) , replacing the antiquated federal transfer process with an instantaneous NICS background check .The HPA also includes a provision to refund the $ 200 transfer tax to applicants who purchase a suppressor after October 22 , 2015 .\" The American Suppressor Association believes that citizens should not have to pay a tax to protect their hearing while exercising their Second Amendment rights , \" said Knox Williams , President and Executive Director of the ASA .\" The removal of suppressors from the National Firearms Act has been our ultimate goal since day one .For months , we have worked alongside Rep. Salmon 's office and the National Rifle Association to craft this legislation .Although we recognize that introducing this bill is the first step in what will be a lengthy process to change federal law , we look forward to working with Rep. Salmon and the NRA to advance and ultimately enact this common - sense legislation . \"Also known as silencers , suppressors are the hearing protection of the 21st century sportsman .Despite common Hollywood - based misconceptions , the laws of physics dictate that no suppressor will ever be able to render gunfire silent .Suppressors are simply mufflers for firearms , which function by trapping the expanding gasses at the muzzle , allowing them to slowly cool in a controlled environment .On average , suppressors reduce the noise of a gunshot by 20 - 35 decibels ( dB ) , roughly the same sound reduction as earplugs or earmuffs .In addition to hearing protection , suppressors also mitigate noise complaints from those who live near shooting ranges and hunting lands .Unfortunately , suppressors have been federally regulated since the passage of the National Firearms Act of 1934 .The NFA regulates the transfer and possession of certain types of firearms and devices , including suppressors .In stark contrast , many countries in Europe place no regulations on their purchase , possession , or use .Rep. Salmon 's Hearing Protection Act will fix the flawed federal treatment of suppressors , making it easier for hunters and sportsmen to protect their hearing in the 41 states where private suppressor ownership is currently legal , and the 37 states where hunting with a suppressor is legal .This legislation will remove suppressors from the onerous requirements of the NFA , and instead require purchasers to pass an instant NICS check , the same background check that is used during the sale of long guns .In doing so , law - abiding citizens will remain free to purchase suppressors , while prohibited persons will continue to be barred from purchasing or possessing these accessories .If only there was a law against murder , all of these killings would stop .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "58.37132"}

{"text": "Rather than simply copy existing designs , SIG Sauer put the R&D branch to work and came up with a sealed , efficient , tough design that used durable materials without the need for exotic alloys .The company set out to design a rifle - caliber silencer that would outlast the service life of the barrel .Time will tell , but since SIG Sauer 's idea of preproduction testing when it rolls out a firearm is to expend 1 million rounds , I 'm pretty confident that will be achieved .Also , the lack of a quick - mount system is part of the longevity of the silencer .If the silencer is going to last as long as the barrel , or longer , why would you take it off ?Simple .You 'd take it off if it did n't outlast the barrel .Now , I differ here .While I have an entire rack full of rifles that can accept a silencer , I ca n't see fitting a silencer to each and every one of them .No problem , as the SIG Sauer silencers do not need to be torqued on to extreme levels .The figure that was mentioned when I asked was 25 foot - pounds .Heck , on a good day I can do that with my bare hands .And last , I noticed that the 9 mm silencer lacked a linear - inertial mount called a Nielson device .On handguns , where the barrel has to move to unlock , the extra weight and length of a silencer can cause the pistol to malfunction .The Neilsen device lets pistols cycle with heavy silencers attached .The 9 mm silencer is so light ( 3.7 ounces ) that it does n't need one .A new and tight pistol with a new , full - power recoil spring might balk occasionally in the beginning .But just shoot it in ( no need to do this with the silencer on ) for a couple hundred rounds and by then it will function fine .The silencers - and firearms - will be made at the brand - new SIG Sauer facility .The company has spent $ 40 million building and equipping a 206,000-square - foot building , making it the only firearms maker to be directly designing and producing silencers , and doing so in mass production as well .As I mentioned earlier , 39 states allow silencer ownership .And the ones that do n't are , for the most part , all the usual suspects when it comes to legislative buffoonery vis - \u00e0 - vis firearms .If you take a silencer to your gun club , inevitably someone will make a few jokes at your expense about shipping out to Iraq or trying out for a job as a movie hitman .Just smile and keep practicing , knowing you 're saving your hearing as well as dampening the noise the neighbors are subjected to .The Cost Factor One of the main drawbacks to silencers has been the fact that they 're expensive .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "68.06104"}

{"text": "To discount a fine product like an Ops Inc 16th Model because it is \" older technology \" or slightly heavier weight is a mistake .The Ops 16th Should really be compared more with the SPR / M4 than the M42 K anyway as they are the more similar in design .Here is some info for the truly curious among us ... .Ops Inc 16th Model Weight : 20.1 oz Mount ( collar , brake and washer ) weight : 4.0 oz Total combined weight : 24.1 oz Length : 8 - 3/8 \" Length added to host : 4.5 \" .AAC SPR / M4 Weight : 19.2 oz Mount ( MITER Blackout ) weight : 4.4 oz Total combined weight : 23.6 oz Length : 8 - 9/16 \" Length added to host : 4.5 \" .AAC M4 - 2000 Weight : 16.9 oz Mount ( Blackout ) weight : 4.3 oz Total combined weight : 21.2 oz Length : 6 - 11/16 \" Length added to host : 4.5 \" .The SPR / M4 and M4 - 2000 use Inconel cores .The Ops product is all SS .I have shot my personal 16th Model on a select - fire M4 for years and the muzzle brake has taken a lot of abuse .There is some erosion noticeable in the suppressor but not much at all .Too many people use dB numbers as a way of measuring sound performance of a suppressor .Unfortunately , the meter does n't tell us things like tone , sound duration , frequency , etc .I have two whistles here - one a dog whistle and the other is the one I carry hiking .If I take the wrong whistle hiking and need to get a humans attention for some help , it should would suck to find that dog whistle in my pack .Get the point about frequency ?Try to hear different products for yourself and form your own opinions .Also , understand we all have some hearing loss so what we \" hear \" with a suppressor might sound a little different to each of us .So , I VERY much disagree with statements like \" All 5.56 cans provide similar sound reduction \" .That is certainly not my experience .I also disagree that a suppressor has to have Inconel to be durable .That has not been my experience .I do agree Inconel is a better material for erosion but the material used in a product is n't the only component to durability .I typed all this out between phone calls so sorry if it rambles a bit or if I missed something .I hope the information helps .Oh , and for the record I personally own a 16th Model and M4 - 2000 on Form 4s .Well it might not hurt for Ops to put the 16th model on the website .We have a similar and soon to be rectified problem of 3 5.56 cans not on the site .The specs were surprising .The combined total system weight should be the only interesting statistic .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "95.7938"}
{"text": "Thomas Jefferson .Some redneck fools have been critical of gun control .They have claimed that disarming a population will leave them vulnerable to naturally opportunistic criminals .Why nothing could be further from the truth !Criminals would have to yield to gun - free zones as they did at Columbine , NIU , Virginia Tech , Lane Bryant , and the Westroads Mall .Others have pointed out that important American politicians such as George Washington , Patrick Henry , Thomas Jefferson , Abraham Lincoln , and Charlton Heston have all been supporters of an armed citizenry .However , these people are dead so their opinions do not matter .[ Citation not needed at all ; thank you very much ] .A few whining women have complained that gun control is sexist .This is a simple minded fallacy spouted by red leader Sarah Palin .If there is anything the world has learned from anime , it 's that a 300lbs . rapist will easily be defeated by a 105 lbs , 15 year old school girl .There is hardly any case to be said that a woman might need a gun to protect herself against biologically stronger opponents .Since gun control frequently targets low - caliber , low - recoil , easily - concealed handguns that women favor , it is doing a great job of protecting those otherwise at - risk rapists .What kind of politician would want to have his state 's rapists at risk of armed female reprisals ?Constitutional Right .The gun nuts who so foolishly cling to their cause of \" self - defense \" cite the Constitution as an excuse to remain dangerously armed .So what if the 2nd amendment says that Americans have the right to be armed ?So what if the Supreme Court ruled that the right applies to individuals and not the state militias ?Since when does the Supreme Court interpret the law ?The Constitution says that it is their job , but no one cares .Everyone knows that old parchment is worthless .America now exists to be regulated by liberals who have your best interests at heart , just like Dr. Kevorkian .But since the liberals do n't really go by the Constitution anyway , why should they start with this part ?Assault Weapons .Gun control supporters target a group of guns that they call assault weapons , which are rarely used in crime .The fact that they are rarely used is proof that gun control works !The term assault weapon was created by the liberal media to describe a group of scary guns that have military - like features .None of them have automatic fire , but since they look like they do , it is easy to say that someone will modify them to shoot that way .The Federal Assault Weapon Ban ( expired 2004 ) was so successful at stopping crimes committed with assault weapons that the government did not have to renew it !The mechanics of assault weapons make them safer to use .Things like standard capacity magazines , pistol grips , barrel shrouds ( the shoulder things that go up ) , flash suppressors , muzzle compensators , and telescoping stocks allow a homeowner to more readily defend their homes .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "101.285095"}
