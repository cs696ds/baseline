Clinton Foundation to combat relevant international issues like HIV and poverty .Interestingly enough , he also became a friend of George H.W. Bush and worked together with him in fundraising efforts in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and the tsunami in Indonesia .Bill Clinton made further news in 2009 when he traveled to North Korea -- the first ex - president since Jimmy Carter to visit -- and aided in the release of two imprisoned American journalists .That same year , he was chosen as the U.N. Special Envoy to Haiti , which took on new prominence when he was asked to offer leadership in the country 's recovery from a devastating earthquake .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.9373"}

Bill Richardson of New Mexico raised $ 5.2 million .By comparison , Mitt Romney , who has been one of the strongest Republican fund - raisers this election , raised only about half of what Mr. Obama raised this summer , according to a senior adviser who was granted anonymity to discuss the campaign 's finances .The adviser said that Mr. Romney brought in about $ 10 million from donors , and that he used more than $ 6 million of his own money for his campaign .Rudy Guiliani also did n't release any data but claims his fundraising was on par with other Republicans .Which other Republicans would be interesting to find out .Senator Fred Thompson raised a so - so $ 8 million - but a variety of factors cut into his ability to raise a lot of cash .Thompson was hamstrung until he formally announced his candidacy from raising money as other candidates since his exploratory committee could n't raise more than he would be able to use to run the committee .He is raising about $ 200,000 a week and has 70,000 individual donors .He will have to do better between now and the primaries if he hopes to compete with Guiliani and Romney .The Democrats are energized and well organized .The Republicans are somewhat lackluster and dispirited .There is still time to turn the situation around but given the trends , 2008 does not look like a Republican year .UPDATE .The Washington Post reports that Hillary Clinton raised an astonishing $ 27 million in the quarter just ended : .Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton 's campaign announced this morning that she had raised $ 27 million in the third quarter , $ 22 million of which was for the primary .The figure topped Sen.
