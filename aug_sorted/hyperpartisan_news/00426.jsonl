{"text": "Microexpressions can be another sign that someone is trying to sell you a falsehood .Throughout a conversation , we make many involuntary microexpressions - brief expressions of anger , fear , happiness , sadness , disgust , surprise , and contempt .These expressions can be hard to catch , sometimes lasting only 1/25 th of a second .When trying to determine whether someone is lying , look out for fleeting expressions that contradict verbal statements , such as the person furrowing their brows while telling you they 're happy .Verbal cues .Now that we 're past the physical signs of lying , let 's move on to the verbal cues .While related to speech , verbal cues do n't necessarily have much to do with the content of what someone is saying , but rather , they are related to the tone of speech and language constructions .Like physical cues , verbal cues are often involuntary .One example is a rise in vocal pitch .This is a sign of stress , and experts note that this phenomenon is more likely to occur when someone is lying than when they are telling the truth .The use of phrases like \" to be honest \" or \" to tell you the truth , \" is also common among deceptive people who are trying ( a little too hard ) to convince you of their honesty .The cadence , or rhythm , of someone 's speech is something else to listen for when gauging someone 's truthfulness .Do they give short , one - word answers ?Do they take long pauses to collect their thoughts before answering questions , or try to buy time by repeating the question ?These are all signs that the person may be lying to you .Bad attitude .When confronting someone about a suspected lie , or even when asking an innocent question , the person being questioned will often display a defensive or even hostile attitude .They may even lash out at you , accusing you of lying or some other wrongdoing .A person who is trying to deceive you may avoid directly answering the question you asked and try to steer the conversation in a different direction , perhaps to the shortcomings of the accuser .For instance , they may retort with something like , \" Why do you question everything I do ?You need to work on your trust issues . \"Besides being uncooperative in answering your question , when lying , people tend to act unpleasant and negative in general .According to psychologists Bella M.

{"text": "Jake Bernstein .2007 was a very profitable year for Magnetar .We know that one of their funds , the constellation fund-- which presumably had some of the profits from their CDO business-- was up 76 % .And we know that the firm Magnetar grew rapidly during this period .When Litowitz , its founder , Alec Litowitz , started Magnetar in 2005 , he had $ 1.7 billion under management .And by the end of 2007 , he had $ 8 billion .Jesse Eisinger .Almost $ 8 .Jake Bernstein .Almost $ 8 billion .Alex Blumberg .So within the span of almost three years , he 'd increased the amount of money under management by $ 6 billion .Jesse Eisinger .Right .And while some of that , I 'm sure , was new investors , some of that was also profit from the business that they were doing .Alex Blumberg .If Magnetar was making a lot of money on these CDOs , there was another group that was n't .And that was the group of people who were buying the top - rated portions of these CDOs that Magnetar was sponsoring and then betting against .There was a group of mutual funds in Tennessee that lost a bunch of money on Magnetar CDOs .There was a regional bank in Ohio .A Lutheran fraternal organization in Minnesota .But surprisingly , the biggest purchasers of Magnetar CDOs , we now know , were the very same investment banks that put these CDOs together in the first place .That 's right .The banks were making these CDOs and essentially selling them to themselves .For example , one CDO deal that Jake and Jesse have managed to learn a lot about , a CDO that Magnetar put together with J.P. Morgan .Magnetar bought the equity portion of the deal for around $ 10 million .But they went ahead and put the deal together and then bought the biggest piece of it without hedging themselves either because they convinced themselves it still was n't that risky or because they just did n't give a damn about the risk or some combination of the two .What they were certain about was how much money they 'd make in fees .Jake Bernstein .J.P. Morgan made , we understand , $ 20 million in fees for the bank , but-- .Alex Blumberg .Probably about half of which was distributed in bonuses to the bankers who worked on it .Jesse Eisinger .Yeah , roughly .Jake Bernstein .Generally .Alex Blumberg .Generally .Jake Bernstein .And yet the bank retained the top - rated , safest portion of the deal .That eventually got wiped out and they took about an $ 880 million loss on the deal according to people we 've spoken to .Jesse Eisinger .We talked to one banker in this world who did CDO business .And he described what had happened as a success .We were sort of taken aback by this because most of these CDOs failed , and the banks ended up saddled with huge losses , which the taxpayers will be paying off for a long time to come .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "118.998566"}
{"text": "A time to go to the beach and burn ourselves to a crisp .A day off from school .A break in the work week .All of these activities and more go through the average American 's head regarding a holiday originally designed to mourn our military dead .What a bizarre twist for Memorial Day , originally called Decoration Day .Once it was a day of remembrance for those who died in our nation 's service .Now , it 's a time to hope that gas prices do n't get too high for travel .While Waterloo N.Y. was officially declared the birthplace of Memorial Day by President Lyndon Johnson in May 1966 , it 's difficult to prove the origins of the day .Historians think the day had many separate beginnings as towns held spontaneous gatherings to honor the Civil War dead in the 1860s .Memorial Day was officially proclaimed on May 5th 1868 by General John Logan , national commander of the Grand Army of the Republic , in his General Order No . 11 , and was first observed on May 30th , 1868 .Flowers were placed on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery .It 's not important what was the very first town to honor the war dead .It is important that Memorial Day was established .Memorial Day is not about division .It is about reconciliation ; it is about coming together to honor those who gave their all .Were you aware of this history ?Are your children aware of this history ?Did you know the first state to officially recognize the holiday was New York in 1873 ?By 1890 it was recognized by all the northern states .The South refused to acknowledge the day , honoring their dead on separate days until after World War I when the holiday changed from honoring those who died in the Civil War to honoring Americans who died fighting in all of our wars .Traditional observance of Memorial Day has faded over the years .Many Americans have forgotten its meaning and traditions .At many cemeteries , the graves of the fallen are increasingly ignored , neglected .Most people no longer remember to fly the flag at half - mast for the day .While there are towns and cities that still hold Memorial Day parades , many have not held a parade in decades .Some people think the day is for honoring any and all dead , not just those fallen in service to our country .What happened ?How did this day turn into a free - for - all three - day vacation ?Many feel when Congress made the day into a three - day weekend with the National Holiday Act of 1971 , it made it easier for people to be distracted from the spirit and meaning of the day .
