Botha will be returned to office .But the unambiguous outcome -- like the resoluteness of the singing -- may well mask a deeper uncertainty among white South Africans .For their country is facing rising internal violence and growing international isolation .And that , in turn , is sparking widening disagreement over the country 's future direction .The election , despite its expected lopsided endorsement of the ruling party , will mirror that disagreement .Voters will likely move to the right and left of the Nationalists -- or simply abstain .And most commentators are predicting the National Party victory margin will be slashed in a number of key constituencies .On the left , the official opposition Progressive Federal Party ( PFP ) , which favors negotiating a new power - sharing arrangement with South Africa 's black majority , may well increase its 18-seat bloc in Parliament .On the right , the Reconstituted National Party ( Herstigte Nasionale Party , or HNP ) -- champions of strict racial segregation in all spheres of life -- could win its first one or two seats in Parliament .Gains by either party , or a substantial staying away from the polls , will be interpreted as a repudiation of the policies of Prime Minister Botha .Mr. Botha has sparked right - wing resentment for merely talking about change in racial policies -- and has been slammed by liberal whites for doing nothing but talking .Willem Kleynhans , professor of political science at the University of South Africa , says there has never been a prime minister in the history of the National Party so unpopular .Professor Kleynhans says this is evidenced by the low number of postal and absentee votes that have already been recorded -- and by the low turnout at numerous National Party rallies .That trend was evident at the party rally here in Tzaneen .Although two of the party 's top Cabinet ministers were on hand , the front rows of the Ben Vorster High School auditorium were empty .The previous night , one of the speakers , Minister of Defense Magnus Malan , had drawn only 39 listeners at a rally in his home constituency .On this particular night , General Malan was on hand to sound what has become the central theme of the National Party 's campaign : the \" total onslaught \" against South Africa from outside the country .The general warned that South Africa was the ultimate \" objective \" of world communism , because of its strategic position and its mineral wealth .The rest of the subcontinent had fallen to communism , he warned , not because of direct military action but because of political developments -- notably , the loss of white resolve .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "96.714264"}
