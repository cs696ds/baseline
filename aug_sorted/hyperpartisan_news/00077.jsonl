Stolar , a member of the National Lawyers Guild , which is supporting the Occupy protesters , said many demonstrators were arrested even after heeding police directions to stay on the sidewalk .He said the judge should throw out all the cases .\" We had previously asked the district attorney 's office to dismiss all these cases because of the ambiguity of the police directions , \" Stolar said .\" I 'm pleased that people recognized the fact that they do n't want to be on some form of probation , that they want to continue to engage in protest activity -- not civil disobedience but protest activity , \" Stolar said .So far , New York authorities have made 555 arrests in the Occupy Wall Street movement , which began in mid - September , on charges ranging from minor violations to felonies , said spokeswoman Erin M. Duggan of the district attorney 's office .In downtown Oakland on Thursday , the clash between demonstrators and police escalated before dawn when authorities used tear gas on protesters who defied orders to disperse , police said .Authorities had earlier shut down the port .In the violence , a crowd of several hundred people threw rocks and shot fireworks at officers after being asked to leave the scene , prompting officers to fire tear gas , authorities said .After the port protest , Occupy Oakland demonstrators returned to a city park and nearby streets , where violence broke out .Hazy video from the scene , posted on the Internet , showed a fire burning and fireworks exploding as at least one protester threw objects .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "50.746532"}

{"text": "\" You want to shut down Wall Street , fine .But stopping people bargain shopping ?Not the right message .\" City tells Occupy Philadelphia : Leave Dilworth Plaza by 5 p.m. Sunday By Kia Gregory Inquirer Staff Writer .At a news conference Friday afternoon , Mayor Nutter announced that those camping out on the City Hall apron of Dilworth Plaza as part of Occupy Philadelphia had until 5 p.m. Sunday to pack up their tents and leave .The notice was posted on trees and poles , and handed out to about 300 people in Dilworth Plaza .\" This announcement today serves as the promise , \" Nutter said of those encamped .\" You must remove all of your possessions and yourself from that location within the next 48 hours .\" The Occupy Philadelphia movement has been demonstrating at Dilworth Plaza under a city permit since Oct. 7 .That permit expires Sunday .Under a new permit granted to an Occupy splinter group Friday , activists may gather at nearby Thomas Paine Plaza , but may not camp overnight .About 150 people gathered for a general assembly Friday night to discuss the eviction notice , but the meeting degenerated as members shouted at one another over long - simmering internal grievances about how decisions were being made and by whom .Members of one faction , representing a group of people who live at the tent city and said they spoke for the homeless , took over the meeting .They expressed their hostility to those who do not live at Dilworth Plaza and , in a few cases , physically menaced some people who tried to argue against them .A group of about 60 people quietly fell away from the meeting and started a separate gathering on the other side of Dilworth Plaza .Jacob Russell , 70 , said the conflict was not surprising because the group is engaged in an \" experiment \" in direct democracy .\" It 's a steep learning curve , \" said Russell , who said his last job was teaching English at St. Joseph 's University .\" I think it 's inevitable that there are divisions . \"Russell said that he expected people to come together again , especially when the police arrive to evict them .The conflict both exposed rifts in the Occupy movement and made clear that while many activists plan to avoid a conflict with the police , others are in a fighting mood - and that might carry into Sunday .The relocation , Nutter said , will clear the way for a long - awaited renovation of Dilworth Plaza .With the permit approved Friday , Nutter said , the $ 50 million , two - year project will bring 1,000 jobs to the city in a rough economy .It 's a project \" built by the 99 percent , for the 99 percent , \" Nutter said , alluding to Occupy 's slogan , \" We are the 99 percent . \" The Occupy Philadelphia Legal Collective appealed the relocation Wednesday in a letter to the city 's deputy managing director .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.868904"}
