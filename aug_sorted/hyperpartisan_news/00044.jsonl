Kitzhaber is available at this link .The judge 's opinion seems defensible based on the Oregon case law that he cites ( none of which I 've read , so I 'm taking his word for it ) .However , in so far as that case law rests on Marshall 's opinion in Wilson , it is seriously flawed analytically .In the first place , Marshall 's deed theory is plainly dicta , because the defendant had in fact accepted the President 's grant of clemency .He had been charged with two separate incidents of robbery of the mail ; both cases were potentially capital offenses because he had put the life of the mail carrier in jeapardy by using a weapon .He was convicted of the first robbery and sentenced to death .The defendant plainly accepted this deal in order to avoid a second capital charge .( In fact , the warrant is somewhat ambiguous about the precise nature of the grant , since the term \" commutation \" was not then commonly used .It was styled a \" pardon , \" but it also said that it was meant to \" remit \" the previously imposed death sentence , with the \" express stipulation \" that it would not extend to any other offense pending before the court .Today , it would in all likelihood have been considered a commutation of the death sentence , in exchange for the guilty plea to the non - capital charges ) .To be sure , the fact that he was also pleading to non - capital charges arising from the first robbery was problematic , but this was a matter of indifference to him , because it spared him from exposure to an almost certain death sentence for the second robbery .But the refusal to affirmatively plead an act of clemency in defense is analytically different from a refusal to accept it in the first place .Secondly , Marshall 's understanding of English common law practices was simply wrong .In practice , the pretence of securing the prisoner 's consent to a royal pardon was never more than a formality in England , which was eventually abandoned to boot .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.503456"}

Terry was killed in December , the top ATF supervisors in Phoenix said in internal emails that weapons found at the scene in Arizona came from a failed agency sting operation .Congressional investigators probing the controversial \" Fast and Furious \" anti - gun - trafficking operation on the border with Mexico believe at least six Mexican drug cartel figures involved in gun smuggling also were paid FBI informants , officials said Saturday .The Obama administration took a concrete step toward curbing the flow of semiautomatic weapons to Mexico last week when it adopted a new regulation mandating the reporting of multiple sales of long guns to federal authorities .As a backlash mounts over the government 's failed Fast and Furious gun - tracing operation , the Justice Department will begin requiring firearms dealers in California and other border states to alert officials anytime they sell more than two semiautomatic rifles to someone in a five - day period .The embattled head of the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives has told congressional investigators that some Mexican drug cartel figures targeted by his agency in a gun - trafficking investigation were paid informants for the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration .Two congressional Democrats , fresh from a trip to Mexico City , plan to propose tighter restrictions on gun trafficking to combat illegal U.S. sales that they say may supply 80 % of the arsenals of Mexican drug cartels .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "66.06716"}

( A controversial lawsuit filed last month against John Yoo follows the same logic . )The senators pressed the inspector general and OPR to investigate DoJ 's authorization of water - boarding .Their push for a joint probe would seem to make sense .Fine 's office has a mandate to investigate fraud , waste , and abuse at DoJ. Jarrett 's office , with total staff of 25 , looks into ethical violations by individual DoJ attorneys , like an allegation of an improper closing argument or failure to turn over evidence .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "79.82885"}
