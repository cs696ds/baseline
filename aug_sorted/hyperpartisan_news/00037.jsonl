Bush cast out the GOP traditions of conservative restraint in foreign policy in favor of neoconservative activism .Conservatism in Republican politics is not a static concept defined in the writing of Edmund Burke , or Ayn Rand for that matter , as Paul Ryan 's words suggest .It has been balanced over the years by the exigencies of what it takes to win .Paul Ryan 's protests notwithstanding , Donald Trump 's populist , nativist rhetoric -- as offensive as it may be -- is well within the American political tradition , and his campaign has its antecedents in the traditions of the GOP as well .GOP candidates have thrived over the years through their willingness to say the words necessary to motivate their base -- however offensive to others they might be -- and Trump is no different .The question is what comes next .Now that the GOP top brass -- from Speaker Paul Ryan to GOP Chairman Reince Priebus to its \u00e9minence grise Dick Cheney -- have heaped condemnation on Donald Trump , and many declared him unfit to serve , they have placed themselves between a rock and a hard place .Within hours of the shooting at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs , my friend , a long time reporter with years of covering the Department of Justice received a call from the editors of a major newspaper .They were struggling with how to describe the actions of Robert Lewis Dear : if it turned out the shooter had anti - abortion motives , would that meet the Department of Justice 's definition of domestic terrorism .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "48.209354"}

{"text": "Several of Mrs. Clinton 's answers reflected an urgent political imperative : to maintain and energize her deep support among minority voters in order to offset Mr. Sanders 's popularity with young people , liberals and some working - class white voters .Mr. Sanders won support from 83 percent of New Hampshire voters ages 18 to 29 , and 60 percent of the liberal base there , according to exit polls , while Mrs. Clinton did best with older and wealthier voters .She has pivoted quickly this week to highlight new endorsements from the political arm of the Congressional Black Caucus and to target a new television commercial at black voters in South Carolina , where the Feb. 27 primary is now a must - win contest for her .That might not be easy : .In her opening statement , Mrs. Clinton denounced discrimination against African - Americans in employment , education , housing and the criminal justice system .But she was matched by Mr. Sanders as he railed against a legal system in which young people have criminal records because of petty drug offenses while Wall Street executives escaped culpability for the great recession .\" Look , we are fighting for every vote that we can get , from women , from men , straight , gay , African - Americans , Latinos , Asian - Americans , \" Mr. Sanders said .\" We are trying to bring America together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class . \" Hillary Clinton loves black people .And black people love Hillary - or so it seems .Black politicians have lined up in droves to endorse her , eager to prove their loyalty to the Clintons in the hopes that their faithfulness will be remembered and rewarded .Doing something concrete to improve the conditions under which most black people live is generally not required .Hillary is looking to gain momentum on the campaign trail as the primaries move out of Iowa and New Hampshire and into states like South Carolina , where large pockets of black voters can be found .According to some polls , she leads Bernie Sanders by as much as 60 percent among African Americans .It seems that we - black people - are her winning card , one that Hillary is eager to play .And it seems we 're eager to get played .Again .Yes , there 's a history here : .The love affair between black folks and the Clintons has been going on for a long time .It began back in 1992 , when Bill Clinton was running for president .He threw on some shades and played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show .It seems silly in retrospect , but many of us fell for that .At a time when a popular slogan was \" It 's a black thing , you would n't understand , \" Bill Clinton seemed to get us .When Toni Morrison dubbed him our first black president , we nodded our heads .We had our boy in the White House .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "49.23292"}

{"text": "The Post 's Chris Cillizza posited several explanations for the most recent change in Gallup 's generic ballot results .Possibly , Cillizza says , the poll giving the Republicans a ten - point lead was an \" outlier , \" or one of those anomalous samples that occasionally fall beyond the normal range of sampling error .Perhaps it was .It is certainly true that many of Gallup 's weekly numbers during 2010 were much closer to the generic ballot results of other pollsters than that one was .The problem with this reasoning , however , is that Gallup 's generic ballot numbers have varied so dramatically from one weekly survey to another that it 's difficult to know exactly which one might truly be an outlier .A more plausible explanation is that , unlike many pollsters , Gallup does not \" weight \" its samples by the party identification of respondents .Gallup might argue that this methodology leads to purer , more accurate , results than predetermining the number of Democrats , Republicans , and Independents within its samples .However , at least in the current political era , this approach is likely to give the GOP an advantage on the generic ballot .That is because the Democratic Party now has a clear and decisive lead party ID lead over the Republican Party .In a June survey conducted for NDN by communications research and consultation firm , Frank N. Magid Associates , the Democrats held a 47 % vs. 33 % edge over the Republicans with 19 % of the electorate claiming to be totally unaffiliated independents .This distribution is matched almost identically by figures from the Pew Research Center 's three most recent surveys , conducted from late July to late August .Across those three polls , a little under half of Americans ( 46 % ) identified or leaned toward the Democrats while about a third ( 36 % ) said they were Republicans and 14 % were unattached independents .None of this is to say that things will be easy for the Democrats this fall .Things are almost never easy for a newly elected president 's party in the first midterm election of his administration .Historically , only once ( in 1934 during Franklin Roosevelt 's first term ) did a new president 's party buck the midterm odds and gain congressional seats .On average parties in the position the Democrats are in this year lose about 25 House and half dozen Senate seats in the midterm election after a new president assumes office .The odds against the Democrats in 2010 are only made longer by an economy slow to rebound from the deep recession that President Obama inherited from George W. Bush .This provides the Democrats with a base sizable enough to withstand a GOP wave if they can rally that base and get it to the polls in November .That is the big political question this year .The answer to it will determine the outcome of the 2010 midterm elections and will , in the end , be far more crucial than what happens with \" angry independents \" or \" engaged Republicans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.71905"}

Wells to Karl Marx , foreign observers have long fingered America 's lack of socialism as a key characteristic distinguishing it from Europe .But Sanders is a democratic socialist ; he does n't run from the term .And neither do his backers .In a January poll of likely caucusgoers in Iowa , The Washington Post reported that more Democrats called themselves \" socialists \" than \" capitalists .\" Sanders 's socialism is especially popular among the young .A 2011Pew Research Survey found that while Americans 65 and older favored capitalism over socialism by 39 points , Americans under 30 favored socialism .Once it was because they were n't as well educated .What 's holding them back now ?Though headway has been made in bringing women 's wages more in line with men 's in the past several decades , that convergence seems to have stalled in more recent years .To help determine why , Francine D.

{"text": "The power of these population shifts to upend conventional political wisdom was demonstrated by Barack Obama 's victories over heavily favored establishment candidates in both the Democratic primary and the general election in 2008 .These demographic transformations are changing the political loyalties and beliefs of the American electorate .Democrats now have their largest lead in national party identification since the early 1960s .In the most recent Pew survey , only 15 % of Americans claimed to be completely unaffiliated independent voters , while about half ( 48 % ) identify with the Democratic Party and 37 % with the Republican Party .By contrast , in 1994 , the last time in which a newly elected Democratic president faced a midterm election against an aroused GOP , the two parties were tied in party identification at 44 % each .This Democratic advantage is due in large part to Millennials and Hispanics who identify as Democrats by a 2:1 margin over Republicans .Survey data also shows that most Americans continue to favor using government to address their economic concerns and societal challenges .Forty percent of adults told an Associated Press survey they did n't think the new health care law went far enough , while only 20 % felt the federal government should n't be involved in healthcare at all .These pro - government attitudes are likely to grow as more and more Millennials enter the electorate .By a 60 % to 36 % margin the generation favors a bigger government providing more services over a smaller government providing fewer services .In the shorter run , the operative question in this year 's midterm elections is the extent to which the major components of the 21st century American electorate make their presence felt at the polls in November .President Obama , who is concentrating his final campaigning efforts on college campuses and minority neighborhoods , clearly recognizes the challenge - but also the rare opportunity - presented by the 21st century electorate .His success in energizing these newest members of the Democratic Party 's base will determine the still uncertain outcome of the midterm elections .But the longer term direction of American politics will clearly continue to be driven by the demographic and generational changes now sweeping the country .Because they voted so uniformly for Obama , while older generations were almost evenly divided in their presidential voting preferences , Millennials accounted for about 80 percent of the president 's popular vote edge in the November general election .In addition , in both 2006 and 2008 , Millennials voted for Democratic congressional candidates by about the same 2:1 margin that they gave the president in his general election victory .More recently , however , some observers say that Millennial enthusiasm for President Obama , the Democratic Party , and progressive policies has begun to wane and wobble .Unfortunately , most of these observations are based more on personal speculation than on empirical evidence .Independents defected long ago , and young people are heading for the door .\" As even a cursory glance at recent polling demonstrates , nothing could be further from the truth .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "57.37014"}

Bush and Bob Dole , respectively .Buchanan 's share of the vote mirrored exactly the share of the GOP electorate represented by the Wallace voters that Nixon brought into the party .The subsequent emergence of the Tea Party movement within the Republican Party demonstrated more than a decade after Buchanan 's last race that the anti - establishment , nativist wing of the GOP was alive and well .Over the past fifty years , the GOP has catered to the socially conservative views of the voters who migrated to the GOP in the wake of the Southern Strategy , but has been largely inimical to their economic interests .Pat Buchanan railed for years that the GOP was serving the interests of Republican corporate and Wall Street elites by supporting free trade and immigration policies that undermined the economic interests of working and middle class Americans .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "60.412315"}

Bernie Sanders ( D - VT ) addressed his rabid crowd of supporters , where he laid out his agenda for America that drastically drags the country towards the left .He thanked the people of New Hampshire , and congratulated Hillary Clinton and her supporters for a vigorous campaign .Yet , he also acknowledged the many thousands of his supporters , who worked tirelessly , day and night knocking on doors and making phone calls .He noted that they won because of their energy .Sanders also said that his win sends a message that the government of our great country belongs to all of the people , and not just a handful of wealthy donors and their super PACS .He noted that his campaign from the outset had no money ( and no real organization ) in the beginning , but they were going to take on one of the most powerful political machines in the country .Because of a huge turnout , and he channeled his inner Trump by saying \" YUGE , \" he said we won because we harnessed the energy and the excitement that the Democratic Party will need to succeed .Sanders said that what happened tonight , in terms of enthusiasm and an aroused electorate , is what 's going to happen across this country .He reminded his supporters that Democrats and progressives should never forget that they win when voter turnout is high ; Republicans win when people are demoralized and voter turnout is low .He also said this win will send notice to the political establishment of the county , that the American people will not accept a corrupt campaign finance system .We will not bring back huge tax breaks for billionaires - and we can not allow right - wing Republicans win in November .The people want real change .In reflecting that change , Sanders took pride in the fact that he does n't have a super PAC and he will never have one , which drew loud cheers among the crowd .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "63.123512"}

Tuchfarber has looked at the December polls and has also demonstrated how little predictive value they have .In polls from November 2007 , taken two months before voting , Hillary Clinton was leading the Democratic race .Rudy Guiliani was leading the Republican race , with Fred Thompson also ahead of John McCain .In 2011 Herman Cain was leading the Republican race , and had left the race by the time of the Iowa caucuses .One reason for the poor predictive value of national polls is that whoever wins in Iowa and/or New Hampshire generally gets a huge boost in subsequent states .That does n't mean that the polls in Iowa are all that more meaningful as voters there typically do n't make up their minds until the last minute .Hillary Clinton was leading in the polls in Iowa and came in third place in 2008 .In late 2007 Mitt Romney was leading the polls in Iowa , and came in second to Mike Huckabee .Herman Cain was leading in Iowa as well as the national polls two months before the Iowa caucus .Polls also have limited predictive value as the pollsters do not know who will actually turn out to vote .If the Democratic caucus in Iowa is dominated by long time Democratic voters , then the polls are showing the race as very close .If those who have n't previously voted but are showing enthusiasm for Bernie Sanders turn out to vote , there could be a big victory for Sanders .The much stronger degree of support seen for Sanders in social media is very encouraging , but no guarantee of votes .It might also be helpful for Sanders that the Iowa caucuses are later this year than in the 2008 cycle , when many college students were off on vacation .Even more might turn out for Sanders in this year than had turned out for Obama .Similarly we will not know whether Donald Trump will easily win the nomination , or if a party regular will challenge him , until we see how the voters act .Members of both parties have good reason to worry about the candidates now leading in the polls .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "65.9287"}

{"text": "All of the public surveys conducted during the past week show the Democrats with at least a modest lead .Over the last few months there has been a net shift of six - points toward the Democratic Party .March / April Democratic Preference .March / April Republican Preference .Quinnipiac .Average .An examination of a few key findings from some recent polls shows why that shift has occurred .First , while voters do not yet believe that America has returned yet to prosperity , there is a clear perception of progress .In the Quinnipiac survey , the number believing that the nation 's economy is getting better rose from 19 % in April 2009 and 28 % last December to 32 % now .The belief that the economy is worsening is down from 32 % to 24 % over the same period .President Obama is getting some of the credit for the perceived improvement in the economy .His approval score for handling the economy is up from 39 % in March 2010 to 44 % currently .More specifically , the percentage approving of President Obama 's performance in creating jobs has risen from a low of 34 % last January to 40 % in May.Second , after a year of rancor , voters are increasingly positive about the Democratic health care reform plan that passed Congress and was signed by the president in March .According to a recent CBS News poll , approval of the plan rose from only 32 % in early March to 43 % in May.As a result , the president 's approval rating for handling health care in the Quinnipiac poll has risen from a low of 35 % in January and February to 45 % now .As proof that nothing succeeds like success , the perception of an improving economy and the increasingly positive reactions to the newly enacted health care reform law have led to the most favorable job approval scores for both the president and congressional Democrats this year .For most of 2010 , in the Quinnipiac poll , a slightly greater percentage of voters disapproved than approved of the way President Obama was handling his job .But in May , for the first time since early February the president 's approval score was in positive ground ( 48 % approve vs. 43 % disapprove ) .Over the same time frame , the job performance approval of congressional Democrats has gone up from 28 % to 34 % .By contrast , the approval score for congressional Republicans is down from a high of 34 % in March to only 26 % in May.Of course , none of this should be taken as an indication that the road forward to November for the Democrats will be smooth and easy .Historically , during a president 's first term his party suffers on average a midterm loss of about 25 seats in the House and half dozen in the Senate .Only once , in 1934 when voters overwhelmingly endorsed Franklin Roosevelt and his New Deal , did a president 's party make first term midterm congressional gains .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "73.108116"}

{"text": "In an extremely confusing line of argument , Pullmann seems to suggest that an environmental apocalypse might actually be a welcome outcome from a Christian point of view : .We will never achieve utopia in this world .That 's kind of the central story arc of the Bible : How humans screwed themselves and the whole world up , and how Jesus has and will ultimately put things to right .Getting all the way to a perfect eternity , however , requires first an apocalypse .So maybe Pope Francis should welcome the environmental apocalypse he thinks is coming .That 's partly a joke and partly serious , because every time I see another Planned Parenthood butchering video I am ready for Jesus to take me and my kiddos right up to Paradise and end this sick , mad world .Pullmann 's words might seem lurid and even nonsensical , but they follow the basic contours of Will 's : The church should stick to saving souls and leave the job of running the world to big business .She also upholds John Paul II as an example of a pope whom it was possible \" to respect and admire\"-further proof that what is wanted is not an apolitical pope but a pope who aligned with the Republican Party .Pat Buchanan , the legendary conservative columnist , takes the right - wing hostility toward Francis to its logical conclusion and sees the current Pope , along with President Obama , as being emblematic of the deep sickness in Western civilization .In a breathtaking recent column , Buchanan opines that Francis is promoting \" moral confusion , \" and argues that both Putin 's Russia and Communist China show much greater cultural health than either Obama 's America or Francis 's church : .America is a different country today , a secular and post - Christian nation on its way to becoming anti - Christian .Some feel like strangers in their own land .And from the standpoint of traditional Catholicism , American culture is an open sewer .A vast volume of the traffic on the Internet is pornography .Ironically , as all this unfolds in what was once \" God 's country , \" Vladimir Putin seeks to re - establish Eastern Orthodox Christianity as the basis of morality and law in Russia .And one reads in The Wall Street Journal on Monday that Xi Jinping is trying to reintroduce his Chinese Communist comrades to the teachings of Confucianism .The world is turned upside down .Every civilization seems to recognize the necessity of faith except for the West , which has lost its faith and is shrinking and dying for lack of it .Will is a religious skeptic , while both Pullmann and Buchanan are believers .Will 's prose is elegant and measured , while both Pullmann and Buchanan write shrill screeds .Yet despite these surface differences , they are making the same argument : that the proper role of the church is promoting individual salvation and social morality , a mission Francis is jeopardizing by advocating for political change .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.48012"}

{"text": "The goals were two -- to make the deficit appear to be smaller by monetizing it , and to do exactly what the monopolize game contemplates -- increasing economic activity by injecting money into the economy .They even paired it with the \" shovel - ready \" public works program , so the parallel to the Monopolize game is pretty complete .The QE had little effect , except for a bump in inflation .And therein lies the rub and the flaw .The money itself has no value .Each currency unit represents a little bit of the economic output of the country , and is itself nothing more than a fungible coupon redeemable for that little slice .In the real world , when you inject currency into the economy faster than economic output grows , you get inflation .That 's why central bankers are always worried about the money supply .It has to stay in rough parity with the economy , otherwise you get inflation or deflation .When you inject excess money , the economy magically soaks it up and compensates by raising prices on everything .Nobody controls this , and apparently nobody can stop it .It just happens .You certainly ca n't stop it by fiat .Imposing price controls is always a failure , and leads to black markets and other undesirable things .And trying to stay ahead of the inflation curve by putting out more money simply leads to a recursive cycle of inflation and money printing .All of this has been tried many times in many countries , so we have a lot of examples of the outcomes .The final practical flaw is that the Monopolize game ( as economists are often wo nt to do ) assumes that people will rationally and calmly accept that the currency has some standard prescribed value and act in accordance with the rational decision - making process assumed by the theory .That just is n't the case , and is probably the source of all the issues I just discussed .In the final analysis , when you use currency , you 're asking people to trade things of value for an essentially worthless piece of paper .When they do so , it 's an act of faith in the currency - issuing entity , and if they lose that faith -- which can happen very quickly -- the whole thing falls apart .And try though governments do , they ca n't keep the real economy from doing all of these things , or from setting a real value on the currency based upon whatever calculation it is that people use for these things .Price controls , currency movement restrictions and all the other things that governments use to try to stop all of this are always defeated by people 's ingenuity and persistence .It may all be irrational , but that 's what people do , and until someone figures out a way to stop them from doing it , a pure fiat currency regime as proposed in that article wo n't work .Good reply .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "93.02186"}

{"text": "On June 3 , 2013 , Hillary Clinton presented an award to de la Renta , a good friend who for years had provided her dresses and fashion advice , and then the two of them hopped over to a 90th birthday party for Kissinger .In fact , the schedule of the award ceremony had been shifted to allow Clinton and de la Renta to make it to the Kissinger bash .( Secretary of State John Kerry also attended the party . )The Kissingers and the de la Rentas were longtime buddies .Kissinger wrote one of his recent books while staying at de la Rentas ' mansion in the Dominican Republic and dedicated the book to the fashion designer and his wife .The Clintons and Kissingers appear to spend a chunk of their quality time together at that de la Renta estate in the Punta Cana resort .Last year , the Associated Press noted that this is where the Clintons take their annual Christmas holiday .That just makes this even odder : .When awarding herself the Kissinger seal of approval to bolster her standing as a competent diplomat and government official , Hillary Clinton has not referred to the annual hobnobbing at the de la Renta villa .So when Sanders criticized Clinton for playing the Kissinger card - \" not my kind of guy , \" he declared - whether he realized it or not , he was hitting very close to home .Lawrence Korb , who was an assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration and leads the think - tank - life now , brings this back to policy : .On CNN last week and on Meet the Press this week , Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders cited me as someone who has given him foreign policy advice .I admit I was surprised to hear this - I have spoken to Senator Sanders only once since he declared his candidacy , in October .The answer is : serious .Since Sanders ' public mention of me , I have been asked repeatedly whether I think his foreign policy positions and experience are sound .I do .That 's because the guy is n't Henry Kissinger : .In my dealings with him , and in analyzing his record in Congress over the past 25 years , I have found that Sanders has taken balanced , realistic positions on many of the most critical foreign policy issues facing the country .And Sanders certainly is n't a foreign policy lightweight : In fact , given his long tenure in the House and Senate , he has more foreign policy experience than Ronald Reagan or Barack Obama did when they were running for office the first time .What would a President Sanders ' foreign policy look like ?Based on his record and my conversation with him , I believe it would be rooted in a number of key principles .First is restraint in using American force abroad .As he has stated , and as is demonstrated by his vote against the Iraq War and the first Gulf War , Sanders believes military action should be the last , not first , option and that , when taken , such action should be multilateral .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "102.29318"}

{"text": "Their split will persist at least through the critical South Carolina primary approaching on February 20 , and possibly through the Super Tuesday cascade of contests on March 1 .The script for J.K. Rowling 's new play , set to premiere in the summer , will also be published in book form .When J.K. Rowling announced last October that her Harry Potter series would get a new story - in the form of a play that featured her beloved book characters as adults - fans greeted the news with mixed feelings .As I wrote at the time , it was exciting to see the author experiment with a new medium and a non - Harry - centric tale in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child .The play picks up the story 19 years after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , and focuses on Harry 's relationship with his son , Albus Severus .The casting choices that were later announced - with a black actress , Noma Dumezweni , in the role of grown - up Hermione - were even more heartening .And yet .They 'll be trying not to feel too sad that the first new Harry Potter story in almost 10 years wo n't be one they can binge - read the day it comes out .Most people in the U.S. believe their country is going to hell .But they 're wrong .What a three - year journey by single - engine plane reveals about reinvention and renewal .W hen news broke late last year of a mass shooting in San Bernardino , California , most people in the rest of the country , and even the state , probably had to search a map to figure out where the city was .San Bernardino went into bankruptcy in 2012 and was only beginning to emerge at the time of the shootings .Crime is high , household income is low , the downtown is nearly abandoned in the daytime and dangerous at night , and unemployment and welfare rates are persistently the worst in the state .Why Donald Trump 's anti - immigration rhetoric was enough for movement conservatives to forgive his history of liberalism .Last summer , Donald Trump described Mexican immigrants as \" bringing drugs , they 're bringing crime .They 're rapists . \"In December , he called for \" a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States . \" Many commentators claim that this wild rhetoric helps Trump suck up media oxygen or appear like a straight - talking political outsider .But the most important benefit of the anti - immigrant language is that it inoculates Trump against the charge of being a closet liberal .Trump has a seemingly fatal vulnerability in the Republican primary : His past support for a host of moderate and liberal positions .But raising the minimum wage does n't really address the fact that black men without criminal records have about the same shot at low - wage work as white men with them ; nor can making college free address the wage gap between black and white graduates .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "117.87117"}
