Rick Perry and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin - showing nomination potential .For example , Rep. Michele Bachmann ( R - Minn . ) , may not have raised as much as Romney , but she is polling surprisingly well and is known for her ability to raise large sums .During the 2010 election cycle , she raised more than any other member of the House of Representatives .And given her later entry in the race , her expenditures this quarter have been minimal .Bachmann reported spending only $ 260,650 of the $ 3.6 million she raised .Bachmann also has more cash on hand than former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , who was the first to announce his presidential bid .Pawlenty 's fund - raising total disappointed many Republican insiders who considered him a top - tier candidate with the ability to challenge Romney .Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) slightly out - raised both Bachmann and Pawlenty during the second quarter , bringing in $ 4.5 million without running a debt .Although Paul has enjoyed strong support from a core group of Republicans and libertarians , he struggled during the 2008 election to reach the wider public and did not win any primary contests .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "39.759758"}

Bush ( 26 % ) and John McCain ( 21 % ) , enjoyed higher levels of financial support from the Republican grassroots during their primaries than Romney .Romney 's reliance on large donors has its perils - a smaller base of large donors who max out can no longer contribute to the candidate , whereas a large base of small donors can be asked to contribute repeatedly .Unlimited money the equalizer ?Of course , the big change this year is the proliferation of outside groups , which can raise unlimited money .Will all the fundraising by Restore Our Future , American Crossroads , Crossroads GPS and other groups end up outgunning Obama ?It 's not clear that they will .First , consider that conservative and Republican leaning super PACs and nonprofits are n't spending only to defeat Obama ; sometimes they 're spending to foil each other .The American Action Network faced off against the Club for Growth in last month 's Republican Senate primary .Richard Mourdock , backed by the Club for Growth , defeated veteran Sen.

Kay Hagan , D - N.C. , has helped launch no fewer than 17 joint committees that have collectively netted more than $ 1 million .Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , whose race could attract as much as $ 100 million in spending , has a hand in four joint campaign accounts that have raised $ 3.4 million between them .More recently , Republicans created a new joint committee that will raise money collectively for 10 GOP House challengers and the National Republican Congressional Committee .These joint fundraising committees enable anywhere from two to two dozen or more candidates to raise money collectively and to split the proceeds .The joint committees often revolve around exclusive fundraising shindigs that offer big donors access to big - name committee chairs and party leaders .State and local party committees and even PACs also get in on the act .It 's too early to say whether such joint committees will now skyrocket in size and number , as some predict , and whether they 'll come to deserve the nicknames they 've inspired , such as \" max PACs \" and \" super JFCs . \"The McCutcheon ruling frees joint campaign committees to collect checks as big as $ 3.6 million from a single donor , watchdogs warn .But the amount distributed to each individual participating candidate will still be capped at $ 2,600 per election .Either way , joint accounts are already raising hundreds of millions for candidates eager to leverage one another 's personal connections and donor lists .Boosted by the joint committees run by President Barack Obama and GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney , joint campaign accounts raised more than $ 1 billion in the 2012 elections , CRP data shows , twice what they yielded in the previous presidential contest .In this election , Republican joint committees are outraising Democratic joint accounts by almost four - to - one .According to data provided by the Sunlight Foundation , GOP joint campaign funds collected $ 23.3 million in 2013 , compared with $ 6.3 million pulled in by Democratic joint accounts .But Democrats outpace Republicans in fundraising overall , which may explain the GOP 's reliance on joint fundraising as a means to catch up .Immediately following the McCutcheon ruling , the three major GOP party committees set up a joint campaign fund for the first time ever in an off - year election .The Republican Victory Funds will split its proceeds between the Republican National Committee , the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee , and will be free to raise checks as large as $ 129,600 per donor for the election cycle .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "41.349434"}
