The City of New York , the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated a lawsuit accusing New York City of violating the 1 st and 14 th Amendment rights of Muslim - Americans in New Jersey under a sprawling and ineffective NYPD surveillance dragnet .The ruling overturns a decision by the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissing the suit for lack of standing and for failing to state a claim .In layman 's terms : the district court , without a trial or the presentation of evidence , ruled that the plaintiffs were n't harmed unjustifiably , that they had n't alleged sufficient wrongdoing by the police , and that they had no right to sue .The Third Circuit ruling rejects those determinations and the case will now move forward at the district court .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "55.429367"}

Martin Dempsey , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , like other military officials doubted that the gains from using embedded advisers and attack helicopters were worth the possible cost in American blood , said several U.S. officials familiar with his position .Instead , he counseled patience , maintaining that the U.S.-led air campaign was weakening the Islamic State and that a force of Sunni tribal fighters would need to be trained and armed to hold the battlefield gains .[A long war in Iraq ] .Defense Secretary Ashton B.

Cerf in his article called ' ' Truth and the Internet ' ' .It perfectly summarizes the nature of the Internet and the ways it can create freedom .Dr. Cerf calls the Internet one of the most powerful agents of freedom : It exposes truth to those who wish to see it .But he also warns us that the power of the Internet is like a two - edged sword : it can also deliver misinformation and uncorroborated opinion with equal ease .The thoughtful and the thoughtless co - exist side by side in the Internet 's electronic universe .What is to be done , asks Cerf .His answer is to apply critical thinking .Consider the Internet as an opportunity to educate us all .We truly must think about what we see and hear , and we must evaluate and select .We must choose our guides .Furthermore , we must also teach our children to think more deeply about what they see and hear .That , more than any electronic filter , he says , will build a foundation upon which truth can stand .Today , this foundation upon which truth could indeed so firmly stand is under continuous pressure by governments .As soon as governments realized that the Internet challenges secrecy and censorship , corruption , inefficiency and bad governing , they started imposing controls on it .In many countries and in many ways the effects are visible and they indeed threaten the potential for information to circulate freely .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.29199"}

{"text": "There is , indeed , a genuine concern about the protection of journalistic sources within the Leveson package , arising from a possible misapplication of suggested requirements for transparency about interests and lobbying .That is an important matter and needs to be addressed carefully .It also needs to be distinguished from the kind of regulation against abuse that all professions need , which should include ( as the NUJ has frequently argued , and as Leveson recognised ) a conscience clause in contracts for journalists .In an accompanying article for the International Forum for Responsible Media , he explains : .The opposition to the statutory underpinning is also based on a type of prophylactic rule - that is David Cameron 's Rubicon , in which he argues that no part of press regulation should be enacted in statute .This is also based on a separation of powers type of argument .The argument runs that the primary function of the press is to act as a check on government and Parliament , exposing abuses of power .If government or Parliament exercise control over the press , then there is a danger that the press will be muzzled and suppress their criticisms .Most people would agree with the argument so far .However , the critics of statutory underpinning go a stage further .The argument goes that we need to guard against those laws targeting the press that do not appear to threaten the watchdog function , for fear that it may set a precedent or that the law may be amended in future .It is therefore a prophylactic rule in so far as it over - protects press independence from legislative intervention to prevent the slightest risk of government and parliamentary control .Of course , some commentators have pointed out that there are already legislative controls on the press .For example , in the Defamation Bill , MPs have decided what standards journalists must fulfill to rely on the responsible publication defence .Furthermore , it has been noted that the proposal for underpinning the new regulator by Royal Charter poses at least as much of a threat to the separation between government and the press as legislation .However , putting these points aside , there are a couple of further points we can make about the separation of powers arguments for press freedom .First , the prophylactic rule assumes that legislative power is the central threat to press independence .However , we might respond that there are other threats that the press may face , which come from private sources of power , such as pressure from advertisers or from a newspaper 's parent company .In some cases , legislative action could help protect the press from such private influence .For example , in his discussion of media plurality , Leveson suggests that those newspapers with a ' substantial market share ' might be required ' to ensure editorial independence both from the proprietor or owner ' .While such a measure might bolster the press independence , a prophylactic rule would appear to rule out such a measure if it is imposed by law .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "76.35271"}

'Whether it 's Cold War reds under the bed , or anarchists or anti - globalization activists , or a mindset that views every Muslim as a potential terrorist , the ' enemy ' may change but the song remains the same , only sung more loudly .Surveillance and repression against dissenters and those communities constructed as ' other ' have always propped up the prevailing state religion .It comes with the territory .The police mindset and operational culture equates challenges to prevailing orthodoxies as criminal activity .The militarization of protests and public spaces with a growing ' less - than - lethal ' armoury of chemical agents and stun guns is magnified in the post-9/11 world .It 's worth noting that millions of dollars in funding for the brutal security crackdowns at the November 2003 Miami FTAA summit and for the 2004 G8 summit in Georgia came from a US Congress Iraq appropriations bill .Under this ' revised ' law , charges can be brought by anyone , the accused can be held without trial for months , and anonymous witnesses and secret evidence can be introduced at trial .The minimum sentence for terrorism is 10 years .Mapuche activists have been charged with terrorism for allegedly burning areas of plantation forest , logging trucks and equipment .Arson - a crime against property , not life , liberty or physical integrity - is defined as a terrorist crime .Some are already serving jail terms .A recent high - profile case was thrown out but the state has already appealed .Indigenous targets New Zealand / Aotearoa has a history of break - ins , wiretaps and surveillance of indigenous activists .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "77.95488"}

{"text": "One could therefore assert that Zionism is imperialism in the age of capitalist counter - revolution .In other words , Zionism is the very form of contemporary Western imperialism .Therefore , unlike Russian and Chinese imperialism , Western imperialism or Zionism has both a religious and ethnic dimension .Zionism is a Messianic and racist ideology based on Talmudic Judaism .Zionism , through its control of Western finance capitalism , is striving for global governance .Lenin , writing in 1915 , described as ' indisputable ' the fact that ' development is proceeding towards monopolies , hence , towards a single world monopoly , towards a single world trust ' .But Lenin also pointed out that this drive towards unipolar global power would also intensify the contradictions in the global economy .A cogent example of this today is the low - intensity covert war currently being waged by the United States / Israel against Germany : The Western imperial alliance is turning on itself .However , no people 's resistance to Zionism can be mounted if the empire continues to outsmart its opponents .The aforementioned General Barnett understands his enemies well .He used to teach Marxism in Harvard university and has written a book comparing the African policies of the German Democratic Republic and the Socialist Republic of Romania .In his book Blueprint For Action , he points out that the father of Fourth Generation Warfare is Mao Tse Tung .Imperial grand strategy is now waging war using techniques developed during the Chinese revolution , one of the greatest anti - colonial struggles in history .The key for anti - imperialist resistance today is , therefore , to understand how to turn the tools of imperialism against imperialism .Marxism is a useful and indispensable tool but is insufficient for an full understanding of the complexities of the information age in the context of imperial strategy and tactics .Barnett and many other US and Israeli military strategists are keen students of social psychology , and in particular General Boyd 's OODA Loop Theory .The OODA stands for observation , orientation , decision , action .According to Boyd , decision - making occurs in a recurring cycle of observe - orient - decide - act .An entity ( whether an individual or an organization ) that can process this cycle quickly , observing and reacting to unfolding events more rapidly than an opponent , can thereby \" get inside \" the opponent 's decision cycle and gain the advantage .One could see this psychology at work during the Arab Spring .The rigid ideological orientation of the average ' leftist ' saw the uprisings in Tunisia as proof that people were rebelling against a US - backed dictator and his ' neo - liberal ' regime .US and Israeli strategists were capable of doing this through their deep understanding of ' leftist ' discourse .They also understood that the ' anti - globalisation ' form of the protest movement would fool genuine critics of US imperialism , thereby impeding their ability to react to the US - orchestrated revolutions in a rational manner .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "116.5187"}

{"text": "Moving the winter olympics to Siberia would be like playing in Russia 's backyard after they kicked you out of their fancy house .It makes one wonder if all these laws being passed are effective in Siberia , if not then going to Siberia instead would teach Russia a lesson .It was too embarassing .Yes , more embarrasing than yelling FIRST when you 're actually second .Sigh .I know its history , but that does n't negate the fact that politically , Siberia is under Russia 's jurisdiction .Also ?How naive are you to think that Siberians would n't care about non - traditional sexualities ?Rural citizens are more likely to be staunchly conservative .Many of the horrific Neo - Nazi hate crimes have been committed in those rural regions , and the politicians are even more corrupt than those in the Kremlin .Just to clarify , the Soviet Union boycotted the 1936 Berlin Olympics , but did participate in the alternative 1937 summer Spartakiad in Belgium ... it was them who organized the alternative olympics , not Spain .There are many reasons to opt out of this PR sham for Putin .My personal feelings are that if US athletes want to participate , go ahead and good luck .But I wo n't watch the games , will boycott NBC and all corporate sponsors involved in the Sochi Games and will complain to any store selling merchandise promoting the games .Moreover , I would hope people from the US would n't attend the games .It 's my hope that the US and EU bans the entry of any Russian politician or religious figure who 's involved in this witchhunt ( and I would hope other countries ban our bigots as the UK has previously done ) .Thank you for this helpful post .I hope that many athletes do wear pins or make statements .Putin wants to use the games to show Russian prestige , so they should think twice before arresting foreigners ( does n't guarantee they will , howver ) .But it would be really nice if the anti - gay laws spark serious international pressure on Russia 's many more serious human rights abuses against migrant workers , ordinary citizens who p1ss off local bosses , and anyone else who 's vulnerable .There have been a couple of cases of skinheads beheading Caucasians - torturing a gay teen is far from the worst of it .Russia had no problem breaking down a gay pride event in Moscow and arresting people when Russia hosted the European Song Contest .The last time during the Pussy Riot trial , when the wold was also watching .In short , Russia does n't seem to give a fuck about international spotlight .I think that arresting Olympians would lead to a different sort of international spotlight than those other instances .I do n't know anything about the European Song Contest , but arresting another country 's Olympic athlete would cause a lot bigger diplomatic backlash than arresting / beating people for protesting a trial about free speech .", "label": "", "metadata": {}, "score": "120.49931"}
